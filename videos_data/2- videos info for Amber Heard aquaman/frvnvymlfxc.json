            "description": "First Look At Amber Heard As Mera In New Justice League\nSubscribe Now! \u25ba http://bit.ly/SubClevverMovies\n\nDC fans, we\u2019ve got your first look at Justice League\u2019s Amber Heard as Mera, queen of Atlantis\nGet ready to meet the misses and now, check out Amber Heard in all her Atlantian glory on the set of Justice League\nWe are still just over a year away from the release of DC\u2019s Justice League movie, and now we\u2019re getting our first look at Amber Heard as the Atlantian queen. IGN exclusively released not only the final Justice League concept art for Mera\u2019s costume, but also an incredible look at Heard in full costume as Mera, taken by the one and only, Zack Snyder, himself. Snyder is directing the DC film, which is slated for November 17, 2017. \nWhile we can expect that Heard\u2019s role probably won\u2019t be too major in Justice League, we can hopefully expect a whole lot of Mera in DC\u2019s Aquaman movie, to be direted by James wan, and currently scheduled for release in 2018, but it will be nice to see the chemistry between Mera and Aquaman and the rest of the Justice League. \nAlong with Justice League, next year, DC will also release Wonder Woman, so we\u2019re in for an incredible slate of movies over the next few years. I can\u2019t wait to see what DC brings to the table, but I want to know if this first look at Mera has you even more pumped for Justice League and Aquaman, so leave your thoughts in the comments below. Then, click right here to get some brand new details from the upcoming Wolverine 3 movie.
