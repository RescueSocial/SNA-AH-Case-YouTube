YA HEARD? Ok if you haven\u2019t figured it out yet, the role has been given to Amber Heard. Amber Heard.\n\nThe actress made the confirmation herself during an interview with Entertainment Tonight-- while promoting her film The Adderall Diaries--\n\nAnd even gave a little tease of what her costume will be like.\n\nSo half-armor and half-scales huh--- we had an artist put together a rendition of what that will look like\u2026\n\nAnd oh Wow, that looks awful.\n\nThe character of Mera has the same strength and endurance as Aquaman, but instead of dealing with sea life, she deals with water itself and is able to bend it to her will..\n\nBut seriously, it\u2019s a hardcore power. If she wanted to, she could evaporate all the water out of a human body. Imagine that. You\u2019d be so thirsty.\n\nWhat do you think of the casting? Let us know in the comment section.\n\nThanks for watching and make sure to keep it on Screen Rant for more news.",
