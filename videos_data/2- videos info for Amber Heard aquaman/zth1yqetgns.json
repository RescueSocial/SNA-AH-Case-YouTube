            "description": "What is the name of the redhead actress that played the lead female role in Aquaman in 2018? Her name is Amber Heard and she's one of the reason I loved the movie so much. Normally Amber Heard hair color is not redhead as in the movie, as you can see in this video, she is blonde or light brown, but she is a very beautiful girl no matter the hair color. I think she nailed it in Aquaman and her popularity will sky rocket from here. She will no longer be just the redhead girl from Aquaman.\n\nA montage of pictures starring Amber Heard, the lead female role in Auqaman movie. This is if you ask yourself who is the girl from Aquaman with beautiful red hair.\n\n#AmberHeard #Aquaman #AquamanGirl",
