            "description": "Amber Heard OFFICIALLY Replaced By Margot Robbie In Aquaman 2!???\nWhen it comes to DC Comics and Marvel Comics movies, one of the key things that they like to try and do is go and select people who they think can not just do a role justice, but in many cases, do those roles for multiple films. This goes especially for major hero characters. Because if they do well, the fans will have a \u201cconnection\u201d with them and thus won\u2019t want them to be replaced should something happen. However, in the upcoming Aquaman 2 movie, that might not be something they can afford to do given what\u2019s going on with Amber Heard. Allow us to break it down for you.
