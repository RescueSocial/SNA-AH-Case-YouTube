            "description": "The first day of filming of the new DC Extended Universe movie franchise Aquaman and The Lost Kingdom was expected to be huge news to its fans, but rather it turned out to be a big flop. Why? Well, everyone watched its first movie, and it was indeed a blockbuster hit. However, after the chaotic downfall between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard\u2019s marriage intensified, many former fans of the DCEU film have turned their backs on Amber Heard. And following the countless petitions of supporters for Warner Brothers to relieve Amber from her role as Queen Mera, which had not been granted, many supporters have turned their backs on the whole movie franchise as well. So how did the fans react when finally, the first day of filming of Aquaman 2 had been announced? Well, let\u2019s find out in this video. But before everything else, make sure to hit that subscribe button and smash that notification bell for more updates. Now, let\u2019s begin!\n\nFirst, let\u2019s have a short recap on the whole Johnny and Amber failed marriage charade. Well, it\u2019s a lot more than a failed marriage. When Johnny and Amber first met at the 2011 comedy-drama film The Rum Diary, everything was glitter and sunshine. Their on-cam romance was eventually developed into a real-life relationship, and everyone was happy. But that happiness didn\u2019t last long. After a year of marriage, their relationship quickly fell apart, and the two actors decided to split. End of story. Kidding! It was definitely far from over. While Amber filed for divorce, she also told everybody including the media about some of Johnny\u2019s quote-unquote \u201cbad habits\u201d. Unfortunately for him, due to our very own rights to a lot of things, Johnny Depp lost this case. But, this suit was actually just the tip of the iceberg. In 2018, his former wife Amber Heard wrote an op-ed in The Washington post,  explaining thoroughly that she was a victim of Johnny Depp\u2019s poor treatment, and in which she spoke about the treatment of women in the same domestic cases. Despite not mentioning Johnny\u2019s name in her statement, Johnny\u2019s team felt that it was about him, having recently filed a complaint against him and, well, technically they just got out of their failed relationship, so whom else would she be talking about? Apart from this, she also used her so-called experiences with Johnny to be the face of the women empowerment movement, which put off many supporters. Since Johnny never really admitted that he did do anything to Amber, nor did he accept her words, in March of 2019,  the 57-year-old actor finally took action and filed a suit of $50 million against his 35-year-old ex-wife over the said article. Johnny\u2019s team was convinced that Amber was using this situation to draw more attention to her name in a positive light. This situation may have looked like it didn\u2019t affect Johnny\u2019s career that much, but it did. After losing his case against The Sun, he lost his role as Grindelwald in the third installment of blockbuster trilogy Fantastic Beasts. Moreover, after Amber\u2019s op-ed article, Johnny Depp also lost one of his famous roles, Jack Sparrow in Disney\u2019s Pirates of the Carribean film series, as the movie series\u2019 production people itself announced that they won\u2019t be having the original Jack Sparrow back.  Amber Heard is about to star in the newest DCEU film Aquaman and The Lost Kingdom, which is the second installment in this series. It is set to be released in 2022, the same year the third installment of Fantastic Beasts will be released. \n\nYou may remember that a huge number of supporters filed for a petition to be signed with the aim to request Warner Brothers to relieve Amber from her role as Queen Mera, the same way they made Johnny leave Fantastic Beasts. However, even after garnering more than 1.6 million signatures, Warner Brothers still pushed through, having Amber Heard reprise her role. Many commented on this post in a positive way, but over the internet, the first day of filming was overshadowed by the number of fans demanding that Amber Heard be let go from the flick. \n\nAquaman 2, now titled Aquaman and The Lost Kingdom, will continue the story of Jason Momoa's Arthur Curry/Aquaman role, but this time as the crowned King of Atlantis. The Aquaman And The Lost Kingdom cast members who have been confirmed to appear in the film include Patrick Wilson, who will be seen reprising his role as King Orm aka Oceanmaster, Amber Heard as Mera, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II as David Kane/Black Manta and Dolph Lundgren as King Nereus. \n\nThat\u2019s all for today, we hope you enjoyed that video and make sure to like, subscribe, and hit that notification bell for more videos like this.\n\nRelated videos:\nAquaman 2 FLOPS on its FIRST DAY of FILMING, PROVING Heard is DONE!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJU7rcIBuAU\n\nAquaman 2 Director PANICS!
