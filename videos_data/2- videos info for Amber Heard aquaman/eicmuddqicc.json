During the wide-ranging conversation, she talked about how Aquaman has something for everyone, how the film is bright and fun a lot different from the previous DC films, how they shot the under the water sequences, getting to make an origin story, and more.\n\nAs most of you know, Aquaman charts the origin story of the titular character (Jason Momoa), a man born from a human lighthouse keeper (Temuera Morrison) and a queen of Atlantis (Nicole Kidman) who straddles both worlds. In the film, Momoa\u2019s Arthur Curry must save the surface world when his half-brother Orm (Patrick Wilson) seeks to wage war on the humans and assert Atlantean dominance once and for all. Arthur is aided in his quest by Mera (Amber Heard), a warrior and daughter of King Nereus (Dolph Lundgren) who was raised by Queen Atlanna and groomed to become Queen herself.\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO THE COLLIDER NETWORK\nCollider Videos: https://bit.ly/2n1MZb7\nCollider Games: https://bit.ly/2vszg0Z\nCollider Quick: https://bit.ly/2OyLjSU \nCollider Sports: https://bit.ly/2Au5rmv\nCollider Podcast Network: https://bit.ly/1qU5ENT\nPro Wrestling Sheet: https://bit.ly/2LKhWzy\n\nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/ColliderVideo\nFollow us on Instagram: https://instagram.com/ColliderVideo\nFollow us on Facebook: https://facebook.com/colliderdotcom\n \nAs the online source for movies, television, breaking news, incisive content, and imminent trends, Collider is more than an essential destination.
