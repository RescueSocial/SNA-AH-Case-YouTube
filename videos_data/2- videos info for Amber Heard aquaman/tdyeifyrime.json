            "description": "Johnny Depp and Amber Heard\u2019s case started years ago, when the latter filed for divorce and accused Johnny of hurting her. However, their feud that rooted from their messy marriage did not end there, and now, the case is swirling once again as their latest court trial is about to come in July this year. As the trials are coming near, the issue that has somehow been buried deep in the internet has recently surfaced once again, and guess who\u2019s been the subject of ridicule these past few weeks? You guessed that right, Amber Heard. Amber seemed to have been losing more and more of her supporters due to more and more evidence surfacing in the media, including the fact that she couldn\u2019t provide proof that she donated the money she got from her divorce settlement, which she promised to donate to charity. But where is it now?  Then there was evidence of her having affairs with actor, James Franco and multi-billionaire, Elon Musk. But what angered most people was the fact that Johnny Depp was forced to step down from his role as Grindelwald in the upcoming third franchise of the film trilogy \u201cFantastic Beasts\u201d. Now, the trilogy is quite a big deal in the entertainment industry, considering that it is the prequel series to one of the most prominent film series of all time, \u201cHarry Potter\u201d. And aside from this, Johnny is actually an incredibly big name in the industry as well, and not just because of his very famous role as Jack Sparrow, but also because he has starred in countless movies too. But now that Johnny had been removed from his role, people\u2019s fury shot directly at Amber Heard, as she was going back to reprise her role in the second installment of the DC Extended Universe film Aquaman, despite the lawsuits she is currently facing. Many, many fans were enraged by this, and some even started a petition to request Warner Bros. to fire Amber Heard, the same way they did to Johnny. But after a very long deliberation, did these people who fought for Johnny Depp\u2019s equal treatment in the industry actually succeed? Had Warner Bros. finally come to their senses and fired Amber Heard from their newest DC film? Well, let\u2019s find out in this video. But before everything else, make sure to hit that subscribe button first and smash that notification bell for more updates. So, let\u2019s begin!\n\nLet\u2019s backtrack a little bit into Johnny and Amber\u2019s career. Johnny Depp has been at the height of his career in the industry for many, many years now, and despite everything he is going through, he is nowhere close to a stop. He started acting as early as the 1980\u2019s, when he first appeared in the horror-slash-thriller film \u201cA Nightmare on Elm Street '', and played a minor role as the boyfriend of the main character. This helped Johnny begin his acting career, landing more minor roles and then major ones, including in the 2010 romantic thriller film \u201cThe Tourist\u201d in which he co-starred with respected actress Angelina Jolie.\n\nAfter many more roles, Johnny landed one of his biggest commercial films, the critically acclaimed Disney media franchise, the \u201cPirates of the Carribean\u201d series, which is one of the major projects that really skyrocketed Johnny\u2019s career into its highest point. In this series, he worked with numerous legendary actors and actresses, and worked on the lead role of Jack Sparrow, which earned him a remarkably huge fan following, as he reprised his role in all five movies that ran from 2003 to 2017. Some people even call him Jack Sparrow more often than his real name. Needless to say, he was and still is, a legend in the film industry. But we can\u2019t say that now in his 2011 comedy drama film \u201cThe Rum Diary\u201d which we can now safely say was not the brightest decision he made, as this was the film where he met his ex-wife, Amber Heard.\n\nOn the other hand, Amber Heard started her acting career in 2003, first by appearing in two music videos, and then later in landing small supporting roles in three various television series. This then later on elevated her to more film and television roles as both a supporting and lead actress. Her latest film that hit commercial success was the 2018 DCEU movie \u201cAquaman\u201d, where she co-starred alongside Jason Momoa as Mera, the Atlantean Queen. \n\nAbove all these, Amber Heard manages to keep her name in the headlines as many more issues come up. She even angered a judge in Virginia once, warning her not to waste the court\u2019s time. \n\nThat\u2019s all for today, we hope you enjoyed that video and if you did, don\u2019t forget to subscribe and hit that notification bell for more videos like this.
