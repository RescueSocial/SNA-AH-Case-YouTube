            "description": "Documentary - As Amber Heard of Aquaman and Melissa Benoist of Supergirl speak out against domestic abuse, we should change culture both in society and online. Amber's life continues to be threatened despite her evidence. #AmberHeard is Innocent in domestic violence from Johnny Depp, part 3.\n\nWe Support Amber Heard in Aquaman 2, Her Life, and Her Leadership! Sign and see other updates, including evidence: https://www.change.org/p/we-support-amber-heard-in-aquaman-2-her-life-and-her-leadership\n\nAmber only wanted to move on with her life, such as to be Mera of Aquaman and to do humanitarian work for the United Nations, ACLU, refugees, World Identity Network SDG 16, Amnesty International, and causes for Human Rights.\n\nAmber Heard experienced choking, kicking, headbutting, over a dozen physically violent fights, bruising, pushing, abuse, loss of confidence, death threats, coercive control, and loss of physical health from Depp. She feared for her life. We show her side...\n\nIt's been nearly 7 years since the first violent experience, yet the abuse continues...\n\nCrowdfunding and modern 21st century online manipulation is used against her, as if she's a political adversary of her ex-husband and his alliances. \n\nWitnesses such as her sister Whitney saw the physical violence, and witnesses such as Melanie Inglessis who saw injuries are intimidated to not give testimonies or are coerced, such as Laura Divenere who worked for Elon Musk. Musk had offered 24/7 security to Amber.\nHarassment is done by Depp's agents, paid tabloids, and online simulations.\n\nForces work against her, such as Adam Waldman who worked for Russian Oligarch Deripaska, to use social media against her while threatening reporters such as a New York Times one on 'national security', supporters, businesses like Warner Bros and L'Oreal, and witnesses.\n\nAdam Waldman's Twitter account only follows the Dali Llama, and originally had no photo, then added a photo closer to the July 2020 UK NGN trial. \n\nSwayed by false commentary and online tip jars, even reporter Nick Wallis removed evidence on Amber's side, such as the recording included (13:33) of Divenere telling Amber she was intimidated by Waldman with being deposed, $20,000 in lawyer fees, and leading questions to coerce her. \n\nMessages are included from an anonymous source stating she was a partner of ex-staff in March 29 and April 2019, stating that Waldman and Depp's team wanted her done. \n\nStaff knew Amber was injured repeatedly and were on NDAs. \n\nMelissa Benoist's story and Amber Heard's draw parallels, with injuries from phones, choking, isolation, and hiding abuse.\n\nMelissa states a friend was the first to ask her about abuse and supported her. \"I Stand With Melissa\" went well since November 2019. \nBoth are part of the DC universe and star as superheroes.. \n\nBut Melissa's ex is not a millionaire starring in over 200 movies. Nor does she need to worry about Depp's circle, criminals including 3-time felony 'minion' Ryan Leone who will do anything for Depp's attention or to incite his followers, or high profile individuals. Online simulations don't target Melissa with hate. Melissa's support comes after Amber's suffering.\n\nScenes from Monica Lewinsky's TEDx talk \"The Price of Shame, \" Hate Lab (http://hatelab.net), Anti-Defamation League's Backspace Hate campaign, Prime Minister Julia Gillard's reference to 'ditch the witch' billboards, Bruce Hickey's scene about true journalism from The Buzz pilot, and screenshots of Waldman with Deripaska at a party in Austria provide background with context of our times.\n\n\"Would you save her?\" is a video showing that only one man stopped to help in their social experiment demonstrating kidnapping a woman in Los Angeles. \n\nThe next time you see something, you should do something! \nYou could save a life!\n\nIt's long been known that Amber would win her legal cases...\n\nMelissa Benoist encourages people to help friends enduring domestic abuse, and Amber Heard encourages people to work on human rights. It does change lives.\n\n\nSome Videos included:\n- Amber Heard's Friend (IO Tillet who saw her injuries and heard her scream) Who Called 911 Speaks Out: https://youtu.be/Ur0wcLV10V8\n- Amber Heard Anonymous 911 Call: https://youtu.be/Cgkn4waCUtk\n- Recording of Laura Divenere being coerced by Adam Waldman: https://youtu.be/CunBOnfsDBE\n- Recording of Depp saying he headbutt Amber as she screamed: https://youtu.be/zMAYCFPu-XQ\n- World Identity Network: https://youtu.be/70XVyFd6TlY\n- Amber Heard 'Why Be a Human Rights Activist?' | Hague Talks: https://youtu.be/6765YsE_aIA\n\nMore Links:\n- Transcript of Coercion of Laura Divenere: https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/6811708/Laura.pdf\n- Adam Waldman met with Oleg Deripaska: https://www.proekt.media/en/article-en/adam-waldman-eng/\n- \u2018Supergirl\u2019 Star Melissa Benoist: https://www.thegeekbuzz.com/news/supergirl-star-melissa-benoist-survivor-domestic-violence/\n\n#DomesticViolence #MelissaBenoist #Supergirl #ElonMusk #UnitedNations",
