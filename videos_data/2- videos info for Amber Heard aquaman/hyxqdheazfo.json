            "title": "Emilia Clarke REPLACING Amber Heard In Aquaman 2?!",
            "description": "Although it is pretty obvious that Amber Heard should be fired from the Aquaman 2 sequel, the DC Extended Universe\u2019s film production company that was supposed to make this decision, seems to have missed the obvious. Now, they are getting huge media backlash, thanks to the negative comments against one of their lead actresses, Amber Heard. Before the whole Aquaman 2 filming even began, we all knew, and if you didn\u2019t then you should listen to this next fact, that millions of fans were against Amber\u2019s role reprisal in the upcoming Aquaman second installment that stars Jason Momoa and other huge stars such as Nicole Kidman, Patrick Wilson, Willem Defoe, and Randall Park. Such a big cast ensemble, and that alone proves that Warner Bros. can pay huge stars for their roles. Now, what\u2019s up with recasting Amber Heard? You may remember that a huge number of supporters filed for a petition to be signed with the aim to request Warner Brothers to fire Amber from her role as Queen Mera, the same way they forced Johnny to leave Fantastic Beasts. However, even after garnering more than 1.6 million signatures, Warner Brothers still pushed through, having Amber reprise her role. A lot of fans were upset by this, and we mean UPSET. Everywhere you look on social media, there were mean comments about Amber, and sadly, about the upcoming Aquaman film itself. There\u2019s no doubt that the first Aquaman directed by James Wan was a huge hit, and it deserved every inch of success because it\u2019s aesthetically and cinematically beautiful in many, many aspects. Yet, during the promotion period, it had been noticeable that people were planning to not watch the movie and even campaign for others to boycott it too, in honor of their support for Johnny Depp, who has been let go from his role as Grindelwald in the Fantastic Beasts film series. Both movies are set to premiere in 2022, and both movies are going to be under Warner Brothers.\n\nBut what is keeping Warner Bros. head over heels for this actress who is currently dealing with a huge lawsuit in front of her, and a number of pieces of evidence against her proving that she is not all that she claims to be? With everything that\u2019s going on in Johnny and Amber\u2019s post-divorce chaos, it is indeed safe to say that Amber\u2019s name is in the hot seat, and not in a positive way. Well, it turns out they are obviously risking it. Several people are slowing turning to Johnny\u2019s side. So, in the middle of this all, fans can\u2019t help but make their own bets on who would be the suitable replacement for her cast as Queen Mera. There are tons of different actresses that would fit the role, but it seems like in the last few months while this situation against casting Amber is happening, fans\u2019 eyes are falling on Emilia Clarke.\n\nBut why do we think Emilia would be the perfect person to play Queen Mera? Well, there\u2019s a number of reasons, from rekindling her romance with Game of Thrones co-star Jason Momoa. Stay tuned because we are about to enumerate all the reasons for you. But first, make sure to hit that subscribe button and smash that notification bell for more updates. So, here are some of the biggest reasons why Emilia Clarke is the best female celeb to replace Amber Heard in Aquaman 2.\n\n1. She is one of the biggest and most celebrated female stars today\nWidely known as Daenerys Targaryen, \n\n2. Fans would love to see Jason Momoa and Emilia Clarke back as an on screen pair\nIt is never easy to replace a cast member, especially a well-loved cast member, in a film\u2019s second installment. However, if Warner Bros. did this decision as easily with Johnny Depp, considering how it might agitate his fans, then it must also be an easy feat for the production company to replace Amber Heard as well especially in the midst of her. While it is never easy with the fans (but in this case of course it is) when an actor is replaced in a franchise, it may go down better with viewers when they see Jason and Emilia reunite as an on-screen pair. The biggest reason why Emilia Clarke is a good replacement for Amber Heard in \u2018Aquaman 2\u2019 is that she is a fan-favorite since her past role with Jason Momoa.\n\n3. Emilia\u2019s siren-like physique can surely rock the Queen Mera suit\nAmidst this chaos between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard, fans are already eyeing Emilia Clarke as the latter\u2019s replacement in Aquaman 2.\n\nBut given that all these will remain merely fantasies for fans, we\u2019ll just wait for 2022 and see how Aquaman 2 goes. That\u2019s all for today, we hope you enjoyed that video, and if you did, make sure you like, subscribe, and hit that notification bell for more videos like this.\n\nRelated videos:\nEmilia Clarke WRECKS MARVEL and WARNER with ARMPIT HAIR and LECTURES?!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfMMQ7Ar_RE\n\nAmber Heard Reacts to The Court STOPPED Listening to Her\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTMkPIsSn50\n\n#emiliaclarke #amberheard #jasonmomoa #aquaman2 #aquaman #johnnydepp #amberheardlawsuit #johnnydepplawsuit",
