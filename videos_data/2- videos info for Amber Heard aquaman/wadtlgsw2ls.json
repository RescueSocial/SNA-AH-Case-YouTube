Before we get to the details of this video let\u2019s take a minute to take you back a few years down memory lane, when the chemistry between Drogo and Khaleesi was the only thing everyone was talking about. Remember that from Game of Thrones and how we all were dying to see more of THOSE two? Well, there is a high chance of that happening again. Just in another movie.\n\nAquaman was the knight in shining armor to DC after Justice League caused immense disappointment amongst the fans. In fact, it is the first movie from DC to hit a billion dollars in its first weekend itself at the Box Office. This had not happened in a long time, the last such success being The Dark Knight Rises. \n\nThere is a high chance that Aquaman\u2019s Mera, who previously cast Amber Heard in its first movie, may no longer play Mera in the second part. You may have a tingle in your 6th sense, assuming it having to do with her messy divorce case. \n\nHow did her divorce case turn into a scandal?\n Most end peacefully but some end up in quite a mess. The same happened in the case of Johnny Depp and Amber Heard. They officially were to divorce in 2016, but due to Amber getting the divorce involved in a libel case, the divorce procedures carried on. Yes, it is true she accused him of being a threat to her and accusing him of engaging in domestic violence while they were married. \n\nAmber, who ruined Depp\u2019s career by throwing false allegations and ruin his name publicly, got played by Karma and is sitting in the same wretched seat her ex-husband has been sitting in, dreadfully, for the past few years.\n  \nTo come back to the present, the truth about Amber and her abusive nature is all out. Fans are mad at both Warner Bros and Disney turning down Depp when instead it should\u2019ve been Amber who was turned down. While Heard lavishly has been getting roles and parading herself everywhere around Hollywood, Depp was the one facing the consequences with a damaged career and broken spirits! \n\nThe fans signed a petition to kick her off the cast list. And guess what? The petition has almost a whopping 2 million signatures defending Depp!\nThe petition has been taken so seriously, the entire film industry was speaking about it. Due to this fact, this news reached the ears of the Warner Bros. Hopefully, they will take further action, serving justice rightly.\n\nWho is the secret replacement in case Amber is to leave? And will she live up to the expectations of the role of Mera?\n\nSo yes, rumor has it that this bad behavior of Amber will cost her the role of Mera, which she totally deserves. The verdict on whether Amber will be cast or not has not yet been given by the Warner Bros, but we hope they do what\u2019s best for them as well as for what\u2019s right.\n\n\nSpeculations have been going around that Emilia Clarke, an ex- co-actor of Jason Momoa, who plays the role of Aquaman, is someone everyone has their eyes on. Especially the fans. The fans seem very pleased with her replacement and have been pushing this idea on social media.\n\nEmilia Clarke is not only a great actress but one who has a great personality in real life too. Apart from that, the bond shared between Momoa and Clarke, both off and on-screen is marvelous. \n\nWhat do Warner Bros have to say about this?\n\nLetting her stay could do some major damage especially when we are in a time where everyone is fighting for their rights as well as for the rights of others. In this case, fans were outraged when this discrimination took place. Discrimination against whom you may ask. But it\u2019s pretty evident by now that we are talking about Depp.\n\nDepp was not allowed to be a part of the next sequel of the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise due to this scandal which blew up. In fact, he was asked to step down from his role in Fantastic Beasts as well. Amber truly ruined his career. It is only fair that justice is served cold to her too.\nClevver news amber heard aquaman 2 celebrity news \n\n#AmberHeard #AmberHeardFired #Aquaman2 #JusticeForDepp\n#EmiliaClarke",
