But why is she the subject of such a toxic response? Johnny and Amber\nhave both accused each other of abuse. First, people thought that Johnny was the \u2018bad guy\u2019\nbut now, fans think that Amber is the one who is doing it for attention, enjoying the drama,\nmanipulating the truth, exaggerating reality.\nMoreover, people were absolutely furious after Amber Heard\u2019s former assistant Kate James\nexposed Amber Heard for stealing her sexual assault story.\nFor so many women struggling from abuse, it was difficult to hear but, that's true that Amber\nreally lied about the fact that Johnny abused her. And the whole world was shocked after\nKate James, Amber Heard\u2019s former personal assistant, alleged that Heard had appropriated\nher story of being a \u201csexual violence survivor,\u201d giving evidence at London\u2019s Royal Courts of\nJustice on the seventh day of Johnny Depp\u2019s libel trial against the publisher of The Sun\nnewspaper.\nHowever, the fact that Kate exposed Amber is really good for Johnny, as now he is suing\nNews Group Newspapers and journalist Dan Wootton for an article on The Sun website that\ndescribed him as a \u201cwife beater.\u201d Depp denies that he was violent toward Heard, to whom he\nwas married from 2015 to 2017.\nKate gave evidence in support of Depp, and said she had told Heard that she was raped at\nmachete-point in Brazil about 25 years ago. She said she was shocked to learn that in a\nwitness statement, Heard misrepresented and exploited the incident.\n\u201cShe referred directly to a violent rape that occurred to me 26 years ago and she twisted it\ninto her own story and she used it for her own use,\" Kate James said by video link from Los\nAngeles. \u201cI am a sexual violence survivor and that\u2019s very, very serious to take that stance if\nyou are not one,\" she added.\nWhen Kate she read Amber Heard\u2019s submissions, she said, \u201cto my utter shock and dismay, I\ndiscovered that Ms Heard had in fact stolen my sexual violence conversation with her and\ntwisted it into her own story to benefit herself. This of course caused me extreme distress\nand outrage that she would dare to attempt to use the most harrowing experience of my life\nas her own narrative.\u201d\nReferring to Amber Heard\u2019s drinking habits, James said in a witness statement: \u201cAmber\nwould drink vast quantities of red wine each night.\u201d Plus, in evidence given remotely from\nLos Angeles, Kate James also said she had regularly received a barrage of drunken,\nabusive and incoherent text messages from Heard between 2am and 4am.\nIn her declaration, James outlines how she spent large amounts of time with Heard during\nher employment - sometimes up to seven days a week, often in intimate settings. That is\nsignificant, she says, because many of Heard's allegations of physical abuse date to that\ntime period - and she never saw any evidence of it. Instead, she claims to have seen ample\nevidence of Heard's own abusive behavior, which was often directed at her.\n\n\u201cAmber was regularly verbally and mentally abusive and would often scream at me... over\nthe smallest things,\u201d she wrote. \u201cShe would fly into blind rages where no-one could reason\nwith her, and even if I was trying to offer an explanation, I didn\u2019t think that she could hear me\nas she was so angry.\u201d\nKate James claims the actress would often binge on wine and drugs - specifically magic\nmushrooms and MDMA - and text her abuse throughout the night.\n\u201cWhen I woke up in the morning, there would almost always be a barrage of incoherent\nabuse sent to me from Amber by text between around 2am and 4am. I discovered later that\nshe had gone ahead and deleted all evidence of abusive texts from that ICloud account,\u201d\nshe claimed. The abuse was so severe, that James said it left her emaciated from stress and\ncaused concern among her friends and family.\n...\n\nAnd now I want to know what you think about Amber Heard. Do you think she really enjoys\nthe drama and does it for clout?
