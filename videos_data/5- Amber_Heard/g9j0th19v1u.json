We\u2019ll take a look back at the true story of this star and see how she went from her childhood home in Texas to her career history in New York City. Long before her ex-husband promised her \u201cglobal humiliation,\u201d they were falling in love on the set of \u201cThe Rum Diaries,\u201d but right from the beginning there were accusations of infidelity, some of which involved Elon Musk! Amber was once a contestant in beauty pageants, but dropped out of high school to pursue her career. But this isn\u2019t the first time she\u2019s had bad press with a partner; most fans have forgotten about an altercation between her and her then-girlfriend, Tasya van Ree. This also isn\u2019t her first lawsuit, as things got unpleasant on the set of the film \u201cLondon Fields.\u201d It seems like everyone is turning against her, while her ex has support from his family and his other exes including Winona Ryder. \n\nWhat do you think about this situation?
