            "description": "For over four years now, ex couple Johnny Depp and Amber Heard are still caught in between the turmoil that their previous marriage has brought. For a marriage that ended just after a year, it is indeed quite a long and agonizing journey that the former couple took after that. Johnny and Amber have gone from obsessing over each other to hating one another in the blink of an eye, and now, their divorce has gone into a messy turn. When Johnny Depp and Amber Heard were first married, everyone thought they were very much in love, and maybe that was a fact for a short time, until the two decided to end their marriage in 2016. However, this divorce isn\u2019t the end of the story, it is actually just the start of a tragic drama that is about to unfold. Along with the divorce, Amber filed for a restraining order against Johnny the same year, for reasons that the latter had allegedly hurt her during their marriage. This, however, was denied by Johnny countless times and the evidence supplied for this issue had also been proven to be fabricated. Not cool, Amber. But this still wasn\u2019t the end of their fight.\n\nAmber claimed that Johnny had been terrible with her at various points in their relationship. Because of these allegations, news publisher The Sun called Johnny a very bad name, and a term that obviously offended Johnny because he stays true to his statement that he never hurts anyone. Johnny filed a libel case against the news company but unfortunately, he lost on this one. But aside from this, another incident also ignited the feud between the former couple, when Amber Heard wrote an op-ed article in The Washington Post, where she claimed to be a victim of domestic maltreatment. The article was entitled \u201cI spoke up \u2013 and faced our culture's wrath. That has to change.\u201d  In the op-ed, she explained that she was maltreated, and she spoke about the treatment of women in the same domestic cases. Apart from this, she also became the face of the women empowerment movement, which many fans thought was the wrong place for Amber to publicly raise her case. For starters, she never really had a legitimate proof that she was hurt by Johnny Depp, and he even had evidence against her that she was stating her facts the other way. These sets of evidence include the phone call that Johnny made with Amber, where she admitted hitting JOhnny. And the list goes on, including the alleged affairs of Amber with actor James Franco and multi-billionaire Elon Musk, and the missing donations to charity that Amber claimed she would make after her $7 million dollar divorce settlement with Johnny. Despite not involving Johnny\u2019s name on her statement, Johnny\u2019s team felt that it was pertaining to him, having recently filed a complaint against him and, well, technically they just got out of their failed relationship.  So, triggered by this, Johnny filed for a $50 million dollar defamation lawsuit against Amber Heard. This lawsuit is still ongoing to this day, and the latest trial will be held in court by July of 2021. However, Amber had recently tried to dismiss this case for the second time, bringing up the lost libel case with The Sun as her back up defense. But, aside from millions of fans who support Johnny on this feat, countless friends, family, former lovers, colleagues, and other celebrities have stood up to defend Johnny against his ex wife. Who are they? And what lies did Amber say that they claimed to be false? Let\u2019s find out in this video, but first, make sure to hit that subscribe button and smash that notification bell for more updates. Let\u2019s dive in!\n\n1. Winona Ryder\nWinona Ryder is one of Johnny Depp\u2019s former flames, and one that really ignited fans\u2019 interest at that time. Winona and Johnny met in Tim Burton\u2019s classic, Edward Scissorhaands, and dated for four years. \n\n2. Vanessa Paradis\nAnother celebrity and another one of Johnny\u2019s ex flames, Vanessa Paradis also spoke up about the allegations. Johnny Depp has been involved with many actresses throughout his career, he is indeed a very handsome and career-driven man, but if there\u2019s one woman who caught and kept his attention for a very long time, it\u2019s Vanessa. \n\n3. Penelope Cruz\nPerhaps in terms of a case of physical maltreatment against a woman, it is important to look at who defends who. In Johnny\u2019s case, there are more women supporting and believing he is innocent than the women who take Amber\u2019s side.\n\nThat\u2019s all for today, we hope you enjoyed that video, and if you did, don\u2019t forget to hit that like and subscribe button and smash that notification bell for more videos like this.
