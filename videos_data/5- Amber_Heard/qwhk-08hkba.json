            "title": "Amber Heard Is FINISHED! Why She's Losing ALL Her Supporters! Amber Heard Johnny Depp Lawsuit UPDATE",
            "description": "As Johnny Depp and Amber Heard get deeper into their $50 million dollar lawsuit, lots and lots of fans, people, and even previous Amber Heard supporters are strolling away from her side and are choosing to side with Johnny Depp instead. You may remember that after losing his libel case against the news publisher \u201cThe Sun\u201d, who gave him a very bad lable following Amber\u2019s claims that he had hurt her, Johnny lost his chance to reprise his major role as Grindelwald in the upcoming third installment of the trilogy \u201cFantastic Beasts\u201d, a prequel series to Harry Potter. Because of this, a huge volume of Johnny Depp fans around the globe were upset and angered, which led them to sign a petition for Warner Bros. to fire Amber from her role in the upcoming Aquaman sequel as well. However, despite reaching and even going over 1.6 million votes, the production company chose to let Amber stay in the movie. So how does Amber lose such a tremendous amount of supporters during the time that she needed them the most? What could Amber possibly have done to make her supporters lose interest in her? Well, let\u2019s find out in this video. But before anything else, make sure to hit that subscribe button first and smash that notification bell for more updates. Let\u2019s dive in!\n\nJohnny and Amber\u2019s romance started well, if one may say, before it all went down into ashes. There are those kinds of divorces that are amicable splits, while there are also divorce cases that are messy. Johnny and Amber\u2019s divorce may be one of the messiest and chaotic in history. But how did it all come down to this? Let\u2019s go back to the beginning. Johnny and Amber first ignited a spark between them when they starred together in the 2011 comedy-drama film, The Rum Diary. Johnny played a journalist who was immediately smitten with Amber\u2019s character. However, this love story between the two quickly travelled from the screen to real life. Amber Heard even told Vogue quickly after the release of the film that, \u201cWorking with Johnny was torture. It was better than I ever imagined, which is really saying something.\u201d Technically, hearing these words from the actress already hinted that the two really hit it off easily during their film taping, and even though the two of them did not quickly jump into a relationship right after the film shooting, the same year that the film was released, the relationships they both were in at the time fell apart, and that suggested quite a rare coincidence. Just a year after the film\u2019s release, the two officially started dating. Their relationship seemed quite beautiful, and as a proof of this, in 2014, just a couple of months into dating, Amber was spotted wearing an engagement ring, where Johnny also made an announcement about their upcoming wedding. Another year after, the couple held a private wedding ceremony at their home in LA. Fans were really happy about how things were going between the two.\n\nIn 2016, Amber Heard filed for divorce. It shocked many people, especially their fans who thought they were living the best days of their married life, but turned out it wasn\u2019t the case at all. Along with filing for divorce, Amber also accused Johnny of physically hurting her, providing some photos as evidence of Johnny\u2019s acts. However, these incidents were proven to be fabricated by the police. She also applied for a restraining order against Johnny, which made many people at that time believe that she was telling the truth. Many fans supported her, and it was then as well that she used her newfound acclaim and victimhood to front as one of the most public faces of the #MeToo movement, and subsequently, to serve as ambassador and speaker for various entities, organizations, and companies, many of whom rewarded Amber financially for her time, image, and story. BUT, Johnny Depp\u2019s team and a lot of fans as well, saw this as Amber\u2019s way to manipulate people into thinking she is a victim rather than a perpetrator. In line with this, Amber also penned an article in the Washington Post.\n\nApart from this, fans and supporters of Amber also started to lose the courage to defend and support her as evidence of her extra marital affairs surfaced, showing her with actor James Franco and multi-billionaire Elon Musk. Elon had been issued a subpoena by Johnny Depp\u2019s team.\n\nAs of now, despite all the chaos swirling around the their case, Amber\u2019s team has tried to dismiss it twice already. \n\nThat\u2019s all for today, if you enjoyed that, make sure to hit that notification bell and subscribe button for more videos like this.
