So far, the\ntrial has featured testimony about: violent, shrieking rows. Massive\nconsumption of drugs and drink. Wild punches and trashed rooms, lopped off\nfingertip, and many other things. But is it true that Johnny Depp is so close to\ndefeating Amber Heard in a defamation case?\nMake sure you stay till the end to know Johnny Depp's odds of winning the\ncase.\nThe fact that Johnny Depp recently failed to secure an appeal in the \u201cwife\nbeater\u201d verdict against him in Britain is causing consequences on his other legal\nbattles in the US. Amber Heard's lawyers state that Johnny Depp's Stateside $50\nmillion defamation lawsuit against Amber Heard should be dismissed.\nAmber Heard's legal team (Heard and Charlson Bredehoft Cohen & Brown, PC\nand Woods Rogers PC attorneys) declares a supplemental plea in bar, stating:\n\u201cGiving full effect to the UK Judgments necessitates a finding that statements in\nthe op-ed published in the Washington Post are true \u2013 Mr. Depp committed\ndomestic violence against Ms. Heard on many occasions, causing her to fear for\nher life.\u201d \u201cTherefore, as a matter of law, Depp cannot prevail on any of his\nclaims, and Depp\u2019s Complaint against Ms. Heard should be dismissed in its\nentirety,\u201d adds the April 13 filing that recently appeared on the Fairfax County\ndocket.\nAs the more than two-year-old matter crawls toward its new-ish April 11, 2022,\ntrial start date, Amber Heard has requested a May 28 hearing on her plea filing\nin front of Judge Penney Azcarate, who was assigned to the case last month by\nChief Judge Bruce White.\nAmber Heard's failed plan to destroy Johnny Depp in the past probably made\nher try some new ideas. Now she is looking far ahead with a new strategy,\nprobably will help her gain a sure-footed move in the US court. The actress\nseems to be absolutely desperate as she\u2019s got nothing to lose. She has already\n\nmade so many mistakes and lied several times (and almost every time she was\ncaught lying). But what if her plan can actually work?\nBecause for now, it seems like her legal team is a little bit pushing. According to\nall the testimony and evidence presented at that trial and Justice Nicol\u2019s decree,\nAmber Heard\u2019s team believes once again that the March 2019-filed Virginia suit\nshould be DOA. \u201cDepp cannot relitigate these factual issues, and as a result of\ntheir preclusion, he cannot claim that the statements are false and \u2018actionable\u2019\nunder Virginia defamation law, so his claims are barred as a matter of law,\u201d the\nplea filing states.\n...\nThe court date for the main defamation date is in April 2022 and we will make\nsure to be the first ones to deliver the latest news to you.
