Yes, mate it is what it is...\n\nThe Aquaman star, Jason eventually opened up on his relationship with Amber Heard and what he feels about her. Well, we all know how fun and interesting the kind of a guy Jason Momoa is. Jason is everyone's favourite (laughing)\n\nAdding on a valuable tip for you, try to stay calm and patient around him, Jason really can't see anyone sitting calm, he's a real attention seeker. If the word \"attention seeker\" is given to someone ever in the future, I would request the officials to kindly give it to Jason Momoa. , \n\nWell as I already mentioned, Jason would never attempt any prank that can harm a person in any way. We must just agree that we adore and love him a lot. And on the other hand, Jason never forgets to charm ladies, with his hot looks and of course beautiful smile. Who called him Jason Momoa and not Jason the charmer? (laughing)\nSpeaking about Jason Momoa's and Amber Heard's bond, they really get along well together, but as you all know things never stay the same. Jason's and Amber's friendship bond was affected after Jason decided to play a master prank on Amber Heard.\n\nOnce while shooting for Aquaman, the charming yet playful Star  Jason Momoa, played a sick prank on Amber heard. Well, what he did was truly sad and tragic. It's like you have made a sandhill and out of nowhere a random person comes and destroys your sandhill. Did you feel that pain now?\n\nWell, Jason didn't ruin Amber Heard's Sandhill (laughs jokingly) but did something the same that left Amber Heard sad all day long. Let me break this down for you, The Game of Thrones star, intentionally in the name of prank, tore the last ten pages of Amber Heard books that she regularly used to read in between shots and takes... Like, yes!!!\n\nShockingly Jason did that, I don't know why that doesn't sound like a Big deal to him, but it is...And guess what? Amber's a bookworm (oops Jason, you shouldn't have done that) But what's done is done (laughing nervously) We feel you, Amber!!\n\nAmber Heard shared all the incident, where Jason went to keep her attention on set, she confessed, \" I love Jason we had so much fun together but he is allergic to being ignored and I'm a bookworm who loves to read the books, he adopted this method of ripping out the pages of my book so I would pay attention to him\". Poor Amber...\n\nWhereas, the crew staff was helpful to Amber Heard, due to Jason's book ripping pranks the crew on the set of Aquaman designed a book bag out of green screen material so that Amber could carry her books on set with her and read between takes.\n\n\"I would feel so bad if someone was going out of  their way to throw her book to her but they could tell I was going crazy so the wardrobe built me a book bag\" Amber stated in the interview with Good Morning America...\"\n\nDelving into the history, Amber Heard's personal life problem which is no more limited to her speaks a lot about her behaviour and the kind of a person she is. As we all know that Amber Heard and Johnny Depp are hooked into the legal drama, things seem to slip out of Dear Amber's hand. \n\nTalking about the legal drama, the case eventually took a u-turn resulting in a case favouring Johnny Depp. The recent leaked audio call and bodycam footage revealed the true colours of Aquaman star Amber Heard. Accepting the fact that Johnny Depp was never the abuser it was Amber Heard who physically abused Johnny Depp celebrity news clevver news entertainment news information overload inform overload johnny depp appeal amber heard aquaman 2 informoverload amber heard petition\n\nHowever, the Warner brothers never reacted to the demand of fans, asking to kick out Amber Heard from the Aquaman 2, while they had already kicked Johnny out of 'the pirates of Caribbean series. \n\nJohnny Depp fans tweeted in his favour and asked that Heard should be fired from Aquaman 2. While one of Johnny's fans tweeted writing \" I don't understand why Warner brothers fired Johnny Depp but not Amber Heard, they both have evidence of being abused by each other, and abusive women are rarely held to the same standard as abusive men\".\n\n#AmberHeard #JasonMomoa #Aquaman2 #JohnnyDepp #JusticeForDepp #TheSpotlight",
