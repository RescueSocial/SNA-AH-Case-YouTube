However, this story took an even juicier\nside when Amber Heard's friends started supporting Johnny Depp and testifying\nagainst Amber Heard.\nMake sure you stay till the end to see which Amber Heard\u2019s friends sided with\nJohnny Depp and what they have to say about Amber.\nDespite the fact that Amber Heard\u2019s vicious plan to ruin Johnny Depp\u2019s career\nwas pretty successful lately, it seems like right now the tables have turned. As\nyou may already know, there have been several times when Amber Heard was\ncaught lying or using other people to stay in the driver's seat in this case. She\nallegedly bribed her own sister, and used her assistant\u2019s s*xual assault story.\nBasically, things got very dirty and it seems like her fans, friends and some\nother people don\u2019t want to be linked to the perfect liar.\nSo, let\u2019s start with Twitter and some fans\u2019 thoughts on Amber Heard\u2019s lies.\nWhen Amber Heard said it out loud that Johnny Depp was an ab*ser and even\nshowed bruises, fans couldn\u2019t help but bombarded Amber with tweets and\ncomments. Among the Twitter users was Adam Waldman - a former member of\nJohnny's legal team - who tweeted a picture of the actress as he tried to discount\nher allegations against her ex-husband.\nAlongside the images he wrote: \u201c12/15/15 allegation 'I had bruised ribs. Bruises\nall over my body, bruises on my forearms from trying to defend the blows. I had\n2 black eyes. I had a broken nose. I had a broken lip. Justice Nichols - I believe\nher. UK Appeals Court - we believe him. But oops ... PHOTO SHOOT!\u201d\nResponding to the post, the actress said: \u201cYes Mr Waldman, I may be wearing\nmakeup on this occasion but on every occasion you will still be short.\u201d\nThen another Twitter user commented, \u201cI'd rather be short than an abusive gold\ndigger Woman shrugging\u201d, Amber hit back, \u201cIt's good to be realistic with your\ngoals\u201d. Then, there was another tweet, written in Spanish that read, \u201cAmber\nHeard talking to Johnny Deep's lawyer regarding a set of photos where she\nclaims she was made wearing makeup to cover hit marks, a broken nostril,\n\nbruises and more made by Johnny...but...\u201d, the actress replied, \u201cAnd so?\u201d Looks\nlike Amber Heard is having fun and doesn't care what people say about her.\nAmber Heard could expect such a reaction from people and, probably, that is\nwhy she is so calm and confident. But what she did not expect was that her\nfriends sided with Johnny Depp. You have to wonder who and why betrayed\nAmber Heard, and we are going to break it down for you in a minute.\nAmber Heard was shocked when Laura Divenere (interior decorator to the stars)\nand Amber\u2019s former friend testified against her. Laura Divenere worked for\nJohnny Depp and Amber Heard as their interior decorator in downtown LA in\nthe Eastern Columbia Building from July 2014 to sometime in 2016. And after\nthe pair splitted up Laura continued to work for Amber. She explains, \"I have\nbeen and continue to consider myself a friend of Amber's. I remain in regular\ncontact with Amber. I have not communicated with Mr. Depp since 2016.\" It is\nan interesting ally in this case for Johnny Depp as she is the first person in the\ncase to identify as a friend of Amber Heard's but give testimony in support of\nJohnny.\n\nPlus I want to know your opinion about Amber Heard\u2019s friends taking Johnny\nDepp\u2019s side. Do you think they just don\u2019t want to be linked to Amber Heard\nbecause she is a liar? Let me know your opinion in the comments section down\nbelow.
