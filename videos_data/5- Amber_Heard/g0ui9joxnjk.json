            "description": "From a sweep-you-off-your-feet kind of romance, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard\u2019s love story has taken a messy turn in just a few years. It seemed like the couple\u2019s burning desire for each other turned into a burning dislike as quickly as it started. Five years after Amber Heard filed for divorce, the fight between the former couple is still ongoing. And even though the divorce had been finalized four years ago, the chaos that their marriage brought is far from over. But since the latest court hearing for the former couple\u2019s defamation lawsuit will take place soon, there have been many major changes and happenings that just surfaced, and that includes a huge win for Johnny\u2019s case. It seems like the Virginian judge handling their case is tired of Amber\u2019s lies and is not willing to listen to her anymore. How did that happen? Well, it is a pretty detailed case but in this video, we\u2019ll lay out everything you need to know. But before that, make sure to smash that subscribe button first and hit that notification bell for more updates. Let\u2019s dive in!\n\nBefore everything else, let\u2019s go back to the beginning of this case. Johnny and Amber first ignited a spark between them when they starred together at the 2011 comedy-drama film, The Rum Diary. This love story between the two had quickly travelled from screen to real life. Johnny was then sharing his life with partner Vanessa Paradis, a French actress and singer, whom he lived with for 14 years and whom he had two kids with, while Amber was with her then girlfriend Tasya van Ree. Shortly after the film\u2019s release, the two broke off their current relationships and officially started dating. Their relationship was something you can describe as romantic and utterly beautiful. But today, it\u2019s now one of the messiest in history. Amber Heard filed for divorce in 2016. Along the divorce filing was her request for a temporary restraining order against Johnny, accusing him of physically hurting her. Johnny, up to this day, vehemently denies the allegation. Even though the couple\u2019s divorce was finalized in 2017, lawsuits have been made due to Amber\u2019s concerning allegations against Depp. She also alleged that at the time of her filing for divorce, Johnny threw a phone at her which caused her to bruise her face, an accusation that Johnny denied, and investigators found false. Turns out, the photos were staged. Not so cool, Amber. Aside from this, the Aquaman actress also stressed that Johnny was hurtful towards his former lovers, which Johnny\u2019s ex-wife and ex-fiancee proved false.\n\nBut despite the police\u2019s information, news publication The Sun still called Johnny Depp a very bad name which angered the actor, causing him to file a libel lawsuit against the publication. Sadly enough, Johnny lost this lawsuit, which resulted in his career\u2019s downfall as major production company Warner Bros. fired him from his role as Grindelwald in the upcoming third installment of the series Fantastic Beasts. Clearly, this broke Johnny\u2019s heart. \n\nBut even though her name became pretty big during this case, it is undeniable that Johnny\u2019s name in the industry is a lot bigger. So, Amber started to lose her supporters\u2019 trust, especially when more and more evidence against her was turning up, including the phone calls she made with Johnny admitting that she did hit him, her alleged affairs, and even her false claims that she donated her $7 million dollar divorce settlement to charity. Until now, Amber couldn\u2019t provide any proof that she did donate her settlement money, which she publicly promised before. \n\nYou might be wondering why Johnny Depp filed for a lawsuit in the state of Virginia when neither him nor Amber lives in the state. Virginia is one of just ten states that adhere to what\u2019s known as the lex loci delicti rule, which is Latin for place of the wrong where the tort was committed. That\u2019s defined as where the publication occurs. The Washington Post\u2019s servers, the publication in which Amber released her Op Ed, are located in the state. Another reason why Johnny did not file his lawsuit in California is because of its strong Anti-SLAPP statute. Now, what is an anti-SLAPP law? These laws are intended to prevent people from using lawsuits, such as defamation suits, to intimidate people who are exercising their First Amendment rights. \n\nThat\u2019s all for today, hope you enjoyed that video and we\u2019ll see you on the next.
