It turns out that Amber Heard is actually a mother? And actually had been for a couple of months already, which is a shock to many. On Thursday the 35 year old Aquaman actress announced this big news on her personal instagram. Heard went on to post a mother daughter photo of her now 12 week old baby. But the truth is, people are kind of confused as to who the other person in the picture is.
