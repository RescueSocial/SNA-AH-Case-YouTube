For Johnny Depp\n\nhttps://youtu.be/QR9_W4jVEcQ\n\nThe various court cases involving Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been all\nover the news over the last several months and still it is unclear who's right and\nwho's wrong. But this time there's never-seen-before evidence: body cam\nfootage from the Los Angeles police department (LAPD) officers who\nresponded to the 911 call and this evidence seems to change the compilation of\nthe case.\nMake sure you stay till the end to see the final downfall of Amber Heard. This\ntime she is exposed for real. So, what was on the bodycam footage and why it\ncould change the whole case.\nNobody expected this was coming but Johnny Depp's attorneys claim that\nnever-before-seen body cam footage from the Los Angeles police department\n(LAPD) officers who responded to the second of two 911 calls proves that\nJohnny Depp did not have the violent altercation with his ex-wife! Moreover, it\nproves that Amber Heard lied about the alleged brawl that took place in May\n2016.\nHowever, it's not the first time that Amber Heard lied. Let\u2019s look back at the\nfollowing things: donating the entirety of the divorce settlement money to a\nchildren\u2019s charity, an abuse story that she stole from her former colleague, the\n\u2018dogs story\u2019, never hitting Johnny Depp, and many other things. Amber Heard\nlied about all of these things while under oath in the UK high courts. Now\nthere\u2019s even more evidence that she lied.\nAnd now, ahead of Johnny Depp's upcoming $50 million defamation lawsuit\nagainst his ex-wife, which will take place in Virginia in April 2022, the actor's\nlawyers are revealing depositions from the officers and body camera footage\nfrom them and the attorneys are claiming that cops do not support Amber\nHeard's allegations.\nGiving testimony, Amber Heard claimed that Johnny Depp hit her in the face\nwith a phone and tore out clumps of her hair in an extended altercation that took\nplace throughout their shared home at the time. Amber Heard and her friend,\nRocky Pennington, both gave depositions about the incident and each of them\n\ndescribed the scene as a violent mess. Rocky Pennington described it as, \"They\nhave a big kitchen island in the middle of the kitchen and on there, there's\ncandles and like fruit and, you know, glass, like jars and vases and things like\nthat. And he just was hitting everything with the wine bottle, just smashing it all\noff. So there was fruit on the floor and baskets and, you know, glass bottles and\nflowers.\"\nAmber Heard's description was, \"We have huge heavy silver candlesticks,\ncandelabra sticks. Those were on the floor broken. Baskets of fruit that we had\non the kitchen island. There ... fruit everywhere. Baskets on the ground. The\ncontainers holding the spoons and forks, kitchen utensils, those were spilled. He\nbroke a lot of glass things that left glass on the floor ... when he walked out into\nthe hallway, you could see wine spilled all over the ground and wine on the\nwalls and ... and so I knew that at least he had gone through there and was like\nsloshing wine anywhere.\"\nRight now we have a chance to take a look at what really happened that night!\n...\nAnd now I want to know your opinion of the matter. Do you think this evidence\nwill help Johnny Depp to prove that he is not the ab*ser? And do you think\nAmber Heard will continue to put up the fight?
