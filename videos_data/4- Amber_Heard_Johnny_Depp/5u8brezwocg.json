He's there for a libel suit against British tabloid The Sun, which ran a report that the actor was abusive to his ex-wife Amber Heard, who he divorced back in 2017 after an 18-month marriage. Today, disturbing texts allegedly sent by Depp were read aloud. Trial attorney Misty Marris shares her take with Access Hollywood on how damaging they could be for his case. Depp's attorney has not yet commented on the alleged texts, and Depp has denied all abuse allegations.\n\n\u00bb SUBSCRIBE: http://bit.ly/AHSub\n\u00bb Visit Our Website: http://www.AccessOnline.com/\n\nGet More Access:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/accessonline\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/accessonline \nInstagram: http://instagram.com/accessonline\nSnapchat: OfficialAccess \n\nAbout Access:\n\"Access\" is a nationally syndicated daily entertainment news show. \"Access\" delivers the most comprehensive coverage of entertainment news and personalities on television, featuring in-depth celebrity interviews and behind-the-scenes accounts of the most important events in Hollywood.\n\nJohnny Depp's Alleged Disturbing Texts About Amber Heard Read In Court\nhttps://www.youtube.com/accessonline\n\n#AccessHollywood\n#JohnnyDepp",
