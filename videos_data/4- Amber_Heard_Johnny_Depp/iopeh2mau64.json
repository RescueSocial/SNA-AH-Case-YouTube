            "description": "As you guys must know a pretty nasty fight happened in March, 2015, Australia.\n\nApproximately one month after they married, Heard threw multiple objects at him, including two vodka bottles that severed his finger. He said in court documents that the attack started after he told her she'd have to sign a prenup. \n\nAnd this video is part of the deposition of the 30M lawsuit against his ex lawyers. Because the attorney Bryan Freedman, brought the injury up because Bloom\u2019s law firm had prepared the post-nup agreement that Heard was asked to sign the night before the fight, as Depp claimed.\n\nHe also stated multiple times in these court documents  that he lied to protect her, saying that he had cut his own finger by accident.\n\n\nHere a few things you need to know:\n\nAmber changed the history behind the incident multiple times.\n\nI. First she claimed she was in UK, on the phone with Johnny while he threw a punch at some glass, severing his finger\nhttps://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3741910/amp/Photo-Johnny-Depp-s-ghastly-finger-cut-tip-fit-rage-wrote-blood-wall-Amber-Heard-affair-Billy-Bob-Thornton.html\n\n\nII. Then she claimed he punched a wall, severing his fingertip\nhttps://variety.com/2016/film/news/johnny-depp-hand-injury-amber-heard-fight-1201786023/\n\n\nIII. Then, that he repeatedly smashed a plastic phone and that caused the injury\nhttps://metro.co.uk/2019/04/15/johnny-depp-scrawled-jealous-messages-amber-heard-oil-paint-blood-severing-finger-9204710/amp/\n\n\nIV. She admits she was in Australia, but didn't throw a bottle or anything at him. https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5835867-Amber-Heard-Motion-to-Dismiss.html\n\n\nV. And recently, in a record obtained by Daily Mail, she admitted that she \"never meant to hurt him\" in Australia. Heard repeatedly says she didn't did it on purpose while crying and afraid she'll lose him. All this happening while doctors were searching for Depp's finger in what looked like a crime scene, just a few hours after the Incident. Which debunk all her initial claims once again. https://t.co/YVvnKXRisQ",
