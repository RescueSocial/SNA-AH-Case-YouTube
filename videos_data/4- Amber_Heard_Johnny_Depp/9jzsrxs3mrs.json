Amber Heard is presenting herself to be in a bad situation that might be pretty hard to come back from. Someone also involved in this case is the Tesla billionaire, Elon Musk. Allow me to explain why Elon Musk is now a person of interest in this whole drama.\n\nAccording to the Times-News source, Johnny Depp has appeared to have dragged Elon Musk into the Amber Heard saga. Just a couple of days ago it was stated that the Tesla billionaire is being brought back into Depp\u2019s 50 million dollar libel action against his ex-wife, Amber. What some of you might not know is why. Well, Depp who had accused Elon of having an affair with Amber during their short-lasting marriage is bringing him back into the case again. However, Johnny Depp is bringing Elon into the mix for a different reason. Depp wants Elon to be interviewed and in this interview, Depp would like him to come forward and hand over the details of all the contact he has had with Amber Heard. The 57-year-old actor is suing her for 50 million dollars in Virginia over a 2019 op-ed article she wrote for the Washington Post. In the article, Amber described herself as a victim. Most of you might be aware of this, but the news about Elon being brought into the case really changes the game as there could be some new information that Elon could bring forward in order to either help Depp\u2019s case against Amber Heard or the other way around. Johnny Depp has obtained a court order requiring Elon Musk, the 49-year-old CEO to give his testimony. This is where he will be questioned on the details about his relationship with Amber Heard. The reason for him being called forward is not to talk about their relationship or whatever they shared together, but Musk is being asked to come forward and bring forward any knowledge he has of her allegations against her ex-husband, Johnny Depp. This means that if he is aware of what the truth is in this case. Musk may be the one who holds some useful information that can make or break the case for either of the two. Depp is hoping that he comes forward and discusses the truth of what happened and not the lies that are being constantly spread. Elon is known for several different things, one of which is that he is the CEO of SpaceX, and the other being that he is the CEO of Tesla. Musk, who was estimated last month to be the world\u2019s richest person with a worth of more than 185 billion dollars, is being required to provide details of phone calls, emails, letters, and text messages exchanged with Amber Heard during various periods in March 2015. Now, you may be thinking that this is invading Elon\u2019s privacy but there are legitimate reasons behind it. Back when things were not so good between Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, it was stated that she was going to get a restraining order against Depp. When Amber decided to do this, the one she made sure to let know was Elon Musk. As she went on to tell him about the issue, he offered to pay and provide her with 24-hour security. He also shared that he liked Amber Heard, according to what the high court had to hear. Laws said that Musk offers to arrange 24/7 security for you, adding the offer would stand even if you never wanted to see me again. Anyway, sorry for being an idiot. The radio silence hurts a lot. It only matters because I really like you, said Elon. He has also been asked to hand over any documents relating to her 7 million dollar divorce settlement which she claimed to have donated to the American civil liberties union and the children\u2019s hospital Los Angeles. The money that she in fact came forward to state that she had yet to give her settlement money over as it was promised back when she split with Depp.In other news, back when Johnny Depp unsuccessfully sued The Sun over an article describing him in a not-so-kind manner and questioning why J.K Rowling let him appear in the fantastic beasts\u2019 film because of the allegations Amber Heard stated about Depp.The high court was told that Elon Musk became a regular late-night visitor to Amber Heard monthly.\n\n#BluffCentral #AmberHeard #JohnnyDepp #JusticeForJohnnyDepp #ElonMusk #Heard #Depp #Musk #MeToo",
