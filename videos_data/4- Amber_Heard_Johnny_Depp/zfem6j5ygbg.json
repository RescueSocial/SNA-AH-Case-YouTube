Anyone really. \n\nYes, I know the editing is horribly cluttered and I'm sorry for that. There was just too much to include. Pause the statements to have enough time to read them. I thought they were too crucial to be left out. \n\nSo, Amber supporters, I'm interested to know if you could wrap up something like this that proves she was the victim. Hmm... very likely not.",
