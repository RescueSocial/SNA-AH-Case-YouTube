            "description": "Johnny Depp Can WIN Amber Heard COURT CASE AFTER THIS BIG REVEAL | The Gossipy\n\nTo say the Amber Heard Johnny Depp Court case has been ruthless, scandalous, and bitter would an understatement. Johnny Depp has been fired from big roles. Amber Heard has been fired from big roles too. But the court battle rolls. New evidence and documents are being brought up all the time now. Today we have update on new crucial evidence. We break it down in the video. Let's get into it.\n\nWith the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. \n\nEver since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.\n\n#AmberHeard #JohnnyDepp #JusticeForJohnnyDepp #AmberHeardJail\u200b #AmberHeardCourt\u200b #JusticeForJohnny #Amberheardfired #BigReveal\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWelcome to The Gossipy.
