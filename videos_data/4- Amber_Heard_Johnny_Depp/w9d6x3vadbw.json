Eleanor Laws QC, Depp's lawyer,asked her about being violent towards Depp during the fight, Heard said: 'He pushed Kate Moss down the stairs, I heard this from two people, and this was fresh in my mind'. Ms Laws accused Heard of 'adding' the Kate Moss incident during her evidence as she had never mentioned it before. The court was then played an excerpt of Heard's deposition in August 2016, in which she talks about the March 2015 incident.
