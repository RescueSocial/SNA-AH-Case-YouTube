It is no secret that Johnny Depp and\nAmber Heard have been in a divorce case involving domestic abuse. At one point, Amber\nclaimed that Johnny was abusive and he didn't do much to fight back. Later, as the\nproceedings began, Johnny made statements that Amber was the abuser. We\u2019re still seeing\nthe fallout of Johnny Depp\u2018s catastrophic defeat in the British High Court last year. His libel\ncase brought against The Sun newspaper was intended to refute accusations that he was a\ndrug-addled domestic abuser and expose ex-wife Amber Heard as a fantasist. But it\nbackfired spectacularly, as not only was Depp\u2019s dirty laundry aired in public, but the judge\nfound Heard\u2019s testimony convincing and ruled that it isn\u2019t libellous to describe him as a\n\u201cwife-beater.\u201d\nConsequences came fast. He was almost immediately booted off Fantastic Beasts 3, has\nreportedly lost several high-profile upcoming roles, and insiders say he\u2019s currently blacklisted\nin Hollywood. But the most painful blow may come from Disney, as the studio is apparently\nplanning to move forward on a Pirates of the Caribbean movie without Captain Jack Sparrow\n(but there\u2019s also an information that Disney allegedly rehired Johnny Depp but no one knows\nfor sure). But according to the latest information, Amber Heard was exposed by her lawyer\nand the body language analyst announced that Amber Heard was not honest by accusing\nJohnny Depp! And it seems like things are going so great for Amber as well! Recently she\nwas replaced by Emilia Clarke for the role of Mera in Aquaman 2, Amber is now abandoned\nby her own legal team. Which means something really serious happened as so many people\nchanged their minds and now they are on Johnny Depp's side. Actually, you may remember\nthat Amber Heard's former personal assistant claimed that she told the actress about a\nviolent se**al as**ult she had endured, only for Heard to \u201ctwist\" the story for her own use.\nKate James gave dramatic testimony at Johnny Depp's libel trial against a British tabloid\nnewspaper that accused the actor of abusing ex-wife Heard during their relationship. Believe\nit or not - it is up to you, but here is something else you need to know about Amber Heard.\nAnyways, the tables are turned now and many celebrities and fans support Johnny Depp,\nand they believe him! Moreover, now they are accusing Amber of orchestrating a hoax to\nruin Johnny Depp\u2019s career. And what is more, so many professionals from all walks of life\nhave come forward to prove that Amber is lying. And someone who showed the whole world\nthat Amber was not honest testifying in court against Johnny was body language analyst\nLogan Portenier from the popular YouTube channel \u2018OBSERVE\u2019. According to Logan\nPortenier, Amber Heard\u2019s behaviour and facial expressions in her infamous 2016 court\ndeposition were strange and it was the reason why Logan decided to make a deep analysis\nof Amber\u2019s body language.\nAmber Heard can be seen in a recording smirking and rolling her eyes while listening to a\nrecording of herself. In this video, the Aquaman star can be seen rolling her eyes and eating\nwhat seem to be cookies. She looks totally disinterested by what\u2019s going on in the recording.\nFirst, fans thought she was behaving that way because she was stressed out and scared.\nBut body language expert is convinced that the real reason why Amber Heard looks and\nsounds like she is lying is because she actually is!\n\nIn the recording Heard is listening to with the lawyers, Depp can be heard claiming that\nHeard hit him with a bathroom door and then punched him in the jaw. She denies having\nslammed the door in his face deliberately and then apologises for having hit Depp in the face\non purpose. She can be heard pleading: \u201cI just reacted and I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s below me.\u201d But why\ndoes she still act like she doesn\u2019t care? At least right now, during the deposition. \n\n\nBinge Watch - Binge Watch is the best source of the latest celebrity news.
