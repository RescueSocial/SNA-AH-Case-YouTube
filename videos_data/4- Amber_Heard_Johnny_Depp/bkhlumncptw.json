            "description": "After a whirlwind of romance since their first movie together, many fans thought that the marriage between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard would be lovely, unproblematic, and just full of sweetness and happiness --just like any other normal couple. But as it turned out, it was actually the opposite. Just a year after their private wedding ceremony, problems started spiraling in, and now, their divorce and lawsuits are even more excruciating and longer than the marriage itself. But how exactly did this happen? Well, let\u2019s first go back to where the Johnny Depp - Amber Heard story started in the first place. \n\nJohnny and Amber first ignited a spark between them when they starred together in the 2011 comedy-drama film, The Rum Diary. Johnny portrayed a journalist who was immediately smitten with Amber\u2019s character. However, this love story between the two quickly travelled from screen to real life. Amber Heard even told Vogue quickly after the release of the film that, \u201cWorking with Johnny was amazing. It was better than I ever imagined, which is really saying something.\u201d Technically, hearing these words from the actress already hinted that the two really hit it off easily during their film taping, and even though the two of them did not quickly jump into a relationship right after the film shooting, the same year that the film was released, the relationships they both were in at the time fell apart, and that suggested quite a rare coincidence. Depp was with his then-partner Vanessa Paradis whom he lived with for 14 years and whom he had two kids with, while Heard was with her then-girlfriend Tasya van Ree. After the film, and the rumors circulating about Johnny and Amber\u2019s involvement with each other, Johnny and Vanessa\u2019s relationship ended, while Amber ended things too with Tasya van Ree. Then, in 2012, the two officially started dating. The couple showed everyone that they were deeply in love with each other. But now, their relationship has turned out to be one of the messiest in history, considering their year-long marriage. \n\nIn 2014, after a couple of years dating each other, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard announced their engagement. Amber was spotted wearing an engagement ring, which quickly sparked rumors about an upcoming wedding between the couple. This rumored engagement did not stay secret long enough, as Johnny himself confirmed this in an interview after discussing wedding planning and pointing out that he was wearing \"a chick's ring\" on his finger. In 2015, after several years of dating, Johnny married Amber in a private ceremony in their home in LA. Johnny Depp is no amateur star, and neither is Amber Heard. So this wedding did not stay secret for too long. The marriage started how everyone expected it would be --near perfect and rich with love. They were both wealthy personalities after all. But there\u2019s a saying that goes around that says, \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t really believe everything you see on picture.\u201d \n\nIn 2017, the couple was officially divorced, but the war they were fighting was definitely far from over. In 2018, Amber wrote an op-ed to The Washington Post entitled \u201cI spoke up \u2013 and faced our culture's wrath. That has to change,\u201d where she explained that she was hurt, and in which she spoke about the treatment of women in these types of cases. Despite not involving Johnny\u2019s name on her statement, Johnny\u2019s team felt that it was pertained to him, having recently filed a complaint against him and, well, technically they just got out of their failed relationship. So, in March of 2019, the 57 year old actor took action and filed a lawsuit of $50 million against her, for defamation over the said article in the Washington Post. The suit said that Amber \"is not a victim of domestic abuse, she is a perpetrator,\" and denied that Johnny ever abused her. At the time, Depp's lawyer called the article an \"abuse of the #MeToo movement\" and claimed Heard \"masquerades as victim rather than abuser.\" And instead, the suit said that her allegations were part of an \"elaborate hoax to generate positive publicity\" for the actress. Johnny also testified that he was actually the one being hurt by his wife before, which was proven through recorded phone calls. Johnny also brought up Amber\u2019s alleged cheating acts and affairs with actor James Franco and multi-billionaire Elon Musk. \n\nIf you enjoyed this story, make sure to like, subscribe, and hit that notification bell for more videos like this.
