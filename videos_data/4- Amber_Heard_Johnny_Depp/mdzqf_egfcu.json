What started as a romantic and cute relationship quickly turned violent and messy. But now 5 years after the initial divorce announcement, the couple is still in ongoing court battles and lawsuits even though the original divorce was actually concluded.\n\nHowever recently, just a few weeks prior to their next defamation case court hearing, many things have started to come to light and there have been lots of changes in the situation. Which includes a massive win for Johnny Depp, apart from the most recent one where bodycam footage confirmed Amber was lying. This time it seems the Virginia judge who handles their case has had enough of Amber\u2019s lies and doesn\u2019t want to hear a single more. But what happened for her to reach this point? \n\n#AmberHeard #JohnnyDepp",
