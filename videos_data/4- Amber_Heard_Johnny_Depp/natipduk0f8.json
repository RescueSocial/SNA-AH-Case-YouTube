            "description": "Ms Heard alleges that Mr Depp also\u00a0ripped her shirt and left her with a 'busted' lip and a\u00a0'lump' on the back of her head on Thanksgiving in November 2015. Today two videos were played in court from the holiday weekend where people can be heard talking excitedly and laughing with Heard and Depp, who filmed the group enjoying themselves. When asked by Eleanor Laws, Mr Depp's QC,  to explain the footage, which showed no violence taking place, Heard replied: 'Our fights never happened in front of the family. They typically happened after everyone had gone to bed.' Ms Laws alleged that Heard was lying about the entire incident and said: 'You are making up this up as you go along'. Not all the faces of those in the darkened video are visible, but Heard can be seen picking up a drink and revealed that she could tell that Marilyn Manson was present after recognising his fingernails.\u00a0 She also told the court that others present were her friend Rocky Pennington, Depp and his son Jack, Heard's father David and Erin Boerum, Heard's nurse and friend. Amber has claimed that her megastar ex-husband would blame his 'alter ego' called 'the monster' for the alleged violence while intoxicated with copious amounts of drink and drugs. In the film Depp can be heard joking with Jack Depp about a monster being in the room while Amber exclaims to a guest: 'What are you doing? Get away get away'.\n\nOriginal Article: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8548577/Amber-Heard-accused-lying-Johnny-Depps-Thanksgiving-attack-video-emerges.html\nOriginal Video: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/video/news/video-2215494/Video-Amber-Heard-Johnny-Depp-laugh-joke-Thanksgiving-2015.html\n\nDaily Mail Facebook: http://facebook.com/dailymail\nDaily Mail IG: http://instagram.com/dailymail\nDaily Mail Snap: https://www.snapchat.com/discover/Daily-Mail/8392137033\nDaily Mail Twitter: http://twitter.com/MailOnline\nDaily Mail Pinterest: http://pinterest.co.uk/dailymail\nDaily Mail Google+: https://plus.google.com/+DailyMail\n\nGet the free Daily Mail mobile app: http://dailymail.co.uk/mobile",
