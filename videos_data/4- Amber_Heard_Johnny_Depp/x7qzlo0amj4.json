            "description": "Johnny Depp FINALLY Exposes Amber Heard For Lying.\nThings appear to be going from bad to worse for Amber Heard as new revelations continue to appear on tabloids detailing how untrue most of her claims about her ex-husband were. Since last year when Johnny Depp decided to launch a series of law suits against her and The Sun Newspapers for defamation of character, her career has not remained the same. She used her allegations to cancel and ruin Depp's career, but now, karma has come full circle. Johnny Depp has come out to speak against Amber and her lies.\n\nJust to give you a quick recap, Johnny Depp and his ex-wife split after been married for only a year and Amber Heard went on to claim that the Pirates of The Carribean actor had been violent towards her while in the relationship. She gave interviews across different media outlets including the Washington Post and The Sun and her story ruined Depp's reputation and affected his career negatively. Then came the publication by the Sun calling Johnny Depp names all based on Amber\u2019s story. This was the final straw as Johnny Depp decided to take NGN (the owners of the Sun Newspaper) to court with a defamation lawsuit. He also filed a suit against Amber seeking damages for ruining his reputation.\n\n\nSubscribe for celeb drama:  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVRROqlaHIP92Oun1Cl8XAw?sub_confirmation=1\n\n#TheSocial #JohnnyDepp #AmberHeard",
