She said that it originally ate away at her wallet for many years, but she\u2019s hung onto the car regardless. In the above video, Heard is surprised by her husband Johnny Depp, her dad and the show\u2019s cast about getting her car restored. But, they all decide to pull a prank on her first, making her believe her car had been stolen.\n\nAnd, in the video, we see the finished product once the car has been fully restored. The sight of the car brings Heard to tears.    Her husband (soon to be ex husband) is please for her.\n\nWhee it all go wrong Amber ?",
