            "title": "Analysing Amber Heard's Abuse Of Johnny Depp",
            "description": "In this video I look closely at what is said between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard in a recorded conversation and compare it to the version of events she gave in court in 2016.  Amber Heard can be heard at times, agreeing with Johnny Depp's version of events, and at other times does not show any signs she sees the situation differently. From the tone of their voices we can get a sense of whether she might feel pressured to agree with him or whether she genuinely does and we can gain an understanding, from what they both say, of what happened between them that day. Amber Heard gives us insight into why she physically abused Johnny Depp and we get a sense of Amber's inability to control her emotions and the excuses she gives.\n\nLater I look at what she said in court about the same event. Why does she claim that everything happened in the opposite way?  How does she try to encourage us to feel contempt towards Johnny Depp and to not take him seriously? And what does she say when questioned about the assaults on Johnny she previously admitted to?\n\nI have done extensive research on narcissism and the effects of narcissistic abuse. I work as a coach specifically with people who have experienced an abusive relationship.
