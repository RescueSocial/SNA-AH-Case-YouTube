This challenge that Johnny offered was rejected by Lord Justice Underhill and Lord Justice Dingemans with their reasoning being that they felt going through the case a second time has a high chance of turning out just like the first one.\n\nDepp has been denied the chance to stand up in the libel case against the newspaper as well as one of its journalists. Even with him having proof of him being the victim of abuse by Amber Heard, Johnny was facing the brunt. \n\nLord Justice Underhill has also stated that it is hard to convince the jury to vote for his side of the case due to the fact that purely factual questions were not enough to turn the case around.\n\nAmber had promised to give away the divorce settlement of 7 million dollars that she had received from Johnny Depp, to two associations one being the ACLU and the other being the Children\u2019s Hospital, Los Angeles. \n\nThe truth about this came out when Johnny\u2019s team did some digging and found out that she hadn\u2019t donated the money and only had contributed $100,000 towards the organizations. \n\nAmber has refuted back that she would pay off the donations in time and that all the money that she had, had gone into the lawsuit case, defending herself. But Johnny also did say that the money that she got was being used to sway the judge towards her favour, which is probably what happened. After knowing her nature, it is quite hard to think of her otherwise. \n\nSadly, Johnny cannot go back and fend for himself this time. This is due to the fact that the same crime cannot be tried twice and thus the newspapers have taken a deep breath due to their narrow escape from the case getting messier.\n\nIn fact, it was the perfect press strategy. Looking at the situation holistically, the overall benefit that Amber has is much higher now. But why? Well, once one rules you out from being the winner of the case, it is hard for other and judged to not agree with his side of the case too.\n\nWhat did The Sun have to say about this after the verdict was out?\nFirst of all, they were pretty glad that they got out of such a rut of a situation. Secondly, the attorney from The Sun had stated that the winning of the was a big deal as it was a true representation of how strong Amber is to stand up to the face of Mr Depp. \n\nThis whole situation according to them stood as a great example for those suffering from domestic violence and that they are being heard and must be strong enough to stand up for their rights. \n\nThis libel trial of the century had 12 files of evidence that were looked into with evidence also been taken from around 30 witnesses. The  does not wish to proceed on with this case and is hoping this to be the final end to this prolonged case. \n\nDuring the first case that he was involved with, the loss that he endured cost him a major chunk of his career. Two of the biggest roles he was holding at that point in time, one being the role of Jack Sparrow from the Pirates of the Caribbean and Gellert Grindelwald from the Fantastic Beasts franchise, both went down the drain after his loss. \n\nNo one wanted to work with him and ruin the reputation of working with an individual who was involved in domestic abuse. \n\nThe only thing left to look forward to is Depp\u2019s defamation lawsuit that would take place in the United States of America. How that would play out and when it would happen is quite unpredictable at this point in time. \n\nThe pandemic has made things all the more worse by dragging out the events of the case. The case that was to be heard out at in April this year, has been postponed to May next year, which is quite a lot of time.\n\nJoelle Rich from Shilling Partners in London has spoken up on behalf of Johnny Depp stating that he still has hopes of winning. In fact, he still thinks that the in the US may actually see things from his perspective and that he may actually be proved not guilty. amber heard aquaman 2 jason momoa clevver news informoverload amber heard elon musk viral vision\n\n#JohnnyDeppLosesCase #JusticeForDepp #AmberHeard #Heard #Depp #JohnnyDeppCase #AmberHeardCase #AmberHeardAudio #Aquaman2 \n#JusticeForJohnnyDepp #TheSpotlight #JohnnyDeppAppeal",
