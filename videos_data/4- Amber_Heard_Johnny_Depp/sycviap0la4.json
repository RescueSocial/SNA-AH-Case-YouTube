            "title": "Amber Heard FORCES Judge To Dismiss Lawsuit  - Johnny Depp Amber Heard Lawsuit UPDATE",
            "description": "As we all know now, famous actor Johnny Depp, who played numerous roles in the past, and his then wife Amber Heard, who had recently appeared in the DC movie Aquaman, are now in the middle of a preposterous chaos that all stemmed from their past marriage, broken vows, and well, a lot of \u201cphysical\u201d, problems. But how did all of this frenzy start? How did the romantic private wedding go down this badly? And what were the actions taken by Amber Heard that were angering the judges so much? Let\u2019s all find out in this video. But before we go any further, make sure to hit that subscribe button and notification bell first for more updates. So, let\u2019s begin!\n\nIf you remember, Johnny Depp has been at the height of his career in the industry for many, many years now. He started acting as early as the 1980\u2019s, when he first appeared in the horror-slash-thriller film \u201cA Nightmare on Elm Street '', and played a minor role as the boyfriend of the main character. This helped Johnny begin his acting career, landing more minor roles and then major ones. Later on, he became a popular star of the classic, eccentric director Tim Burton\u2019s films, where he portrayed various roles that all have these similarities: unique, bizarre, and kinda creepy in their own ways. In the romantic fantasy film \u201cEdward Scissorhands\u201d, he met his ex-partner Winona Ryder, whom we all see now in the sci-fi series Stranger Things. The two of them dated for four years, and even though the couple ended things between them in the 90\u2019s, Winona still defended Johnny against Amber Heard on her recent allegations of abuse. He also played a few roles with Helena Bonham Carter in many Tim Burton films such as Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Alice in Wonderland and Alice Through the Looking Glass, Corpse Bride, Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, and Dark Shadows. One of the most widely-known appearances of Johnny Depp that perhaps brought him the largest commercial and critical success was the Disney media franchise \u201cPirates of the Carribean\u201d series, where he landed and reprised his lead role for all five movies that ran from 2003 to 2017. \n\nAmber Heard, on the other hand, started her acting career in 2003, first by appearing in two music videos, and then later on landing small supporting roles in three various television series. This then later on elevated her to more film and television roles, both in the supporting and lead actress roles. Her latest film that hit commercial success was the 2018 DC movie \u201cAquaman\u201d, where she co-starred alongside Jason Momoa as Mera, the Atlantean Queen. However, even amidst the controversies circling her divorce with Johnny Depp, she managed to keep and reprise her role in the 2021 superhero film \u201cZack Snyder\u2019s Justice League'', a director\u2019s cut of the 2017 film. Not only that, but she also starred in the post-apocalyptic miniseries \u201cThe Stand\u201d, which was based on Stephen King\u2019s novel of the same name. Here, she co-starred alongside Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd, James Marden, and Odessa Young, and it premiered in December 2020. This upset fans because as Johnny was being banned from reprising his role as Grindelwald, Amber got to star in more films and series, and not only that, she was also reported to reappear as Mera in the sequel of the DC movie Aquaman which is set to start filming in July of 2021. Many fans saw this as an unfair treatment, given that both actors slash ex-lovers are facing the ongoing lawsuits between them.\n\nAnd just recently, there has been a new occurrence in the ongoing defamation case against Amber\u2019s article on The Washington Post, and it seems like Johnny\u2019s side is stepping a little ahead of the game.\n\nAmber Heard has been looking into Disney and what the company knew about Johnny\u2019s actions and behavior during his time on the Pirates of the Caribbean films. For his part, Johnny has asserted Amber has lied on several occasions, including saying she would give their divorce settlement to charity but didn\u2019t, and also said she had asserted he was violent once, when police body cam footage allegedly showed otherwise. Not so cool, Amber. Her lawyer has also said that the Aquaman 2 actress has not been able to pay out the full divorce settlement to charity.\n\nThat\u2019s all for our latest updates for today.
