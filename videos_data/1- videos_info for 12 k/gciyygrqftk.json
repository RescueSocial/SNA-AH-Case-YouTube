This one stuck out for me... it was at a premiere for Mortdecai. Mind you this is only 2 minutes yet...there was something odd going on. You have to look carefully at his body language: In the beginning, he mouths \"Stop\" to Amber (twice!) because she obviously didn't want him to do an interview. He then shook his head \"no\" then proceeded with the interview. Notice he backed little after locking eyes with Amber, fearing he upset her by going against her wishes. Notice he had a plaster on his finger too...not sure if she injured it but she certainly injured his middle finger a couple of months after this. While answering questions, he kept checking to see if she was okay with it. She pretended she was, knowing they were being watched. He perhaps unintentionally used words like 'out of control' and 'difficult' to reflect the situation back then. At the end he asked, \"can we go?\" Why should he even ask for her permission? She treated him like a dog throughout their whole relationship.",
