A couple of weeks ago, Heard lost the appeal to dismiss Johnny Depp\u2019s $50 million defamation lawsuit and we learned that the Aquaman star could be facing up to 3 years of jail time if found guilty of manipulating evidence against her then-husband. But even beyond the former couple\u2019s seemingly never-ending legal battle, Heard has come under a lot of fire after evidence presented to the court as part of the lawsuit revealed that she\u2019s physically and emotionally harassed Depp while twisting the narrative in her favor and painting the Pirates of the Caribbean actor as a domestic abuser.\n\n\nNote : Copyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for \"fair use\" for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.
