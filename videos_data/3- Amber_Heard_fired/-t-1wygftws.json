            "description": "Marilyn Manson's Former Personal Assistant Speaks Out ( Marilyn Manson Innocent / Allegations / Evan Rachel Wood / Amber Heard / Johnny Depp )\n\nI interview the lovely Paula, a good friend and former personal assistant of Marilyn Manson. She's known him for almost two decades and tells us about him. She also gives her view of the abuse allegations against him (she's on his side) and discusses her experiences with Johnny Depp and Amber Heard. \n\nAt approximately the 1:13:00 mark, she and I begin discussing Johnny Depp and Amber Heard. Paula knew them and was present at the infamous 2015 Thanksgiving dinner that was discussed in the UK trial. She has some interesting things to say about Amber! :)\n\nPaula's Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/paulababy1/ \n\nFOR MORE VIDEOS ON MANSON ALLEGATIONS, SEE MY CHANNEL.
