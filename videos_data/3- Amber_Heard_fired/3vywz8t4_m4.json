Initially, everyone was siding with Amber, but eventually, the truth about Heards violent nature came out. At the time of the divorce between the two celebs, Depp was hushed and his word meant nothing as opposed to Ambers. When Amber provided the court with such reasons, Depp denied these accusations and even stated that all this was being done by Amber in her best interests, and not his. \n\n#7: The Lawsuit In 2019\nThe messes the two of them were drowning in were further worsened by the onset of a lawsuit. And no, this time it wasn\u2019t filed by Amber, but in fact against her! Amber Heard expressed her feelings about Johnny Depp, using explicit content in an article published by the Washington Post, injuring Depp\u2019s reputation, which led to the beginning of the 50 million dollar suit against Amber Heard. \n\n#6: Leaks Of Audio 2015\nThe audio leaks seemed to be the turning point for Depp\u2019s ill fate as this was one of the most solid forms of proof that helped enable him to be proved as the innocent in the messy trial.What did the leaked audio messages contain? The conversations between the two were as toxic as their marriage. It involved a lot of content that went along the lines of them being involved in domestic violence, her being the main abuser. \n\n#5: Severed Fingertip\nIf Amber truly was the one to have faced being physically harmed why was Depp\u2019s finger left severed? According to various sources, including Johnny Depp himself, Amber Heard injured Depp\u2019s finger due to a heated argument that broke out between the two of them, resulting in him having to rush to the emergency room to get it fixed. In an interview, she claims he was the one who would constantly hurl things at her, when in fact later on it was proved it was just quite the opposite that was happening behind closed doors. \n\n#4: Depp's Bruised Face 2020 & Amber's Fake Bruises\nTo what extent this woman went to prove her innocence is quite disgusting we must say. At one point, Amber had exposed her scarring and bruising on social media to damage Depp. On investigating further into Amber\u2019s bruises, they seemed to be fake as the next day she made an appearance with no trace of even a single scratch on her. \n\n#3: Premiere of Alice Through The Looking Glass\nDepp did a fabulous job in the movie Alice Through The Looking Glass. His fans were quite enlightened with his presence on the day of its premiere, but the same cannot be said about Johnny Depp! Unfortunately, we all assumed his speech to include his dark humor which he constantly brings out from time to time but indeed many believe it to be a cry for help. He mentioned being in pain, being tired, and wanting to go home.\n\n\n#2: Career 2016 Onwards\nIt is quite a well-known fact that once someone is surrounded by constant negativity, this not only takes a toll on their mental health but also starts affecting their professional life too. Depp met Amber on the sets of The Rum Diary, and both were happily married then. Depp fell into Amber\u2019s trap, both ending their marriages and marrying each other a few years later. Depp was quite a huge hit in Hollywood. Everyone wanted to hire him. The array of films he was getting by the year was massive and all he was doing at every award function was hoarding awards. It is quite evident that following 2016, things for him took a turn downhill professionally. \n\n#1: Mother\nDepp\u2019s mother was quite well known for her difficult nature. Apparently, it was said Johnny was the only person who could tolerate her cruel nature. It was till her very end that he stood by her side and tended to all of her needs. If Depp could respect such a woman till her last breath, why would he ever harm someone who he claimed to have loved? There is no answer to that question by anyone but stands as a self-explanatory form of evidence to prove Depp was not the kind of man to hurt any woman, especially Amber.
