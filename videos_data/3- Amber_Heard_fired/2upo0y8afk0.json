However, many also noticed that Heard's name wasn't in the credits and they didn't see her in the trailer, making some wonder if Heard has been removed from the movie.\n\nBut fans got thunder-struck when they saw that Amber Heard is still part of Zack Snyder's \"Justice League'' 4 hours cut. What a trick there Snyder. \n\n#AmberHeardFired #AmberHeadCancelled #AmberHeardCareerOver\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-lZTlG05ETwyjDS1JQCv3w/featured?sub_confirmation=1\n\nThis Channel intends to provide the most breaking celeb news, drama and controversies all in one place.
