            "description": "The Harry Potter franchise has gone from one of the most lucrative investments in the entertainment industry to a major headache for Warner Bros.\n\nIt all started when the studio decided to move full-steam ahead on a prequel series beginning with Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. This involved casting Johnny Depp as the dark wizard Grindelwald, a decision which was met with derision from fans after allegations came out claiming Depp physically assaulted his former wife, Amber Heard. \n\nNo doubt this controversy, combined with incredibly poor reviews, led to a significant drop in box office revenue when the sequel, Fantastic Beasts and the Crimes of Grindelwald grossed just over $650 million worldwide. Roger Ebert never got a crack at reviewing it, but if he had, his reaction might have been something like this:\n\n\"This movie was a total disappointment. No thought went into it. No effort went into it.\"\n\nWhile there are still plans to make a third film in the series, Warner Bros. has decided to let Depp go from his role of Grindelwald. This comes in the aftermath of Depp and his attorneys filing a libel lawsuit against News Group Newspapers in July of 2020. The lawsuit stemmed from the news source referring to Depp as a \"wife beater,\" but Depp was dealt a blow when the court ruled against him on November 2. A few days after the court rendered its decision, Depp took to Instagram to post a notice to his fans that while he'll continue fighting his case and appealing the court's decision, he'll be stepping down from the Fantastic Beasts franchise, a decision that appears to accord with the studio's wishes.\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, one person who's staying away from this conversation, at least for the time being, appears to be Harry Potter creator and writer for the Fantastic Beasts movies J.K. Rowling.  Keep watching the video to see what J.K. Rowling Reportedly Did After The Johnny Depp Firing.\n\n#JohnnyDepp #JKRowling #FantasticBeasts\n\nRead Full Article: https://www.looper.com/276240/what-j-k-rowling-reportedly-did-after-the-johnny-depp-firing/",
