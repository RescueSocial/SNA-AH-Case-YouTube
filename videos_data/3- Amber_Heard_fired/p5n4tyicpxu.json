The rumor follows the news of Amber Heard possibly facing jail time for allegedly faking injuries in order to obtain a temporary restraining order against ex husband Johnny Depp.\n\nThe rumor actually offers that Warner Bros. fired Amber Heard weeks ago from Aquaman 2 and won't ever again be working with the actress. It's claimed that Heard is uninsurable, much like Robert Downey Jr. during his drug days and Linsday Lohan during her troubled times.\n\n__________________________________________\n\nMusic In This Video : \n\nTrack: Odessa \u2014 LiQWYD & Scandinavianz\nMusic provided by Audio Library Plus\nWatch: https://youtu.be/jNy-Dp3lgcg",
