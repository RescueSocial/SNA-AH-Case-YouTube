            "title": "Warner Brothers Wants To FIRE Amber Heard From Aquaman 2 NOW?!",
            "description": "Just a few hours after Warner Brothers announced that they\u2019d started filming the second installment of the DC Extended universe film, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, people were quick to react negatively, causing the first filming day of the said movie to flop early on and trend in pretty bad ways. Why? As you remember, Warner Brothers stuck with their initial decision to keep Amber Heard in Aquaman\u2019s second movie despite her involvement in the lawsuits with Johnny Depp, and despite the same production company\u2019s reckless decision to fire Johnny from his iconic role as Grindelwald in the third installment of the Fantastic Beasts film trilogy. Because of this, many fans were outraged, as they should have been, because of the so-called unfair treatment between the former couple. However, despite garnering almost two million signatures in a petition for Warner Brothers to fire Amber, the production company still pushed through on casting her. Many fans were angered by this, and as a result, they vowed to boycott the upcoming Aquaman movie in 2022. Many said they would not watch it so that Amber Heard and the rest of Warner Brothers get their well-deserved downfall. All this time, Warner Brothers never bent their decision, but now that they are experiencing a major backlash in social media due to mean comments about their film and Amber Heard, will they finally regret casting her? What are fans saying about Warner brothers now? Will the movie and the production company itself plummet to the ground? Let\u2019s find out in this video. But before that, make sure first to subscribe to our channel and hit that notification bell for more updates. Now, let\u2019s begin!\n\nThe first day of filming of the new movie sequel Aquaman and The Lost Kingdom was expected to be huge news to its fans, but rather, it turned out to be a big flop. What made it an even bigger disappointment for Warner Brothers is that the first Aquaman movie turned out to be a major blockbuster success in 2018, reaching 1.184 billion dollars, with a production budget of only 160 to 200 million dollars. That\u2019s a lot of profit! However, after the first release of the first movie, one of the main actresses, Amber Heard, had been involved in a lawsuit with Johnny Depp, all brought about by their messy marriage and split. And even though Amber played the victim at first, soon enough, evidence surfaced proving her as a \u201cliar and a manipulator\u201d to use one of Johnny Depp\u2019s co-stars\u2019 words. And aside from the stuff that Amber told the public, there was evidence of her having affairs during her marriage with Johnny, a phone call record proving she was the one who actually lifted a finger on Johnny, and a missing 7 million dollars worth of charity donations. Because of this evidence and allegations, Amber Heard had turned into one of the most despised celebrities today real quick. Now, having someone with a bad image to star along with a few of the highest paid actors in the industry is actually a big risk for a huge production company like Warner Brothers, and that\u2019s why people are so confused why Warner Brothers kept her from getting fired. But apart from this, Warner Brothers are reportedly trying to reduce Amber\u2019s screen time, a matter which Jason Momoa and the director, James Wan himself, kind of disagree about.\n\nEverywhere you look on social media, there were mean comments about Amber, and sadly, about the upcoming Aquaman film itself. There\u2019s no doubt that the first Aquaman directed by James Wan was a huge hit. Here are some of the nastiest reactions of fans about Warner Brother\u2019s firm decision to keep Amber Heard.\n\nWhen Aquaman director James Wan posted on social media a photo of a clapperboard hinting on their start of filming,  it was overshadowed by negative comments with almost 3,000 tweets. One social media user took it to twitter and said, \u201cWhen you see that Warner Bros kept Amber Heard onboard for Aquaman 2, but still haven't brought back Johnny for 'Fantastic Beasts'. #FireAmberHeard, with a GIF of a man throwing tantrums in a kitchen. Some twitter users even made social media memes out of it making fun of their excited reactions when Aquaman 2 was announced but then changed it to disgust after learning that Amber Heard will be in it. While another twitter user did not use any more fuss and just directly said, \u201cDon\u2019t care, just fire Amber Heard\u201d. \n\nThat\u2019s all for today, we hope you enjoyed that video, and if you did, don\u2019t forget to smash that like button, subscribe to the channel and hit that notification bell for more videos like this.\n\nRelated videos:\nHeard ACCIDENTALLY REVEALS her ENTIRE DESPERATE PLAN!
