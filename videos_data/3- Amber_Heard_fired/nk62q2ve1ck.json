That doesn\u2019t sound so bad, does it? It actually sounds like a fun little trip, but as we all know by now that Amber is known to pull off a great facade in front of the public and she did the same in 2015.\n\nAmber Heard was quite stubborn in taking two of her Yorkshire terriers, Boo and Pistol, along with her. Unfortunately, Australia is pretty strict with their animal policies and do conduct a strict check at the Borders and during immigration. \n\nIf so, how were they able to take the dogs?\nAmber Heard is quite cheeky when it comes to escaping the law. She managed to take her dogs and enter the country until she was caught leading Amber to face the court. \n\nWell at that time we all believed her to be innocent and that she hadn't known about these rules as she has stated, and all was forgiven. But only after her divorce and lawsuit did the Australian Government decide to look into this case yet again. The case currently holds a status of ongoing and we are pretty sure that this is going to cause her a lot of trouble holistically. \n\nSo what do these documents contain?\nIn simple words, the documents contain information stating that everything she stated back in 2015 are complete lies. That is not a shocker for us at this point but yes that is the truth of what the documents contain. \n\nQuick recap from the past, what did Amber defend herself when she was called onto the pedestal to plead her case?\nAmber stated that she did not know that such a law existed in Australia. She stated that it was all a misunderstanding and that she wasn\u2019t aware that it would cost her a lot. In fact, shortly after all those events happened, she and Depp put up their video showcasing them in a sorry state being extremely apologetic about what they did and how much they love and respect Australia. \n\nWant to know something funny about this, Amber stated to have forgotten to claim her dogs or whatever set of lies she was rapping at that point but guess what she didn\u2019t forget to claim? \n\nNow, who is Kate James and Kevin Murphy?\nKate James was Amber Heard\u2019s personal assistant and she worked for Amber Heard for 3 years from March 2012 to February 2015. Kevin Murphy on the other hand was someone who worked for Depp for almost 8 years and was caught into this huge mess unknowingly.\n\nAs someone famous once said, it is the people who try to do good who get into trouble while the guilty always seem to have it easier. This is partially true, but karma is real and it surely is served cold to the people who deserve it.\n\nKevin knew about the issues that would arise if the dogs were taken without proper documentation. He even spoke to Amber about it on call and even in person stating that it was a bad idea. But being the stubborn individual she is, refused to take heed to his advice and took things into her own hand.\n\nKevin rejected her offer but then was verbally threatened by Amber due to which he succumbed under pressure to do so. Later on, after she divorced Depp, he tried to retract his claim as he no longer worked for them and wanted to turn his wrongs into rights as the guilt was killing him.\n\nKevin also stated that he had told Amber to proceed in taking her dogs in the right way by filling out the paperwork and only then taking her dogs overseas. But due to this entailing a ten-day quarantine which she wasn\u2019t patient enough to endure, she chose to take the shortcut which came to bite her back. \n\nThe worst-case scenario involves her facing jail time that can be for a minimum of 5 years to a maximum of 15 years. Now that is a lot, especially if it was for just being stubborn over taking your dogs with you. How old are you Amber? 5?\n\nTo make this situation messier, Aquaman 2 is also going to be shot there which means Amber Heard could lose her role as Mera to this mistake of hers, that she forgot to cover up. Dear Amber, you cannot hide the skeleton in the closet forever. But if she does get kicked out of Aquaman 2 for this, we are pretty sure fans would be glad. #AmberHeard #JohnyDepp #Aquaman2 #JohnnyDeppCase #AmberHeardCase #TheSpotlight #AH",
