            "description": "Yesterday, Amber Head was dragged on Twitter for her continued involvement in Aquaman 2 because a lot of people want her fired for things she's done or accused of having done in her personal life with her ex-husband. Lately, every time Aquaman 2 director James Wan posts anything related to the movie onilne, people respond by trolling Amber Heard.\n\nThey want Amber Heard fired, but she's not going anywhere.\n\nSo... will their anger cause them to reject Aquaman 2 at the box office, or will a lot of people still go see the movie anyway, despite their unhappiness with her being in the project? And what about those who simply don't care?\n\nI discuss in this latest Super Nerd Video edition, so check it out. \n\nPlease subscribe to the channel and leave a comment below!\r\n\r\nFOLLOW ME ON TWITTER: https://twitter.com/HiltonCollins\r\nFOLLOW ME ON INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/hiltoncollins/\n\n#amberheard #aquaman2 #aquaman",
