Amber Heard secretly taped Johnny Depp, trying to catch him as \"the monster\", then leaked PART of the tape to TMZ.  The video clip looked bad out of context with Johnny hurling glasses against the wall. But the full tape has now been released, along with more information about the reason Johnny was angry. Get ready to be mad. Amber Heard is a complete liar.\n\nS U P P O R T   T H I S.
