            "description": "Amber Heard and Johnny Depp have been the focus of some incredible issues ever since their divorce, with the two initiating a series of massive lawsuits. These accusations and lawsuits have since claimed much of Johnny Depp\u2019s career, costing him his role of Jack Sparrow. While fans have petitioned to have Amber Heard similarly fired from Aquaman 2, it seems they may have now gotten their wish. Although for some rather unexpected reasons if the report is to be believed. As revealed via Yahoo! Finance, they have\u00a0shared a rather interesting rumor. Apparently Amber Heard allegedly wasn\u2019t in physical enough shape to take on the role of Mera again for Aquaman 2. As a result of this, she was reportedly fired. The rumor then continues, suggesting that Warner Bros also apparently has a replacement in mind. As stated:\u201cReports suggest that Amber gained a little weight before the commencement of the shoot and the makers are not keen on continuing to work with her. Not just that, it is being said that Emilia Clarke who I known popularly for her role as Daenerys Targaryen from Game Of Thrones is all set to replace her.\u201dFurthermore, Sausage Roll similarly stated the following rumor about Amber Heard being fired from Aquaman 2:\u201cAmber Heard did not pass her physical examination. She\u2019s put on some pounds and is in terrible shape. There is a clause in her contract which says she is required to be in good form ahead of shooting and she violated that.\u201dAlthough one reporter has stated that these reports are \u201cinaccurate\u201d:But for the time being, it looks like there\u2019s a slight possibility all those who\u2019ve petitioned against Amber Heard won\u2019t have to see her in the new Aquaman movie after all. Of course, this should all be taken with a grain of salt for now. But stay tuned for any updates on the rumor as we have them. Aquaman 2 is currently scheduled for a release date on December 16, 2022.\n\n\nAll data is taken from the source: http://screengeek.net\nArticle Link: https://www.screengeek.net/2021/02/28/amber-heard-fired-aquaman-2-report/\n\n\n#AmberHeard #newsoftoday #newsworldtoday #bbcnewstoday #newsworldwide #cnnnewstoday #",
