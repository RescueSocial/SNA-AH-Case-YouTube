Get the latest details in our LIVE COVERAGE.

There are no suspects yet and no known motive in Joshua Brown's murder. The shooting may have been a drive-by shooting -- a car was seen speeding away from where Brown was shot. Brown lived in the same apartment complex as Botham Jean and Amber Guyger, and was in the hallway and heard the gunshots last September when Amber Guyger shot and killed her neighbor Botham Jean. Guyger testified that she accidentally entered the wrong apartment and thought Jean was an intruder. A Dallas County jury convicted Guyger of murder this week, and Joshua Brown's testimony is seen as playing a key role in the trial. In this interactive live stream, host Steve Lookner brings you the latest updates on the news that Botham Jean's neighbor Joshua Brown has been murdered, and Steve will also read your comments and questions on the air!

http://bit.ly/ScienceSalon97

In this revealing conversation Amber Scorah opens the box into the psychology of religious belief to show how, exactly, religions and cults convince members that theirs is the one true religion, to the point, she admits, that she would have gladly died for her faith. As a third-generation Jehovah’s Witness, Amber Scorah had devoted her life to sounding God’s warning of impending Armageddon. She volunteered to take the message to China, where the preaching she did was illegal and could result in her expulsion or worse. Here, she had some distance from her community for the first time. Immersion in a foreign language and culture — and a whole new way of thinking — turned her world upside down, and eventually led her to lose all that she had been sure was true. As a proselytizer in Shanghai, using fake names and secret codes to evade the authorities’ notice, Scorah discreetly looked for targets in public parks and stores. To support herself, she found work at a Chinese language learning podcast, hiding her real purpose from her coworkers. Now with a creative outlet, getting to know worldly people for the first time, she began to understand that there were other ways of seeing the world and living a fulfilling life. When one of these relationships became an “escape hatch,” Scorah’s loss of faith culminated in her own personal apocalypse, the only kind of ending possible for a Jehovah’s Witness. Shunned by family and friends as an apostate, Scorah was alone in Shanghai and thrown into a world she had only known from the periphery — with no education or support system. A coming of age story of a woman already in her thirties, this unforgettable memoir examines what it’s like to start one’s life over again with an entirely new identity. Scorah and Shermer also discuss:

• the legals and logistics of writing a memoir
• the rise of the nones and disbelief and why stories like hers provide social proof for living without religion
• what Jehovah’s Witnesses believe and why they believe it
• what it’s like to go door-to-door witnessing for a religion
• Armageddon and what doomsayers do when the world doesn’t end
• the mindset of the fundamentalist
• why religions are obsessed with female sexuality
• why religions forbid homosexuality
• the psychology of deconversion
• the problem of evil, or why bad things happen to good people
• how she would try to talk someone out of joining ISIS
• what it’s like to be expelled from a religion and be an apostate, and
• how to start your life over when you’ve lost everything.

Amber Scorah is a writer living in Brooklyn, NY. Her articles have been published in The New York Times, The Believer, and USA Today. Prior to coming to New York, Scorah lived in Shanghai, where she was creator and host of the podcast Dear Amber: An Insider’s Guide to Everything China. Leaving the Witness is her first book.

This dialogue was recorded on December 9, 2019 as part of the Science Salon Podcast series hosted by Michael Shermer and presented by The Skeptics Society, in California.
