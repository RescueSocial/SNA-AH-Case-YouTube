Yes, you read that correctly. AH and her team are using the Chewbacca defense from an episode of South Park. Overloading people with evidence that doesn't even need to be there.

The American actor, 57, is suing News Group Newspapers (NGN), publisher of The Sun, for an article they ran in 2018 branding the star ""a wife beater"" – an allegation he strenuously denies.  During the third week of the libel case, Heard and her sister Whitney Henriquez gave evidence against Depp who they claimed was violent towards Heard on numerous occasions.  According to Deadline.com, during the hearing on Friday, Depp's barrister David Sherborne told the court they had received a clip from a ""confidential source"" on Thursday night after Henriquez gave evidence earlier in the day, stating her sibling had never attacked her.    Henrique gave evidence, claiming she saw Depp punch Heard “really hard in the head … multiple times” in Los Angeles in March 2015.  Henriquez said that Heard punched Depp on that occasion, but only did so ""in my defence"" because she claimed her sister thought Depp was going to push her down the stairs.    Sherborne then claimed to the court that Henriquez had ""tailored"" her evidence ""to meet her sister’s evidence"".    Sherborne told Justice Nicol: “After she [Ms Henriquez] gave evidence yesterday, one of our team was contacted by an individual, on the basis of being kept confidential.  ""We were contacted to explain that Ms Amber Heard had a history of violence and attacking people and this video, which was attached, of her sister Whitney [Henriquez] was taken shortly after Amber Heard had attacked her and Ms Whitney [Henriquez] was filmed with people commenting on the bruises on her face and body.""  He continued: "" In the context of the attack, what I will call ‘the stairs incident’, and the evidence we say of the attack by Ms Amber Heard on Mr Depp, Ms Whitney [Henriquez] you will recall protested that it was only in self-defence and it is the one physical attack that Ms Amber Heard admits to.""     Sherborne explained that Henriquez’s evidence about the altercation in March 2015 is ""the only occasion on which any other human being is supposed to have witnessed” Depp being violent towards Heard.  He added: ""The reliability of Ms Whitney [Henriquez] is critical.""  Sherborne told the court: ""We are entitled to put [allegations of] violence to Ms Whitney [Henriquez] … we want to play the video tape to her and ask her about the incident in which Ms Amber Heard attacked her.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5bMzPzl-qwc/default.jpg,120,90,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5bMzPzl-qwc/mqdefault.jpg,320,180,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5bMzPzl-qwc/hqdefault.jpg,480,360,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5bMzPzl-qwc/sddefault.jpg,640.0,480.0,,,,Entertainment today,['More OnAmber Heard'],22,none,,Amber Heard accused of 'attacking sister' after video emerges in court,"Johnny Depp ’s lawyers introduced new video evidence from an ""anonymous source"" which they claim shows Amber Heard had ""attacked"" her sister, the High Court heard.

Amber Heard might be the new Avengers movie! Disney is reportedly eyeing her for a new role in the marvel cinematic universe. Amber Heard's Avengers won't sit well with Johnny Depp fans if she is indeed casted. Especially with all drama going on with Johnny Depp Amber Heard court case.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

Now it turns out that Amber Heard may have not written the statement or OP ED in accusations against Johnny Depp. This could another case of defamation or fraud. Let's break it down in today's video.

Did Amber Heard just get booted for Aquaman 2? This would be great news to Johnny Depp and Aquaman fans around the world. The #FireAmberHeard movement is going strong. It seems the Aquaman 2 director, James Wan, does not even want Amber Heard in the movie. 

It seems like everyone is turning against Amber Heard. The Johnny Depp Amber Heard legal battle is still at the forefront of celebrity news.

Elon Musk, Jason Momoa, Angelina Jolie, Joe Rogan, and others have all WHO DEFENDED Johnny Depp with PROOF from Amber Heard.

While some celebrities prefer living a quiet life away from the public, others just have so many scandals following them. In this video, we are going to talk about Johnny Depp and Amber Heard, who have been on each other’s throats ever since they split up and how Amber Heard might be facing jail time for one mistake she made in all this.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court.

Did Amber Heard just get booted for Aquaman 2? This would be great news to Johnny Depp and Aquaman fans around the world. The #FireAmberHeard movement is going strong. It seems the Aquaman 2 director, James Wan, does not even want Amber Heard in the movie. 

It seems like everyone is turning against Amber Heard. The Johnny Depp Amber Heard legal battle is still at the forefront of celebrity news.

Elon Musk, Jason Momoa, Angelina Jolie, Joe Rogan, and others have all WHO DEFENDED Johnny Depp with PROOF from Amber Heard.

While some celebrities prefer living a quiet life away from the public, others just have so many scandals following them. In this video, we are going to talk about Johnny Depp and Amber Heard, who have been on each other’s throats ever since they split up and how Amber Heard might be facing jail time for one mistake she made in all this.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

Now it turns out that Amber Heard may have not written the statement or OP ED in accusations against Johnny Depp. This could another case of defamation or fraud. Let's break it down in today's video.

Today we will be telling you about the disasters Amber Heard is making in terms of her divorce from Johnny Depp.
Even Johnny and Amber’s love life and married life were not as engaging as their divorce is. 
Depp has firmly refused the claims of abuse by Amber Heard but was once again withheld permission to petition the court's ruling in March 2021. Court of Appeal judges said the original hearing ""was full and fair"" and that the trial judge ""gave thorough reasons for his conclusions which have not been shown even arguably to be vitiated by any error of approach or mistake of law.""
Before I tell you about the bad times, let me tell you about the good times. After several years of dating, Depp and Heard married in 2015 in a private ceremony in their home in LA. And ya, that’s the end of it.
On May 23, 2016, Heard filed for divorce from Depp and obtained a temporary restraining order against the Oscar-nominated actor. She alleged that Depp had physically abused her during their relationship and said it was usually under the influence of drugs or alcohol.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard.
