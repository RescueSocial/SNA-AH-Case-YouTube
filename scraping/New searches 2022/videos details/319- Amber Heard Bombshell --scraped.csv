Together, they pull back the curtain to reveal how they figured out their working rhythm, how exactly they approach their content calendar and social media strategies, and they even share the exact tools they use to make it all happen.

 Coming from both perspectives of business owner and marketing and social media manager, the two recommend how others new to this relationship or who are aspiring to hire a marketing team member might approach syncing their efforts. They agree it is important to give autonomy, affirm and show trust along the way, stay curious, continuously evaluate things together, and importantly take chances, but in small, doable steps.

 Abby totally dropped the podcast mic after quoting her mantra, ""Blessed are the flexible for they won't be bent out of shape.""

 &nbsp;

 Make it Easy to Cover You in the Media

 &nbsp;

 Synthesize your key talking points. (Yes, say them over and over and over again, no matter how many interviews you’ve been on. Only you have heard it that many times, the various audiences have not.)

 &nbsp;

 Create a Media Kit

 &nbsp;

 Before sending your kits out, consider that different outlets will require different angles, so while your kit may be mostly the same, your pitch should be unique.

 &nbsp;

 Create different versions of your media kit including:

 -A digital PDF that you can email or link to. (Be sure to reduce the file size so it can be reasonably attached to an email. Or link to a Dropbox, Box, or Drive folder that has the correct share settings to grant access to it.

 -A printed version that can be snail mailed or handed to someone.

 -A web page version. You can see mine here: amberhurdle.com/media

 &nbsp;

 Media Kit Checklist

 &nbsp;

 Include the following elements in your media kit:

 &nbsp;

 -Product description

 -Brief bio of you or any key members of your team involved in the story

 -Press release

 -Product specs

 -Sample interview questions (and answers if you want to go that far)

 -Contact information

 -Credibility page featuring testimonials, previous media appearances, notable companies you’ve worked with, awards or accomplishments, etc...

 &nbsp;

 How to Make Your Media Kit

 &nbsp;

 You can make a simple media kit in Microsoft Word or Google Docs, or you can make a fancier or more graphically enhances media kit in a free do it yourself design application like Canva or PicMonkey or in Adobe Photoshop if you have those skills. OR if you don’t want to be responsible for it at all, you can search “media kit” in Fiverr and find a super affordable, fast and professional looking solution there.

 &nbsp;

 Recruit a Launch Team

 &nbsp;

 The media probably won’t pay attention to your business, product or service launch if no one else is. That’s why it’s helpful to make your own ruckus by recruiting the help of customers, audience members, friends and family.

 &nbsp;

 Pick one reliable person to handle different aspects of your promotions, then give them very specific to-dos, and let them rally the troops. For example, they can:

 -Help plan or execute a launch party, or get people there

 -Share promotional posts on social media

 -Get/share early access and leave reviews online once your business, product or service actually launches

 -Participate in/organize a Thunderclap

  

 Be sure to tune in to part 3 of this three-part series on how to promote your business to the media!

 Create a Media Kit

 &nbsp;

 Before sending your kits out, consider that different outlets will require different angles, so while your kit may be mostly the same, your pitch should be unique.

 &nbsp;

 Create different versions of your media kit including:

 -A digital PDF that you can email or link to. (Be sure to reduce the file size so it can be reasonably attached to an email. Or link to a Dropbox, Box, or Drive folder that has the correct share settings to grant access to it.

 -A printed version that can be snail mailed or handed to someone.

 -A web page version. You can see mine here: amberhurdle.com/media

 &nbsp;

 Media Kit Checklist

 &nbsp;

 Include the following elements in your media kit:

 &nbsp;

 -Product description

 -Brief bio of you or any key members of your team involved in the story

 -Press release

 -Product specs

 -Sample interview questions (and answers if you want to go that far)

 -Contact information

 -Credibility page featuring testimonials, previous media appearances, notable companies you’ve worked with, awards or accomplishments, etc...

 &nbsp;

 How to Make Your Media Kit

 &nbsp;

 You can make a simple media kit in Microsoft Word or Google Docs, or you can make a fancier or more graphically enhances media kit in a free do it yourself design application like Canva or PicMonkey or in Adobe Photoshop if you have those skills. OR if you don’t want to be responsible for it at all, you can search “media kit” in Fiverr and find a super affordable, fast and professional looking solution there.

 &nbsp;

 Recruit a Launch Team

 &nbsp;

 The media probably won’t pay attention to your business, product or service launch if no one else is. That’s why it’s helpful to make your own ruckus by recruiting the help of customers, audience members, friends and family.

 &nbsp;

 Pick one reliable person to handle different aspects of your promotions, then give them very specific to-dos, and let them rally the troops. For example, they can:

 -Help plan or execute a launch party, or get people there

 -Share promotional posts on social media

 -Get/share early access and leave reviews online once your business, product or service actually launches

 -Participate in/organize a Thunderclap

  

 Be sure to tune in to part 3 of this three-part series on how to promote your business to the media!

  

 Come to my Nashville Author Event/Book Signing at Parnassus Books Also, be sure to come see me at my next author event at Parnassus Books in Nashville! I’d love to meet you in person! And if I’m not candy enough, Parnassus Books is co-owned by novelist Ann Patchett and her business partner, Karen Hayes. No big deal. An independent bookstore owned by two women, one of whom is a New York Times best selling author and the other, a publishing industry vet.

 Why Did I Create the Bombshell Business App?

 Through listener surveys and one-to-one conversation with listeners I discovered that Bombshells listen to me on their phones, on the go, and rarely found the time to visit my website to leverage links or downloads in the show notes. So I knew I needed to make everything conveniently located on your phone, just a tap or two away from the episode you were already listening to.

 &nbsp;

 So the purpose of this app is to provide a convenient way for women in business to learn and connect on the go, and to strengthen the Bombshell community.
