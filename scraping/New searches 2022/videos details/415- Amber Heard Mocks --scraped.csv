Episode 4:
------------------
Amber and Dhara get appreciated as they both perform beautifully on the stage. Akshat takes the credit as he had only gifted the guitar to Dhara. Sonia passes sarcastic comments to Akshat, Amber and Dhara.

About The Amber Dhara :
------------------------------------------
Amber, Dhara are conjoined twins yet are as different as chalk and cheese. Amber Dhara is a bittersweet tale of survival, ambitions, music, and understanding, and most importantly: unconditional love. Abandoned by their father, since the two sisters are joint at the hips, Amber [Sky] and Dhara [Earth] are raised by their mother and grandfather in the idyllic hilly town of Panchgani. From birth, life for these girls has always been a challenge since people stare at them and jeer at their deformities. However, their mother is determined to make them independent and successful. Amber Dhara is a story of a courageous journey where the twins survive various challenges and meet people- good, bad, and ugly. The show emphasizes human values, compassion, and a persistent struggle against all odds.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/s2Piz6CH6uk/default.jpg,120,90,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/s2Piz6CH6uk/mqdefault.jpg,320,180,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/s2Piz6CH6uk/hqdefault.jpg,480,360,SET India,"['sony tv shows', 'heena tv serial', 'best shows on sony tv', 'old set shows', 'old shows of sony tv', 'hindi drama', ""90's hit serial"", 'set india', 'best shows of sony tv', 'old sony tv shows', 'amber dhara show on set', 'set old shows', 'archive shows set india', 'amber dhara sony tv serial', 'amber dhara serial all episodes', 'best old shows sony tv', 'amber dhara show online', 'kashmira irani', 'sulagna panigrahi', 'harshad chopda', 'mona ambegaonkar', 'shweta gulati', 'amber dhara', 'amber dhara full episode 4']",24,none,,Ep 4 - Akshat Mocks Amber - Amber Dhara - Full Episode,"Click here to Subscribe to SET India: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpEhnqL0y41EpW2TvWAHD7Q?sub_confirmation=1
