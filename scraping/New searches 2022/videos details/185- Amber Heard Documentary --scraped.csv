This protects the tree from infection or infestation. Over millennia, as forests fell & began to form peat, with time, pressure & heat, their organic material turned to coal. Trapped within the coal are the remnants of tree resin which turn to copal and then fossilize into amber. Discover how things caught in the resin- remains of plants, animals like insects, spiders, frogs & lizards - help the amber to preserve creatures entombed within, giving paleontologists a window to a far-off time.

Scarlett Johansson's run in the Celebrity Women's Wrestling League is second to none, but there's a significant threat looming in the form of Amber Heard.  Heard has dismantled all 3 of her opponents in Scarlett-like fashion since her arrival.  These two competitors are similar in strength, stamina and athleticism.  Forecasters have this match as dead even. If a menacing challenger isn't enough to deal with, Scarlett is also contending with rumors of consorting with the Provocateurs.  Could the admired Johansson accept a deal with the devil and take a ride on the wild side?  Time will tell, but for now she must summon her focus on a demanding Amber Heard.

Scarlett Johansson's run in the Celebrity Women's Wrestling League is second to none, but there's a significant threat looming in the form of Amber Heard.  Heard has dismantled all 3 of her opponents in Scarlett-like fashion since her arrival.  These two competitors are similar in strength, stamina and athleticism.  Forecasters have this match as dead even. If a menacing challenger isn't enough to deal with, Scarlett is also contending with rumors of consorting with the Provocateurs.  Could the admired Johansson accept a deal with the devil and take a ride on the wild side?  Time will tell, but for now she must summon her focus on a demanding Amber Heard.

This film leads you along the trail of amber in the Dominican Republic.

This substance, and the insect fossils it contains, became famous thanks to the media publicity given to the film ¬´ Jurassic Park ¬ª.

In the southwest of the island villagers who play at being miners, extract larimar - a blue stone with white volutes ‚Äì from narrow galleries lacking in oxygen.

We will follow one of these men who risks his life daily, descending into deep pits to find sufficient larimar to enable him to support his family.

Tired of this dangerous life, he decides to leave for the middle of the country to search for amber.

We follow him down into deep tunnels dug with pickaxes and metal rods, not knowing when one enters whether one will come out alive.

After long searches, the precious resin fossil will come out of the earth in front of your eyes. In a hurry to profit from his discovery, the man goes to collectors who will give him a good price.

To the frenzied rhythms of carnivals and Caribbean music, the amber passes from hand to hand, some pieces selling for several thousand pesos.

There is still a long journey to be made before reaching the Dominican artists who can carve the most beautiful and creative pieces.

The exceptional pieces will reach the jeweler Tournaire in Place Vend√¥me, Paris who will adorn some of his creations with them.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yLDGVjH8sZs/default.jpg,120,90,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yLDGVjH8sZs/mqdefault.jpg,320,180,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yLDGVjH8sZs/hqdefault.jpg,480,360,,,,Voillot Patrick,19,none,Amber from the Dominican Republic documentary of Patrick Voillot,"English :  https://youtu.be/yLDGVjH8sZs
