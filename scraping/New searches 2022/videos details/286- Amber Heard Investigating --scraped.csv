HAMPTON, Va. (WAVY) — It’s a frantic search for a missing mom and baby. The Amber Alert for 8-month-old Chloe Johnson expired Thursday night, but the baby and her mother, Keir Johnson are still considered missing and in danger.

Eight-month-old Chloe Johnson and her mother, 34-year-old Keir Johnson, were reported missing earlier this month. Hampton police say the two were last seen Sunday, April 30 in the 1900 block of Hastings Drive. Johnson was heading to Buckroe Beach. No one has seen or heard from Keir since.

“My sister is somewhere where she needs help and we just haven’t found her yet,” said Johson’s twin sister Teir Pettway. “I call her hoping one day she will answer the phone.”

Pettway’s concern stretches all way to Colorado where she is now living. The last time she talked with her sister was just hours before Hampton police say she went she went missing in late April.

Police say the two were last seen Sunday, April 30 in the 1900 block of Hastings Drive. Johnson was heading to Buckroe Beach. No one has seen or heard from Keir since.

“We were just taking about normal things,” Pettway added. “I went out to eat at the restaurant and I was just telling her about my experience at the restaurant.”

Keir and Chloe have now been missing for three weeks.

Last week, state police issued an Amber Alert last week on behalf of Hampton police for Chloe. Virginia State Police announced the termination of the Amber Alert Thursday night. State Police say the alert was terminated in accordance with Amber Alert policy.

Virginia Amber Alert Plan | General Guidelines

“Standard procedures for a Virginia Amber Alert dictate a 12-hour activation period, unless there are extenuating circumstances,” Virginia State Police spokeswoman Corinne Geller said in an email Thursday night. “The Amber Alert for Chloe Johnson was originally activated May 11, 2017. Upon completion of seven days, the activation has now been terminated.”

According to Virginia’s Amber Alert website, Chloe and Keir Johnson are still considered missing and endangered.

On Monday, 10 On Your Side learned Newport News police were taking over the investigation into Chloe and Keir’s disappearance. The car police believe the two were in was recovered in Newport News on Mother’s Day morning about 10 miles from Johnson’s Hampton home.

“Our detectives on every level, special victim’s unit, homicide are working around the clock and following up on any leads that we get in this case,” said Newport News Officer Brandon Maynard.

Detectives continue to interview family and friends trying to retrace Johnson’s last steps.

“You have to rule out everything and talk to all possible witnesses and families members,” Maynard added. “That’s basic investigation.”

Thursday night, the state police cancelled the AMBER Alert. Newport News officers say that was just protocol.

(“We just want to let the public know that the Amber Alert may be cancelled, but it does not mean we are quitting all efforts in looking for Chloe and Keir Johnson,” Maynard said.

“To me, I just think somebody knows something and they just haven’t come forward yet,” Pettway added. “Everybody worries, because we just want them back safely.”

If you see Chloe or Keir or know anything about their disappearance, call Newport News police immediately at (757) 928-4100 or Virginia State Police at 1-800-822-4453.
