She claimed she didn't want anything except for a divorce from Johnny and yet made a huge demand list. 
There is too much evidence such as pictures, witnesses and medical statements which prove to be in Johnny's favour - he is a victim of DV.
This is nothing to do with genders, a woman shouldn't strike a man just like a man shouldn't strike a woman. 
I stand with Justice. I stand with Johnny Depp.

She claimed she didn't want anything except for a divorce from Johnny and yet made a huge demand list. 
There is too much evidence such as pictures, witnesses and medical statements which prove to be in Johnny's favour - he is a victim of DV.
This is nothing to do with genders, a woman shouldn't strike a man just like a man shouldn't strike a woman. 
I stand with Justice. I stand with Johnny Depp.
