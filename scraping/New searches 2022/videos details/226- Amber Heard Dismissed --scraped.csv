With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

More Celebrity News ►► http://bit.ly/SubClevverNews

As Kanye took the stage, you know MTV had to be petty and played the infamous line in his song “Famous” about Taylor Swift. As the words “I made that bitch famous” echoed throughout Madison Square Garden the crowd chanted Yeezy before proceeding  to shout “you made that bitch famous.” Kanye kicked off his 4 minutes by introducing himself and said that he would be presenting his video, but first he was going to talk. 
Kanye joked about being nominated against Beyonce saying QUOTE – “Later in the night Famous might lose to Beyonce but I cant be mad because I’m always wishing for Beyonce to win.” And speaking of Famous, you know he had to defend the video heard around the world featuring naked wax figures of T-Swift, Kim K, Amber Rose, and Donald Trump just to name a few. Many people jumped on him for exploited women’s bodies by depicting them naked, but Kanye defended his artistic vision by pointing out that he even put Ray J in the bed! In other words he even put his wife’s sex tape co-star in his video. He then pointed to Amber Rose in the audience who is also featured in the video to give a nod to their past relationship. Amber was a good sport when Kanye put her on the spot by smiling back while Kanye joked saying QUOTE – “My wife is a G. Not many people’s wives would let them say that.” 
Kanye also spoke about social issues such as gun violence and racism saying that if you see people dying constantly, you might start to see your life as worthless. He also talked about how people have told him not to compare himself to the greats and that three tactics used to keep people impoverished include taking away their self-esteem, resources, and taking away their role models. In Other words, he’s not going to let anyone tell him that he’s not great. He then gave special shout outs to 2 Chains, Jaden Smith,  called Diddy his idol, said Chance the Rapper is the future, and of course gave love to his wife, Kim Kardashian. 
Following his speech he then exclusively presented his video “Fade” starring Teyanna Taylor. Her body will make you give up cake for life. But I want to hear what you guys thought about Kanye’s speech so sound off in the comment section below and then click right over here for a recap of Ariana Grande and Nicki Minaj’s performance. Then of course don’t forget to subscribe. Thanks for watching Clevver News, I’m your host Drew Dorsey and I’ll see you next time.
