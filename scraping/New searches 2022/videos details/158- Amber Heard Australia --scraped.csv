The DC film stars Momoa as Aquaman (Arthur Curry) and Heard as his wife, Mera. Both actors will appear in November’s Justice League.

Momoa praised Heard’s performance in his touching Instagram photo where the pair are seen sharing a bottle of wine. Momoa claimed he and his onscreen wife “went through some heavy sh*t,” and went on to say how proud he was of her. Momoa also gave love to Australia, where most of the movie was shot.

Heard returned the compliments by saying it was an “amazing 7 months.” The duo definitely seemed to be enjoying their time at the wrap party.

Filming on Aquaman took place on the Gold Coast of Queensland, Australia, according to ComingSoon. Footage was also shot in Newfoundland, Sicily, Tunisia, and at Village Roadshow Studios. The film began shooting this past May.

Aquaman‘s director, James Wan, also took to social media to announce the film’s wrap. Wan is known for his movies such as The Conjuring, Furious 7, Saw, and Insidious. Aquaman will be Wan’s second film that is not classified as a scary movie or horror flick.


Aquaman also stars Nicole Kidman as Queen Atlanna, Dolph Lundgren as King Nereus, Willem Dafoe as Nuidis Vulko, and Patrick Wilson as the film’s villain, Orm (a.k.a. Ocean Master).

Arthur is the half-human son of Queen Atlanna and half-brother of Orm.

The couple, who are not thought to have signed a pre-nup, have been married for 15 months, having tied the knot in February 2015.
According to TMZ, their separation date is listed as Sunday May 22 in divorce documents, two days after Johnny’s mum sadly passed away.

The site reports that Amber filed the divorce petition on Monday, citing irreconcilable differences and asking for spousal support.

It’s claimed that Johnny has since filed a response through his lawyer, Laura Wasser, asking that the judge rejects Amber’s request for spousal support.The couple, who do not have children together, met whilst working on Johnny’s ‘The Rum Diary’ and tied the knot in a small civil ceremony in Los Angeles.

More recently, they found themselves in the spotlight for their awkward ‘apology’ to Australia after Amber allegedly illegally brought their dogs into the country.

Johnny was previously in a relationship with Vanessa Paradis. The couple have children Lily-Ross and Jack together.

Charges were dropped, and some are now wondering if their new apology video was part of their deal to avoid punishment. Cenk Uygur and Ana Kasparian, hosts of The Young Turks, break it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.

""Amber Heard pleaded guilty on Monday to falsifying travel documents to sneak her two pet dogs into Australia.

The 29-year-old actress had been charged with illegally smuggling her dogs, Pistol and Boo, into the country last May, but managed to avoid jail time after prosecutors dropped the charge. Instead, Heard was given a one-month good behavior bond, according to NBC News.

Now that the #WarOnTerrier is over, Heard and husband Johnny Depp want everyone to know they’re sorry for illegally bringing their dogs into Australia.

The couple recorded an apology video, which can only be described as incredibly somber. The video was posted on Facebook by Australian politician Barnaby Joyce, who initially threatened to have the dogs euthanized. Joyce’s comments turned the case into a worldwide media sensation.”*

Charges were dropped, and some are now wondering if their new apology video was part of their deal to avoid punishment. Cenk Uygur and Ana Kasparian, hosts of The Young Turks, break it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.

""Amber Heard pleaded guilty on Monday to falsifying travel documents to sneak her two pet dogs into Australia.

The 29-year-old actress had been charged with illegally smuggling her dogs, Pistol and Boo, into the country last May, but managed to avoid jail time after prosecutors dropped the charge. Instead, Heard was given a one-month good behavior bond, according to NBC News.

Now that the #WarOnTerrier is over, Heard and husband Johnny Depp want everyone to know they’re sorry for illegally bringing their dogs into Australia.

The couple recorded an apology video, which can only be described as incredibly somber. The video was posted on Facebook by Australian politician Barnaby Joyce, who initially threatened to have the dogs euthanized. Joyce’s comments turned the case into a worldwide media sensation.”*

The couple, who are not thought to have signed a pre-nup, have been married for 15 months, having tied the knot in February 2015.
According to TMZ, their separation date is listed as Sunday May 22 in divorce documents, two days after Johnny’s mum sadly passed away.

The site reports that Amber filed the divorce petition on Monday, citing irreconcilable differences and asking for spousal support.

It’s claimed that Johnny has since filed a response through his lawyer, Laura Wasser, asking that the judge rejects Amber’s request for spousal support.
The couple, who do not have children together, met whilst working on Johnny’s ‘The Rum Diary’ and tied the knot in a small civil ceremony in Los Angeles.

More recently, they found themselves in the spotlight for their awkward ‘apology’ to Australia after Amber allegedly illegally brought their dogs into the country.

Johnny was previously in a relationship with Vanessa Paradis. The couple have children Lily-Ross and Jack together.

This week, we're kicking off our latest season with the wonderful Dr Amber Lee!🦜🦩 

We discuss how she built her career as an avian/exotics specialist and the differences between working with exotics in the USA and Australia. We also discuss the difficulties the veterinary profession has faced during 2020, both with coronavirus and the Australian wildfires. Amber shares some fantastic insight and advice about using mindfulness to improve your emotional wellbeing. 

Amber graduated from the University of Melbourne in 2010 and worked in small animal practice before moving to Indianapolis, in the USA, to undertake a 1-year rotating internship. From here, she completed an ABVP (American Board of Veterinary Practitioners) Avian medicine residency at the Avian and Exotic Animal Clinic of Indianapolis. Shortly after finishing her residency, she moved to Boston to work in private practice. In 2017, she passed her Avian Board exams through ABVP. 

In 2018, she launched her website and social media platforms, teaching and training nurses, veterinarians and clients worldwide! She is also the co-chair for the social media committee for the Association of Avian Veterinarians (AAV), managing their Instagram page and working closely with the other committees to spread awareness of the work of the organisation.

At the end of 2020, she moved back home to Melbourne to be closer to family and friends. She is now working in private practice in Melbourne, seeing a wide range of birds and exotic pets and wildlife.  You may be familiar with some of her work on social media - she is passionate about educating clients about exotic animal husbandry through her website, Facebook and Instagram pages. If not, check them out!'

Shortly after finishing her residency, she moved to Boston to work in private practice. In 2017, she passed her Avian Board exams through ABVP. 

In 2018, she launched her website and social media platforms, teaching and training nurses, veterinarians and clients worldwide! She is also the co-chair for the social media committee for the Association of Avian Veterinarians (AAV), managing their Instagram page and working closely with the other committees to spread awareness of the work of the organisation.

At the end of 2020, she moved back home to Melbourne to be closer to family and friends. She is now working in private practice in Melbourne, seeing a wide range of birds and exotic pets and wildlife.  You may be familiar with some of her work on social media - she is passionate about educating clients about exotic animal husbandry through her website, Facebook and Instagram pages.

Actress Amber Heard appears set to return to Australia's Gold Coast to star in the DC Comics blockbuster movie ""Aquaman"" a year after she was convicted in the same tourist town of smuggling her pet Yorkshire terriers Pistol and Boo into the country.
The movie which will also feature ""Game of Thrones"" television star Jason Momoa in the lead role will be shot next year at Village Roadshow Studios near Gold Coast city in a deal that will cost the Australian government 22 million Australian dollars ($16 million), Treasurer Scott Morrison said Thursday.
Heard, 30, pleaded guilty in a Gold Coast court in April to falsifying an immigration document to conceal the dogs when she and her then husband Johnny Depp flew into Australia in 2014 for the filming of the latest ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" movie in which Depp played pirate Jack Sparrow.
She avoided jail under a deal that included Heard and Depp videoing an awkward public warning against others breaking Australia's strict quarantine laws.
Morrison said Thursday that a ""miniature motor home"" would be provided for Pistol and Boo if Heard decided to bring them back through the proper quarantine channels.
""We will have a home for them if Amber would like to bring them on to the film set,"" Morrison told reporters.
The scandal over the dogs was lampooned as Australia's ""war on terriers"" and unleashed personal hostility between Depp and Agriculture Minister Barnaby Joyce.
Joyce, who is now Australia's deputy prime minister, prompted countless parodies by stating: ""It's time that Pistol and Boo buggered off back to the United States."" He then warned that the dogs would be euthanized if they didn't flee the country within 72 hours, which they did with only a few hours to spare.
Depp quipped that ruddy-faced Joyce appeared to be ""inbred with a tomato"" and voiced fears that ""he might explode.""
Morrison said on Thursday that he was not concerned by how Joyce might react to Pistol and Boo returning.
""No, everyone knows the rules. Those rules apply to everybody as they did last time,"" Morrison said.

Australia has very strict biosecurity laws to protect the health of our people, animals and plants. Everyone entering the country must truthfully declare if they are carrying any items listed on the Incoming Passenger Card.

Ms Amber Heard appeared in the Southport Magistrates Court in Queensland on 18 April 2016 to answer charges alleging the illegal importation of her two dogs into Australia in April 2015.

Ms Heard pleaded guilty to one count of producing a false document (her Incoming Passenger Card).

Ms Heard also offered to publicly state her contrition with the support of her husband – this video is that statement.

The 29-year-old actress plead guilty in court on Monday (April 18) for bringing the couple’s two dogs into Australia last year with a false immigration document and without going through the required 10 day quarantine period.

The charges were dropped by prosecutors, but Amber could have been sent to prison for up to 10 years for the crime.

Amber and Johnny filmed the apology video and it was played during the hearing on Monday.

“Australia is a wonderful island with a treasure trove of unique plants, animals and people,” Amber says in the clip. “Australia is free of many pests and diseases that are commonplace around the world. That is why Australia has to have such strong biosecurity laws.”

“Australians are just as unique, both warm and direct. When you disrespect Australian law, they will tell your firmly,” Johnny adds. “Declare everything when you enter Australia.”

Johnny Depp cut off the tip off his finger in March 2015, according to estranged wife Amber Heard, then dipped the stump in blue paint and wrote a violent message on his mirror in a fit of rage while staying at a villa in Australia.
Johnny and Amber were allegedly in a brutal fight at the time, when he accused her of cheating on him with someone named “Billy Bob”; he wrote the man’s name on the wall and mirror in a mixture of blood and paint, as well as the words “easy Amber.”


The graphic photos are more evidence for Amber’s domestic violence case against her soon-to-be ex-husband. She claims that during their stay at the villa, Johnny became extremely drunk and high on cocaine. Johnny allegedly cut off the tip of his finger after smashing bottles and windows, slicing himself on one of the glass shards.
The “Billy Bob” message is interesting. In 2015, Amber starred in a film with Billy Bob Thornton, and she claims that Johnny accuses her of sleeping with the actor during filming. She denies this, as well as his other alleged claims that she cheated on him with other men.
As for the fact that Johnny noticeably isn’t missing any fingers, that’s because the digit was able to be saved. Johnny allegedly waited over 24 hours to get medical help, so his fingertip couldn’t be saved, but doctors used skin from his hand to sew a new one. Clever!

This is just another shocking, scary twist in Johnny and Amber’s divorce case. Amber has repeatedly stated that Johnny abused her, and now she’s coming out with alleged evidence, including these videos, and that frightening video of Johnny smashing bottles.
