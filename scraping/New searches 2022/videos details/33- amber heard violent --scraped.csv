Johnny Depp, un tacle d’Amber Heard qui veut détruire sa carrière
Amber Heard semble très mobilisée pour détruire la carrière de Johnny Depp, sur lequel elle a balancé sur Instagram, en laissant ainsi entendre que celui-ci a été violent avec elle durant leur relation qui aura duré quatre ans.


La jolie blonde s’est en effet emparée de sa page Instagram pour dénoncer l’attitude des
studios «Warner Bros» qui ont défendu l’acteur hollywoodien en le maintenant au casting d’Animaux Fantastiques.
Dans un communiqué, la production expliquait, en parlant des accusations de violences conjugales portées contre l’ex chéri de Vanessa Paradis qu’il « n’y a jamais eu d’intention de préjudice physique ou émotionne».

Amber Heard est sortie de ses gonds pour dénoncer cette formule.

«Pour être précis, c’était notre déclaration commune COMPLETE. Choisir certaines lignes et les citer en dehors de leur contexte n’est pas juste. Mesdames, continuez à vous lever et à rester fortes. Love. Amber», a-t-elle lancé. #Halk_Tarjel #Zapping_TV_2018 #Zapping_TV

 The 'Aquaman' actress denies the allegations made by her ex-husband in court documents, which the actor filed as part of his libel lawsuit against The Sun.  Aug 2, 2018   AceShowbiz -  An attorney for Amber Heard has denied claims she hit her ex-husband Johnny Depp twice in the face for being late to a party.   The allegation emerged as part of the Hollywood actor's libel lawsuit against British newspaper The Sun, who he is suing for running a story in April which claimed he is a ""wife-beater"" and criticised his casting in Harry Potter spin-off Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald.     In court documents obtained by British publication The Mirror, the star's legal team claimed that Amber became upset after her then-husband turned up two hours late to her birthday party in April 2016, and went on to become ""aggressive and violent"" after guests left, ""punching him twice in the face"". His lawyers also claimed that the actress had been drinking and had to be pushed away by the Pirates of the Caribbean star to stop the alleged abuse.   ""These allegations are totally false,"" Amber's attorney told The Mirror. ""One needs only read the recent Rolling Stone article about Mr Depp and the lawsuit filed against him by a location manager, among many other recent news stories and lawsuits, to understand his state of mind.""   Her attorney was referring to a recent interview the 55-year-old gave to the music magazine where he detailed his drinking, depression and dwindling fortune, and claims by location manager Gregg 'Rocky' Brooks that Johnny became violent after he informed the actor that he only had one more chance to shoot a scene in Los Angeles in April 2017.   Amber and Johnny, who met while filming The Rum Diary together in 2011, finalised their divorce in January 2017 after a two-year marriage.

Amber Heard arrived at the High Court in London Thursday (23 JULY 2020) for the fourth and final day of her testimony in Johnny Depp's High Court libel case against The Sun over allegations of domestic violence.
Depp, 57, is suing The Sun’s publisher, News Group Newspapers, and the paper’s executive editor, Dan Wootton, over the article. The Hollywood star strongly denies abusing Heard, and claimed in court that she had been violent to him.
On Wednesday, Heard alleged that ex-husband Depp threw ""30 or so bottles"" at her as if they were “grenades or bombs” during a drunken and frenzied assault in Australia in March 2015 that also saw him accidentally sever part of his finger.
Taking the witness box, the actress refuted his allegation that it was she who lost her temper and that she had injured him.
Heard has described her stay in Australia with Depp as akin to a “three-day hostage situation,"" during which Depp was “completely out of his mind and out of control” following a binge on drugs and alcohol. Heard has said that she feared for her life while at the rented property on Australia's Gold Coast during a visit while Depp was filming the latest “Pirates of the Caribbean” film. 
The incident is central to The Sun’s labeling of Depp in an April 2018 article as a “wife-beater.” The Sun’s defense relies on 14 allegations made by Heard of violence by Depp between 2013 and 2016, in settings as varied as the rented house in Australia, his private island in the Bahamas and a private jet. 
Depp, 57, denies abusing Heard and claims she was the aggressor during their tempestuous relationship. He was present once again to hear Heard’s testimony. He is suing The Sun’s publisher, News Group Newspapers, and its executive editor, Dan Wootton, over the article. 
Depp and Heard met on the set of the film “The Rum Diary,” released in 2011. They married in Los Angeles in February 2015. Heard filed for divorce the following year, and it was finalized in 2017.

✍   « Laissez la justice faire son travail ». C’est en substance le message qu’a adressé le juge du comté de Fairfax, en Virginie, à Johnny Depp. L’acteur réclamait en effet que la demande reconventionnelle d'   Amber Heard, de 100 millions de dollars, formulée en réponse à son procès en diffamation (pour lequel il lui réclame 50 millions), soit rejetée. La star d’Aquaman attaque en effet son ex-mari également en diffamation pour avoir affirmé qu’elle avait menti en évoquant les violences conjugales – la base de la plainte initiale.   Pour demander l’annulation de la plainte d’Amber Heard, Johnny Depp a évoqué la loi anti-SLAPP (Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation), adoptée récemment dans l’Etat. Cette loi a pour objectif de mettre fin à certaines actions en justice qui empêchent de parler de sujets d’intérêt public.

The American actor, 57, is suing News Group Newspapers (NGN), publisher of The Sun, for an article they ran in 2018 branding the star ""a wife beater"" – an allegation he strenuously denies.  During the third week of the libel case, Heard and her sister Whitney Henriquez gave evidence against Depp who they claimed was violent towards Heard on numerous occasions.  According to Deadline.com, during the hearing on Friday, Depp's barrister David Sherborne told the court they had received a clip from a ""confidential source"" on Thursday night after Henriquez gave evidence earlier in the day, stating her sibling had never attacked her.   Read More Related Articles  Read More Related Articles    Henrique gave evidence, claiming she saw Depp punch Heard “really hard in the head … multiple times” in Los Angeles in March 2015.  Henriquez said that Heard punched Depp on that occasion, but only did so ""in my defence"" because she claimed her sister thought Depp was going to push her down the stairs.    Sherborne then claimed to the court that Henriquez had ""tailored"" her evidence ""to meet her sister’s evidence"".

Depp is suing News Group Newspapers, publisher of The Sun, and the paper’s executive editor, Dan Wootton, over an April 2018 article that called him a “wife-beater.”
He strongly denies abusing Heard.
Heard, 34, has made 14 allegations of violence by 57-year-old Depp between 2013 and 2016, in settings including his private island in the Bahamas, a rented house in Australia and a private jet.
He denies them all.
During Wednesday's hearings, Heard's former personal assistant claimed that she told the model-actress about a violent sexual assault she had endured, only for Heard to “twist"" the story for her own use.
Kate James, who worked for Heard between 2012 and 2015, gave evidence in support of Depp, and said she had told Heard that she was raped at machete-point in Brazil about 25 years ago.
She said she was shocked to learn that in a witness statement, Heard misrepresented and exploited the incident.
“She referred directly to a violent rape that occurred to me 26 years ago and she twisted it into her own story and she used it for her own use,"" James said by video link from Los Angeles.
Heard is due to give evidence in the case later this week.

The Associated Press reports that on Thursday, the 32-year-old “Aquaman” actress asked a Virginia judge to dismiss a $50 million defamation lawsuit her 55-year-old ex-husband filed over an op-ed she wrote about domestic violence for The Washington Post in December 2018. 
In the motion filed in the Circuit Court of Fairfax, Virginia, Heard goes into harrowing detail about more than a dozen alleged incidents before and during their rocky one-year marriage in which she claims the actor was high on drugs or alcohol, became “the Monster” and punched, slapped, kicked, spat on and choked her. There are also details about Depp allegedly head-butting Heard and pulling her hair so hard that chunks of her scalp came out. 
Depp has denied the abuse, and the allegations have appeared in the couple’s divorce and other court documents. HuffPost has reached out to Depp’s publicist for comment.

Johnny Depp and Amber Heard attend at the Grammy Awards in 2016. 
In the court papers obtained by the New York Post’s Page Six, Heard claims that Depp’s substance abuse issues would trigger a personality they both referred to as “the Monster,” like on a morning in May 2014 in which the couple, who were dating at the time, traveled from Boston to Los Angeles on a private jet: 
On the flight, Johnny ordered the flight attendants to give him an oxygen tank, and drank heavily. Johnny’s handlers told me that he was upset that I was filming a movie with a romantic scene with James Franco the day before. Soon, Johnny began to throw objects at me. Instead of reacting to his behavior, I simply moved seats. That didn’t stop him. He provocatively pushed a chair at me as I walked by, yelled at me, and taunted me by yelling out the name “James Franco.” 
Heard states that at one point during the flight, she stood up and Depp kicked her in the back. She says she fell to the floor, Depp threw a boot at her and continued to insult her until he went to the bathroom and passed out inside. 
Heard also elaborated on an incident she said occurred a month after their February 2015 marriage, in which Depp, who was supposed to be clean, went on a sleepless, three-day ecstasy bender in Australia: 
Johnny told me that I had not explicitly forbidden him from taking ecstasy. The argument heated up, and Johnny pushed me, slapped me, and shoved me to the ground before I retreated to a locked bedroom. 
Heard then goes into explicit detail about the abuse she said she endured during those three days, alleging she was hit, shoved and choked numerous more times. During their fights, Heard said Depp “shoved me into a ping pong table that collapsed underneath me,” threw bottles of alcohol at her and through the window, breaking panels, and at one point pulled off her nightgown. “I was naked and b",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Q0aLar_Z0Sc/default.jpg,120,90,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Q0aLar_Z0Sc/mqdefault.jpg,320,180,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Q0aLar_Z0Sc/hqdefault.jpg,480,360,News two,"['domestic abuse', 'abuse', 'Johnny Depp', 'Amber Heard']",20,none,Amber Heard Details 'Horrific' Abuse By 'Monster’ Johnny Depp In Response To Lawsuit,"Actress Amber Heard has submitted a graphic new court filing that details horrifying allegations of abuse she says she endured during her relationship to actor Johnny Depp.

He provocatively pushed a chair at me as I walked by, yelled at me, and taunted me by yelling out the name “James Franco.” 
Heard states that at one point during the flight, she stood up and Depp kicked her in the back. She says she fell to the floor, Depp threw a boot at her and continued to insult her until he went to the bathroom and passed out inside. 
Heard also elaborated on an incident she said occurred a month after their February 2015 marriage, in which Depp, who was supposed to be clean, went on a sleepless, three-day ecstasy bender in Australia: 
Johnny told me that I had not explicitly forbidden him from taking ecstasy. The argument heated up, and Johnny pushed me, slapped me, and shoved me to the ground before I retreated to a locked bedroom. 
Heard then goes into explicit detail about the abuse she said she endured during those three days, alleging she was hit, shoved and choked numerous more times. During their fights, Heard said Depp “shoved me into a ping pong table that collapsed underneath me,” threw bottles of alcohol at her and through the window, breaking panels, and at one point pulled off her nightgown. “I was naked and b",PT2M41S,2d,hd,true,False,rectangular,processed,public,youtube,True,True,False,51,0,0,9,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Q0aLar_Z0Sc/sddefault.jpg,640.0,480.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Q0aLar_Z0Sc/maxresdefault.jpg,1280.0,720.0,,,

A British judge will rule next Monday on whether Johnny Depp was libelled by a tabloid newspaper that branded him a wife-beater — an accusation his lawyer called a ""reputation-destroying, career-ending"" false allegation.
Judge Andrew Nicol will deliver his verdict in writing on November 2, without a hearing at the High Court, where Depp and his ex-wife Amber Heard had a dramatic three-week legal showdown in July.
The case, with its accusations of drug abuse, emotional turmoil and drunken fights, cast a stark light on the private lives of the celebrity couple, who met on the set of 2011 comedy ""The Rum Diary"" and married in Los Angeles in 2015.  They separated the following year and divorced in 2017.
Media lawyer Mark Stephens told The Associated Press that both parties are going to lose in  this case as the reputations of both Depp and Heard are damaged.
""The lawyers were the winners in this case.  They walk away.  They'll be putting their kids through private education for years to come.  But actually, the reputations of both Johnny Depp and Amber Heard are tarnished irrevocably and I think that it's going to persist because whoever wins in this case, the way in which this case was presented, the issues that came up, particularly around gendered presentation of the case, I think that's going to be studied for years to come.  So when you go to look at the law books or your sociological books or any of those other gender studies books, they're going to be looking at Depp versus The Sun and Amber Heard to see how it is done or how it shouldn't be done.""
""Pirates of the Caribbean"" star Depp sued News Group Newspapers, publisher of The Sun, and the newspaper's executive editor, Dan Wootton, over an April 2018 article that accused him of assaulting Heard.
Over several days in the witness box, Depp, 57, branded the allegations a ""hoax"" and claimed Heard was the aggressor during their volatile relationship.
""He has never hit a woman in his entire life — period, full stop, nada,"" Depp's lawyer David Sherborne said in closing arguments.
Heard, 34, testified as the main witness for the defense, saying Depp turned violent under the influence of alcohol and drugs.  She alleged 14 separate incidents between 2013 and 2016 in which he hit, slapped and shoved her, pulled her hair and threw bottles at her ""like grenades.""
""I didn't want to do this, I did not want to expose this totality of what really happened to me,"" Heard said in court.  ""I didn't want to talk about everything that happened in our marriage and happened in our relationship.""
The Sun's lawyer, Sasha Wass, said in her summing up that there was no doubt Depp ""regularly and systematically abused his wife.""
But Depp's lawyers accused Heard of fabricating evidence, calling her an unreliable witness and ""a compulsive liar.""
Whichever way the judge rules, it's unlikely to be the end of the legal drama.  Depp is also suing Heard for $50 million in Virginia over a Washington Post story about domestic violence.  The trial is due to be held next year.
Stephens is a media lawyer at the firm Howard Kennedy.

Mr Depp, 57, is suing the publisher of the Sun newspaper over an article that referred to him as a ""wife beater"".

Giving evidence, Mr Depp agreed he had ""fallen off the wagon"" at the time of the alleged incident but said it was ""patently untrue"" he had hit Ms Heard.

The Sun has defended the accuracy of the 2018 article.

It had referred to ""overwhelming evidence"" that Mr Depp attacked Ms Heard, 34, during their relationship - which he strenuously denies.

The Hollywood actor's action is against the publisher of the Sun - News Group Newspapers (NGN) - and executive editor Dan Wootton.

Ms Heard claims that Mr Depp first hit her in early 2013 - one of 14 separate allegations of domestic violence, all denied by Mr Depp, which are being relied on by NGN in their defence.

NGN's lawyer Sasha Wass QC asked Mr Depp about an alleged incident in March 2013 involving Mr Depp's tattoo which reads ""Wino Forever"".

It had originally said ""Winona Forever"" in reference to his relationship with actress Winona Ryder, but he had changed it when they split in 1993.

Ms Wass said Ms Heard had made a joke out of the tattoo at a time when he was drinking heavily after about 160 days of sobriety.

Mr Depp replied: ""I don't recall any conversation.""

Ms Wass said the actor then slapped his ex-wife across the face. She added: ""You slapped her more than once, because after you slapped her the first time, she didn't react, she just eyeballed you, she just stared at you, and that made you more angry and you slapped her again.""

Mr Depp answered: ""That is patently untrue."" When he was told he had slapped her three times in total, Mr Depp said: ""I'm sorry but that is not true, you are mistaken.""

The barrister then put it to Mr Depp that he ""broke down"" after coming to his senses and realising what he had done, to which he said: ""I didn't hit Ms Heard.""

The second day of Mr Depp's cross-examination had begun with the actor being asked whether he was taking cocaine in March 2013.

Mr Depp replied that it was ""difficult to recollect if I was taking cocaine in March 2013... it's possible"".

The court heard about another alleged incident that month when Ms Heard claims Mr Depp hit her several times after an argument about a painting by her ex-partner, Tasya van Ree, which was hanging in her LA home.

Ms Wass read out part of Mr Depp's witness statement in which he said he had asked Ms Heard to remove the painting ""as a courtesy"" to him.

He said she hadn't taken it down it but denied allegations put to him by Ms Wass that he tried to remove the painting and to set fire to it, saying each time they were ""not true"".

Mr Depp was also asked whether he would describe himself as jealous. He responded: ""I am, yes. I can be jealous.""

An email written by Ms Heard to Mr Depp, which she never sent to him, was read out in court.

Ms Heard wrote that she didn't know ""if I can do this anymore"", saying it was like ""Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde"" - ""half of you I love madly, and the other half scares me"".

It went on: ""The problem is, I never really know/understand which one I'm dealing with until it's too late. The drinking assures me that I am dealing with the monster.""

The court heard Mr Depp describe Ms Heard's allegations that he was a serial domestic abuser as ""a hoax"" as they were all ""patently untrue"".

Mr Depp added that from all the evidence he had seen, Ms Heard appeared to be ""building a dossier very early on that appears to be an insurance policy for later"".

On the first day of the libel case the court heard that Mr Depp denied being violent towards his ex-wife and accused Ms Heard of being violent towards him.

NGN previously tried to have the case thrown out, but Mr Justice Nicol ruled last week the case could go ahead.

The case arose out of the publication of an article on the Sun's website headlined: ""Gone Potty: How can JK Rowling be 'genuinely happy' casting wife beater Johnny Depp in the new Fantastic Beasts film?""

The Sun's original article related to allegations made by the actress, who was married to the Pirates of the Caribbean star from 2015 to 2017.

Witnesses including Mr Depp's former partners Vanessa Paradis and Winona Ryder are expected to give evidence via video link, and the hearing is expected to last for three weeks.

Mr Depp, has been Oscar and Bafta-nominated and won a Golden Globe in 2008 for Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street.

Depp, giving evidence in his libel trial against Britain's Sun newspaper over an article describing him as a ""wife beater"", denied he had attacked Heard, accusing her of being the aggressor whom he tried to placate.

During the first two days of what is expected to be a three-week case, the court has heard evidence about Depp's heavy drinking and drug use and about his relationship with Heard whom he married in 2015. She filed for divorce 15 months later.

On Wednesday, the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" actor was accused of abusing Heard on a flight from Boston to Los Angeles following a row over Franco, who appeared with her in the film ""The Adderall Diaries"".

The court heard an 18 second audio clip of a person groaning, which Sasha Wass, lawyer for the Sun put to Depp was him in the recording during the flight from Boston to Los Angeles.

Depp told the court he was ""drawing art sketches"" in a notebook during the flight.

Depp said he was surprised Heard had agreed to make the film with Franco, having previously described him as ""creepy"" for making aggressive sexual advances towards her.

On the flight, Depp screamed obscenities at Heard, said she liked having sex on film sets and called her a ""go-getter slut and a whore"", said Wass.

In a ""blind rage"", he kicked her in the back as she tried to walk away from him and slapped her across the face, Wass said.

Depp denied the accusations.

The court also heard the first alleged incident of violence took place at Heard's home in March 2013 when Depp had ""fallen off the wagon"" and started drinking again after months of sobriety.

Wass said Depp had become angry when Heard mocked one of his tattoos which he had changed from ""Winona forever"" - a reference to his former girlfriend Winona Ryder - to ""Wino forever"" and slapped her three times.

""That's not the case, that's untrue. It didn't happen,"" Depp said. ""I don't recall any argument about any of my tattoos.""

The court was shown a photograph of Heard with what appears to be a bruise on her upper arm, which the court was told was during an in incident in March 2013.

American model-actress Amber Heard and ex-husband Johnny Depp could be seen separately leaving London's High Court on Wednesday (15 JULY 2020) after another day of Depp's libel trial against a British tabloid newspaper that accused him of abusing Heard during their relationship.
Depp is suing News Group Newspapers, publisher of The Sun, and the paper’s executive editor, Dan Wootton, over an April 2018 article that called him a “wife-beater.”
He strongly denies abusing Heard.
Heard, 34, has made 14 allegations of violence by 57-year-old Depp between 2013 and 2016, in settings including his private island in the Bahamas, a rented house in Australia and a private jet.
He denies them all.
During Wednesday's hearings, Heard's former personal assistant claimed that she told the model-actress about a violent sexual assault she had endured, only for Heard to “twist"" the story for her own use.
Kate James, who worked for Heard between 2012 and 2015, gave evidence in support of Depp, and said she had told Heard that she was raped at machete-point in Brazil about 25 years ago.
She said she was shocked to learn that in a witness statement, Heard misrepresented and exploited the incident.
“She referred directly to a violent rape that occurred to me 26 years ago and she twisted it into her own story and she used it for her own use,"" James said by video link from Los Angeles.
Heard is due to give evidence in the case later this week.

One of the charities has a particular focus to help stop violence against women 
 Amber Heard is donating the full $7million Johnny Depp divorce settlement to charity.

Earlier this week, Johnny Depp agreed to pay his estranged wife the huge sum of money just one day before they were due to battle it out in court.

On Thursday, a statement from the actress said the money ""played no role"" to her and she will be donating the entire sum equally between two charities.

One of the charities is the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which she says has a particular focus to stop violence against women, and the other is Children’s Hospital of Los Angeles where she worked as a volunteer for the past 10 years.

The statement said: ""As described in the restraining order and divorce settlement, money played no role for me personally and never has, except to the extent that I could donate it to charity and, in doing so, hopefully help those less able to defend themselves.
As reported in the media, the amount received in the divorce was $7 million and $7 million is being donated. This is over and above any funds that I have given away in the past and will continue to give away in the future.""

The statement finished: ""I know these organizations will put the funds to good use and look forward to continuing to support them in the future. Hopefully, this experience results in a positive change in the lives of people who need it the most.
Legal documents were filed on Tuesday in which the Rum Dairy actress withdrew her request for a restraining order.

Johnny and Amber split in May and the actress was granted a restraining order after accusing him of domestic abuse.

Amber alleged Johnny threw a phone at her during an argument and insisted there were other instances where he had been violent towards her but she filed court papers to dismiss her domestic violence case against the actor once they agreed on the settlement.
The insider added: ""Initially, being the stubborn people they are, they both didn't want to give in to each other's requests. For a long time, Amber lived with a lot of hurt and had been deeply affected by Johnny's behaviour, but chose not to say anything. Whenever something would happen, he'd apologise, and they'd move on. Johnny never wanted the world to know any of this.""

Amber, 30 and Johnny, 53, said in a joint statement: ""Our relationship was intensely passionate and at times volatile, but always bound by love. Neither party has made false accusations for financial gain.

""There was never any intent of physical or emotional harm. Amber wishes the best for Johnny in the future. Amber will be donating financial proceeds from the divorce to a charity.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tF7ACFclzIE/default.jpg,120,90,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tF7ACFclzIE/mqdefault.jpg,320,180,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tF7ACFclzIE/hqdefault.jpg,480,360,armelia rafita,"['Amber', 'Heard', 'Reveals', 'The', 'Two', 'Charities', 'To', 'Which', ""She'll"", 'Donate', 'Full', '$7m', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Settlement']",25,none,Amber Heard Reveals The Two Charities To Which She'll Donate Full $7m Johnny Depp Settlement,"Amber Heard reveals the two charities to which she'll donate FULL $7m Johnny Depp settlement

The saga of the domestic violence accusations against Johnny Depp by wife Amber Heard reveals just how bias we all are and how our bias affects the way we interpret reality and even deny the facts before our very eyes. In psychology, this is referred to as bias confirmation which simply infers ignoring some of the facts and looking for confirmation of our preconceived ideas.

Actress Amber Heard was married to Johnny Depp for 15 months before filing for divorce. She then filed, and was granted by a judge, a temporary restraining order against Depp alleging repeated physical and verbal abuse.

Heard claims that Depp has been physically and psychologically abusive to her for years, and she claims that he hit her with a cell phone and had not reported prior abuse to protect him and his career.

Amber Heard is 23 years younger than Johnny Depp.

Amber Heard is viewed as a gold digger, someone who is making up these stories as a way to get a better divorce settlement including monthly payments of around $50,000.00

Depp is viewed as a loveable, affable, charming all-round good guy who entertains us and makes us laugh with his on-screen characters such as the endearing, Captain Jack Sparrow. We have known, loved and admired Depp for decades. We also conduct parasocial relationships with celebrities such as Depp – we falsely believe we actually know him, who he is and how he thinks and behaves. We also feel a sense of ownership and identify with the celebrity, particularly if he/she is our idol and we associate good memories & emotions with them. Remember, many people did the same thing with Bill Cosby believing that every woman who accused him was just a lying gold digger until so many women came out with accusations and stories that it was impossible to discount every single claim as a lie and now Cosby stands trial for sexual assault criminal charges.

The new Discovery+ documentary series Johnny vs Amber will look at the breakdown of Johnny Depp and Amber Heard’s two-year marriage — and the messy legal battle that followed.
The Pirates of the Caribbean star and Aquaman actress were married in February 2015 and confirmed their split in May 2016. 
After filing for divorce later that month, Heard filed a domestic violence restraining order against Depp and brought photographic evidence of the alleged abuse she suffered.
Three years later, the Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald actor “vehemently” denied ever being violent with his ex-wife in court documents. 
He subsequently accused her of domestic violence as well.
Johnny vs Amber will delve into what went wrong between the former pair by focusing on both sides of the story. 
The first part will “introduce Depp’s side, how he felt he was married to a Machiavellian liar who would stop at nothing to protect her image, before Heard’s episode explains how the actress married the man of her dreams only to see him turn into a violent drug-fueled monster,” according to Discovery.

He claimed he doesn’t even remember her making fun of it.    Johnny Depp vehemently denied during the second day of his trial in London that he “slapped” ex-wife Amber Heard, 34, when she was allegedly mocking his tattoo. A lawyer for The Sun, the British paper Depp is suing for libel, told the court that the Pirates of the Caribbean star, 57, allegedly assaulted his then-girlfriend in 2013 after she joked about him having “wino forever” ink while falling off the wagon.  Sasha Wass, The Sun‘s lawyer, claimed that “Ms. Heard laughed at that tattoo. You were in fact acting like a wino and an alcoholic and felt very sensitive.” Depp said he did not recall Heard joking about his tattoo, and did not slap her. Depp admitted that he had a problem with alcohol and drugs. “I was dispirited, after 160 days or so I had broken my sobriety,” the actor told the court.      Wass pressed forward, saying to the Edward Scissorhands star, according to The Guardian, “You then slapped Ms. Heard across the face and that was the first time it happened.” Depp allegedly slapped heard a total of three times, Wass argued, because the actress had stared at him with no reaction. Depp responded with, “It’s not true. It didn’t happen… I didn’t hit her.”  Depp famously had a tattoo altered on his right shoulder when he and fiancée, fellow Tim Burton darling Winona Ryder, split in 1993. What used to be “winona forever” is now “wino forever.” The actor also had a tattoo for Heard. After his wife of two years accused him of domestic violence, he got it redone. What used to be “Slim” across his fingers now reads “Scum.”  Ryder will appear virtually during the three-week trial, along with Depp’s ex-partner Vanessa Paradis. Both women have denied that Depp was ever violent during their relationships. Ryder wrote in a previous statement that “I obviously was not there during his marriage to Amber… The idea that he is an incredibly violent person is the farthest thing from the Johnny I knew and loved. I cannot wrap my head around these accusations.”   This wasn’t the only shocking claim to come out of the first two days of the trial. Depp claimed that Heard, or “possibly one of her friends,” defecated in their bed during an unspecified night. The alleged incident was the final straw that led to him wanting a divorce. Heard is expected to speak to the court at a later date in the coming weeks.  Depp is suing The Sun‘s parent company News Group Newspapers (NGN) and the paper’s executive editor Dan Wootton over an April 2018 article. Wootton called Depp a “wife beater” and claimed that there was “overwhelming evidence” that he abused Heard during their relationship.

All of you DC fans must be aware, the release of Justice League movies in the past, was quite a huge disappointment! Yes, it in fact was so awful, that the future of Aquaman to be released the following year, seemed quite bleak too. 

But Aquaman hit the theatres with a bang and brought in a whopping 1.148 billion US Dollars. That was quite a comeback for DC!

But why was the movie so successful?

The DC comics of Aquaman, are considered by many not to be quite exciting as the rest of the DC world. Due to this, most of the credit was given to the actors who brought the movie to life. The two leads, Jason Momoa and Amber Heard were given high praise for their performance, leading to the success of the movie. 

Due to its victory in the first weekend, an official report was released by Warner Bros. that there will be an Aquaman 2 in 2022. This was great news for the fans but what we weren't aware of was that Amber Heard’s personal life would blow up and affect the fate of the sequel. 

What did Amber do that caused a holistic rut?

Amber Heard is known for her gorgeous looks, which many people may substitute for innocence. This perception played to be false ever since she filed for divorce in 2016. She was married to Johnny Depp and had filed a divorce from him stating he was a threat to her life and was constantly involved in physically abusing her.

The evidence was quite nasty indeed. It involved audiotape leaks proving her violent side, of her physically assaulting Johnny Depp by severing his finger with a broken Vodka bottle and even at one time, faking bruises and scars which even her neighbors claimed not to be true.

What did poor broken Johnny do about this?

He kept on the low and silent for a while, all for her good. But when she crossed her limits he brought out the 50 million dollar lawsuit against her which had solid evidence that he was in the right and she was clearly in the wrong. injustice

Johnny, a notable actor who has been a blessing to the film industry for decades together was getting fired from some of the major roles he was cast in, such as Pirates of the Caribbean and even Warner Bros, Fantastic Beasts, due to Amber Heard’s claims. He had hit rock bottom. All this was thanks to Amber Heard.

The public was seeing this injustice and wasn’t liking it at all. Just like many of today’s problems are solved, a petition to safeguard Johnny’s innocence was started by the fans getting almost enormous 1.8 million! That’s almost reaching up to the 2 million mark.

What will happen to Amber Heard now?

Mera, the role she played in Aquaman suited her quite well but fans are very keen on her being entirely replaced by another actress who pretty much fits just right in. Any guesses on who that actress could be? Yes, indeed. It is Emilia Clarke. 

Emilia Clarke has acted with Jason Momoa in the past and the performance they did was nothing less than magnificent. Due to their performance on Game of Thrones, fans are keen on seeing this duo working together again. 

What happens to Amber Heard’s now?

Only in 2020 when some dirty secrets of their marriage and her personality were out, did the concerns of her being a part of Aquaman 2 arise. Everyone wanted her to face the same fate Johnny did. They didn’t want her cast and she surely did not like that! The opportunities are just opening up in big movies such as Star Wars: Rogue Squadron, Rangers of the Republic, and Ashoka Tano to name a few.  

All the mentioned openings that were mentioned were from Disney. 

But would Disney sanction her appearance in these movies?

Disney quite blatantly denied Johnny Depp when the allegations against him were out in the open due to the Me Too movement. This caused him to lose his famous role of Jack Sparrow which he has been playing for nearly 2 decades. If he can lose a movie with that history, Amber Heard being kicked out from Aquaman 2 is nothing!

Disney is known for taking its stance on justice and has also been known to cast out various of their showstoppers for matters even smaller than the situation between Depp and Amber. The famous American film director, James Gunn, was fired by Disney too. The Guardians of the Galaxy 3 Director was fired for some of the tweets he had posted during his amateur directing days which cost him his career quite a bitclevver news  johnny depp amber heard amber heard aquaman 2
