** Johnny Depp in Virginia court **
** Johnny Depp and Amber Heard **
** Johnny Depp Amber Heard case ***
** Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them 3 case **

Actor Johnny Depp has filed documents at the Fairfax Country, Virginia, court to delay the defamation trial against his ex-wife Amber Heard, so that he can proceed with filming for his role in ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them 3” in London
Depp sued Heard in March, 2019, over an op-ed piece she wrote for the Washington Post titled “I spoke up and faced our culture’s wrath. That has to change” where he is not named. Under Virginia law, where the Post is printed, plaintiffs can sue for defamation by inference.
The court’s current dates for the trial are Jan. 11 through Jan. 28, 2021. However, Warner Bros. is planning to commence principal photography for “Fantastic Beasts 3” from October in London and will finish only by the end of February 2021. Depp has requested the court to delay the hearing to a period between March and June, 2021.

Join us in today’s video as we show you Amber Heard Sentenced In Court After Shocking Details Surface… Johnny Depp today got his wish to have another delay in the start of the trial over his $50 million defamation lawsuit against Amber Heard, but not for the reasons he pitched.

In a hearing this morning in Fairfax County, Virginia, Circuit Court Chief Judge Bruce White pushed the trial back from January 11 next year to May 3, 2021. However, the latest postponement had nothing to do with Depp’s filming schedule for Warner Bros’ Fantastic Beasts 3. Be sure to watch the whole video for the full details about this and in addition, do us a favor and like the video and subscribe and turn on the notification bell. We’ll see you in the next video!

Online security has always been a hot topic, and it's only going to be more so as time goes on. With that in mind, there's never been a better time to look at how you're handling your online presence, specifically the passwords you use for site logins, be it a gaming site or commerce such as  Amazon.com.

To start with, people are known to use the same password across multiple sites because it's hard remembering all the site/password combinations. Or there's a similar reason.  Quite often, they use very simple passwords that are easily guessable. Passwords such as '123456' and 'password' are just plain horrible choices.  Dictionary-based passwords such as 'smellycat' are not much better.  They're way too obvious and lack any level of complexity that would prevent someone from cracking them. So this presents a huge security hole, one that could cause a lot of heartache, not to mention significant financial loss. And yes, this stuff really happens. Every single day!

This is where LastPass comes in. LastPass is a secure password manager that integrates with your favorite browser for the purpose of managing online sites and passwords. It stores those sites and passwords in an encrypted vault which you alone can access. All that's required of you is to remember one master password. And while you're at it, you really ought to make it a complex password, one with at least 8-characters, though longer is better. 

...because this password is the key to your online kingdom.  Oh, and you'd best not forget it because LastPass keeps no record of your password whatsoever. That's right.  There is no 'answer a secret question for a password reset' workaround.  And this is by design.  Your master password stays with you. When type it in, it works with the encryption algorithm to encrypt or decrypt your vault locally, i.e., the process takes place  right there on your computer.  Not online.   That means you never have to worry about someone at LastPass accessing your vault.  They wouldn't, of course, but more that that, they can't.  You alone hold that master password.

And what about credit card numbers and shipping information? Don't you dislike typing out all that stuff when making an online purchase?  LastPass has that covered there. Create a new Form Fill Profile to hold such personal information as name, address, gender, birthday, SSN, credit card number, bank account routing number, and any related notes you'd like, and LastPass safely stores this alongside your passwords in the vault.

LastPass offers free and paid subscription versions.  The subscription is dirt cheap at $12/year.  What do you gain?  Take a look at this comparison page, and you'll see that phone/mobile apps are one additional feature.  Yubikey support is another. Yubikey provides one a number of ways to implement multi-factor authentication which provides an extra layer of security for logging into LastPass when you're at less than ideal location such as a hotel, public library, or any open wi-fi.

Is it time to secure your online life?  You bet it is.  So head over to https://lastpass.com and get started by hitting the Download LastPass button and grabbing the installer.  Once you're done with installation and setup, take the LastPass Security Challenge.  That'll show you just where you stand with your own online password security, and what you can do to improve it.

You're going to love the ""...password manager that makes browsing easier and more secure.""

Amber Jackson was a free spirit. Her parents had passed away, and she had no children, save for her beloved two small dogs. Amber grew up in Fairfax, California, but her love of exploring and visiting new places brought her to paradise in 2000, when she packed up her life and moved to Hawaii’s fourth largest island, Kauai, where there were plenty of beaches to wander, and rainforests to explore. There she lived happily for a decade, but on July 3rd, 2010, Amber’s decomposing remains were found in a remote ravine, and responding law enforcement officials knew that Amber’s life had ended due to foul play, more specifically, a great deal of blunt force trauma to her head and face.
