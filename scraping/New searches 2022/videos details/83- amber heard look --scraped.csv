The theatres have gone dark and the cinemas are closed, while scripts gather dust in locked rooms and production has ceased on television soaps.

However, those in need of a drama fix need look no further than the law courts in London, where the showbiz trial of the century — or at least the pandemic — has begun.
Everything about the Johnny Depp and Amber Heard case is wild, sensational, astonishing. It has laid bare a world in which the jets and the islands are private, but where the excess and indulgence have been made horribly public.

The actress - as always - looks incredible in an understated, business-like suit, a figure-hugging skirt, and a crisp white shirt

It’s a serious look. She’s power dressing - she wants to be seen as strong and not fussy. A trustworthy figure. It’s an outfit that says, ""I mean business"".

AMBER LUKE, 25, from Brisbane, Australia has 600 tattoos covering her face and body. She first filmed with Truly last year, revealing her blue tattooed eyes which blinded her for three weeks. Since then, she has continued to add to her collection with stretched ear lobes, more tattoos, and plans to get a Brazilian Butt Lift. Her journey into body modification began when she was diagnosed with severe clinical depression at 16-years-old. She explained the reasons behind her extreme look to Truly: “I know it sounds very materialistic that I want to change myself but imagine hating yourself so much that you couldn't even look in a mirror or step outside your house.” Amber has now spent $50,000 on tattoos, and $70,000 overall on body modifications.

An Amber Alert is a child abduction alert system. Expand the description below to read how I was able to be ready to record this alert and what exactly an AMBER alert is.

These alerts are also seen and heard when there's a Winter Storm Warning, such as a Tornado is near, during Flash Floods, and also when there's a Dust Storm like when the Phoenix area of Arizona is sometimes hit with those huge sand storms called Haboobs.

How was I ready to capture the alert on video?
Well, I have two iPhones (one for work) and so when my personal one started going off and alerting, I quickly silenced the alarm and then started recording the second iPhone that I had which started it's alert very soon after the first one and I was able to capture it in time, as you can see in the video!

Why is it called an Amber Alert?
The Amber Alert originated in the United States in 1996. AMBER is officially a backronym for America's Missing: Broadcast Emergency Response, but was named for Amber Hagerman, a 9-year-old abducted and murdered in Arlington, Texas, in 1996.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

About:
Venom: Let There Be Carnage is a 2021 American superhero film featuring the Marvel Comics character Venom, produced by Columbia Pictures in association with Marvel. Distributed by Sony Pictures Releasing, it is the second film in Sony's Spider-Man Universe and the sequel to Venom (2018). The film is directed by Andy Serkis from a screenplay by Kelly Marcel, based on a story she wrote with Tom Hardy who stars as Eddie Brock / Venom alongside Michelle Williams, Naomie Harris, Reid Scott, Stephen Graham, and Woody Harrelson. In the film, Brock struggles to adjust to life as the host of the alien symbiote Venom, while serial killer Cletus Kasady (Harrelson) escapes from prison after becoming the host of Carnage, a chaotic spawn of Venom.

Venom was intended to be the start of a new shared universe, and plans for a sequel began during production on the first film. Harrelson was cast to make a brief appearance as Kasady at the end of Venom with the intention of him becoming the villain Carnage in the sequel. Official work on the sequel began in January 2019, with Hardy and Harrelson confirmed to return along with Marcel as writer. Serkis was hired as director that August, partly due to his experience working with CGI and motion-capture technology which was an important part of portraying Venom and Carnage in the film. Filming took place at Leavesden Studios in England from November 2019 to February 2020, with additional filming in San Francisco in February. The title was announced in April 2020. The film was primarily inspired by the comic book story arc ""Maximum Carnage"" (1993) and the 1994 Spider-Man animated series story arc The Venom Saga (1996).

Venom: Let There Be Carnage premiered in London on September 14, 2021, and was theatrically released in the United States on October 1, 2021. It was delayed from an initial October 2020 date due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The film has grossed over $397 million worldwide, making it the eighth highest-grossing film of 2021, and received mixed reviews from critics, although it was generally considered an improvement over its predecessor.
