Amber's Airlines - High Hopes

Game Description:

Fasten your seat belt and take off with Amber Hope in a new airline game!

From the makers of Delicious, Fabulous and Heart's Medicine, comes a brand new time management adventure that will make your heart soar! Meet Amber Hope, aspiring stewardess for Snuggford Airlines. Amber has dreamed of flying to exotic destinations around the world since she was a girl. But before she can join the elite crew of air hostesses, she'll need to pass her exams. That's not going to be easy, and she'll need your help. Amber's life seems wonderful. She shares her apartment with her pet fish, Sushi. She loves her job and dreams of the day she'll be on an airplane, a full-fledged cabin attendant assisting travellers. The possibilities are endless - ""the sky is the limit"" as they say. But appearances can be deceiving… Everything is overshadowed by what happened in her childhood and she can't escape her past. Her lingering guilt and fear are holding her back from achieving the very thing she is trying to achieve. When her plane crashes, Amber is forced to face her fears. As you've heard time and again during safety demonstrations, Amber will have to help herself before she can help others. Is she up to the task? Share the highs and lows of Amber's life. Be there for her and help her ascend to the highest heights!

Everything is overshadowed by what happened in her childhood and she can’t escape her past. Her lingering guilt and fear are holding her back from achieving the very thing she is trying to achieve.

When her plane crashes, Amber is forced to face her fears. As you’ve heard time and again during safety demonstrations, Amber will have to help herself before she can help others. Is she up to the task?

Share the highs and lows of Amber’s life. Be there for her and help her ascend to the highest heights!

About this channel: Welcome to my channel. I'm Amber Smith. My husband Granger and I live on a little farm in central Texas with lots of animals and our beautiful, super funny kiddos. We have London, Lincoln, River (who is now with Jesus) and Maverick. This channel is a spin off of our family vlog The Smiths. 

I started Arise, when we lost our son, to share my feelings of loss, grief, love, hope, parenting and my faith journey along the way. We comb through scripture, I share what the Lord puts on my heart, I answer questions and more. My hope through Arise is that something I say makes you want to seek Jesus. He changed my life and my heart when I was in my 30s and I've been sharing the good news ever since. 

Life is hard but God is so good. I pray you are encouraged each week. Make sure you subscribe and hit the notification bell so you don't miss any videos!

Amber’s life seems wonderful. She shares her apartment with her pet fish, Sushi. She loves her job and dreams of the day she’ll be on an airplane, a full-fledged cabin attendant assisting travellers. The possibilities are endless - “the sky is the limit” as they say. But appearances can be deceiving…

Everything is overshadowed by what happened in her childhood and she can’t escape her past. Her lingering guilt and fear are holding her back from achieving the very thing she is trying to achieve.

When her plane crashes, Amber is forced to face her fears. As you’ve heard time and again during safety demonstrations, Amber will have to help herself before she can help others. Is she up to the task?

Share the highs and lows of Amber’s life. Be there for her and help her ascend to the highest heights!

Welcome to the Amber’s Airline – High Hopes! Amber Hope is an aspiring airline stewardess whose dreams fly high in the clouds. Help make Amber’s dreams a reality as she faces personal fears and challenges. This is the unofficial gameplay and strategy guide for Amber’s Airline – High Hopes and includes every level, challenge, minigame, and more! Learn how to unlock every trophy and find all hidden mice. Are you ready to take off?

Fasten your seat belt and take off with Amber Hope in a new airline game!

From GameHouse, makers of Delicious, Fabulous and Heart’s Medicine, comes a brand new time management adventure that will make your heart soar!

In Amber’s Airline - High Hopes, you’ll get a taste of the glamorous life of a flight attendant.

Meet Amber Hope, aspiring stewardess for Snuggford Airlines. Amber has dreamed of flying to exotic destinations around the world since she was a girl. But before she can join the elite crew of air hostesses, she’ll need to pass her exams. That’s not going to be easy, and she’ll need your help.

✈️Be transported by a truly wonderful story of love and loss
✈️Fly through 60 travel-themed levels, and 30 extra challenging levels
✈️Explore the world and get a behind-the scenes look at airport life with 6 unique locations
✈️Master 18 mini games that cover every aspect of flying – from check-in to security checks, suitcases to passports, safety demonstrations to serving passengers
✈️Fasten your seatbelt for amazing, all-new cinematics
✈️Experience what it’s like to be a real flight attendant - the ups and the downs
✈️”Unfasten” Amber’s diary and discover her secret thoughts as you earn game goals
✈️Customize Amber’s diary by earning diamonds and make it your own with travel stickers and different covers

Amber’s life seems wonderful. She shares her apartment with her pet fish, Sushi. She loves her job and dreams of the day she’ll be on an airplane, a full-fledged cabin attendant assisting travellers. The possibilities are endless - “the sky is the limit” as they say. But appearances can be deceiving…

Everything is overshadowed by what happened in her childhood and she can’t escape her past. Her lingering guilt and fear are holding her back from achieving the very thing she is trying to achieve.

When her plane crashes, Amber is forced to face her fears. As you’ve heard time and again during safety demonstrations, Amber will have to help herself before she can help others. Is she up to the task?

Share the highs and lows of Amber’s life. Be there for her and help her ascend to the highest heights!

Welcome to the Amber’s Airline – High Hopes! Amber Hope is an aspiring airline stewardess whose dreams fly high in the clouds. Help make Amber’s dreams a reality as she faces personal fears and challenges. This is the unofficial gameplay and strategy guide for Amber’s Airline – High Hopes and includes every level, challenge, minigame, and more! Learn how to unlock every trophy and find all hidden mice. Are you ready to take off?

From GameHouse, makers of Delicious, Fabulous and Heart’s Medicine, comes a brand new time management adventure that will make your heart soar!

In Amber’s Airline - High Hopes, you’ll get a taste of the glamorous life of a flight attendant.

Meet Amber Hope, aspiring stewardess for Snuggford Airlines. Amber has dreamed of flying to exotic destinations around the world since she was a girl. But before she can join the elite crew of air hostesses, she’ll need to pass her exams. That’s not going to be easy, and she’ll need your help.

✈️Be transported by a truly wonderful story of love and loss
✈️Fly through 60 travel-themed levels, and 30 extra challenging levels
✈️Explore the world and get a behind-the scenes look at airport life with 6 unique locations
✈️Master 18 mini games that cover every aspect of flying – from check-in to security checks, suitcases to passports, safety demonstrations to serving passengers

Amber’s life seems wonderful. She shares her apartment with her pet fish, Sushi. She loves her job and dreams of the day she’ll be on an airplane, a full-fledged cabin attendant assisting travellers. The possibilities are endless - “the sky is the limit” as they say. But appearances can be deceiving…

Everything is overshadowed by what happened in her childhood and she can’t escape her past. Her lingering guilt and fear are holding her back from achieving the very thing she is trying to achieve.

When her plane crashes, Amber is forced to face her fears. As you’ve heard time and again during safety demonstrations, Amber will have to help herself before she can help others. Is she up to the task?

Share the highs and lows of Amber’s life. Be there for her and help her ascend to the highest heights!

Welcome to the Amber’s Airline – High Hopes! Amber Hope is an aspiring airline stewardess whose dreams fly high in the clouds. Help make Amber’s dreams a reality as she faces personal fears and challenges. This is the unofficial gameplay and strategy guide for Amber’s Airline – High Hopes and includes every level, challenge, minigame, and more! Learn how to unlock every trophy and find all hidden mice. Are you ready to take off?

Fasten your seat belt and take off with Amber Hope in a new airline game!

From GameHouse, makers of Delicious, Fabulous and Heart’s Medicine, comes a brand new time management adventure that will make your heart soar!

In Amber’s Airline - High Hopes, you’ll get a taste of the glamorous life of a flight attendant.

Meet Amber Hope, aspiring stewardess for Snuggford Airlines. Amber has dreamed of flying to exotic destinations around the world since she was a girl. But before she can join the elite crew of air hostesses, she’ll need to pass her exams. That’s not going to be easy, and she’ll need your help.

✈️Be transported by a truly wonderful story of love and loss
✈️Fly through 60 travel-themed levels, and 30 extra challenging levels
✈️Explore the world and get a behind-the scenes look at airport life with 6 unique locations
✈️Master 18 mini games that cover every aspect of flying – from check-in to security checks, suitcases to passports, safety demonstrations to serving passengers
✈️Fasten your seatbelt for amazing, all-new cinematics
✈️Experience what it’s like to be a real flight attendant - the ups and the downs
✈️”Unfasten” Amber’s diary and discover her secret thoughts as you earn game goals
✈️Customize Amber’s diary by earning diamonds and make it your own with travel stickers and different covers

Amber’s life seems wonderful. She shares her apartment with her pet fish, Sushi. She loves her job and dreams of the day she’ll be on an airplane, a full-fledged cabin attendant assisting travellers. The possibilities are endless - “the sky is the limit” as they say. But appearances can be deceiving…

Everything is overshadowed by what happened in her childhood and she can’t escape her past. Her lingering guilt and fear are holding her back from achieving the very thing she is trying to achieve.

When her plane crashes, Amber is forced to face her fears. As you’ve heard time and again during safety demonstrations, Amber will have to help herself before she can help others. Is she up to the task?

Share the highs and lows of Amber’s life. Be there for her and help her ascend to the highest heights!

Amber's Airline - High Hopes

Enjoy this game for FREE – or unlock ALL Original Stories games with unlimited play and no ads by signing up for a GHOS Subscription!

Fasten your seat belt and take off with Amber Hope in a new airline game!

From GameHouse, makers of Delicious, Fabulous and Heart’s Medicine, comes a brand new time management adventure that will make your heart soar!

In Amber’s Airline - High Hopes, you’ll get a taste of the glamorous life of a flight attendant.

Meet Amber Hope, aspiring stewardess for Snuggford Airlines. Amber has dreamed of flying to exotic destinations around the world since she was a girl. But before she can join the elite crew of air hostesses, she’ll need to pass her exams. That’s not going to be easy, and she’ll need your help.

✈️Be transported by a truly wonderful story of love and loss
✈️Fly through 60 travel-themed levels, and 30 extra challenging levels
✈️Explore the world and get a behind-the scenes look at airport life with 6 unique locations
✈️Master 18 mini games that cover every aspect of flying – from check-in to security checks, suitcases to passports, safety demonstrations to serving passengers
✈️Fasten your seatbelt for amazing, all-new cinematics
✈️Experience what it’s like to be a real flight attendant - the ups and the downs
✈️”Unfasten” Amber’s diary and discover her secret thoughts as you earn game goals
✈️Customize Amber’s diary by earning diamonds and make it your own with travel stickers and different covers

Amber’s life seems wonderful. She shares her apartment with her pet fish, Sushi. She loves her job and dreams of the day she’ll be on an airplane, a full-fledged cabin attendant assisting travellers. The possibilities are endless - “the sky is the limit” as they say. But appearances can be deceiving…

Everything is overshadowed by what happened in her childhood and she can’t escape her past. Her lingering guilt and fear are holding her back from achieving the very thing she is trying to achieve.

When her plane crashes, Amber is forced to face her fears. As you’ve heard time and again during safety demonstrations, Amber will have to help herself before she can help others. Is she up to the task?

Share the highs and lows of Amber’s life. Be there for her and help her ascend to the highest heights!

Amber's Airlines - High Hopes

Game Description:

Fasten your seat belt and take off with Amber Hope in a new airline game!

From the makers of Delicious, Fabulous and Heart's Medicine, comes a brand new time management adventure that will make your heart soar! Meet Amber Hope, aspiring stewardess for Snuggford Airlines. Amber has dreamed of flying to exotic destinations around the world since she was a girl. But before she can join the elite crew of air hostesses, she'll need to pass her exams. That's not going to be easy, and she'll need your help. Amber's life seems wonderful. She shares her apartment with her pet fish, Sushi. She loves her job and dreams of the day she'll be on an airplane, a full-fledged cabin attendant assisting travellers. The possibilities are endless - ""the sky is the limit"" as they say. But appearances can be deceiving… Everything is overshadowed by what happened in her childhood and she can't escape her past. Her lingering guilt and fear are holding her back from achieving the very thing she is trying to achieve. When her plane crashes, Amber is forced to face her fears. As you've heard time and again during safety demonstrations, Amber will have to help herself before she can help others. Is she up to the task? Share the highs and lows of Amber's life. Be there for her and help her ascend to the highest heights! 

- Be transported by a truly wonderful story of love and loss 
- Fly through 60 travel-themed levels, and 30 extra challenging levels 
- Explore the world and get a behind-the scenes look at airport life with 6 unique locations 
- Master 18 mini games that cover every aspect of flying – from check-in to security checks, suitcases to passports, safety demonstrations to serving passengers 
- Fasten your seatbelt for amazing, all-new cinematics 
- Experience what it's like to be a real flight attendant - the ups and the downs 
- Unfasten"" Amber's diary and discover her secret thoughts as you earn game goals 
- Customize Amber's diary by earning diamonds and make it your own with travel stickers and different covers",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SA-T4zHG2Vc/default.jpg,120,90,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SA-T4zHG2Vc/mqdefault.jpg,320,180,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SA-T4zHG2Vc/hqdefault.jpg,480,360,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SA-T4zHG2Vc/sddefault.jpg,640.0,480.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SA-T4zHG2Vc/maxresdefault.jpg,1280.0,720.0,Abadone Game TV,"[""Amber's Airlines High Hopes"", 'time management game', 'flight attendant game', 'game', 'cooking game', 'airline game']",20,none,"Amber's Airlines - High Hopes - Level 60 ""Free Bird""(#85)(Walkthrough)","Thanks for watching!

✈️Fly through 60 travel-themed levels, and 30 extra challenging levels
✈️Explore the world and get a behind-the scenes look at airport life with 6 unique locations
✈️Master 18 mini games that cover every aspect of flying – from check-in to security checks, suitcases to passports, safety demonstrations to serving passengers
✈️Fasten your seatbelt for amazing, all-new cinematics
✈️Experience what it’s like to be a real flight attendant - the ups and the downs
✈️”Unfasten” Amber’s diary and discover her secret thoughts as you earn game goals
✈️Customize Amber’s diary by earning diamonds and make it your own with travel stickers and different covers

Amber’s life seems wonderful. She shares her apartment with her pet fish, Sushi. She loves her job and dreams of the day she’ll be on an airplane, a full-fledged cabin attendant assisting travellers. The possibilities are endless - “the sky is the limit” as they say. But appearances can be deceiving…

Everything is overshadowed by what happened in her childhood and she can’t escape her past. Her lingering guilt and fear are holding her back from achieving the very thing she is trying to achieve.

When her plane crashes, Amber is forced to face her fears. As you’ve heard time and again during safety demonstrations, Amber will have to help herself before she can help others. Is she up to the task?

Share the highs and lows of Amber’s life. Be there for her and help her ascend to the highest heights!

Fasten your seat belt and take off with Amber Hope in a new airline game!

From GameHouse, makers of Delicious, Fabulous and Heart’s Medicine, comes a brand new time management adventure that will make your heart soar!

In Amber’s Airline - High Hopes, you’ll get a taste of the glamorous life of a flight attendant. 

Meet Amber Hope, aspiring stewardess for Snuggford Airlines. Amber has dreamed of flying to exotic destinations around the world since she was a girl. But before she can join the elite crew of air hostesses, she’ll need to pass her exams. That’s not going to be easy, and she’ll need your help.

- Be transported by a truly wonderful story of love and loss
- Fly through 60 travel-themed levels, and 30 extra challenging levels
- Explore the world and get a behind-the scenes look at airport life with 6 unique locations
- Master 18 mini games that cover every aspect of flying – from check-in to security checks, suitcases to passports, safety demonstrations to serving passengers
- Fasten your seatbelt for amazing, all-new cinematics
- Experience what it’s like to be a real flight attendant - the ups and the downs
- ”Unfasten” Amber’s diary and discover her secret thoughts as you earn game goals
- Customize Amber’s diary by earning diamonds and make it your own with travel stickers and different covers

Amber’s life seems wonderful. She shares her apartment with her pet fish, Sushi. She loves her job and dreams of the day she’ll be on an airplane, a full-fledged cabin attendant assisting travellers. The possibilities are endless - “the sky is the limit” as they say. But appearances can be deceiving…

Everything is overshadowed by what happened in her childhood and she can’t escape her past. Her lingering guilt and fear are holding her back from achieving the very thing she is trying to achieve. 

When her plane crashes, Amber is forced to face her fears. As you’ve heard time and again during safety demonstrations, Amber will have to help herself before she can help others. Is she up to the task?

Share the highs and lows of Amber’s life. Be there for her and help her ascend to the highest heights!

About this game

❤️❤️❤️Help Amber get her wings❤️❤️❤️

Fasten your seat belt and take off with Amber Hope in a new airline game!

From GameHouse, makers of Delicious, Fabulous and Heart’s Medicine, comes a brand new time management adventure that will make your heart soar!

In Amber’s Airline - High Hopes, you’ll get a taste of the glamorous life of a flight attendant. 

Meet Amber Hope, aspiring stewardess for Snuggford Airlines. Amber has dreamed of flying to exotic destinations around the world since she was a girl. But before she can join the elite crew of air hostesses, she’ll need to pass her exams. That’s not going to be easy, and she’ll need your help.

✈️Be transported by a truly wonderful story of love and loss
✈️Fly through 60 travel-themed levels, and 30 extra challenging levels
✈️Explore the world and get a behind-the scenes look at airport life with 6 unique locations
✈️Master 18 mini games that cover every aspect of flying – from check-in to security checks, suitcases to passports, safety demonstrations to serving passengers
✈️Fasten your seatbelt for amazing, all-new cinematics
✈️Experience what it’s like to be a real flight attendant - the ups and the downs
✈️”Unfasten” Amber’s diary and discover her secret thoughts as you earn game goals
✈️Customize Amber’s diary by earning diamonds and make it your own with travel stickers and different covers

Amber’s life seems wonderful. She shares her apartment with her pet fish, Sushi. She loves her job and dreams of the day she’ll be on an airplane, a full-fledged cabin attendant assisting travellers. The possibilities are endless - “the sky is the limit” as they say. But appearances can be deceiving…

Everything is overshadowed by what happened in her childhood and she can’t escape her past. Her lingering guilt and fear are holding her back from achieving the very thing she is trying to achieve. 

When her plane crashes, Amber is forced to face her fears. As you’ve heard time and again during safety demonstrations, Amber will have to help herself before she can help others. Is she up to the task?

Share the highs and lows of Amber’s life. Be there for her and help her ascend to the highest heights!
