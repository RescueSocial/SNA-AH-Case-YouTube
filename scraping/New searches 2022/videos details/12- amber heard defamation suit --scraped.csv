Depp sat in the witness box in a wood-paneled High Court courtroom on the first day of his libel case against The Sun over an article that branded him a ""wife-beater."" The ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" star began by taking the court oath and giving his full name: John Christopher Depp II.

Depp is suing the tabloid's publisher, News Group Newspapers, and its executive editor, Dan Wootton, over an 2018 story alleging he was violent and abusive to then-wife Amber Heard. Depp strongly denies the claim.

Depp said Heard had ""said to the world that she was in fear of her life from me, and I had been this horrible monster if you will. Which was not the case.""

Johnny Depp and Amber Heard both waved as they arrived at the High Court on Wednesday ahead of the second day of the trial.

Mr Depp, who says he follows a Southern Gentleman code, is suing The Sun for libel after being dubbed a “wife beater” in a 2018 article, and denies ever being violent towards Ms Heard during their volatile marriage.

He in turn claims that Ms Heard was the violent abuser, insisting she had married him to further her career and called the actress a “sociopath”. She denies his allegations.

Johnny Depp’s $50M Defamation Trial Against Amber Heard,"EXCLUSIVE: Johnny Depp and Amber Heard won’t be facing off in a Virginia courtroom anytime soon, it seems. In yet another delay in the trial start of the former Pirates of the Caribbean star’s acetous $50 million defamation lawsuit against the Aquaman actress, the former couple now will trade barbs and evidence starting April 11, 2022. The trial is expected to last about two weeks. Already rescheduled several times, the trial had been set to start May 7, which was looking like the final mad rush of discovery and depositions. The new date was decided Tuesday by Fairfax County Circuit Court Chief Judge Bruce White. The last time the fuming matter was postponed was back in September of last year. While Depp had been advocating for a new delay then because of his Fantastic Beasts 3 shooting schedule, White actually pushed the date from January 2021 to May due to backlogs in the state’s court system because of the coronavirus pandemic. And, to the frustration of some involved, that’s kind of the reason this time too, as the April 2022 date was the first available slot for a civil jury trial, I hear. As with last September, criminal cases are still the priority in Virginia. In that context, and with proceedings slowly starting up again as Covid-19 continues to rage across the nation, a murder trial with a defendant who is already behind bars was given the Depp-Heard May 7 date. With Depp’s UK lawyers anticipating an oral hearing next month in their attempt to appeal their loss in the actor’s libel suit against The Sun tabloid, the significant date shift in Virginia barely lowers the volume in the loud matter. For once thing, Heard countersued her ex-husband for $100 million last summer after failing to get the initial suit dismissed. In fact, in the UK, Heard’s team recently filed an opposition to the appeal there, and Depp’s barristers have until February 28 to reply. Having been axed from the Fantastic Beasts franchise in November, mere days after Judge Andrew Nicol’s damning “wife-beater” ruling against Depp, the actor has been on a subpoena binge in the U. S. of late. The ACLU and Elon Musk were pulled into the Virginia case earlier this month, by Depp. That follows Heard dragging Pirates studio Disney and the LAPD into the matter in January for basically everything that they might or might not have on her ex. Among those high-profile names in this very high-profile case, free speech nonprofit the ACLU is in the spotlight again in the case because the group was among the two organizations to which Heard said five years ago she was donating half of her $7 million divorce settlement. Despite years of insisting on the donation and an ACLU Ambassador for women’s rights role for Heard, it turns out that big-bucks payments have been “delayed, ” according to what the actress’ attorney Elaine Bredehoft told Deadline in January.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

(Associated Press) 
Actor Johnny Depp has filed a $50 million defamation lawsuit against his ex-wife, actress Amber Heard, accusing her of making allegations of domestic abuse in order to advance her career. 
In the lawsuit, which was filed in Virginia on Friday, Depp cites an article that Heard wrote for the Washington Post about domestic abuse. 
The lawsuit also contains Depp’s allegation that Heard began an affair with Tesla founder Elon Musk just one month after Depp and Heard got married in 2015. 
Heard’s attorney, Eric M. George, responded to the lawsuit in a statement to People magazine.

“This frivolous action is just the latest of Johnny Depp’s repeated efforts to silence Amber Heard,” George said. “She will not be silenced.” 
“This frivolous action is just the latest of Johnny Depp’s repeated efforts to silence Amber Heard. She will not be silenced.” 
— Eric M. George, attorney for Amber Heard 
Depp’s attorney, Adam Waldman, then responded to George’s statement. 
“Telling media ‘they want to silence Amber Heard’ doesn’t sound like a denial by Ms. Heard of Mr. Depp’s 40-page, evidence-packed complaint,” Waldman said in a statement to People. 
“We hardly intend to silence Ms. Heard,” Waldman continued. “To the contrary, we intend to subpoena and compel evidence from her, her three hoax-assisting friends, and Elon Musk. We look forward to holding the overwhelming video, photographic and eyewitness evidence we finally possess up against Amber Heard’s (so far silent) attempts to explain the inexplicable.” 
""We hardly intend to silence Ms. Heard. To the contrary, we intend to subpoena and compel evidence from her, her three hoax-assisting friends, and Elon Musk."" 
— Adam Waldman, attorney for Johnny Depp 
Depp’s complaint says that although Heard did not use Depp’s name in the Post article, it was clear she was referring to him. The lawsuit calls her ongoing allegations of domestic abuse ""categorically and demonstrably false."" 
""They were part of an elaborate hoax to generate positive publicity for Ms. Heard and advance her career,"" the lawsuit says, claiming that ""she is the perpetrator."" 
The suit said Depp, 55, has suffered financial losses because of the accusations, including being dropped from his role as Capt. Jack Sparrow in the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" films. 
In her article, published in the Post in December, Heard, 32, also says she lost an acting role and contract with a major fashion brand because she went public with her claims of abuse.

I figured she wouldn't be fired, however I am glad that WarnerMedia is staying out of Cancel Culture entirely.

That has to change” entitled Post piece, which never actually mentioned Depp by name but clearly didn’t have to – at least not for this lawsuit.  “Mr. Depp never abused Ms. Heard, the compensatory damages and punitive damages seeking complaint from the actor goes on to say. “Her allegations against him were false when they were made in 2016,” it adds in reference to the claims that Heard made in the couple’s short-lived union.  A marriage that ended with a temporary restraining order against Depp and later a $7 million settlement, that Heard donated to charity. Having long since denied the abuse allegations, the Hollywood Vampires guitarist clearly now thinks there was more going on.“ They were part of an elaborate hoax to generate positive publicity for Ms. Heard and advance her career,” Friday’s lawsuit postulates of the allegations of Depp’s violent misconduct.  “This frivolous action is just the latest of Johnny Depp’s repeated efforts to silence Amber Heard,” the actress’ attorney Eric M. George told Deadline. “She will not be silenced.”  “Mr. Depp’s actions prove he is unable to accept the truth of his ongoing abusive behavior, the Browne George Ross LLP partner added.  “But while he appears hell-bent on achieving self destruction, we will prevail in defeating this groundless lawsuit and ending the continued vile harassment of my client by Mr. Depp and his legal team.”Representatives for Depp did not respond to request for comment on the filing.However, if their past legal entanglements are any indication, expect the ambassador on women’s rights at the American Civil Liberties Union to not enter her own POV into the docket soon.  This latest suit comes against the backdrop of Depp still battling it out on several other legal fronts. Despite a big win last summer, one of those battles include a $30 million malpractice action against the actor’s ex-attorneys at Bloom Hergott Diemer Rosenthal LaViolette Feldman Schenkman & Goodman LLP.

Having long since denied the abuse allegations, the Hollywood Vampires guitarist clearly now thinks there was more going on.“ They were part of an elaborate hoax to generate positive publicity for Ms. Heard and advance her career,” Friday’s lawsuit postulates of the allegations of Depp’s violent misconduct.  “This frivolous action is just the latest of Johnny Depp’s repeated efforts to silence Amber Heard,” the actress’ attorney Eric M. George told Deadline. “She will not be silenced.”  “Mr. Depp’s actions prove he is unable to accept the truth of his ongoing abusive behavior, the Browne George Ross LLP partner added.  “But while he appears hell-bent on achieving self destruction, we will prevail in defeating this groundless lawsuit and ending the continued vile harassment of my client by Mr. Depp and his legal team.”Representatives for Depp did not respond to request for comment on the filing.However, if their past legal entanglements are any indication, expect the ambassador on women’s rights at the American Civil Liberties Union to not enter her own POV into the docket soon.  This latest suit comes against the backdrop of Depp still battling it out on several other legal fronts. Despite a big win last summer, one of those battles include a $30 million malpractice action against the actor’s ex-attorneys at Bloom Hergott Diemer Rosenthal LaViolette Feldman Schenkman & Goodman LLP.

Amber Heard arrived at the High Court in London, Monday (27 JULY 2020) for the closing submissions in Johnny Depp's libel case against a UK publisher.
Depp, 57, is suing News Group Newspapers, the publisher of The Sun, and the newspaper’s executive editor, Dan Wootton, over a April 2018 article that labeled the actor a “wife beater”. 
Depp has told the court that he was the one abused by Heard and that she had a history of being violent against him.
The Sun’s defense relies on 14 allegations made by Heard of violence by Depp between 2013 and 2016, in settings as varied as a rented house in Australia, his private island in the Bahamas and a private jet.

Johnny Depp, whose acting career has almost come to an end after devastating legal loss in UK, will get a second libel trial to prove his claims that he didn’t physically abuse ex-wife Amber Heard. 

A Virginia judge Wednesday ruled that the decision in Depp’s suit against the publisher of a newspaper shouldn’t derail his second case against his ex-wife over an op/ed published in the Washington Post.

Heard is being sued in that latter case over a Dec 2018 column where she penned, “I became a public figure representing domestic abuse, and I felt the full force of our culture’s wrath for women who speak out.”

That suit in Virginia was expected to make it to trial first, but thanks to delays, Depp’s UK case got the honor.

In the United Kingdom, the actor sued over an article that had called him a “wife beater.” After a trial that lasted weeks, Judge Andrew Nicol found substantial truth to the article, specifically with regards to 14 incidents that happened during the troubled marriage.

The ruling left Depp in the atypical position of arguing he didn’t get everything he wanted in the country, which has long been known for libel tourism since the burden of proof is on defendant and public figures needn’t show actual malice.

On the other hand, Amber Heard responded that the Virginia court should recognize the U.K. judgment, and since both actions centered on whether Johny Depp was a domestic abuser, declare the matter already adjudicated.

The trial is scheduled for early next year and will also examine Johnny Depp's ex wife Amber Heard’s counterclaims.

Fairfax County Chief Judge Penney Azcarate rejected Heard's motion to dismiss the case – Heard's third such motion since Depp filed his lawsuit in March 2019.

Heard tried to get the Virginia lawsuit thrown out citing the ruling of a London judge last year in a libel lawsuit Depp filed against the publisher of The Sun tabloid and subsequently lost following a contentious legal showdown in an English courtroom. 

The London judge concluded that the 2018 article branding Depp a ""wife beater"" was not libelous and that ""the great majority"" of Heard's claims of domestic abuse ""could be proved to the civil standard.""

Johnny Depp and his wife Amber Heard arriving at a court in Australia in April 2016.
But Virginia's Judge Azcarate concluded that the two cases were not the same – Heard was not a party in the London lawsuit, although she was a witness for The Sun – and thus her argument for dismissal failed under well-established legal precedents governing when civil cases can be dismissed. 

""Defendant's claim that refusing to recognize the U.K. Judgment in this case would set a dangerous precedent is unfounded,"" Azcarate said in her opinion. ""If anything, upholding English libel judgments in the United States would create the chilling effect and could create a dangerous precedent. Accordingly, this Court is unpersuaded by Defendant's argument.""

The decision marks a major victory for the actor in his ongoing warfare with his ex, which began in 2016 during their divorce in California and has now outlasted their brief, tumultuous marriage.

Actress Amber Heard is asking a judge to dismiss a $50 million defamation lawsuit her ex-husband Johnny Depp filed over a Washington Post op-ed she wrote about domestic violence.
  
In the motion filed Thursday (11 APRIL 2019) in Fairfax, Virginia, Heard's lawyers reiterate allegations that Depp abused her and include exhibits such as photos of her with bruised face and scarred arms.
  
Depp's lawsuit, filed last month, said the domestic-abuse allegations are ""categorically and demonstrably false.""
  
Heard's Post piece said the culture punished her about being a victim of domestic violence, and she argued for changed attitudes.
  
It didn't me mention Depp's name or describe any incidents, but Depp's lawsuit states it was clear Heard was talking about him and it hurt his career.
  
Messages seeking comment from Depp's attorney were not immediately returned.

Amber Heard denied Tuesday (21 JULY 2020) that she fabricated injuries to show that her then-husband Johnny Depp had been violent toward her as she took to the witness box for her second day giving evidence in Depp’s libel case against a British tabloid over allegations of domestic violence.
  
On Monday, during her first day of testimony at Britain's High Court in London, she accused her ex-husband of abusing her both physically and verbally while he was allegedly bingeing on alcohol and drugs, claiming that at various times during their tempestuous relationship she feared for her life.
  
In the first hour of her second day of evidence, Depp's lawyer, Eleanor Laws, sought to show that Heard fabricated injuries, allegations that Heard denied.
  
In written testimony released to the court, Heard said that at various times during their relationship she endured “punching, slapping, kicking, head-butting and choking.” She said “some incidents were so severe that I was afraid he was going to kill me, either intentionally or just by losing control and going too far.” 
  
According to Heard, Depp “explicitly threatened to kill me many times, especially later in our relationship.” She said he blamed his actions on “a self-created third party” that he referred to as “the monster.” 
  
Heard told the court that she loved Depp when he was himself but that she was “terrified of the monster.” 
  
The court is examining Depp’s libel suit against The Sun newspaper over an April 2018 article that labelled him a “wife beater” for allegedly abusing Heard. Depp, 57, is suing The Sun’s publisher, News Group Newspapers, and the paper’s executive editor, Dan Wootton, over the article. The Hollywood star strongly denies abusing Heard and was at the court to hear his ex-wife.
  
In the first nine days of testimony at the High Court, judge Andrew Nicol heard from Depp and from several current or former employees who have backed his version of events.
  
Heard's testimony is now expected to last for four days, through Thursday.

Amber Heard arrived at the High Court in London on Friday (24 JULY 2020) as Johnny Depp's libel case against a U.K. publisher continues.
Thursday saw Heard testify for the fourth day, during which she said she never wanted the world to know the details of her years of alleged abuse by Depp, as she concluded her evidence in her ex-husband's libel case against a British tabloid.
Heard testified that everything she had said at the High Court in London was true.
She said she just wanted to be ""left alone"" after the breakup of her and Depp's tempestuous marriage and that she wanted to ""save him the embarrassment.”
Heard was in court because Depp, 57, is suing News Group Newspapers, the publisher of The Sun, and the newspaper's executive editor, Dan Wootton, over an April 2018 article that labeled him a “wife beater.”
The Sun’s defense relies on 14 allegations made by Heard of violence by Depp between 2013 and 2016, in settings as varied as a rented house in Australia, his private island in the Bahamas and a private jet. 
Depp denies abusing Heard and claims she was the aggressor during their relationship. He missed Heard's testimony on Thursday after arriving late to court.
Heard was followed on the witness stand by her sister, Whitney Henriquez, who was quizzed by Depp's lawyer, Eleanor Laws, about a number of alleged incidents that are at the heart of the case. Henriquez denied Laws' suggestion that she was doing her “absolute best” to throw her sister a “lifeline.”
In written evidence to the court, Henriquez said she “felt sick” in September 2013 when she learned her sister was going to marry Depp and told Heard that “putting a ring on her finger was not going to stop him hitting her.”
Depp and Heard met on the set of the film “The Rum Diary,” released in 2011. They married in Los Angeles in February 2015. Heard filed for divorce the following year, and it was finalized in 2017.
The case is due to finish next week with closing submissions from both sides’ legal teams on Monday and Tuesday.

Join us in today’s video as we share with you Johnny Depp’s sentiments about how Amber Heard treated him! For several years now, Johnny Depp has been entangled in legal battles both directly and indirectly tied to his split from ex-wife Amber Heard. Their relationship was a tabloid magazine’s dream: Hollywood A-lister falls in love with up-and-coming ingenue on set. 

Depp lost his libel case against The Sun in U.K. court over the publication describing him as the attacker. You might well assume that Depp's career is in ruins and his reputation irretrievably damaged. But this isn’t the case in any way. Be sure to watch the whole video and see what really happened in the case of Johnny Depp against Amber Heard!

By now you’ve likely heard that Johnny Depp lost his legal battle against the tabloid The Sun, who in a 2018 article referred to him as a wife beater. A High Court judge ruled that the claims are substantially true, leading to Depp’s libel suit against The Sun to unfortunately be ruled in favor of the publication. We’ve been covering the Johnny and Amber story for quite some time now, and although the two of them are still in a back and forth, Johnny's legal team has filed to appeal the ruling in regards to the libel case. The judge also seemed to think some of Johnny’s claims we’re a little far-fetched, and for whatever reason, is willing to accept everything Amber says as the truth, but has a hard time believing Johnny’s side of the story.

Amber Heard arrived at Britain's High Court Friday (17 JULY 2020) to attend a hearing of ex-husband Johnny Depp's libel claim against a UK tabloid.
Depp is suing News Group Newspapers, publisher of The Sun, and the paper’s executive editor, Dan Wootton, over an April 2018 article that called him a “wife-beater.” He strongly denies abusing Heard.
On Thursday, Depp’s security chief alleged that Heard physically abused Depp during the couple’s tempestuous marriage.
  
Lawyers also released statements from two of Depp's former romantic partners, Winona Ryder and Vanessa Paradis, who said they could not reconcile Heard's accusations of violence with the kind and loving man they knew.
  
Depp, 57, and Heard, 34, met on the set of the 2011 comedy “The Rum Diary” and married in Los Angeles in February 2015. 
Heard filed for divorce the following year, and the divorce was finalized in 2017.
  
The Sun’s defense relies on 14 allegations made by Heard of violence by Depp between 2013 and 2016, in settings including his private island in the Bahamas, a rented house in Australia and a private jet. 
He denies them all and claims Heard was the aggressor during their volatile relationship, which he has likened to “a crime scene waiting to happen.”
  
In a week and a half of testimony, judge Andrew Nicol has heard from Depp - who accused Heard of compiling a dossier of fake claims against him - as well as several current or former employees who have backed his version of events.
  
Heard is due to give her side of the story when she enters the witness box next week.

The photos, obtained by the MailOnline, show the closet in their $3 million penthouse apartment with broken clothing racks strewn across the floor along with clothes and accessories. Depp, 55, is alleged to have caused the damage.

According to legal documents obtained by The Hollywood Reporter, Fairfax County judge Bruce D. White blocked Depp’s attempt to have Heard’s countersuit dismissed based on a new anti-SLAPP (strategic lawsuits against public participation) law passed in Virginia last year. This new legislation is intended to prevent people from using courts and the threat of lawsuits to intimidate people who are exercising their First Amendment rights. Those being sued most often invoke it to strike down a case because it involves speech on a matter of public concern. The judge cited precisely this lack of public concern as the reason to dismiss Depp’s request, adding that Heard has alleged sufficient facts to support her defamation claims, specifically “that Mr. Depp may have made these statements with actual or constructive knowledge or with reckless disregard for whether they are false.”
However, while Heard will be able to pursue her countersuit, the judge did throw out one aspect of her case that cited the Virginia Computer Crimes Act and claimed that Depp organized a social media bot attack against her to have her removed from Aquaman. White determined there was a lack of evidence to support this claim, explaining, “The pleading fails to demonstrate that the social media accounts communicated obscene language, suggested obscene acts, or threatened illegal or immoral acts. Rather, it appears that Mr. Depp texted those statements, privately, to two of his friends, and Ms. Heard has not alleged that Mr. Depp intended for her to see them.”

Depp is suing Heard for defamation in Virginia courts over a 2018 op-ed she wrote for The Washington Post in which she called herself a survivor of domestic abuse, although she never mentioned Depp by name. The actor is seeking $50 million in damages. Heard initially filed her defamation counterclaims in response to this suit after Depp’s attorney Adam Waldman called her allegations of domestic violence “fake” and a “sexual violence hoax” last year. The judge sided with Heard in this initial ruling, saying that Waldman’s statements were not protected opinion because “whether Mr. Depp abused Ms. Heard is a fact that is capable of being proven true or false.” He added that Depp’s and his attorney’s remarks “imply that Ms. Heard lied and perjured herself when she appeared before a court in 2016 to obtain a temporary restraining order against Mr. Depp” and “imply that she has lied about being a victim of domestic violence.” He continued, “In light of the #MeToo Movement and today’s social climate, falsely claiming abuse would surely ‘injure [Ms. Heard’s] reputation in the common estimation of mankind.’ Therefore, this Court finds that the statements contain the requisite ‘sting’ for an actionable defamation In November, Depp lost his very high-profile libel case against The Sun over a 2018 headline dubbing him a “wife-beater,” which the judge deemed to be “substantially true,” although Depp has denied all instances of abuse.

Johnny Depp talks backlash from Amber Heard abuse allegations
Johnny Depp is opening up about the tumultuous year he's had after his ex-wife, actress Amber Heard, accused him of physically abusing her. 
Johnny Depp’s bandmate Alice Cooper came to the actor’s defense and said the majority of the headlines concerning Depp’s physical appearance and health were “just bull.” 
Cooper, who is in the rock group ""Hollywood Vampires"" with Depp, told Billboard that he’s never seen Depp “happier” amid the ongoing case involving ex-wife Amber Heard and reports of his health. 
“All the stuff you heard last year about Johnny, 99 percent was just bull,” Cooper said. “I've never seen him look better in my life. I've never seen him happier. I've never heard him play better, and the way the press would have it is 'he's a total destruction and ready to die.' Totally not true.” 
JOHNNY DEPP SUES EX-WIFE AMBER HEARD FOR $50M, CLAIMING DEFAMATION, AFFAIR WITH ELON MUSK 
Cooper said the band’s upcoming album will include songs by Depp about his frustrations over the abuse allegations against him. 
“I'm spewing his venom on this album, which is kind of good,” Cooper said. 
Depp filed a $50 million defamation lawsuit against Heard earlier this month, claiming she accused him of domestic abuse to advance her career. The lawsuit cites an article by Heard published on the Washington Post in which she talks about her experience with domestic abuse. Depp said that even though he isn’t named in the article, it was clear she was referring to him, adding that the allegations leveled against him were “categorically and demonstrably false.” 
JOHNNY DEPP APPEARS FRAIL AND GAUNT IN NEWLY SURFACED INSTAGRAM PHOTOS 
The “Pirates of the Caribbean” star also claimed Heard’s relationship with Tesla founder Elon Musk began a month after the former couple got married in 2015. 
The actor also sparked concerns last June when photos emerged of him looking frail and gaunt. Fans questioned whether Depp’s emaciated appearance was due to his public divorce with Heard, which a source previously told Fox News was “mentally draining” and took a toll financially for the actor.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Oc2iEmUt_uo/default.jpg,120,90,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Oc2iEmUt_uo/mqdefault.jpg,320,180,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Oc2iEmUt_uo/hqdefault.jpg,480,360,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Oc2iEmUt_uo/sddefault.jpg,640.0,480.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Oc2iEmUt_uo/maxresdefault.jpg,1280.0,720.0,Biển Đông,,20,none,Johnny Depp’s bandmate Alice Cooper says '99 percent' of reports about actor 'was just bull’,"close

Cooper, who is in the rock group ""Hollywood Vampires"" with Depp, told Billboard that he’s never seen Depp “happier” amid the ongoing case involving ex-wife Amber Heard and reports of his health. 
“All the stuff you heard last year about Johnny, 99 percent was just bull,” Cooper said. “I've never seen him look better in my life. I've never seen him happier. I've never heard him play better, and the way the press would have it is 'he's a total destruction and ready to die.' Totally not true.” 
JOHNNY DEPP SUES EX-WIFE AMBER HEARD FOR $50M, CLAIMING DEFAMATION, AFFAIR WITH ELON MUSK 
Cooper said the band’s upcoming album will include songs by Depp about his frustrations over the abuse allegations against him. 
“I'm spewing his venom on this album, which is kind of good,” Cooper said. 
Depp filed a $50 million defamation lawsuit against Heard earlier this month, claiming she accused him of domestic abuse to advance her career. The lawsuit cites an article by Heard published on the Washington Post in which she talks about her experience with domestic abuse. Depp said that even though he isn’t named in the article, it was clear she was referring to him, adding that the allegations leveled against him were “categorically and demonstrably false.” 
JOHNNY DEPP APPEARS FRAIL AND GAUNT IN NEWLY SURFACED INSTAGRAM PHOTOS 
The “Pirates of the Caribbean” star also claimed Heard’s relationship with Tesla founder Elon Musk began a month after the former couple got married in 2015. 
The actor also sparked concerns last June when photos emerged of him looking frail and gaunt. Fans questioned whether Depp’s emaciated appearance was due to his public divorce with Heard, which a source previously told Fox News was “mentally draining” and took a toll financially for the actor.",PT1M47S,2d,hd,true,True,rectangular,processed,public,youtube,True,True,False,24,1,0,0,,,,

Johnny Depp arrived in London, where he is suing a tabloid newspaper for libel over an article that branded him a ""wife beater. ""On Tuesday, a judge at the High Court is due to begin hearing Depps claim against The Suns publisher, News Group Newspapers, and its executive editor, Dan Wootton, over the 2018 story alleging he was violent and abusive to then-wife Amber Heard.

They divorced in 2017, and now bitterly accuse one another of abuse.

The tabloids lawyers tried to have the suit thrown out on the grounds that Depp failed to disclose text messages he exchanged with an assistant showing that he tried to buy ""MDMA and other narcotics"" while he was in Australia with Heard in 2015. Heard alleges that Depp subjected her to ""a three-day ordeal of physical assaults"" while they were in the country after drinking and taking drugs.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

Johnny Depp and Amber Heard departed from Britain's High Court Thursday (16 JULY 2020) after another day's proceedings in Depp's libel suit against a British tabloid that accused him of assaulting his former spouse.
  
Depp is suing News Group Newspapers, publisher of The Sun, and the paper’s executive editor, Dan Wootton, over an April 2018 article that called him a “wife-beater.” He strongly denies abusing Heard.
  
On Thursday, Depp’s security chief alleged that Amber Heard physically abused Depp during the couple’s tempestuous marriage, giving testimony to support Depp’s claim.
In a written witness statement released as he appeared in court, security officer Sean Bett said that “throughout the course of Mr. Depp and Ms. Heard’s relationship, Ms. Heard was verbally and physically abusive towards Mr. Depp.""
  
“On many occasions, I witnessed her shout at Mr. Depp. I was also told by Mr. Depp on multiple occasions that Ms. Heard had physically abused him,” he said.
  
Bett, a former Los Angeles sheriff's deputy who has worked for Depp for a decade, said he regularly had to remove the “Pirates of the Caribbean” star from bad situations when Heard was in an “abusive mood.”
  
“Ms. Heard often behaved in this way when she had been drinking. I learnt quickly to recognize the signs, so that we were able to leave the situation before it escalated further,” he said.
  
Depp, 57, and Heard, 34, met on the set of the 2011 comedy “The Rum Diary” and married in Los Angeles in February 2015. Heard filed for divorce the following year, and the divorce was finalized in 2017.
  
The Sun’s defense relies on 14 allegations made by Heard of violence by Depp between 2013 and 2016, in settings including his private island in the Bahamas, a rented house in Australia and a private jet. He denies them all and claims Heard was the aggressor during their volatile relationship, which he has likened to “a crime scene waiting to happen.”
  
In a week and half of testimony, judge Andrew Nicol has heard from Depp - who accused Depp of compiling a dossier of fake claims against him - as well as several employees of Depp and Heard who have backed his version of events.
  
Heard is due to give her side of the story in evidence later in the trial, which is scheduled to last three weeks.
  
Bett was cross-examined Thursday by The Sun's lawyer, Sasha Wass, who questioned his claim that he had never seen Heard with bruises of marks on her face or body but had several times seen Depp with bruises inflicted by his wife.
  
Wass suggested Bett was lying to protect Depp, his employer.
  
“Ma’am you can call me a liar a hundred times. I’m not a liar. I’m telling the truth,"" Bett said.
  
Depp’s former romantic partners Vanessa Paradis and Winona Ryder had been scheduled to give evidence, but Depp's lawyer said Thursday that they would no longer be appearing.
  
David Sherborne, said Thursday that he no longer needed to call them, “much as it would have been a pleasure to have them here,” because The Sun does not contest Depp’s claim that he never hit them.
  
Depp and French singer Paradis had two children during a 14-year relationship that ended in 2012. American actress Ryder dated Depp between 1990 and 1993.
  
In a written witness statement disclosed in part at a pretrial hearing, Ryder said Depp ""was never, never violent towards me. He was never, never abusive at all towards me.”
  
Paradis said in a witness statement that she had always known Depp to be ""a kind, attentive, generous, and non-violent person and father.”

According to legal documents obtained by The Hollywood Reporter, Fairfax County judge Bruce D. White blocked Depp’s attempt to have Heard’s countersuit dismissed based on a new anti-SLAPP (strategic lawsuits against public participation) law passed in Virginia last year. This new legislation is intended to prevent people from using courts and the threat of lawsuits to intimidate people who are exercising their First Amendment rights. Those being sued most often invoke it to strike down a case because it involves speech on a matter of public concern. The judge cited precisely this lack of public concern as the reason to dismiss Depp’s request, adding that Heard has alleged sufficient facts to support her defamation claims, specifically “that Mr. Depp may have made these statements with actual or constructive knowledge or with reckless disregard for whether they are false.”
However, while Heard will be able to pursue her countersuit, the judge did throw out one aspect of her case that cited the Virginia Computer Crimes Act and claimed that Depp organized a social media bot attack against her to have her removed from Aquaman. White determined there was a lack of evidence to support this claim, explaining, “The pleading fails to demonstrate that the social media accounts communicated obscene language, suggested obscene acts, or threatened illegal or immoral acts. Rather, it appears that Mr. Depp texted those statements, privately, to two of his friends, and Ms. Heard has not alleged that Mr. Depp intended for her to see them.”

Depp is suing Heard for defamation in Virginia courts over a 2018 op-ed she wrote for The Washington Post in which she called herself a survivor of domestic abuse, although she never mentioned Depp by name. The actor is seeking $50 million in damages. Heard initially filed her defamation counterclaims in response to this suit after Depp’s attorney Adam Waldman called her allegations of domestic violence “fake” and a “sexual violence hoax” last year. The judge sided with Heard in this initial ruling, saying that Waldman’s statements were not protected opinion because “whether Mr. Depp abused Ms. Heard is a fact that is capable of being proven true or false.” He added that Depp’s and his attorney’s remarks “imply that Ms. Heard lied and perjured herself when she appeared before a court in 2016 to obtain a temporary restraining order against Mr. Depp” and “imply that she has lied about being a victim of domestic violence.” He continued, “In light of the #MeToo Movement and today’s social climate, falsely claiming abuse would surely ‘injure [Ms. Heard’s] reputation in the common estimation of mankind.’ Therefore, this Court finds that the statements contain the requisite ‘sting’ for an actionable defamation claim.”
In November, Depp lost his very high-profile libel case against The Sun over a 2018 headline dubbing him a “wife-beater,” which the judge deemed to be “substantially true,” although Depp has denied all instances of abuse.

Johnny Depp’s big libel case against The Sun’s parent company kicked off this week and already the testimonies and recollections have been a lot. First and foremost, we’ve heard from Amber Heard that Johnny Depp once dangled her dog outside of a car. Yes, one of the dogs that was involved in the immigration to Australia scandal a few years back.


The story goes like this: According to Amber Heard, Johnny Depp was set to film a documentary with Keith Richards of The Rolling Stones one day (this never came to fruition) and was in a foul mood. This was likely exacerbated by the fact that he was drunk and high, according to Heard's story. Whilst being driven to meet up with the rock ‘n’ roll star, Depp allegedly held one of Amber Heard’s two dogs, a terrier named Pistol, out of the car window. It is reported he also chose to “howl” like a dog during the car ride, finding the whole experience amusing.

Johnny Depp’s Hollywood career lay in tatters today as a High Court judge ruled he was violent abuser of wife Amber Heard during their tumultuous marriage.  

The Pirates of the Caribbean star, 57, played a high-stakes gamble when he sued The Sun for libel over a 2018 article branding him a “wife beater”.  

Depp and his expensively-assembled legal team called out actress Heard as a liar, branding the domestic abuse claims a “hoax” and insisting she had concocted a #MeToo story during their five-year romance.  

But in a blockbuster showdown this summer, Aquaman star Heard revealed how Depp had punched her in the face, repeatedly throttled her, dragged her around by her hair, and pelted her with bottles.

Johnny Depp has gotten himself another win in the ongoing feud between himself and Amber Heard. The win that Johnny secured was that despite Amber’s best efforts, the $50 million lawsuits against her will still goes ahead. Due to court documents obtained by Fox Business, the supposed reason that this suit will go ahead is that the suit is “inherently different” from the earlier UK case, which was about his abuse accusations.
