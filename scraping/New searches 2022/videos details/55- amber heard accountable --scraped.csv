This is a no BS zone.  BS will get shut out and shut down quickly.  I promote facts and some ""IMO's"" that not everyone may like or even agree with.

I invite everyone to chat freely during lives but be respectful of others and their feelings.  Speak as you would want someone to speak to you.  Old school rule:  You don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all.  I'm a Texas girl through and through.  If you like realness, no bs, and actual content... hit that subscribe button and the ALL notification bell. 

If you like drama all day... every day and no content.... I won't be the channel for you.  

If you like content with the occasional drama mixed in.... feel free to subscribe and tune in when the content fits you like a shoe.

All are welcome!  All opinions matter as long as they are respectful to myself and other's in chat.


Thanks,
