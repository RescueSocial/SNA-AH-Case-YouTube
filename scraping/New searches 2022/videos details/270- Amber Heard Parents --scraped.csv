Amber Peat was last seen at home in Mansfield in Nottinghamshire at 17:30 BST on Saturday.

At a press conference, her mother and stepfather said Amber's disappearance, from her home in Bosworth Street, was ""completely out of character"".

Fighting back tears, Kelly and Danny Peat said: ""We just want to know she is okay.""

Up to 300 people were involved in a search for Amber on Monday, with posters being placed in many houses and shops.
'Brilliant holiday'

""We just want her, or someone who knows where she is, to get in touch,"" Mr and Mrs Peat added.

Supt Matthew McFarlane, of Nottinghamshire Police, said they had had few leads in the inquiry, but a ""full-scale effort"" to find her was under way.

Mr Peat said: ""We had just all had a brilliant holiday. It's just not right.

She had a fantastic time, never stopped laughing with all of us together.""

Mrs Peat said ""nothing else happened"" that would lead to Amber leaving, apart from a disagreement over chores.
'No confirmed sightings'

She added: ""I was upstairs and I heard a door bang.

""I went downstairs and she wasn't around, so I looked outside and she was nowhere.""

They confirmed Amber had left without her mobile phone or any money.

Supt McFarlane said: ""We've been involved in searching the area, and friends and family have also assisted with that.

""We've been speaking to all of her friends, all the inquiries through the school, through family, through anybody who may possibly know or have heard from her over the last three days.

郭采潔《2.Oak》 “No eye has seen In the name of me ”
你是一顆堅硬的石頭
甘願為人惦上一腳 看得更好
一顆堅硬的石頭在急流裡
像一座島

噢 其實你是一棵樹
長了滿頭禮物

小石頭
在路上開過
和風一起作用。

曾經隨意的看到一幅隨手畫
上頭寫著：
today I’m going to be a girl,
tomorrow I will be a boy.
一根蘿蔔奮力的從地裡向艷陽奔去⋯

2.Oak
一篇以野性生長為命題的禱文
一首
誕生卻含著遺憾的哀歌
然而
世界要人堅硬
一切的機會，為成全生命

以自己的名
以自己的名
重寫一首慶祝誕生的歌曲

導語：「親愛的我」是網易音樂人發起女性合輯企劃第2季，邀請春曉、郭采潔、劉忻、祁紫檀、Sunnee楊蕓晴、蘇詩丁、楊默依7位女性音樂人，一起通過音樂來關註那個最親愛的、卻常常被忽略的自我。這或許不是最好的我，卻是命運般的最親愛的我。希望每個女孩都能在音樂中獲得力量，更加了解自己、接納自己、學會愛自己。每一個「我」，都是最值得被愛的人~

delicatebirdak：在這首歌的簡介里，我寫了一個蘿蔔奮力地從地里向艷陽奔去。這個奮力的蘿卜，就是最開始對於這次創作的畫面，有一股特別強壯的力量。

Parents are the pride of their children
I was called to one hope when I was born
Possibility, opportunity
Those are the air I breathe to live
You don’t know me
You don’t know
A discerning heart
A discerning rock
Don’t you know how good is a timely word
How good is a timely word
Say,
You love me,Ginty my love
You love me
No eye has seen
In the name of me
No ear has heard
In the name of me, No
No mind has conceived
In the name of me
In the name of me
It takes a life-long to end a story

Fourteen years on Christmas,
2021/12/25
Amber Kuo brings to the season a new work: 
2.Oak 
A hymn to celebrate the birth of her own name; the oak of February, thick or thin, is strong and stable, full of spiritual respect. 
A prayer with the proposition of wild growth
Born with a sad song 
However
The world is hard
All opportunities for the fulfillment of life

郭采潔《2.Oak》 “No eye has seen In the name of me ”
你是一顆堅硬的石頭
甘願為人惦上一腳 看得更好
一顆堅硬的石頭在急流裡
像一座島

噢 其實你是一棵樹
長了滿頭禮物

小石頭
在路上開過
和風一起作用。

曾經隨意的看到一幅隨手畫
上頭寫著：
today I’m going to be a girl,
tomorrow I will be a boy.
一根蘿蔔奮力的從地裡向艷陽奔去⋯

2.Oak
一篇以野性生長為命題的禱文
一首
誕生卻含著遺憾的哀歌
然而
世界要人堅硬
一切的機會，為成全生命

以自己的名
以自己的名
重寫一首慶祝誕生的歌曲

導語：「親愛的我」是網易音樂人發起女性合輯企劃第2季，邀請春曉、郭采潔、劉忻、祁紫檀、Sunnee楊蕓晴、蘇詩丁、楊默依7位女性音樂人，一起通過音樂來關註那個最親愛的、卻常常被忽略的自我。這或許不是最好的我，卻是命運般的最親愛的我。希望每個女孩都能在音樂中獲得力量，更加了解自己、接納自己、學會愛自己。每一個「我」，都是最值得被愛的人~

delicatebirdak：在這首歌的簡介里，我寫了一個蘿蔔奮力地從地里向艷陽奔去。這個奮力的蘿卜，就是最開始對於這次創作的畫面，有一股特別強壯的力量。

Parents are the pride of their children
I was called to one hope when I was born
Possibility, opportunity
Those are the air I breathe to live
You don’t know me
You don’t know
A discerning heart
A discerning rock
Don’t you know how good is a timely word
How good is a timely word
Say,
You love me,Ginty my love
You love me
No eye has seen
In the name of me
No ear has heard
In the name of me, No
No mind has conceived
In the name of me
In the name of me
It takes a life-long to end a story

Fourteen years on Christmas,
2021/12/25
Amber Kuo brings to the season a new work: 
2.Oak 
A hymn to celebrate the birth of her own name; the oak of February, thick or thin, is strong and stable, full of spiritual respect. 
A prayer with the proposition of wild growth
Born with a sad song 
However
The world is hard
All opportunities for the fulfillment of life
