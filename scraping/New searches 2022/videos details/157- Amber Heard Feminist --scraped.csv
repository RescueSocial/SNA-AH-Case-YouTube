Because of that, she wanted to try her hand playing a game from the #Feminism  anthology. It’s a collection of nano games written by women that focus on feminist issues. Amber played How to be Ava White by Eva Wei with Kristin and Brandon. This game is about the unrealistic expectations of being a woman. They donned roles of aspects that live in Ava White’s head and debated their fiercely held beliefs. There is a  long debrief after the debate so this episode is about 50% roleplay and 50% talk show.

Lecture/Workshop
Ignorant Fairies: New Materialist Queer-Feminist Political Ecological Approaches 
by Öznur Karakaş

In this workshop, we will be studying selected new materialist texts and works of art regarding non-human life, nature and matter in this digital era which also intersects with Anthropocene discussion starting from the beginning of 2000s to better confront the growing 'uncertainty' 'unintelligibility' of non human agency. Plant studies of Natasha Myer, the conception of nature in Staicy Alaimo's queer ecology and nature-culture entanglement in the bio-art works of Marta de Menezes will be discussed within the scope of the larger new materialist, post-human queer-feminist theoretical contributions.  The workshop will include a theoretical part to discuss the place of Nature, Matter and Body in Queer theory with a special emphasis on new materialist critics of Judith Butler's conception of body and performativity. Queer feminist theorists like Stacy Alaimo provide us with valuable tools to reconsider our conception of nature, body and matter in the post-digital world we live in which is gradually more construed around the tendency of dematerialization. Yet, recent discussions on Anthropocene and the growing interest towards developing a political ecology to cope with ramped-up uncertainties of a world afflicted with climate change, and unforeseen viral activities point towards the requirement to re-materialize our ties with the earth. The theoretical part of the workshop will thus give us a chance to reconsider what nature, matter and body signify in in the post-digital world with a special emphasis on Natasha Myer's """"becoming sensor"""" project, Stacy Alaimo's queer ecologies and Marta de Menezes' bioart.  It will also include an artistic-practical part where the participants will be instructed to practice Natasha Myer's Sensing Botanical Sensoria: A Kriya For Cultivating Your Inner Plant.

Yes that&rsquo;s right, somehow six years have gone by since the last time Fire On Your Head welcomed a female guest. Not because we&rsquo;re sexist, but like as I explained in the introduction, none of the people I&rsquo;ve invited on the podcast in recent years have gotten back to me.

We finally break that streak and welcome author of the forthcoming book, God&rsquo;s Feminist Movement, Amber Picota to the show. We discussed a lot of different things, such as:

-the pros and cons of repurposing blog content into a book,
-the challenges I faced when I published my first Kindle book
-how she scored a book contract with Destiny Image Publishers
-how her time so far in the Welton Academy also led to her going -through the Scripture with a new set of eyes to see things we&rsquo;re oftentimes conditioned to accept without question.
-God&rsquo;s Feminist Movement and what it is. We&rsquo;ve heard a lot of prophetic voices talk about how God is turning the hearts of the fathers to the hearts of the sons, but what about&hellip; the mothers?
-Amber shares her powerful testimony
and a lot more...

This week I critique the ideas of a commu.... ahem, feminist manifesto written by Amber Tamblyn for instructions on how men can be better allies for women.  
I don't know about you but I have never needed to wait for any man to help me do what I have always wanted to do, so......now we have this.
Let me know what you think.  

I always have some articles and another fun videos in the works. So Stay tuned and subscribe so you won't miss a thing.

Please consider donating to help me improve and grow my channel to include what you heard:  https://www.paypal.me/ldghwih
No tip too small.

Thanks again for visiting my little acre of the internet and I hope you enjoy my work.  
If you watched my first video, you know that my main goal is to grow my channel so that you can be a part of my show.  
Right now, I am operating on a shoestring with the most primitive of video producing equipment and many many doctor bills, but that is part of my plan to grow and improve as I go.  
I will be so excited when I finally get to add you all to the mix. 
I figure I gotta start somewhere, right?
