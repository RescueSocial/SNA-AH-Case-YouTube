Wassup....I'm Amber and I'm a Weirdo! I make videos that range from challenges, comedy skits, motivational videos, fashion, vlogging my everyday life, LGBT topics, and more.  I'm comfortable with who I am, and I'm not afraid to be open to the world. I first started my channel to help others that may be struggling with their identity, to break stereotypes, as well as to showcase my unique androgynous/tomboy style. 
Since I started, it's turned into so much more....and I truly LUV and appreciate my followers and supporters.  Welcome to the AmbersClosetArmy!",PT7M24S,2d,hd,false,True,rectangular,processed,public,youtube,True,False,False,27389,1623,0,144,en
