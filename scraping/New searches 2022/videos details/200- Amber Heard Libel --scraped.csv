Depp used a different entrance, and was ushered through a crowd by security staff.
After a week and a half of testimony from Depp and several current or former employees of Depp and Heard, Heard is due to give her side of the story as she enters the witness box.
The Sun's defence relies on 14 allegations made by Heard of violence by Depp between 2013 and 2016, in settings including his private island in the Bahamas, a rented house in Australia and a private jet.
Heard claims that Depp first hit her in 2013, and put her through a ""three-day hostage situation"" in Australia in 2015.
She also says he threw a bottle of champagne at her and pushed her onto the floor during her 30th birthday party in 2016.
Depp is suing News Group Newspapers, publisher of The Sun, and the paper's executive editor, Dan Wootton, over an April 2018 article that called him a ""wife-beater.""
He strongly denies abusing his ex-wife, Amber Heard.
He claims Heard was the aggressor during their volatile relationship, which he has likened to ""a crime scene waiting to happen.""

The Hollywood star (left in London last year) is trying to overturn a damning High Court ruling that he assaulted his ex-wife (right last year) and put her in fear for her life, and is asking the Court of Appeal to order a retrial of his libel claim against The Sun. Following a three-week trial in July last year, Mr Justice Nicol ruled that Mr Depp, 57, assaulted Ms Heard, 34, on a dozen occasions and put her in 'fear for her life' three times. The judge found that an April 2018 column calling Mr Depp a 'wife beater' was 'substantially true'.  He said 'a recurring theme in Mr Depp's evidence was that Ms Heard had constructed a hoax and that she had done this as an 'insurance policy', and that Ms Heard was a 'gold-digger'. But he added: 'I do not accept this characterisation of Ms Heard.' Today the actor's legal team (David Sherborne QC inset) was back in court to claim the star 'did not receive a fair trial' and is applying for permission to appeal against the ruling at the Royal Courts of Justice in London on Thursday. Neither Mr Depp nor Ms Heard (her lawyer Sasha Wass QC inset) were in court today.

Heard appeared to be wearing a similar outfit to the one she has worn to each day of Depp's libel action in the High Court, while Whitney - who is set to give evidence during her sister's trial - wore a blue jumpsuit.

Depp is suing News Group Newspapers, publisher of The Sun, and the paper’s executive editor, Dan Wootton, over an April 2018 article that said he’d physically abused ex-wife Amber Heard. 
The newspaper's lawyers plan to use Heard's allegations of abuse by Depp to defend the “wife beater” claim.
The trial opened on Tuesday. 
It is one of the first major cases to be held in person since Britain began to lift its coronavirus lockdown.
Depp, 57, and Heard, 34, met on the set of the 2011 comedy “The Rum Diary” and married in Los Angeles in February 2015. They divorced in 2017 and now bitterly accuse one another of abuse.
While Heard isn't on trial, the case is also a showdown between the former spouses, who accuse each other of being controlling, violent and deceitful.
It is set to put the two performers’ complex private lives under a microscope.
Depp is also suing Heard in the United States for 50 million US dollars for allegedly defaming him in a Washington Post article about domestic abuse. 
That case is due to be heard next year.

Description:
The case that had a global attention has finally concluded and it is terrible news for millions of Johnny Depp fans as he has lost his highly publicized libel case against the publisher of Britain's The Sun newspaper. The newpaper has earlier claimed that the Pirates Of Caribbean actor was an abusive husband and a wife beater referring to his married life with ex-wife Amber Heard. 
Johnny Depp has sued “The Sun’s executive Director” Dan Wootton and News Group Newspapers over an article accusing the actor of being involved in domestic violence and physical altercation towards Amber Heard when they were together. 
But on Monday, November 2nd, 2020 the UK high court has ruled in favor of the tabloid. But does it mean the court has also confirmed Johnny Depp as a “Wife Beater”? 
As reported by CNN: 
Citing evidence, including photos, audio recordings and Depp's own text messages, lawyers for the newspaper group argued in court filings that Depp ""beat his wife Amber Heard, causing her to suffer significant injury, and on occasion leading to her fearing for her life.""
Judge Andrew Nicol has passed a historical judgment favoring the News outlet and categorically mentioned the claims made by the News Outlet are substantially true. 
""I have reached these conclusions having examined in detail the 14 incidents on which the defendants rely, as well as the over-arching considerations which the claimant submitted I should take into account,"" the judge said.
During the trial Depp has admitted having problem with drugs and alcohol but has always denied the accusation of being violent with his partner. 
The case was highly publicized and got heated in the month of July this year and Amber Heard has narrated her side of story acknowledging the tabloid’s claim to be correct. 
""When Johnny puts his attention on you, with all his intensity and darkness, it is unlike anything I've ever experienced,"" she said in a written witness statement submitted to the court.
""Some incidents were so severe that I was afraid he was going to kill me, either intentionally or just by losing control and going too far. He explicitly threatened to kill me many times, especially later in our relationship,"" Heard told the court, according to the UK's PA Media news agency.
The tabloid is one of the subsidiaries owned by Media Magnet Rupert Murdoch released a statement following the verdict: 
""The Sun has stood up and campaigned for the victims of domestic abuse for over 20 years. Domestic abuse victims must never be silenced and we thank the judge for his careful consideration and thank Amber Heard for her courage in giving evidence to the court.""  
Now it will be interesting to see if Amber Heard is motivated to pursue it further and take legal action for what has already been substantiated by London High Court, or it’s the case closed.

The Claimant was not violent towards Ms Heard, it was she who was violent to him.” Actor Johnny Depp arrives at the High Court in London, Britain July 7, 2020. REUTERS/Peter Nicholls In papers submitted to the court, Depp’s team also said Heard had begun an affair with Tesla chief executive Elon Musk in early 2015 shortly after they had got married and had engaged in at least one extra-marital relationship with her co-stars, with actor James Franco named.  Depp’s lawyers also said he was the victim of attacks from his ex-wife and had himself sought to avoid confrontation.  THREE-WEEK CASE  The couple met on the set of the 2011 film “The Rum Diary” and married in February 2015. Heard filed for divorce after 15 months and days later obtained a restraining order against Depp.   Their divorce was finalised in 2017 when the restraining order was dismissed.  Lawyers for The Sun said they will suggest Depp is either a “pathological liar or his excessive alcohol and drug abuse have detached him from any insight into his own conduct”.  Cross-examined by lawyer Sasha Wass, Depp agreed he had taken “every drug known to man” by the age of 14 and said he had had a difficult childhood and struggled to come to terms with his fame and success.  “Even when I speak my own name it sounds foreign to me,” he said.

Johnny Depp arrived at the High Court in London on Thursday (23 JULY 2020) on what is the final day of Amber Heard's testimony in Depp's libel case against a British tabloid over allegations of domestic violence.
Taking the witness box for a fourth straight day, Heard reiterated allegations of abuse when Depp was on a “bender” that would often last days.
“Johnny, when he was clean and sober, could be a wonderful person, generous, loving,” she said. “He’s a remarkable man when he’s like that and I loved him. The other side of him was a monster but I always held out hope he would get clean and sober.”
In her first three days of testimony, Heard, 34, has accused Depp of an array of acts of violence, including throwing bottles at her “like grenades,” headbutting her and even of stubbing out a cigarette on his cheek. She has claimed that she often feared for her life during their tempestuous relationship.
Depp denies abusing Heard and claims she was the aggressor during their tempestuous relationship. 
Depp, 57, is suing The Sun, specifically its publisher, News Group Newspapers, and its executive editor, Dan Wootton, for labeling him in an April 2018 article as a “wife-beater.” 
The Sun’s defense relies on 14 allegations made by Heard of violence by Depp between 2013 and 2016, in settings as varied as a rented house in Australia, his private island in the Bahamas and a private jet. 
The case is due to finish next week with closing submissions from both sides’ legal teams on Monday and Tuesday.

Actor Johnny Depp and his ex-wife, actress Amber Heard arrived at the High Court in London on Wednesday (8 JULY 2020) for the second day of a three-week trial over his libel case against a British newspaper.
Depp is suing British tabloid The Sun over an April 2018 story headlined “Potty - How can JK Rowling be ‘genuinely happy’ casting wife beater Johnny Depp in the new Fantastic Beasts film?” 
The newspaper's lawyers plan to use Heard's allegations of abuse by Depp to defend the “wife beater” claim.
The trial over his libel claims opened Tuesday. 
It is one of the first major cases to be held in person since Britain began to lift its coronavirus lockdown.
Depp, 57, and Heard, 34, met on the set of the 2011 comedy “The Rum Diary” and married in Los Angeles in February 2015. They divorced in 2017, and now bitterly accuse one another of abuse.
While Heard isn't on trial, the case is also a showdown between the former spouses, who accuse each other of being controlling, violent and deceitful.
 It is set to put the two performers’ complex private lives under a microscope.
Depp is also suing Heard in the United States for 50 million US dollars for allegedly defaming him in a Washington Post article about domestic abuse. 
That case is due to be heard next year.

The newspaper's lawyers plan to use Heard's allegations of abuse by Depp to defend the “wife beater” claim.
The trial over his libel claims opened Tuesday. 
It is one of the first major cases to be held in person since Britain began to lift its coronavirus lockdown.
Depp, 57, and Heard, 34, met on the set of the 2011 comedy “The Rum Diary” and married in Los Angeles in February 2015. They divorced in 2017, and now bitterly accuse one another of abuse.
While Heard isn't on trial, the case is also a showdown between the former spouses, who accuse each other of being controlling, violent and deceitful.
 It is set to put the two performers’ complex private lives under a microscope.
Depp is also suing Heard in the United States for 50 million US dollars for allegedly defaming him in a Washington Post article about domestic abuse. 
That case is due to be heard next year.

The actor is seeking to overturn a ruling that he assaulted Heard during the couple's marriage.

The Hollywood star is seeking permission to appeal a High Court ruling in November, when he lost his libel lawsuit against The Sun newspaper for labelling him a “wife beater”.

At the conclusion of today’s appeal hearing Lord Justice Underhill and Lord Justice Dingemans said the court would give its ruling at a later date.

In his 129-page judgment, Nicol also wrote that there was sufficient evidence that the Pirates of the Caribbean actor, 57, had physically assaulted Heard, 34, at least 12 of the 14 times she claimed he did.  “I accept her evidence of the nature of the assaults he committed against her. They must have been terrifying,” the judge wrote. “I accept that Mr. Depp put her in fear of her life.”  Nicol also stated that Heard’s allegations “have had a negative effect on her career as an actor and activist.” Previously, the actress said that she was “subjected to a campaign of targeted online abuse on social media as well as online petitions calling for [her] to be removed from any future sequel to Aquaman and from [her] association with L’Oréal,” according to her witness statement from March.  The Way They Were: Amber Heard and Johnny Depp's Relationship Timeline   Heard alleged that Depp struck her multiple times. He denied the allegations and accused her of having hit him. While speaking to the court, Heard recounted this 2015 incident and explained she was protecting her sister, Whitney Heard, claiming her ex tried to shove Whitney down a flight of stairs.  Depp and Heard first met in 2009 on the set of The Rum Diary and tied the knot in 2015. She filed for divorce in 2016 and obtained a temporary restraining order against the actors which was ultimately dropped. After their divorce was finalized in 2017, Heard donated the $7 million settlement to various charities.  Following Judge Nichol’s ruling, Heard’s lawyer, Elaine Charlson Bredehoft, told the New York Times that judgment was “not a surprise” and that she is “committed to obtaining justice” in the United States, where Heard and Depp are set to appear in court over a Washington Post op-ed she wrote in December 2018. In a statement to Reuters, Depp’s British law firm, Schillings, called the judgement “as perverse as it is bewildering.”  “The judgment is so flawed that it would be ridiculous for Mr. Depp not to appeal this decision,” the statement read.  If you or someone you know is experiencing domestic violence, please call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-7233 for confidential support.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZuQLmq4NSpM/default.jpg,120,90,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZuQLmq4NSpM/mqdefault.jpg,320,180,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZuQLmq4NSpM/hqdefault.jpg,480,360,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZuQLmq4NSpM/sddefault.jpg,640.0,480.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZuQLmq4NSpM/maxresdefault.jpg,1280.0,720.0,Metro News,"['Amber Heard', 'Johnny Depp']",22,none,"Johnny Depp Loses Libel Case, Judge Rules He Assaulted Ex-Wife Amber Heard","Actor Johnny Depp lost his libel case against Britain’s The Sun newspaper after they called him a “wife beater” in 2018, after a tumultuous relationship with ex-wife Amber Heard, Us Weekly confirmed on Monday, November 2.  Judge Andrew Nicol from the Royal Courts of Justice in London ruled that the publication’s allegation was “substantially true,” according to court documents obtained by Us Weekly.
