CAST:
Rose Hathaway - Lyndsy Fonseca
Lissa Dragomir - Amber Heard
Dimitri Belikov - Henry Cavill

VAMPIRE ACADEMY BY RICHELLE MEAD
St Vladimir's Academy isn't just any boarding school - hidden away, it's a place where vampires are educated in the ways of magic and half-human teens train to protect them.

Rose Hathaway is a Dhampir, a bodyguard for her best friend Lissa, a Moroi Vampire Princess. They've been on the run, but now they're being dragged back to St Vladimir's where the girls must survive a world of forbidden romances, a ruthless social scene and terrifying night time rituals.

CLIPS USED: 
Kick-Ass, And Soon The Darkness, All the Boys love Mandy Lane, One Tree Hill, Nikita, Dorian Gray, the Hitcher, the Covenant, Tristan and Isolde, Sky High, The Vampire Diaries (1x01) and a video I found on youtube.

SONGS: 
Doves - There goes the fear
Hammock - Like starlight into day
The Glitch Mob - Between two points

VOICEOVERS:
""Hey Gorgeous."" (Rose)
""Hoes over Bros."" (Rose)
""Buds over studs."" (Lissa)
""What?"" (Lissa)

hi! 
thank you all very much for voting and helping me to find the perfect dimtri.
the votes say this:
Henry: 11
Lyndsy: 23
Odette: 13
Ben: 16
Sophia: 6

now you're probably wondering why I used henry then. it's because he definitely got the looks of dimitri and I wanted the trailer to fit as much as possible. he only has that long hair in tristan and isolde, so there aren't many clips to use for videos. but for the trailer is was enough at least :)
next videos will probably change cast everytime.
first one with ben, next one with henry. :P
thanks again ♥

Yet, cypherpunks and national security experts alike have long warned of the increasing use of cyberspace as an extension of nation-state politics. In parallel, tech startups that that moved fast, broke things, and pledged to ""do no evil"" have turned into systemically important parts of social, political, and commercial infrastructure that cross global jurisdictions. 

In this frank discussion, Clovyr Co-founder & CEO Amber Baldet looks at how new technologies at the intersection of cryptography and distributed systems are helping us push back against the ongoing aggregation of data in the hands of a few, dissect why prior efforts to check such power accumulation failed, and see how this all intersects with the next generation of enterprise infrastructure.

And finally, because it’s unlawful. However, have you ever heard of a Prime Ministerial candidate who promises to promote corruption if he wins?

His party has different agenda from all other parties which believes in slashing defence budget, improving tax system, making judiciary, police and Election Commission of Pakistan free from political influence and interference, fair accountability with special focus on eradication of corruption. Mega projects in health and education sectors are also his party agenda, the chairman says.
Amber Shahzada is the candidate who knows the art of contesting election with ‘small amount of money’ which he says is sponsored by his friends and fans on every election, and strongly condemns the purchased-victory and votes. However, he does not know how much expenses incur on his election every year.
I think that politicians could be corrupt, but only as required and not as they wish. If my government comes into power, I will minimise corruption and legalise it. If someone less corrupt comes into power, the country will progress.”
Shahzada always wears a Turkish-style hat, and sports a handlebar moustache, and is very active on his twitter account. He has announced his plans to contest for NA-125, a constituency for the National Assembly of Pakistan in Lahore. He is up against the major political parties in Pakistan and Maryam Nawaz, former prime minister Nawaz Sharif’s daughter, who will contest as an independent candidate.

“It is my firm belief that I’ll be victorious when Election Commission will be completely impartial, when the census will be held truly on real grounds, and police will stop interference into political system,” Shehzada speaks, making specific gesture with both his hands

Discover the best wine competition in the world in Battle of the Wines and learn about wine and winemaking at the same time.  Meet some great wine personalities, with blind tasting by the judges in exotic locations.  These judges are a mixture of wine experts, passionate wine enthusiasts and entry-level drinkers.........""WineyPeople"".

This ""Battle"" is in our ""Skin Contact"" group, one of 16 categories that will be decided as we work towards category and a single competition winner - with over 300 of the best wines from all over the globe participating.

In this ""Battle"", the ""Nominators"" are leading Australian wine writer Katie Spain and the winemaker himself Lado Uzunashvili from Georgia.

Battle of the Wines took its initial inspiration from a 1224 poem La Bataille des Vins (Battle of the Wines) by 13th century Norman poet Henry d’Andeli. It tells the story of the first famous wine competition organised by the French King Philip Augustus, which drew over 70 wine samples mostly from northern and central France but some from as far away as Spain and Cyprus.  Probably to the surprise of many, a sweet Cypriot wine widely believed to be an antecedent of modern Commandaria wines was the winner.

Let's see what surprise results emerge as the competition progresses!
