Guyger's defense attorneys questioned whether Creuzot violated a gag order by discussing the case in an interview with KDFW-TV (Channel 4). The gag order prevents prosecutors and the defense from speaking publicly about the case.

entered the Dallas, Texas, apartment of Botham Jean and fatally shot him. 
Guyger said that she had entered the apartment believing it was her own and that she shot Jean believing he was a burglar.

 The fact that Guyger, a white police officer, shot and killed Jean, an unarmed black man, and was initially only charged with manslaughter resulted in protests and accusations of racial bias 

On October 1, 2019, Guyger was found guilty of murder.
 The next day, she received a sentence of ten years in prison

Joshua Brown, Brown, 28, testified in Guyger’s trial about the September 2018 night that Jean was killed, saying he was in a hallway on the fourth floor, where he and Jean lived. 

He said he heard what sounded like “two people meeting by surprise” and then two gunshots.

Brown, who became emotional at times and used his T-shirt and tissues to wipe his tears, said he had met Jean, a 26-year-old accountant from the Caribbean island nation of St Lucia, for the first time earlier that day.,

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.
