Johnny Depp appears at the end of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them as the villainous Grindelwald, and will have a larger role in the sequel, an unsettling prospect for many considering the domestic abuse allegations leveled against him by his ex-wife Amber Heard. The two reached a settlement after her suit, and issued a statement that read “our relationship was intensely passionate and at times volatile, but always bound by love. Neither party has made false accusations for financial gains.” Despite a Hollywood climate that has recently cracked down on abusive men in power such as Harvey Weinstein, director David Yates told Entertainment Weekly that he has no concerns about working with Depp. “Honestly, there’s an issue at the moment where there’s a lot of people being accused of things, they’re being accused by multiple victims, and it’s compelling and frightening,” Yates said. “With Johnny, it seems to me there was one person who took a pop at him and claimed something. I can only tell you about the man I see every day: He’s full of decency and kindness, and that’s all I see. Whatever accusation was out there doesn’t tally with the kind of human being I’ve been working with.”


Yates also noted that Depp’s exes, including Winona Ryder, have spoken positively of him. “By testament, some of the women in [Depp’s] life have said the same thing — ‘that’s not the human being we know,’” Yates said. “It’s very different [than cases] where there are multiple accusers over many years that need to be examined and we need to reflect on our industry that allows that to roll on year in and year out. Johnny isn’t in that category in any shape or form. So to me, it doesn’t bear any more analysis. It’s a dead issue.”",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5SClPhvoOHE/default.jpg,120,90,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5SClPhvoOHE/mqdefault.jpg,320,180,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5SClPhvoOHE/hqdefault.jpg,480,360,love tv,"[""'Fantastic Beasts' director David Yates defends Johnny Depp despite Amber Heard’s abuse accusations""]",22,none,'Fantastic Beasts' director David Yates defends Johnny Depp despite Amber Heard’s abuse accusations,"'Fantastic Beasts' director David Yates defends keeping Johnny Depp despite Amber Heard’s abuse accusations

When Amber Heard alleged that she was not to blame at the hands of her ex-husband actor Johnny Depp his career took a dive. Regardless of the lack of evidence, the media chose to believe Heard and the biggest film studios followed suit. This led to Johnny Depp losing some of his biggest roles. However, the tables have turned and now Amber Heard is finding that her career as an A-list Hollywood actress might be over. 

The allegations first surfaced in 2016, when the #MeToo and #BelieveAllWomen movements were fresh on the minds of the Hollywood press and film producers. So, when Amber Heard came forth with a black eye and accused her, then, husband Johnny Depp of physically abusing her the Hollywood press and film industry took her side without questioning it.

Ever since the divorce of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp was filed, there has been a stream of new information leaked in regard to their strange situation. 

Amber Heard accused Johnny Depp of several horrifying things throughout the course of their marriage. However, more evidence has been discovered that proves a lot of what she has claimed has been false.

Amber Heard spent most of her second day of evidence in Johnny Depp's libel case against a British tabloid dismissing accusations that she fabricated allegations of domestic violence against her ex-husband.
Taking to the witness box Tuesday (21 JULY 2020) at the High Court in London, the actress faced a barrage of questions over alleged incidents that are central to The Sun's labeling of Depp in an April 2018 article as a ""wife beater.""
Depp, 57, is suing The Sun's publisher, News Group Newspapers, and the paper's executive editor, Dan Wootton, over the article. The Hollywood star strongly denies abusing Heard and was at the court to hear his ex-wife.
His lawyer, Eleanor Laws, sought to show inconsistencies in Heard's allegations, accusing her of weaving a ""web of lies.""
""You're making this up as you go along at times,"" Laws said to Heard, to which the 34-year-old actress replied: ""All this happened to me and I remember it.""
The actress has alleged that Depp threw a phone at her ""like he was a baseball pitcher,"" hitting her on the right cheek and eye.
Heard said she wears makeup when leaving home that could have camouflaged any injury.
""Of course I had an injury,"" she said.
Laws also questioned Heard about text messages she sent Depp in the days after the alleged incident and about why she hadn't filed a restraining order immediately.
""I thought it could stay under wraps for a few days and those few days were a precious few days in the hardest time of my life, and presumably difficult for Johnny as well, and I would have done anything to have those few days of privacy,"" Heard said.
Heard also denied she had an ""illicit relationship"" with anyone during her time with Depp, specifically with either Tesla CEO Elon Musk or actor James Franco. ""Not that that matters much,"" Heard said.
Laws read out text messages on May 22, 2016, in which Heard allegedly tells Musk she is going to obtain a restraining order against Depp, and the billionaire offers to ""arrange 24/7 security.""
Musk allegedly said the offer would stand, ""even if you never wanted to see me again ... anyway, sorry for being an idiot. The radio silence hurts a lot. It only matters because I really like you.""
On Monday, during her first day of testimony, Heard accused her ex-husband of abusing her both physically and verbally while he was allegedly bingeing on alcohol and drugs, claiming that at various times during their tempestuous relationship she feared for her life.
Depp and Heard met on the set of the comedy ""The Rum Diary,"" released in 2011. They married in Los Angeles in February 2015. Heard filed for divorce the following year, and it was finalized in 2017.
In the first nine days of testimony at the High Court, judge Andrew Nicol heard from Depp and from several current or former employees who backed his version of events. In his testimony, Depp said he was the one being abused by Heard and that she had a history of being violent against him.
Via audio recordings of the couple discussing various incidents played in court, Depp's lawyer sought to show that Heard admitted she had been violent against Depp. Heard said any contact was purely self-defense.
""That is what happens when you are in this situation, that's the truth,"" she said. ""I knew better than to fight with him about the details of the fight, and what he perceived as injuries to him. My job was to say sorry and get him on track, and move on to bigger things.""
Heard said the ""information"" was ""fresh"" in her mind at the time of the alleged incident and that she reacted ""in a flash"" to protect her sister.
