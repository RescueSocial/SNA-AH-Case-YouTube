Fans recently got their first real look at the highly anticipated  Aquaman  movie when the first trailer  (finally) saw the light of day at last months San Diego Comic-Con. Among the other importanttidbits released about the movie from SDCC was Momoas revelation that Arthur Curry  wears denim pants in the poster , not leather as was originally thought. The trailer itself was of course filled with revelations of its own, includinga first look at the movies sprawling version of Atlantis, as well as hints about the  origins of Black Mantis . One other recent reveal from  Aquaman  director James Wan , that there will be no  Justice League  team  cameos in the movie, may come as something of a disappointment to some fans. Clearly, many DC fans are very excited about the movie as evidenced by all the  tweets about  Aquaman  during Comic-Con , not to mention  the cleverfan trailers  that have come out since the real trailer first dropped. Related: Aquaman Trailer Breakdown: 25 Secrets You Missed For Aquaman fans who just cant get enough glimpses of what the movie has in store,  EW  has exclusively released a new photo from the film that helps build the intrigue. In the image, Amber Heards Mera and Jason Momoas casually dressed Arthur Curry are seen in a chamber apparently inside a ruin within one of the Seven Kingdoms of Atlantis having a look at a very mysterious piece of technology. By the looks on their faces, theyre very happy to have stumbled across this particular object. See the photo below: Theres a definite Indiana Jones - specifically  Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull  - feel to the scene, with its stone walls, ancient-looking sculptures and the piece of technology itself, which Wan has revealed is actually a device used to play back an ancient recording. Mera and Arthur are here seeking clues as part of their quest to find the Trident of Neptune so they can use it in their battle against Aquamans half-brother King Orm (Patrick Wilson). It should be no surprise that theres a distinct Indiana Jones vibeto not only the plot but the above still, as Wan has revealed the Indiana Jones movies helped inspire his take on Aquaman. As the particular setting featured above is in fact located in Africa, the scene shown likely happens not long after the famous moment from the  Aquaman  trailer where Mera and Arthur both leap from a plane into the desert without parachutes (theyre also wearing the same costumes as in that scene from the trailer). Among the many mysteries the movie will have to clear up is how they both manage to survive their plane leap, sincetheres nothing but sand dunes underneath them.

In this audio The Mental Marketer discusses his entrepreneurial journey and How You Can Start An Online Business Selling Digital Products.
.
You might say...
. 
Well, what's a Digital Product ââ ð¤
.
Great question...
.
A Digital Product is an intangible asset or piece of media that can be sold and distributed repeatedly online without the need to replenish inventory..
.
So, literally, you create it ONCE and you can sell it an INFINITE amount of times...
.
Without ever having to order more when the supply runs low, or carry any inventory...
.
(Way better than selling t-shirts for $15 bucks a piece and only making $5 after all expenses ð¤·)
.
What makes Digital Products really cool is the fact that they can be a business all by themselves, or they can be used to increase the value of an existing product or business.
.
And...
.
The Global market size for Digital Products was 336.14 Billion in 2020 and is expected to reach 400.34 Billion by the end of this year.
.
(Billion, with a B â¼... it's not a typo)
.
So, yeah...
.
Selling Digital products online is a really HOT topic right now.
.
And our conversation brought the heat ð¥

For the eighth year, Kern County will come together on Saturday, Sept. 25, in the fight against impaired driving to proclaim, âNo More Victims!â

Bakersfieldâs Walk Like MADD & MADD Dash â presented by Chain | Cohn | Stiles â is Kern Countyâs chance to do something about drunk and drugged driving in our community. In what has become one of the largest fundraising walks and runs in town, the event brings together people from our community â surviving victims of crashes, families and friends of injured and deceased victims, law enforcement, prosecutors, first responders, advocates, and community leaders and members â to march, rally and run for the cause.

Our community has seen at least 4,000 DUI arrests made each year, according to the Kern County District Attorneyâs Office â nearly 12 DUI arrests per day. Kern County ranks worst in the state for DUI crashes resulting in injuries, and second most in the United States. And during this pandemic, fatal crash rates have spiked, with speeding, lower seatbelt use, and impaired driving to blame.

âImpaired driving continues to be one of the leading causes of fatalities and injuries on our roadways, with devastating consequences for all involved, especially innocent bystanders,â said Carla Pearson, MADD Kern Countyâs victim services specialist. âLetâs all remember and remind our loved ones that these crashes are 100% preventable.â

Walk Like MADD & MADD Dash has three main components:
1) Remember: We walk for those who no longer can and alongside those who are learning to walk again.
2) Inspire: We walk empowered even when we feel powerless, as survivors when we have been victimized, and with purpose when we have lost our way.
3) Commit: We walk with supporters who share our vision of No More Victims.

At the state level, the MADD Campaign to Eliminate Drunk Driving calls for high-visibility law enforcement, ignition interlocks or âin-car breathalyzersâ for all convicted drunk drivers, and support for the development of advanced technology.

Funds raised in Kern Countyâs event funds local educational programs and prevention services, raises awareness of the DUI problem in our local communities, and provides support to local victims and survivors of impaired driving crashes.

Presented by the local law firm Chain | Cohn | Stiles, itâs also supported this year by Chevron, Valley Strong Credit Union, Kern County Prosecutors Association, Sally Herald Accountancy Inc., and others. Since the first Bakersfield Walk Like MADD in 2014, thousands of local residents have made their voices heard while raising more than $400,000 for MADD Kern County.
