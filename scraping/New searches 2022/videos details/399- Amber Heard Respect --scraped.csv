The FACTS,"We're discussing Heartland TV Show's main cast members, Amber Marshall and Graham Wardle aka Amy Fleming and Ty Borden. Heartland has been a part of our lives for the past 15 years. Sometimes, we feel like we grew up with them. When Ty Borden died, Amy Fleming is left alone as a single mother, which felt so unfair for many fans. For many, it was almost certain that Amy and Ty will inherit the Heartland ranch one day but now, with the death of Ty Borden, everything became ambiguous. Suddenly, we struggled in having any idea about what will happen next in the show. A considerable amount of fans, however, were okay with losing Ty. “Why?” you may ask. Well, because, they assumed Ty and Amy were together in real life. Yes, you heard it right. Since the couple’s on-screen chemistry was too realistic, many assumed that they were already a real couple, meaning that Amber Marshall and Graham Wardle were dating in real life.

What do you think about Amy and Ty? Would you wish for the couple to be together in real life? Do you think Ty should return to the show? Let us know what you think in the comments below.

Today, Chris talks with Maelisa Hall and Amber Hawley, expert networkers and cohosts of the My Biz Bestie podcast.

For many people, networking can be awkward and uncomfortable. Maelisa and Amber help our listeners build their social muscles and give healthy approaches to relationship building.

Episode highlights
How do they get comfortable connecting with people and networking?
What is modern-day networking about and how is it a long game?
How it is important to be a trustworthy source in relationships
They share the one thing you need that will push you out of your comfort zone
If you do have a goal for a relationship, when is the right time to present your ‘ask’
