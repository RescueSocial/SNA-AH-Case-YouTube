Abnormal behaviour and pain is a hugely important topic. Recent work from the team at Lincoln University suggests that between 28-82% of clinical behaviourists‚Äô workload may be associated with underlying painful conditions! Amber explains that we must be vigilant for changes in behaviour, because the term ‚Äòabnormal behaviour‚Äô means anything out of the normal for that specific dog. Suggesting that deleterious/abnormal behaviours are only those that fall into specific categories such as repetitive or fear-based, will overlook a myriad presentations that are abnormal for that dog and suggest there is an underlying cause driving them that needs investigating. Amber then goes on to present common abnormal behaviours and the categories into which they fall, giving great case examples of dogs that she has seen. The pair take a tangent and discuss the gut microbiome and emerging evidence of its role in the central nervous system and behaviour. There is so much to learn regarding the biome, but there‚Äôs a lot of speculative material circulating rather than hard clear evidence and Amber clarifies that bold statements regarding what to feed and when are not within reach yet. Finally, the two bring the conversation back to abnormal behaviours and pain and answer a number of questions posed by CAM followers such as whether we should avoid medications so as to preserve the biome, and how to improve communication with your vet.

After a brief recap on the importance of sleep, Amber talks in more detail about the effect of various medications on sleep quality and notes that some medication which is thought to aid sleep actually disrupts sleep patterns. She then moves on to exercise and sleep quality starting with an explanation of the kind of exercise that dogs have evolved to do as scavengers rather than hunters. Their bodies are more suited to longer duration, slower-paced activity and short bursts of high intensity, high speed movement can adversely affect the quality of their sleep.
