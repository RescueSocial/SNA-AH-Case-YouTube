With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

Amber Heard lawsuits seem to backfire as Johnny Depp appeals to court while investigations and evidence seem to point and turn against Amber Heard losing the court case and facing some jail time if the court rules in favor of umbrella guy Johnny Depp. According to celebrity breaking news so far apparently, Johnny Depp suing Amber Heard for defamation is a celebrate news win for that umbrella guy Johnny Depp. However, amber heard news which concerns fans who recognize amber from the Aquaman 2 movie, tend to rumor if indeed is amber heard in Aquaman 2 movie. Who will be her replacement if get jail time, and even if she does not get sentenced to jail time she should be replaced regardless.

Is Amber Heard going to jail? We will tell you at the end of this video. We will try to give you the whole story and what possible sentence Amber Heard could be facing for allegedly abusing Johnny Depp. This issue has been dragged for many years, but there seems to be an end in sight. Let’s tell you what we have so far. 

A famous American actress is known for Aquaman; Amber Heard could be heading to jail for perjury charges. We’ll explain. When it comes to Hollywood, there are A-list stars and then down to D-list. Think of Beyonce, and then Shangela from Drag Race, and A star is born. Both have careers in Hollywood, but I can bet that 70% of the people watching this video have never heard of Shangela, and another 50% do not know what Drag Race is. That is how you grade celebrities. Here Beyoncé is A-list, and Shangela is D-list. What has Amber Heard got to do with this listing? Well, we wanted to establish that she was married to an A-lister while being A-list herself. Johnny Depp is one of the most revered Hollywood legends. He has the qualities of an excellent star who is cherished by his fans and the industry. Depp has been one of the most cherished roles in blockbusters like Las Vega Parano, what’s eating Gilbert Grape, Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, and Pirates of the Caribbean series.
