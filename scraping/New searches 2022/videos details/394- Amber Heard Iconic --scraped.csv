Ru's POV
""CHRIS, Help me put this on"" Amber whined from across the room. I rolled my eyes. Amber is trying to flirt with Chris. MY boyfriend. 

"" You have hands, do it yourself."" Chris retorted. I felt myself smile. Not only because I find it hilarious that Chris rejected her; But, because he said that to a girl like Amber. Amber is beautiful, no doubt about it. She's absolutely stunning; Yet, Chris picked me.

 "" Whatever."" She mumbled before leaving the room. The crew is trying on their outfits for this weeks show. After this week. I'll be taking my spot back. That is if I don't get murdered by Amber first.

"" EWWW."" We heard a muffled scream coming from the other room. I was slightly startled. Chris jumped up from his seat and pulled me along with him.

"" Should we go check?"" Chris asked. I nodded and we made our way to the next room. I hesitantly opened the door; And once it was halfway open, the door flew open. It was Amber.

"" THERE'S A COCKROACH OVER THERE."" She yelled while pointing to a tiny creature on the other side of the room. I let out a chuckle at the terrified Amber and made my way to the cockroach. I took a water bottle from the nearby counter and smacked the cockroach. 

"" That's why you screamed?"" I said while I turned around, walking back to Chris. I smirked and let a small laugh escaped my lips. ""It's kinda pathetic."" I said again.

"" I don't know, I would be scared if I saw a bug while I was changing."" Chris said. I made a weird face at him and watched him smile at Amber. Did that really just happen? Anger filled me and I felt a sudden urge to slap Amber. I've never really felt something like this; Yet, I know exactly what this was. Jealousy.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JVAXiqCX05c/default.jpg,120,90,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JVAXiqCX05c/mqdefault.jpg,320,180,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JVAXiqCX05c/hqdefault.jpg,480,360,,,,ICONicWriters,24,none,Love is Breakable ICONic Boyz Love Story Chapter 30!!,"Nicole's turn to shake it up:)
