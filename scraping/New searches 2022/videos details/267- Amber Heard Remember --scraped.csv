About Reminiscence: 
From writer/director/producer Lisa Joy comes Warner Bros. Pictures‚Äô action thriller Reminiscence, starring Oscar nominee Hugh Jackman, Rebecca Ferguson and Thandiwe Newton.

Nick Bannister (Jackman), a private investigator of the mind, navigates the darkly alluring world of the past by helping his clients access lost memories. Living on the fringes of the sunken Miami coast, his life is forever changed when he takes on a new client, Mae (Ferguson). A simple matter of lost and found becomes a dangerous obsession. As Bannister fights to find the truth about Mae's disappearance, he uncovers a violent conspiracy, and must ultimately answer the question: how far would you go to hold on to the ones you love?

Honestly, the Johnny Depp and Amber Heard controversies have turned so many tables that nothing surprises me anymore. From co-stars to lovers to couples to enemies, they indeed intend to be each other‚Äôs everything. Insecurities, possessiveness, anger, hunger for wealth, what more is left between them? 
After truckloads of allegations and dark secrets coming out to the public, both Amber Heard and Johnny Depp have lost a lot of respect and fandom. The last time I remember, Amber was exposed lying about being the perfectly gentle and sweet wife of Johnny as Johnny‚Äôs team presented a phone recording from the past in which Amber herself admitted to being agitated and hurting her then-husband. 
And more and more accusations against the two, it is pretty hard to understand and trust any one of them. No matter what the actual scenario is, the fact is that the two were toxic together and should have never been together. I hope they learned their lessons!
