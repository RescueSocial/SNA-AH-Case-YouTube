Comedian TK Kirkland sat down on the Vlad couch for the fourth time and continued with his hilarious and informative take on some topics. He spoke about releasing a Comedy album, and signing the legendary Dick Gregory to his label and the release of the late activist's work.

The funnyman then went on to speak about the Kevin Hart cheating scandal, Usher's accusers coming forward, Yung Joc wearing a dress, and 21 Savage supporting Amber's women's empowerment walk. That developed into a discussion about men dating women in their league and not getting played out as Rob Kardashian was with Blac Chyna.
