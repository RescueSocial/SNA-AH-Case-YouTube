In addition, the spokesperson addressed the loss of Johnny’s beloved mother, Betty Sue Palmer, who died just days before news of the couple’s split emerged.

Born and raised in Texas, she made her film debut in a minor supporting role in the sports drama Friday Night Lights (2004), followed by a series of other small roles in television and film. Her first leading role was in the horror film All the Boys Love Mandy Lane (2006), but it was not released in the United States until 2013 due to distribution problems. Her second major role came in the short-running The CW television series Hidden Palms (2007).

Heard's breakthrough came in 2008 with roles in the action film Never Back Down and in the stoner comedy Pineapple Express, which were both box office successes. The same year, she received the Breakthrough Award at Young Hollywood Awards. Heard continued her career with roles in films such as The Informers (2008), The Stepfather (2009), Zombieland (2009), and The Joneses (2009). In 2011, she played the female lead opposite Nicolas Cage in Drive Angry, and opposite Johnny Depp in The Rum Diary; neither were critically nor commercially successful. Subsequently, Heard appeared in 3 Days to Kill (2014), Magic Mike XXL (2015) and The Danish Girl (2015). She also starred in the indie film The Adderall Diaries (2015), the television musical drama One More Time (2015), and the Martin Amis adaptation London Fields (2018). The latter was due to be released in 2015, but became the subject of a series of lawsuit between its director, Heard, and the film's production company over disagreements in its editing and other issues. The film was finally released in 2018, and was both a critical and commercial flop.

In 2017, Heard acted as part of an ensemble cast in the indie film I Do...Until I Don't (2017) and made an appearance as Mera in the superhero film Justice League (2017). She reprised the latter role opposite Jason Momoa in Aquaman (2018), which became the most profitable DC Extended Universe film up to that point, and the fifth highest-grossing film of 2018.[4] The same year, Heard was also named a global spokesperson for the cosmetics giant L'Oréal Paris. In 2019, she appeared in supporting roles in the independent films Her Smell and Gully.

In addition to her acting career, Heard engages in activism for causes such as LGBTQ rights and domestic and sexual violence awareness.

He has claimed Ms Heard caused the injury and put a cigarette out on his face.But texts aired in court today for the first time reveal he texted his doctor, David Kipper, on 7 March and 19 March 2015.He said: 'I cut the tip of my middle finger off. What should I do? Except of course go to hospital.'I am so embarrassed for jumping into anything with her. F**K the world. JD..'Then 12 days later he sent text message to Dr Kipper: 'Thank you for everything.

The 52-year-old actor released a statement amid reports that he did not have a prenuptial agreement in place and his soon-to-be ex-wife was seeking spousal support.The statement on behalf of the ‘Alice Through the Looking Glass’ actor revealed that he is looking to divorce “quickly”.

In addition, the spokesperson addressed the loss of Johnny’s beloved mother, Betty Sue Palmer, who died just days before news of the couple’s split emerged.

The statement said: “Given the brevity of this marriage and the most recent and tragic loss of his mother, Johnny will not respond to any of the salacious false stories, gossip, misinformation, and lies about his personal life.

“Hopefully the dissolution of his short marriage will be resolved quickly.”The couple’s breakup comes just weeks after the pair appeared in a viral video made for the Australian Government after Heard was fined $1,000 for bringing their dogs, Pistol and Boo, into the country illegally.

According to The Sun, their embarrassing apology video, which made them a global laughing stock, could be the root cause behind the separation.

“Johnny felt humiliated by the whole ordeal and believes Amber made him look like a fool,” a source told the paper.

“It just doesn’t fit with his serious image and he hated being mocked. The dogs are Amber’s so she should really have done the thorough checks.”

Even though Amber officially began the legal process to end their union, it was reportedly Johnny who had “enough” of their marriage.The Hollywood couple, who met on the set of ‘The Rum Diary’, married in a private civil ceremony at their home in Los Angeles in 2015.

The Commonwealth Department of Public Prosecutions said Thursday that Heard faces two counts of illegally importing Yorkshire terriers Pistol and Boo into Australia and one count of producing a false document in May.

The charges carry maximum penalties of 10-years imprisonment and a fine of $102,000 and up to one-year imprisonment and a fine of $10,200, respectively.

A summons has also been issued for her to appear before a Queensland court Sept. 7.

Agriculture Minister Barnaby Joyce told reporters Thursday that he was not concerned that legal actions against Heard could be considered mean internationally.

“No, it’s not. The law is the same for everybody,” the Australian Associated Press quoted him as saying. “There is no preferential treatment here.”

Stressing that a rabies outbreak would be catastrophic, he warned of its possible impact on Australia’s “massive” wild dog population and bat population in many towns.

“We've got enough problems with them [bats], let alone if they became rabid,” he said.

The Australian cited a Department of Agriculture spokesperson as confirming the summons issued to Heard.

“All animals entering Australia must have an import permit, and have undergone relevant testing and health checks signed off by a government veterinarian from the exporting country to ensure pests and diseases from overseas are not brought here,” she said in a statement.

The dogs had been brought into Australia while Depp was based on the Gold Coast filming Pirates of the Caribbean 5: Dead Men tell No Tales.

Australia's ports and airports have some of the toughest screening measures in the world. The country has extremely tight biosecurity laws, given that much of its flora and fauna is unique, and some have no resistance to foreign disease or bacteria.

The Commonwealth Department of Public Prosecutions said Thursday that Heard faces two counts of illegally importing Yorkshire terriers Pistol and Boo into Australia and one count of producing a false document in May.

The charges carry maximum penalties of 10-years imprisonment and a fine of $102,000 and up to one-year imprisonment and a fine of $10,200, respectively.

A summons has also been issued for her to appear before a Queensland court Sept. 7.

Agriculture Minister Barnaby Joyce told reporters Thursday that he was not concerned that legal actions against Heard could be considered mean internationally.

“No, it’s not. The law is the same for everybody,” the Australian Associated Press quoted him as saying. “There is no preferential treatment here.”

Stressing that a rabies outbreak would be catastrophic, he warned of its possible impact on Australia’s “massive” wild dog population and bat population in many towns.

“We've got enough problems with them [bats], let alone if they became rabid,” he said.

The Australian cited a Department of Agriculture spokesperson as confirming the summons issued to Heard.

Amber Heard is an American film and television actress. After a series of small roles in film and television, Heard had her first starring role in the horror film All the Boys Love Mandy Lane (2006). She first gained mainstream recognition for supporting roles in the action film Never Back Down (2008) and the comedy Pineapple Express (2008). In the following years, she appeared in films such as The Joneses (2009), The Ward (2010), The Rum Diary (2011), Drive Angry (2011), Machete Kills (2013) and Magic Mike XXL (2015).

In 2017, Heard joined the DC Extended Universe to play Atlantean queen Mera in superhero films Justice League (2017), Aquaman (2018), and Zack Snyder's Justice League (2021). In addition to acting, Heard has been a global spokesperson for the cosmetics giant L'Oréal Paris since 2018. She also engages in human rights activism.

Heard was married to actor Johnny Depp from 2015 to 2017. Their divorce drew significant media attention as she alleged that he had been abusive through most of their relationship. He then sued her for defamation in 2019 after Heard wrote an op-ed discussing being a public victim of domestic violence. He also sued the publishers of The Sun in a related libel suit in England. In 2020, the High Court of Justice of England and Wales ruled that Depp had lost his libel case and that the majority of Heard's allegations had been proven to a civil standard.
