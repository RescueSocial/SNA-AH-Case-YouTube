The temps may have dropped, but the showdowns are still heating up. With the fall/winter season, we expect to see stars outfitted in looks more in tune with colder weather, so get ready for a lot of layers, crisp jackets and statement boots. While we’re sure they’ll be a few rule breakers in the mix, we’re excited to see which items are so nice, celebs had to wear them twice.

beautiful twin daughters, Amber and Jade. Unfortunately, my little
girls were born both with a very rare defect called Goldenhar
Syndrome. This condition causes numerous birth defects including
incomplete development of the ear and unfortunate cranial and facial
defects.

Throughout their young lives they've had to undergo through an
abundance of surgeries to help with these defects. However, they are
both missing one ear on opposite sides of their faces. Several years
ago, on Oprah and the Discovery Channel, I saw a man named Robert R.
Barron, a former Senior CIA Disguise Specialist, committed to
restoring identities through prosthetic devices. I searched for his
email, sent him my daughter's story, and within 2 hours he called me.
We had an enlightening conversation, that gave their mother and I
hope. Together, we decided that instead of our daughters going through
numerous failed surgeries, trying to reconstruct and ear, that Dr.
Barron's prosthetic ears would be the best for them.

Unfortunately insurance doesn't cover this, and each ear is over
$5,000. I'm sure you understand, we've had many medical expenses and
an additional $10,000 is hard to save. My daughters have reached the
ideal age for Dr. Barron's surgery, so I decided to start a fundraiser
to possibly raise the funds needed to help my daughters get ears so
they can walk around with 2 ears just like all the other little girls.

Amber and Jade are two of the happiest little girls you'll see, but as
they get older, and start to be more aware of their condition, they
will come across many hurtful comments and questions about their
condition and defects. We just want our daughters to live as
normal as a life as possible with the least amount of hurt feelings,
pain, and worry. 

Thank you all for your time and support. WE DID IT!

The star and her co-ambassadors, Camilla Cabello, Aja Naomi King, Helen Mirren, visited the French cosmetic brand's fashion show. And as reported by Daily Mail, the celebrities were accompanied by an assortment of models and dancers as they were ""on hand to help L'Oreal unveil their spring-summer 2022 range at the biannual event.""
On that day, the 35-year-old ""Aqua Man"" actress posed on the long catwalk wearing a plunging pale pink jumpsuit, detailed with feathers on her shoulder and split sleeves. She also had her blonde hair down in loose waves and a dash of bright red lipstick.
