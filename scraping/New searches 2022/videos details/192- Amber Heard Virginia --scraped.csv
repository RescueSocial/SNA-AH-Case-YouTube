I don't really cover this types of videos. However, since I did the video about why ""Meghan Is Not An 'A' List Actress"" I felt like I should cover this. Also, Only because some of the women mentioned in this video stood for the TRUTH. The did not sit by and let it happened to an opposite sex.

I've included a partial video of ""Lost Beyond Pluto"" (YT Channel). She covers why Johnny Depp's case is being held in Virginia. Please go to her channel to see the rest of the video. The links to her YT channel and the video I highlighted are down below.

A new video allegedly showing a fight between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard could have a major impact on the estranged couple's upcoming divorce battle, according to a legal expert. 

The video, which was obtained by TMZ, apparently shows the 53-year-old actor throwing a wine bottle and a glass in a kitchen. It was reportedly filmed months before the 30-year-old actress was granted a temporary domestic violence restraining order against Depp and filed for divorce. Heard denied releasing the tape in a statement to PEOPLE but otherwise both sides have declined to comment.

Großer Erfolg für Johnny Depp (58): Die Verleumdungsklage gegen seine Ex-Frau Amber Heard (35) wird nicht abgewiesen, wie eine Richterin aus Virginia laut ""USA Today"" am Dienstag entschieden hat. Das bedeutet, dass der Fall nächstes Jahr vor Gericht verhandelt wird. Die Vorsitzende Richterin Penney Azcarate lehnte Heards bereits dritten Antrag auf Abweisung des Falls aus verschiedenen Gründen ab. Heard hatte versucht, die Klage gegen sich unter Berufung auf das Urteil eines Londoner Richters abzuweisen. In London hatte Depp gegen den Herausgeber der Boulevardzeitung ""The Sun"" wegen Verleumdung geklagt. Dort kam das Gericht zu dem Schluss, dass es rechtens wäre, den Schauspieler als ""Ehefrauenschläger"" zu bezeichnen, da die große Mehrheit von Heards Behauptungen nachgewiesen werden könnten. Aufgrund dieses Urteils wollte Heard das Verfahren in Virginia verhindern. Dort hatte der ""Fluch der Karibik""-Star sie im März 2019 ebenfalls wegen Verleumdung auf 50 Millionen Dollar verklagt. Die US-Richterin kam aber nun zu dem Schluss, dass die beiden Fälle nicht miteinander zu vergleichen seien - die Klage also vor Gericht kommen soll. Depp soll über die Entscheidung des Gerichts ""sehr erfreut"" sein, wie sein Anwalt mitteilte. Sie markiert einen großen Sieg für den Schauspieler im Rosenkrieg mit Heard, der 2016 während ihrer Scheidung entbrannte.
