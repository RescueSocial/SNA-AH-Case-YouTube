Children with autism and other developmental disabilities often have limited functional language to request access to preferred items/activities.  B.F.

Amber is the founder of Leaders of Change where she specializes in organizational development. 

The goal is to create economical and sustainable practices in communities and businesses. 

📈As a systems thinker, she helps organizations function more efficiently and being more equitable. 

Through creating this efficiency, she creates more equitable organizations by focusing on the most impacted populations (team members, community members, leaders) by creating a “bottom up” style of impact. 

⬆️”Learn bottom up to teach top down” ⬇️

This creates a more holistic environment in business and is effective with community building. 

💡Creating systems that serve well the most vulnerable people in society automatically creates a equitable environment up the ladder. 

This creates a sustainable business and community. 

📌An Example from our discussion: creating health care systems that are created to optimally serve Black residents will be even more efficient to serve more privileged members of society. 

📌Having a business flow that serves your bottom employees well creates an environment that those at the top benefit well from in addition. 

Leaders of Change works with community development organizations/civic institutions as well as corporations and small businesses that need more equitable, sustainable processes.

They dive into the topic of integrated pediatric care services for children and families with disabilities including an innovative protocol, Astronaut Training. Astronaut Training is a precise, powerful, therapeutic protocol that is designed to to develop optimal vestibular function, an essential foundation for all sensory processing and movement control. This protocol is administered by occupational and physical therapists that have received advanced education.

Milestone Pediatrics was founded in 2009 by two ambitious women looking to make a difference in the special needs community. To effectively meet the challenges of raising children with disabilities, families have a strong ongoing need for therapeutic interventions for their loved ones. As Milestone Pediatrics saw that need, they decided to fill that void by creating several programs for individuals with disabilities. Their services include Speech Therapy, Occupational therapy, Physical Therapy, Music Therapy and caregiving services. Milestone Pediatrics acts to ensure that people with intellectual and developmental disabilities have meaningful opportunities in our community and can be a part of an inclusive society.
