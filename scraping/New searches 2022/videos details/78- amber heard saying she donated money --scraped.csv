Amber Heard has announced she will donate her $7 million divorce settlement to charity, including a group that tackles domestic violence.

Ms Heard will split the payment to the American Civil Liberties Union - “with a particular focus to stop violence against women”, she said - and the Children’s Hospital of Los Angeles, where she has volunteered for the past 10 years.

In a statement, Ms Heard said that money has never “played a role” in the divorce except to the extent that she could donate to charity and “hopefully help those less able to defend themselves”.

Depp, 53, has agreed to pay Heard $7m (£5.6m; €6.6m), which she says she will donate to two charities.

Heard, 30, will get to keep the couple's dogs, Pistol and Boo, who were at the centre of scandal when she took them to Australia illegally in 2015.

She had accused Depp of domestic abuse - a claim he denies. 

According to court documents, she said Depp had been physically abusive to her, culminating in him throwing a mobile phone at her face during a fight in February last year. 




Depp's lawyer denied the allegations, saying Heard was ""attempting to secure a premature financial resolution by alleging abuse"". Police officers attending the scene said they had found no evidence of a crime.
The actress had filed for a restraining order, but this was dropped after the majority of the terms of the divorce were settled in August.

But the divorce was only finalised this week because lawyers could not agree over whether Depp should make the payments directly to the charities or not.


Divorce settlement - who gets what?
◾Depp to pay Heard $7m (£5.6m; €6.6m)
◾Heard to keep dogs Pistol and Boo, and a horse called Arrow
◾Depp to retain sole possession of real estate assets, including properties in LA, Paris and his private island in the Bahamas
◾He will also keep more than 40 vehicles and vessels, including vintage cars and motorcycle collection
◾Heard to drop request for continued restraining order against Depp
◾Confidentiality provision prevents them from discussing relationship publicly
◾No spousal support for either actor


Heard said she would donate the money from the divorce settlement to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the Children's Hospital of Los Angeles.

Her lawyer, Pierce O'Donnell, said it was a ""great day"" for his client, adding: ""All Amber wanted was to be divorced and now she is.""
◾Heard and Depp row over divorce money
◾Depp and Heard reach divorce settlement
◾Johnny Depp and Amber Heard to divorce

Depp's lawyer, Laura Wasser, said they were ""all pleased to put this unpleasant chapter in Mr Depp and his family's lives behind them"".

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

Amber Heard has demanded that Johnny Depp double the amount that is paid to charity following their divorce settlement.
She recently pledged to donate the $7m (£5.3m) settlement to two charities for abused women and ill children.
But he has begun to donate the money directly in her name, instead of giving it to her first, leading her to accuse him of trying to reduce his total bill.
She said he must now ""honour the full amount by donating $14m to charity"".
On Thursday, the Pirates of the Caribbean star revealed he had paid the first instalments of the original $7m sum to the charities ""in the name of Amber Heard"".
'We insist on $14m'
Her spokeswoman responded in a statement: ""Amber Heard appreciates Johnny Depp's novel interest in supporting two of her favourite charities, the ACLU (American Civil Liberties Union) for domestic violence and the Children's Hospital of Los Angeles. This is great and unexpected news.
""However, if Johnny wishes to change the settlement agreement, we must insist that he honour the full amount by donating $14m to charity, which, after accounting for his tax deduction, is equal to his $7m payment obligation to Amber.
""We would also insist that the full amount be paid immediately and not drawn out over many years.

After their 2016 breakup, Heard stated that she didn't want Depp's money and promised to donate it to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and Children's Hospital Los Angeles.

Lawyers, on the other hand, claim that Heard did not mislead about the donations because she agreed to pay the money over a ten-year period.

Adam Waldman, the lawyer for the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" star, has alleged that she did not donate the full amount she pledged.

Waldman pointed out that the payments were not from the divorce settlement money, but rather from anonymous donors.

Elaine Bredehoft, Heard's attorney, acknowledged in January that her client had yet to complete her $7 million pledge to the CHLA and ACLU, citing financial concerns.

The money will be split between the American Civil Liberties Union and the Children's Hospital Los Angeles.

""As described in the restraining order and divorce settlement, money played no role for me personally and never has, except to the extent that I could donate it to charity and, in doing so, hopefully help those less able to defend themselves,"" Heard wrote in a statement.

The pair settled their divorce just a day before they were scheduled to begin a restraining order hearing that would centre on Heard's allegations Depp repeatedly abused her during their marriage.

Depp denied he abused Heard, and his lawyer accused the 30-year-old of making up the domestic violence allegations to obtain a more favourable settlement.

In a joint statement on Tuesday, Heard and Depp acknowledged volatility in their relationship, which began after they met on the set of the 2011 film The Rum Diary.

""Our relationship was intensely passionate and at times volatile, but always bound by love.

Johnny Depp has reportedly accused his ex-wife Amber Heard of keeping the millions she was given in a huge divorce settlement, instead of giving it to charity like she promised.


Amber, 34, was awarded £5.1million ($7million) when her divorce from the Pirates of the Caribbean actor, 57, was finalised in 2016, but she vowed to donate the money, splitting it equally between the Children's Hospital Los Angeles and American Civil Liberties Union.


But Depp's lawyers have reportedly been chasing the two organisations over the last year to find out if Amber did donate the money.


The ACLU has not revealed how much they received, but, according to the Daily Mail, the children's hospital has received just £74,000 ($100,000) so far.


Bosses at the hospital allegedly wrote to Heard in June 2019 to ask ""if the pledge will not be fulfilled"".
Depp's legal team are confident there was no further payments because the hospital would have been legally compelled to hand it over after they filed a subpoena.


His laywers are said to believe this proves she lied about the promise in court this summer.


He lost his libel case against The Sun and its publishers over an article that branded him a ""wife beater"", with a high court judge ruling that the publication proved to the civil standard that Depp abused his wife on 12 of the 14 occasions she alleged.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

Now there might evidence that Amber Heard never paid your divorce settlement from Johnny Depp to the ACLU like she said she did.
