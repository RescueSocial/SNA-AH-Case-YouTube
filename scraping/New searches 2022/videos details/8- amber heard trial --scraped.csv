Johnny Depp and Amber Heard arrived at Britain's High Court Monday (20 JULY 2020) for the final week's proceedings in Depp's libel suit against a British tabloid that accused him of assaulting his former spouse.
After a week and a half of testimony from Depp and several current or former employees of Depp and Heard, Heard is due to give her side of the story as she enters the witness box.
Heard alleges Depp was violent towards her on 14 occasions between 2013 and 2016, in settings including Depp's private island in the Bahamas, a rented house in Australia and the couple's downtown Los Angeles penthouse.
Depp denies the allegations and claims Heard was the aggressor during their volatile relationship, which he has likened to “a crime scene waiting to happen.”
Depp is suing News Group Newspapers, publisher of The Sun, and the paper’s executive editor, Dan Wootton, over an April 2018 article that called him a “wife-beater.” He strongly denies abusing Heard.
Depp, 57, and Heard, 34, met on the set of the 2011 comedy “The Rum Diary” and married in Los Angeles in February 2015. Heard filed for divorce the following year, and the divorce was finalized in 2017.

Lawyers for the tabloid's publisher will be making closing submissions today, before Mr Depp's lawyers make their closing submissions on Tuesday. Summing up for The Sun, lawyer Sasha Wass said the newspaper's defence 'is one of truth - namely that Mr. Depp did indeed beat his wife.' Wass said there was 'overwhelming evidence of domestic violence or wife-beating behavior, cataloged over a three-year period.'

Depp is suing British tabloid The Sun over an April 2018 story headlined “Potty - How can JK Rowling be ‘genuinely happy’ casting wife beater Johnny Depp in the new Fantastic Beasts film?” 
The newspaper's lawyers plan to use Heard's allegations of abuse by Depp to defend the “wife beater” claim.
The trial over his libel claims opened Tuesday. 
It is one of the first major cases to be held in person since Britain began to lift its coronavirus lockdown.
Depp, 57, and Heard, 34, met on the set of the 2011 comedy “The Rum Diary” and married in Los Angeles in February 2015. They divorced in 2017, and now bitterly accuse one another of abuse.
While Heard isn't on trial, the case is also a showdown between the former spouses, who accuse each other of being controlling, violent and deceitful.
 It is set to put the two performers’ complex private lives under a microscope.
Depp is also suing Heard in the United States for 50 million US dollars for allegedly defaming him in a Washington Post article about domestic abuse. 
That case is due to be heard next year.

The Hollywood star is suing News Group Newspapers, publisher of The Sun, and the paper's executive editor, Dan Wootton, over an April 2018 article that called him a ""wife-beater."" 
He strongly denies abusing Heard.
Depp, 57, and Heard, 34, met on the set of the 2011 comedy ""The Rum Diary"" and married in Los Angeles in February 2015. 
Heard, a model and actress, filed for divorce the following year, and the divorce was finalised in 2017.
Depp has depicted a tumultuous relationship with Heard during a period when he was trying to kick drugs and alcohol, and sometimes lapsing.
He called the relationship ""a crime scene waiting to happen."" 
But he denied Heard's claims that he slapped, hit, headbutted and threw things at her, and accused his ex-wife of compiling a dossier of fake claims against him as an ""insurance policy.""

わずか1年ほどの結婚生活を経て2016年5月に離婚を申請したアンバーによるDV発言を受け、名誉棄損で訴えを起こしているジョニー。先日、アンバーが「首を絞められたリ、殴られたり、缶や未開封の瓶を投げつけられたりした」など、ジョニーから受けたとする暴力の詳細を説明したことで、ジョニーとの破局後に交際していたイーロンを「虚偽の助けをした友人」として裁判に召喚したという。

ジョニーの弁護団は、アンバーが証拠として提出している動画や音源、写真などについて、イーロンをはじめとしたアンバー側の証人に追及する意向だと説明している。

アンバーの発言を「新たな虚偽」としているジョニー側は、不起訴とはなったものの、アンバーには2009年に元恋人ターシャ・ヴァン・リーに対するドメスティックバイオレンスの疑いでの逮捕歴があることも引き合いに出し、その信頼性について懸念を示している。
