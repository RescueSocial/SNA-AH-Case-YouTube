The Amber Heard vs Johnny Depp saga continues!

Johnny Depp has had a pretty interesting life the last few years. It has been funny, happy, and sad. Likely due to his current  long and rigorous court case with his ex wife. 

This court case is calling Johnny Depp's character into question. He continues to fight for his life and reputation. To show to prove that he isn’t what the media and others make him out to be. 

If you paid attention during certain points in his life during the past few years, he has sent slight warnings on what was happening to him. But you may not have realized it.

Amber Heard knows how to get that money. She remains in the celebrity news and headlines as Aquaman 2 is set to make Amber Heard one of the highest paid actresses in Hollywood today. The Johnny Depp Amber Heard Court case continues and remains at the top of celeb news. 

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

Her first leading role was in the horror film All the Boys Love Mandy Lane (2006), but it was not released in the United States until 2013 due to distribution problems. Her second major role came in the short-running The CW television series Hidden Palms (2007).

Heard's breakthrough came in 2008 with roles in the action film Never Back Down and in the stoner comedy Pineapple Express, which were both box office successes. The same year, she received the Breakthrough Award at Young Hollywood Awards. Heard continued her career with roles in films such as The Informers (2008), The Stepfather (2009), Zombieland (2009), and The Joneses (2009). In 2011, she played the female lead opposite Nicolas Cage in Drive Angry, and opposite Johnny Depp in The Rum Diary; neither were critically nor commercially successful. Subsequently, Heard appeared in 3 Days to Kill (2014), Magic Mike XXL (2015) and The Danish Girl (2015). She also starred in the indie film The Adderall Diaries (2015), the television musical drama One More Time (2015), and the Martin Amis adaptation London Fields (2018). The latter was due to be released in 2015, but became the subject of a series of lawsuit between its director, Heard, and the film's production company over disagreements in its editing and other issues. The film was finally released in 2018, and was both a critical and commercial flop.

Heard was married to her Rum Diary co-star Johnny Depp in 2015–2017. Their divorce drew significant media attention as Heard alleged that Depp had been physically and verbally abusive towards her through most of their relationship. In 2019, he sued her for defamation after she publicly discussed being a victim of domestic violence, alleging that she had been the abusive party; Heard denied this. Depp also sued the publishers of The Sun in a related libel suit, with Heard as a key witness for the defendants. In November 2020, the High Court of Justice of England ruled that Depp has lost his case and that the majority of Heard's allegations had been proven to a civil standard which Depp intends to appeal.

Rumours have been going around that Gal Gadot Wants to Work with Amber Heard in the DCEU. In today’s video, we’re going to discuss all we know about this rumour. 

Gal Gadot’s Wonder Woman shined particularly brightly, with the scene in which she dispatches terrorists being one of the best fights in the movie. But we also got to see more of Amber Heard‘s Atlantean princess Mera, who squared off with Steppenwolf in defence of a Mother Box and came close to stopping him early by sucking the water out of his body with her hydrokinesis.

Despite this, the two heroines still haven’t shared a scene with one another. However, according to leaker Daniel Richtman, Gadot is eager to work with Heard in the DCEU. Of course, Aquaman 2 is currently in pre-production and expected to shoot soon, but the most likely potential place for a team-up is Wonder Woman 3.

This is being fast-tracked by Warner Bros. and it’d be fun to see Mera and Diana interact in it. After all, both characters are royalty (specifically princesses), have expert control of their powers, are fierce warriors and hail from isolated, insular societies. On top of that, there’s a long history of conflict between the Amazonians and the Atlanteans, so sparks could fly in the form of a mutual rivalry.

At this stage, Amber Heard knows exactly what certain sections of the public think of her, and she now appears to be going out of her way to actively troll them. Over 1.5 million people signed a petition to have her removed as Aquaman 2‘s Mera, but she dismissed it by claiming that the numbers had been artificially inflated by paid campaigns and she couldn’t wait to head back to Atlantis.

The actress will also be fully aware that ex-husband Johnny Depp’s army of loyal supporters will continue to defend him to the hilt, so she’d have known exactly what the reaction would have been when it was announced that she was being paid $33,000 to give talks on domestic abuse, while she may as well have smiled and winked at the camera like Jim in The Office after revealing that she’s got a talent for playing the villain.

All that being said, the 34-year-old’s increased role in Zack Snyder’s Justice League has so far been relatively safe from any backlash, presumably because the fanbase who spent over two and a half years trying to will it into existence in the first place have used up all their energy and don’t want to draw any sort of negative attention towards the long-awaited redux.

That hasn’t stopped rumors from making the rounds that Amber Heard‘s involvement in the DCEU is only set to increase in the future, though, and we’ve now heard from our sources – the same ones who told us Ben Affleck would be back as Batman in The Flash long before it was confirmed that she’s talking with Warner Bros. about a Mera series on HBO Max, and she also wants Gal Gadot’s Wonder Woman involved in it.

Of course, based on the online discourse there’s always the chance that such an announcement would cause a lot of people to cancel their subscriptions instantly, but the DCEU is set to be a major part of the streaming service’s future, so they’re well within their rights to develop as many shows as possible.

And that’s all we know for now. Let us know your views in the comments section below and Don't forget to like this video and if you have not subscribe to my channel yet please do so. See you within the next video.

This never previously seen Queen + Adam Lambert performance of the song which features on the upcoming Queen + Adam Lambert ‘Live Around The World’ release was captured at the second of the band’s two spectacular shows at London’s O2 Arena on July 4th 2018. Both concerts attracted widespread critical acclaim, with critics noting that “many thrilled fans leaving the arena were calling it one of their all-time favourite gigs” and declaring “this is as good as live shows get.” #Queen #QALlive #TheShowMustGoOn

This never previously seen Queen + Adam Lambert performance of the song which features on the upcoming Queen + Adam Lambert ‘Live Around The World’ release was captured at the second of the band’s two spectacular shows at London’s O2 Arena on July 4th 2018. Both concerts attracted widespread critical acclaim, with critics noting that “many thrilled fans leaving the arena were calling it one of their all-time favourite gigs” and declaring “this is as good as live shows get.” #Queen #QALlive #TheShowMustGoOn

Amber Heard knows how to get that money. She remains in the celebrity news and headlines as Aquaman 2 is set to make Amber Heard one of the highest paid actresses in Hollywood today. The Johnny Depp Amber Heard Court case continues and remains at the top of celeb news. 

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.
