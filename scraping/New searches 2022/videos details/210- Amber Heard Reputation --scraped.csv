Yet it also doesn’t do his subject real justice, because Amber Digby’s singing touches the heart, not just of anyone who appreciatse a traditional country song, but of anyone who’s ever known heartbreak, happiness, regret, loneliness—or just the compelling desire to get out on the dance floor for a night of fun.  And the fact is, with each passing month and year, as she enjoys growing airplay and tours farther and farther from her home in Texas, Amber Digby and her music are reaching out to more and more and more of those hearts.

To an outside observer, Digby’s career has an appearance of inevitability—after all, her father, mother, stepfather and uncles have all been in the ranks of professional musicians, notable for their own careers or for their contributions to the music of Loretta Lynn, Connie Smith, Faron Young, Ronnie Milsap, Hank Williams, Jr., the Osborne Brothers and many more.  But though she frequented the wings of the Grand Ole Opry House and the sets of Hee Haw and Nashville Now as a child watching her parents at work, singing “was just something I did,” she says with a laugh.  “My mom and my dad and my stepdad encouraged me to find my path and to be creative—not necessarily to sing.”  

Indeed, it wasn’t until she was in her mid-teens and living in Oklahoma that Amber even began to sit in with her stepfather’s band, much less think about music as a career—and even then, it wasn’t an easy road.  “I actually graduated from high school in Missouri, and then I got sidetracked, detoured,” she says with the frankness of someone who’s been through what she calls rough times.  “I made some bad choices, and really, the only good thing that came out of that five year block was my son.”

That, though, turns out not to be quite true, because in the midst of that turmoil, Digby began visiting her mother and stepfather in their new home in the Texas hill country—and before long, she’d made her first album.  “I started sitting in with artists like Jake Hooker and Justin Trevino,” she recalls, and once I heard what all these guys were doing down there, I thought yeah, this is really different—and it’s really good!”   

With Trevino producing and playing on the album, her stepfather on pedal steel and Bobby Flores on fiddle, Music From The Honky Tonks served notice of a major new talent—and though it took a while to reach more than a few ears, it began to make the young singer a reputation.  As country music historian John Morthland wrote in No Depression in early 2005, not long after she finally made the move to Texas, “if there’s a more promising hard-country singer on the horizon than Amber Digby, I’ve been kept in the dark.”  By that summer, the album had garnered enough attention in Europe that she got called to go with Trevino and Flores to Sweden—the first of many overseas visits she’d make.  

Reuniting in the studio with Trevino, Amber released Here Come The Teardrops for Heart Of Texas Records in 2006, and traveled to Europe again—this time headlining her own tour—and by early 2007, she’d quit her day job, moved to the Houston area and, with the help of future husband Randy Lindley, had put together her own band to play the dance hall and club circuits that have nurtured so many Texas country artists.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/74gvkLz7Rkc/default.jpg,120,90,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/74gvkLz7Rkc/mqdefault.jpg,320,180,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/74gvkLz7Rkc/hqdefault.jpg,480,360,,,,,,,Marcus Brazil,['Music Country Amber Digby'],22,none,Amber Digby  If Anyone Ought To Know,"When Amber Digby sings, people listen.  “Amber is a great traditional singer,” says Vince Gill, who knows whereof he speaks, and like his following observation—“which is so hard to find these days”—it’s just the simple truth.

One very important thing to observe here: Johnny Depp DID NOT hit Amber Heard in this video, nor did he throw anything at her.  He did everything he could to avoid going near her. When he realized she was filiming him, which obviously she'd done before by the conversation?  He had finally had enough and lost his temper but STILL didn't hit her.  She had what looked like a small black remote control in her hand(first look 1:00), and seemed to use it to control a camera either buried in a wall or hidden behind something.  Johnny reached for the remote in her hand but instead of grabbing her hand and wrestling with her for the remote, he went right to the camera and yanked it out of wherever it was and slammed it to the floor. The only casualties in this video were the camera, some unfortunate cabinets, a door, and several wine glasses. Maybe even a bottle.  However, no human beings were struck physically during the making of this video.  You'll see when you watch it broken down.
 It's clear that Amber has started conversations like this one with Johnny before, when he's at his angriest and clearly wants to be left alone.  No abuse victim would seek to engage their abuser in a fight, to see if they get hit, just so they can get it on tape.  It doesn't make sense.
Johnny Depp and Amber Heard were officially divorced January of 2017.  In May of 2016 after filing for divorce, she accused him of domestic violence which caused many to do battle with words on social media and otherwise.  When they settled out of court, they had a document that stated, and I will paraphrase correctly.  Their relationship, passionate and sometimes volatile was still always bound by love.  Neither party lied for financial gain and there was no intention of physical or emotional harm.  Amber wished Johnny the best and pledged to donate her spousal support to charity.
However, she also dropped the charges against Johnny with prejudice, a legal term for swearing in a court of law that she'd never refile those charges against Depp.  Also ""neither lied for financial gain""(paraphrased) doesn't mean neither lied to protect a reputation!  Based on her Instagram post repeating the joint statement after JK Rowling spoke out to assure her fans that she feels comfortable with Johnny Depp in the Fantastic Beasts franchise?   Amber Heard's jumping in and responding like that shows how very concerned she is about her reputation.  Narcissists always are, but for now, I will let my breakdown of her original video speak for itself.

Many would like to be done with this chapter but unfortunately domestic violence is everyone's business.  It will never end.  Because these people are famous and no one truly was ""there"" except others not talking about it anymore?  We may never know or have ""solid proof.""  What I did was look very hard at both sides last year, as this issue is close to my heart thanks to my own experiences with abuse.  If  I saw any indication that Johnny Depp even remotely abused Amber Heard, I would not be defending him to this day.  Women, please remember that some of our fellow women are not all good.  Many are abusers, just like those men that abuse women.  Many women use feminism to their advantage, playing the victim to make a man look horrible or ruin his life.  It's sick and pathological but it happens all the time.  I am still getting many views and comments on this video, and while many can say with ease, ""Let them get on with their lives!""  unfortunately once narcissists put out smear campaigns on their discarded human supply, it never stops.  Those speaking up for Amber won't stop until Johnny is boycotted.  He will never be boycotted but they are so fired up because of REAL abusers like Weinstein that they can't cool down.  Why respond, say some of you?  Well, I'm not feeding narcs, I am just continuing to put out the other side of things for the sake of discernment.  Let Truth continue to be Spoken and never Silenced!!!  Namaste to all.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

For several years now, Johnny Depp has been entangled in legal battles both directly and indirectly tied to his split from ex-wife Amber Heard. Their relationship was a tabloid magazine’s dream: Hollywood A-lister falls in love with up-and-coming ingenue on set. Later, as allegations of abuse emerged of violent outbursts and alleged physical abuse.

Depp lost his libel case against The Sun in U.K. court over the publication describing him as a “wife beater.” You might well assume that Depp's career is in ruins and his reputation irretrievably damaged. But before this, what really happened between them? Be sure to watch the whole video and in addition, do us a favor and like the video and subscribe and turn on the notification bell.

Now let's chat with this week's featured Guest, Annette Densham.

Annette Densham is a weaver of words, engaging storyteller, hoarder of knowledge, larrikin, mum, wife and lover of musicals… now working closely with entrepreneurs and innovators on raising their profile by tapping into the power of PR and social media.

This week, our entire interview will be captured around the board game, RISK.

This board game is one of careful planning, quick decisions and bold moves - just like our life, no matter which area of life you are focusing on, such as health, business, family, relationships, money or anything in between. 

We may feel like we’re either defending or attacking our enemies to protect our territory. 

So round up your troops, get into position and let the war begin! 

Or in the PR world; gather your content, choose your mode of communication and step foot on the battlefield by “Unleashing the PR Genie within!”

Here are some key points summarised in today’s battle:

- PR is everything you say and everything you do in your business including your personal accounts
- PR stands for Public Relations, however Annette, suggest you replace it for perception & relationships
- Relationship with media and your target audience
-PR isn’t a magic bullet - it’s a long term strategy

Getting & Placing New Armies:
- You MUST PLAN!
- Start with 90 days
- Each month, ask yourself, what is it that I need to be doing to expand my reach?
*Drop the bread crumbs
- Know exactly who your target audience is
- Then you can create some key messages
- What is it that you do?
- Why do you do it?
- How do you do it?
- What are people going to get out of working with you?
- What problems do you solve?
- When you are clear on this, it makes it easy to create content for your target audience
- Develop third party credibility (i.e be a guest on peoples Podcasts, speak at events, etc. 
- PR is earned media
- Advertising is something you pay for
- PR is ultimate word of mouth

Attacking:
- Bad PR is bad PR…
- Best way to handle negative PR is to PLAN
- Think of all the possible worse case scenarios and plan your response then when you are calm and not clustered
- Acknowledge the compliment and take it offline
- Bring empathy and compassion into how you deal with negativity
- Check in with yourself - why has that triggered me?
- What people think of you, has NOTHING to do with you
- There’s always 3 sides of the truth
- Surround yourself with REALLY good people
- Ask self, how can I improve this situation so it doesn’t happen again?
- What part are you playing in this?
- Empathise and be compassionate with bullies

Fortifying Your Position:
- Look after yourself
- Still must work on your business to grow your business
- Use your words to communicate with the important people in your lives - DON’T hold a grudge
- Start small - don’t over complicate it
- Set boundaries & expectations for clients from the beginning
- Tools:
Paypal, Gmail, Hootsuite (schedule all of your monthly content in a few hours a month), Google Calendar, Asana -(Project management tools), Slack (other ways to communicate), Xero & Canva
- The people around you: People to vent to, Mentor to guide you & Cheerleaders
- Use what you have 

Sets of Armies:
- Annette’s top 4 communication channels for PR:
1. Social Media: Facebook & Facebook Groups
2. Awards - Ultimate 3rd party credibility from Startups to well established business
3. Blogging - Content Creation
- Repurpose into all your other channels
4. Media
- In Australia there’s 9 to 10 THOUSAND different media outlets out there
Find 10 media outlets you’d like to be featured in (e.g Radio, TV, Magazines, Online Publications)
- Build relationship with journalists
- Repurpose & Leverage EVERYTHING
- Start with 4 blogs a month (Put aside 2-3 hours, 1x a month)
- Repurpose into 40 pieces of content
- Come up with 4 story ideas (e.g What are the problems you solve?
What should people know about you, that don’t? Share a case study)

Reflection - You’ve Won The Battle - This Time…
- Look after yourself
- If I don’t look after myself, everything else falls apart
- Stop giving yourself AND other people a hard time
- Manage expectations with clients, family and those in your inner circle from the start

Never disturb a calmly sleeping dragon.
This is what I think about the Johnny Depp, Amber Heard and the British media saga. I truly believe Johnny Depp did not want to be a in the media circus with his personal private life. Unfortunately for him, his wife is ... (fill in the blank). She keeps poking and poking him to get some sort of negative reaction. He never did. So, when it comes to HIS KIDS! EVERYTHING CHANGES.
Johnny is doing and going through all of this not only to clear his name, but also for HIS KIDS REPUTATION. He doesn't his kids to see him as a wife beater. He also doesn't other people to see his to be known that their father is a wife beater or an abusive person towards women. 
This is of course, my HUMBLE OPINION. I hope the truth comes out. I wish him and his kids well.

She had flown to Boston, where the Hollywood star was filming Black Mass, a film about American mobster James ‘Whitey’ Bulger, and now, after a two-hour wait, he was finally boarding the flight to Los Angeles.

What happened next is at the heart of his libel battle against The Sun, which begins later this month in the High Court in London. Depp is suing the newspaper over articles he claims are libellous and damaged his reputation and ability to work in the film industry.

He claims the articles, from April 2018, mean he was guilty of serious domestic violence against his former wife, leaving her fearing for her life.

Depp was wrongfully accused of domestic violence towards Amber back in 2015.

His career and reputation were negatively impacted by these slanderous accusations, and he ended up suing her for $50,000,000.

Recently, there has been audio of a conversation between Heard and Depp which tells an entirely different story. Turns out that Amber was the abuser all along.
