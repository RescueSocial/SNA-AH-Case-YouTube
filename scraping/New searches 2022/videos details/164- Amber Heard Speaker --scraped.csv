In this episode, HERdacious host Lorelei chats with Amber Briggle about implementing inclusive behaviors and non-exclusionary language into the workplace. We might be familiar with increasingly common inclusive practices like offering our preferred pronouns or using gender-neutral language; but, what more can we do to promote non-discriminatory culture in the workplace? While Amber walks us through the endless possibilities, we quickly realize that the better question to ask is: what can’t we do? As a small business owner and parent to a transgender child, Amber teaches us that although conscious and unconscious discriminatory behavior often pervade the workplace, uprooting these behaviors is well within reach. From breaking the habit of assuming gender and sexuality to rewriting parental leave policies, Amber emphasizes that being mindful of inclusivity through our interactions benefits the well-being of individuals and businesses alike. Although these actions appear slight, they are meaningful to people who are constantly excluded from the heteronormative mainstream. Being seen and valued is a privilege easily taken for granted, so let’s pay it forward to everyone of all identities!

Host: Lorelei Gonzalez
Co-host: Amber Briggle, CMT

Amber Briggle (she/her) is an activist, speaker, writers, and self-described “mamabear” of a transgender child. Amber is internationally recognized for her work involving LGBTQ advocacy, is a founding member and former national co-chair of the Human Rights Campaign’s “Parents for Transgender Equality Council” and has been previously nominated by the Dallas Morning News as “Texan of the Year.” Mostly, though, she’s “just a mom” in the Dallas area who loves both of her kids unconditionally.

LuAnn didn't get to talk to her at the conference, so she's really happy to interview Amber on today's show, as there were parts of her story that LuAnne thought were really fun and interesting.&nbsp; LuAnn finds Amber's body of work and what she's managed to accomplish at such a young age, to be incredible. Listen in now and get some great tips for gaining followers on social media.

 Amber spent a couple of years working for Elizabeth Lamont (#17) at her store, Room With A View, in Santa Monica. This is where she first fell in love with pretty things and with design and started to feel a pull in that direction. Listen in and find out how Amber first discovered her niche in the world of design and how her business has evolved and grown, since then.

 &nbsp;

 Today, Amber talks to LuAnn about:&nbsp;

  How she first started out, working for Elizabeth Lamont and where she went, from there. How she initially didn't connect being an Interior Designer with making a living. How much she gained from working for and being mentored by Kirsten Marie. Why she only hires people who have completed school. How she learned about design on the job, through making mistakes, rather than going to school. That she runs her business as a team effort. What it was like for her, speaking at the Design Blogger's Conference. Why you shouldn't compare your own business with the appearance of someone else's success. How she first started to develop a name for herself through her initial obsessive engagement with her community. How she has learned and progressed through her business. Creating a formula to her really successful method of engagement with social media. Her e-commerce store- how it started through her blog which documented the decoration of her home. Her Flash Sales on Instagram- a great way to gain followers. Her struggle with sacrificing her family time for the huge amount of time and attention that she poured into developing her business. Her milestones, analyzing why her followers were coming back. The first time her house was properly published, in Glitter Guide and in HD TV Magazine how she used the pics to her advantage. The silly names she uses for her clients' hashtags! Her fabulous photographer, Tessa W, who she's used on all her projects. The value of using really great photography. Being featured in Architectural Digest last October, for her kitchen. Working with agencies for blog sponsorship. Brand ambassadorship and how it has developed. That she does all her own writing for all her social media platforms.  Amber's website:

College scholar Amber Quinney shares with you how she lost her appetite for virtual interaction through her year-long social media fast. Through her talk, learn how to be more mindful of your social media presence and how to be more present in your own life. Amber Quinney is no average college student. A Marketing major at Canisius College, she has completed seven internships and earned more than $50,00 in private scholarships. Amber was a finalist at the national C.E.O. elevator pitch competition, won two research grants, and twice was a WNY Prosperity fellow. She completed the University of California Emerging Leaders Program, and is the founder of “Charm School for Sisters,” which teaches young girls of color about self-love, sisterhood, and success skills. Her talk is based off of her recent research for candidacy for her degree and explores the negative effects on the brain of over saturation of social media exposure and addiction. Her talk also explores the critical role that social media and media stimulation plays in our everyday lives.

Dorothy Gibbons is the Co-Founder & CEO of The Rose in Houston, TX.  She is also an author, motivator, fundraiser, speaker, and force of nature!
Dorothy’s leadership has led to many firsts – she employed patient navigators when no one had heard of that terminology, established a 500 + member strong Physicians Network that provides pro-bono care for the uninsured; brought in the first truly portable and business adaptable Mobile Mammography units which now serves a 35 county area in southeast Texas, created the Breast Health Collaborative of Texas, was the first female selected for the Community Health Leadership Award in 2008 by the Episcopal Health Charities, named Houston’s first “Fearless Woman” Awardee in 2011, was the first recipient of the Trekker Award, and her first national award was as Yoplait’s Breast Cancer Champion in 2012.
Her nonprofit experience involves healthcare, education and women’s issues. She has served as founder or on the founding board for the Breast Health Collaborative of Texas, the North Pasadena Community Outreach, the Breast Care Center in Washington DC., Gateway to Care and the Texas Medical Centers Women’s Health Network in Houston. She has served on the boards of the Texas Executive Women’s, the Association of Business Professional Women, Brigid’s Place and was the primary organizer of the Mary Magdalene Community started in 2005.
Like most women she juggles her professional and personal life, seldom finding a true balance. As a CEO, community leader, published author, wife, mother, yoga instructor, lecturer at the Jung Center, rancher, and advocate for women, her labels are many. Her true education began at the bedside of her dying mother, then continued through the real-life experiences of leading The Rose. With a BA in communications, she is also a student of women’s roles in world religions, mythology and history.

In 2018 the Valhalla Wilderness Society sponsored a scientific expedition into the largest of two contiguous valleys to record an ecological inventory of plant, macrofungi and lichen species using standard sampling and photodocumentation methods. Biologists Toby Spribille, Curtis Björk, Wayne McCrory, Tyson Ehlers and Amber Peters conducted exploratory research to determine the ecological and inland rainforest values of the newly discovered wilderness. An impressive diversity of rare habitats and species were discovered, including abundant growth of oceanic lichen species indicative of a true rainforest ecosystem. Researchers have since concluded that the Rainbow-Jordan Wilderness harbours stands of some of the richest Inland Temperate Rainforest yet found in the province, making the unroaded and unlogged wilderness a valuable refuge for wildlife and sensitive plant communities. The presentation will include a summary of rare and at-risk species that have been inventoried to date, as well as photography by the researchers and by well-known professional photographer Douglas Noblet.

The Valhalla Wilderness Society have submitted a proposal for this area of land to be included in a protected areas proposal currently under review with the province of British Columbia and the Federal government.

When Marina J became a single mum in 2001 her light went out. She couldn’t find anyone to teach her; not just how to turn her life around, but actually how to flourish. 

So she made a decision: She would do it. 

She put herself on her own program and within 6 months her life turned around in a BIG way and her light turned back ON. 

She had what those around her didn’t: A system that took her out of her old life and into the new. 

Since then she’s become a #1 best-selling author, a speaker and a life coach - because your happiness is everything! 

She married the love of her life and lives by the beach near Sydney. 

She’s been interviewed by Channel 9’s breakfast show, ABC radio, Fox Sports Radio, 2GB radio, Body + Soul, Better Health and Gardens, and more. 

Her motto? Is that you’re built to heal; because you’re built to live that life that’s waiting for you!

This week, the entire interview has been constructed around The Grand Opening Night for the most famous show in town - “Ignite Your Power” & Marina J is the main character about to hit the stage! 

We went behind stage with Marina, dove into the four acts of the show, had a remarkable encore and sat back and reflected in the dressing room once the show was over. 

Ignite Your Power demonstrates the foundational core of truly diving inwards to make a difference in not only our personal or business lives but most importantly, in our children’s...

Here are some key points summarised in the four acts:

First Act: Decide What You Don’t Want
First step in igniting your personal power
Lots of self help saying “don’t think negative” = Marina completely DISAGREES.
Pay attention to this natural step or you’ll be worse off in the future
Decipher what’s right for you AND what’s wrong for you
Find and write down where your energy drains are
Worship and trust your B.S detector

Second Act: Desire What You Do
Isn’t that selfish? YES! The best kind of selfish
Start small - example: what do you want for lunch?
Go with your feeling in the here and now - the rest will follow
We’re all energy...

Third Act: Detox What’s In Your Way
Focus on emotional detox
What are you more committed to?
The importance of asking more powerful questions
85% of what’s in our way, lives underneath in our subconscious 
You can talk all you want, but until you go deep - you’ll always be where you are
Real healing = where you won’t walk out of this year with the same problems you walked into this year with
We all hold 50% masculine & 50% feminine energy and truly NEED both
Most of us, need to raise the feminine to match the already high masculine energy we’ve all been taught

Fourth and Final Act: Self-Love Action
Self Love = It’s the act of being kind to yourself
How kind are you being on yourself right now?
Your children learn it from you
If you don’t love yourself, how do you expect your child to love their self?


Looking back and reflecting on your business & life journey, going back to whichever age you choose, what advice would you share with yourself and how old are you?

Marina would go back to her 8 year old self and teach herself to keep some of the energy inwards - to not always give it all away... 

She has always had a great deal of energy, but wasn’t aware of how to manage it and would tend to give it out rather than keeping some in and replenishing herself. 

So she would actually receive and invest in herself and move forward. 

She simply didn’t understand how to contain it... 

Eventually she learned to keep some of it inwards for herself to move forward too. 

Final thought: 
What turns you on?
What turns you off?
Begin asking yourself powerful questions and you’ll be surprised of the wisdom that’s already within you that just wants to be heard. 
If you want to bring out the best in your children, focus on your own healing and that’s the legacy you want to be passing onto the next generation...

This week's featured guest is Marina J. 

When Marina J became a single mum in 2001 her light went out. She couldn’t find anyone to teach her; not just how to turn her life around, but actually how to flourish. 

So she made a decision: She would do it. 

She put herself on her own program and within 6 months her life turned around in a BIG way and her light turned back ON. 

She had what those around her didn’t: A system that took her out of her old life and into the new. 

Since then she’s become a #1 best-selling author, a speaker and a life coach - because your happiness is everything! 

She married the love of her life and lives by the beach near Sydney. 

She’s been interviewed by Channel 9’s breakfast show, ABC radio, Fox Sports Radio, 2GB radio, Body + Soul, Better Health and Gardens, and more. 

Her motto? Is that you’re built to heal; because you’re built to live that life that’s waiting for you!

This week, the entire interview has been constructed around The Grand Opening Night for the most famous show in town - “Ignite Your Power” & Marina J is the main character about to hit the stage! 

We went behind stage with Marina, dove into the four acts of the show, had a remarkable encore and sat back and reflected in the dressing room once the show was over. 

Ignite Your Power demonstrates the foundational core of truly diving inwards to make a difference in not only our personal or business lives but most importantly, in our children’s...

Here are some key points summarised in the four acts:

First Act: Decide What You Don’t Want
First step in igniting your personal power
Lots of self help saying “don’t think negative” = Marina completely DISAGREES.
Pay attention to this natural step or you’ll be worse off in the future
Decipher what’s right for you AND what’s wrong for you
Find and write down where your energy drains are
Worship and trust your B.S detector

Second Act: Desire What You Do
Isn’t that selfish? YES! The best kind of selfish
Start small - example: what do you want for lunch?
Go with your feeling in the here and now - the rest will follow
We’re all energy...

Third Act: Detox What’s In Your Way
Focus on emotional detox
What are you more committed to?
The importance of asking more powerful questions
85% of what’s in our way, lives underneath in our subconscious 
You can talk all you want, but until you go deep - you’ll always be where you are
Real healing = where you won’t walk out of this year with the same problems you walked into this year with
We all hold 50% masculine & 50% feminine energy and truly NEED both
Most of us, need to raise the feminine to match the already high masculine energy we’ve all been taught

Fourth and Final Act: Self-Love Action
Self Love = It’s the act of being kind to yourself
How kind are you being on yourself right now?
Your children learn it from you
If you don’t love yourself, how do you expect your child to love their self?


Looking back and reflecting on your business & life journey, going back to whichever age you choose, what advice would you share with yourself and how old are you?

Marina would go back to her 8 year old self and teach herself to keep some of the energy inwards - to not always give it all away... 

She has always had a great deal of energy, but wasn’t aware of how to manage it and would tend to give it out rather than keeping some in and replenishing herself. 

So she would actually receive and invest in herself and move forward. 

She simply didn’t understand how to contain it... 

Eventually she learned to keep some of it inwards for herself to move forward too. 

Final thought: 
What turns you on?
What turns you off?
Begin asking yourself powerful questions and you’ll be surprised of the wisdom that’s already within you that just wants to be heard. 
If you want to bring out the best in your children, focus on your own healing and that’s the legacy you want to be passing onto the next generation...
