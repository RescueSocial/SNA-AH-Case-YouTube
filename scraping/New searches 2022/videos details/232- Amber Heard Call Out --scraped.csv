Police did respond to a call about a domestic incident but left after the reported victim chose not to file a report.

Meanwhile, a source told E! News that Heard was seen both two days and five days after the alleged phone incident with no visible injury to her face.

Also that weekend, Depp's latest movie, the Alice in Wonderland sequel Through the Looking Glass, was busy tanking at the box office while he was in Europe for a string of shows with his band Hollywood Vampires.
