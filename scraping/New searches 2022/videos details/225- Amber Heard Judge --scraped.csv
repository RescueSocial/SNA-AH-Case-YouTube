With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

He was forced into the Amber Guyger trial via subpoena. Lee Merritt spoke on Full Circle Anderson Coopers show on CNN. He stated it’s likely Joshua’s past caught up with him, but nobody should be ruled out including Dallas PD. The courts knew Joshua Brown was in fear for his life. During Joshua’s Testimony there was an intermission for a break. Audio unintentionally was heard of Judge Tammy Kemp “of course he’s here” “I’m surprised he came” They failed to protect this witness, especially having everything broadcasted live via stream. I personally feel this maybe he past catching up with him but everything needs to be looked into. Joshua Brown would have also been a witness testimony for the civil case. 

New York Post:
Brown fled the state for California, where he remained as the trial got underway, according to Meritt.
But prosecutors “hounded him” and threatened to issue a warrant for his arrest if he didn’t appear in court. “So he got on a plane and came straight from the airport to the courthouse,” Merritt said.
Once he arrived, Brown met with the judge in her chambers about his concerns, but ultimately ended up taking the stand, Meritt said
