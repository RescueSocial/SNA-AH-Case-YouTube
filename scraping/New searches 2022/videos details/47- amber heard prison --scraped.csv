With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

Amber was initially sentenced to 5 years in the big house for violating probation in her drug possession case.

The judge had given Amber the choice of going to a drug rehab program instead of prison -- but Amber decided she would rather serve time than do the program.

Now, we've learned the 24-year-old MTV star -- who began her sentence in June 2012 -- was released Monday morning (only 17 months into her sentence).

We're told Portwood was granted early release due to good behavior, time served and the fact that she completed two unspecified prison courses while serving her time.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

Heard was the only one charged with smuggling the dogs in but she got off on a very lightly.
Transcript:
""When you disrespect Australian law, they will tell you firmly,"" Johnny Depp said.

""I am truly sorry that Pistol and Boo were not declared. Protecting Australia is important,"" Amber Heard said. 

Johnny Depp and his wife Amber Heard are stiltedly apologizing for bringing their two dogs into Australia illegally last year. 

""We were under the impression that we had all the paperwork for the dogs. We were there with the dogs in front of everybody. Um, there might have been other things smuggled,"" Depp told Jimmy Kimmel.

Australian authorities charged Heard — not Depp — after she brought her two Yorkshire terriers with her on a private jet to go visit Depp, who was in the country filming the next ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" movie. 

Australia's maximum penalty for the illegal import of animals is 10 years in prison and a $75,000 fine, but Heard got off very lightly Monday after she appeared in court.

She received a one-month good behavior bond of about $765 after pleading guilty to providing a false immigration document. This means the actress can't commit any other offense in the country through May 18. 

Heard was also required to read a prepared statement, which was filmed and placed on the Australian Government Department of Agriculture and Water Resources' YouTube account. 

""Australia is a wonderful island, with a treasure trove of unique plants, animals and people,"" Heard said. 

""It has to be protected,"" Depp said. 

It's quite clear that Heard and Depp would rather be doing anything other than filming that video, and Twitter users seem to agree.

One said, ""Deep is very underrated as an actor. That performance of 'man loathing every second of being forced to do this' was utterly convincing."" While another said, ""I doubt Depp or Heard could have been any worse at the acting in that video if they tried.""

And then there's all those people who think the apology looks suspiciously like a hostage video. 

This video includes clips from NBC and TBS and images from Getty Images.

While some celebrities prefer living a quiet life away from the public, others just have so many scandals following them. In this video, we are going to talk about Johnny Depp and Amber Heard, who have been on each other’s throats ever since they split up and how Amber Heard might be facing jail time for one mistake she made in all this.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

Welcome toThe Gossipy. We make interesting videos about Hollywood in English. We give you a closer look in the lives of celebrities like Kanye West, Ed Sheeran, The Rock, Jay Z, Selena Gomez, Kylie Jenner, Kim Kardashian, Rihanna and 100s more.

Today we talk about what into Johnny Depp's big win in court and talk about how Amber Heard will likely respond.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.
