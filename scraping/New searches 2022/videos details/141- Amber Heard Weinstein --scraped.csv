In US news and current events today, Actress, author, and activist Amber Tamblyn has a message for men: 

'At the end of 2017, a few months after millions of women told their stories of sexual harassment and assault across the world, my friend, an unknown and up-and-coming actor named Ryan Reynolds (never heard of him) said to me, “I get it. I get what women are asking for right now. They would like us to back off and sit down and be quiet for a change.Then once you've figured out what you need from us, you'll tell us and we'll need to get on board and support you.' – Amber Tamblyn on sexual assault. 

Tamblyn recently wrote a book called “Era of Ignition” which chronicles her personal exploration of feminism in the Third Wave, but one of her favorite parts of the book is the Male Ally Manifesto. 

'When it comes to men being accused of bad behavior, let's leave the ancient, messy laws of the American justice system and instead listen to the rational and reasonable intelligence of women like Roxane Gay. On whether or not she believes Woody Allen did or did not molest his daughter, Dylan Farrow, she once wrote, “I know where I stand and why. I know I would rather stand where I stand and eventually be proven wrong than support Woody Allen and eventually be proven wrong.” In other words, my friends, err on the side of women, not on the side of your brethren.' — Amber Tamblyn on 'Male Ally Manifesto' 

Watch our full interview with activist Amber Tamblyn to learn how she's taking a stand against sexual assault.
