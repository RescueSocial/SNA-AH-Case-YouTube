Vancouver, Canada.  The estate manager said he was tasked with finding the star's severed finger.  Depp claims that his finger was cut off during an altercation with his ex-wife Amber Heard, claiming

his hand while smashing a plastic phone against the wall repeatedly and she was not present at the time of the injury.  King was shown the video, which was played on day one of the trial and again yesterday, of Depp kicking kitchen cupboards and pouring himself a pint of red wine for breakfast.   Asking about the actor's behaviour on the video Sasha Wass, QC for The Sun asked: ""Did you ever see Mr Depp conduct himself like that during the time you worked for him?'  Mr King answered he had not.  King said he learned from the media that Depp lost his finger when a vodka bottle was

her into a ping-pong table, choked her against a fridge and throttled her.  Depp has admitted he wrote on a mirror in blood from his severed finger.  Talking about cleaning up after a fight at their

Welcome Back To Our Channel, In This Video we will talk about What Johnny Depp’s Friend’s has to say about the Whole drama

Johnny's friend for almost thirty years, Josh Richman tells a lot about their relationship and how they were as a ""Happily Married couple"". Johnny met Amber on the sets of the Movie ""The Rum Diary"" in 2011. The couple dated for a few years before finally getting married in February 2015. However Josh Richman who was present there at the wedding said that Johnny's friends were not “THAT” happy about the marriage. He also said that she was always manipulative and emotionally abusive. None of Johnny's friends wanted him to marry her. He also said that Amber used to keep Johnny away from his real friends. Amber filed the divorce case stating that she was physically abused under the effect of drugs and alcohol. She also stated an incident in which Depp allegedly threw his phone at her which leaved a bruise on her face. However a police spokesman said that no crime was found under his investigation. Johnny denies all the allegations saying that this was an attempt to secure a premature financial resolution by alleging abuse. However Amber did receive $7 million from the divorce which according to THE PEOPLE was donated to charity. The divorce was settled one year after the case was filed. And a non-disparagement clause was inserted into the settlement. This clause was to prevent either party from saying anything negative about the relationship

Read More Related Articles    But the actor said Heard had been violent towards him and had tried to provoke him on multiple occasions.   The court was shown a picture supposedly showing gruesome injuries suffered by Depp at the hands of his then-wife.   Depp claimed he had part of his finger severed when Heard threw a vodka bottle at him.

and 2016 and she claims she was ""best friends"" with his then-partner Heard at the time.    She appeared via video link from Los Angeles to give evidence and when asked if she ever saw Depp hit Heard, Pennington told the court she did not.  In her witness statement, which was presented to the court today, Pennington discussed the couple's trip to Australia in 2015, during which Depp was said to have caused $150,000 worth of damage to their rented home.  She claims Heard told her that she had a row with Depp over his drinking, as he had previously been trying to give up alcohol.  Rachel Pennington repeated Heard's allegations that Depp threw several glass bottles at her during the argument.    Pennington said: ""She [Heard] said that he was throwing glass bottles at her, and there was broken glass all over the ground which cut her feet.  ""She said he backed her up against a bar and she was trying to support herself but her arms were sliding down and getting cut by broken

So far, 4935 have signed.  It comes after Depp fans launched another petition to have Amber removed from Aquaman 2, calling for Warner Bros. to take action against the star amid the domestic abuse allegations.   Nearly 350,000 people have signed the petition.  Metro.co.uk has reached out to Amber Heard’s rep.   In November, it was reported Amber is trying to get Depp’s defamation lawsuit dismissed and it has now been pushed back to August 2020.   She and Depp married in 2015, before divorcing two years later in 2017.   In May 2016, Amber filed for a domestic violence restraining order against Depp, accusing him of abusing her. Depp denied the claims and the exes settled their divorce out of court for £5.6million.  Need support?

Lyrics:
ALL THE FOLKS DOWN IN LYNCHBURG TENNESSEE
BEEN WORKIN’ HARD FOR GOOD OL’ BOYS LIKE ME
I DON’T WANNA BE THE ONE TO TELL ‘EM
THAT STUFF THAT THEY BEEN SELLIN’
AIN’T WORKIN’ LIKE IT SHOULD
BUT I DAMN SURE WISH IT WOULD

WHISKEY’S SUPPOSED TO DROWN A MEMORY
I’VE GONE FROM ONE TO ONE TOO MANY
AND THE THING THAT REALLY GETS ME
IS HOW YOUR MEMORY DROWNS THE WHISKEY

MAYBE IT’S THE BAR OR THIS STOOL I’M ON
MAYBE IT’S THE BAND AND THIS SAD OL’ SONG
THAT KEEPS ME BUYIN’ ROUNDS
KEEPS ME TURNIN’ DOWN
ANY GIRL THAT WANTS TO DANCE
YOU AIN’T GIVIN’ THEM A CHANCE

WHISKEY’S SUPPOSED TO DROWN THE MEMORY
I’VE GONE FROM ONE TO ONE TOO MANY
AND THE THING THAT REALLY GETS ME
IS HOW YOUR MEMORY DROWNS THE WHISKEY

GIRL I’M LIVIN’ PROOF THAT 80 PROOF
AIN’T GOT A SHOT AT TOUCHIN’ YOU

WHISKEY’S SUPPOSED TO DROWN A MEMORY
I’VE GONE FROM ONE TO ONE TOO MANY
AND THE THING THAT REALLY GETS ME

IS WHISKEY’S SUPPOSED TO DROWN THE MEMORY
I’VE GONE FROM ONE TO ONE TOO MANY

#JohnnyDepp is suing the British newspaper The Sun for a 2018 article which labelled him as a wife beater. The trial started on 7 July 2020 and both Head and Depp have been giving their own version of what happened. 

It is slightly difficult to know what is true and what isn’t, but it is like watching a movie. We bring you the top moments from Amber Depp abuse case based on headlines we have seen. 

1. Depp accuses Heard of manipulating him into a relationship. 

The two met on set in 2011 while filming for “The Rum Diary” and married in February 2015 before filing for divorce in May 2016 which formally concluded in 2017. So a very short marriage. 

According to several media reports, he has described the actress as ""a narcissist"" who's ""calculating,"" and ""sociopathic"". According to him “she had an agenda, namely to get married to me in order to progress her own career and/or to benefit financially, and she knew how to bring it about.” “She presented herself as a carbon copy of me, with precisely the same interests, thoughts, favorite writers, taste in music and art as me,"" he claimed

Apparently she went as far as telling him she admired all his films except he later discovered she hadn’t seen any of them. 

2. He claims she ""severed his finger with the second of two thrown vodka bottles"" and put out a cigarette on his face during a March 2015 row in Australia. 

She says he caused the injury himself when he smashed a telephone against a wall.

Apparently he then used the blood from his hand to write “I love you” on the mirror as well as accusing her of being a fraud and cheating on him with Billy Bob Thornton.  

Amber then supposedly had a mental breakdown “begging Johnny not to leave the house” while also “screaming at him for running away.” According to Johnny’s body guard. 

They used a coverup story of injuring his finger while cutting onions to avoid bad press. 
3. In the same incident in Australia Amber says it was a “three-day ordeal of physical assault” and she was “scared for her life”
Amber says that he spat in her face, choked her against a fridge causing her to run to the bathroom. By the end, she had ""a broken lip, swollen nose and cuts all over her body.""

Apparently, they had also caused $150,000 worth of damage to the property including leaving blood on sofas and urinating on walls. 

4. Amber or one of her friends defacated in the bed

The day the marriage was called off was the day Amber or supposedly one of her friends defecated in the bed in their department. She later said it had just been “a harmless prank”. 

Then when the housekeeper sent the pictures to Depp of the faeces, Heard accused her of trying to ruin her marriage. 

“Ms. Heard continued to disagree with me, but I wanted to end the conversation as quickly as possible,"" said the housekeeper on the sixth day of trial. ""She has a bad temper in my opinion, and I did not want her to yell at me."" Amber's team, meanwhile, has suggested that it was actually Johnny — who started referring to his missus as ""Amber Turd"" — who defecated in the bed.

5. Amber accused Johnny of hanging her dog out of the window 

Depp denied the claim that he held one of her two tea cup puppies out of moving vehicle which he denied but when confronted of their long running joke about putting the pup in the microwave, he didn’t deny and fessed up to giving him hashish on one occasion claiming that the dog “scooped it up before he could do anything about it”

6. Johnny wanted to drown and burn his wife

 The Sun presented texts as evidence between the Paul Bettany and Johnny who took drugs together, where Johnny joked about drowning and burning his then-wife ""to make sure she's dead."" In one exchange, they joked about buying a pet beaver for Amber and then recording Johnny shaving it so they could post a clip online titled ""Johnny Depp shaves Amber Heard's beaver.""

7. Depp kicked her after accusing her of having an affair with Faro then accused her of crying about it. 

He says he confronted her and then locked himself into the plane’s bathroom where he slept all night. 

8. She haymarkered him

Depp says when he told Amber he lost $750 million in a shady deal on the night of her birthday party she tried to punch him. She says he threw a champagne bottle, pulled her hair, grabbed her by the throat and pushed her and her sister. 

Depp gave his daughter drugs at 13

Depp’s drug habit is well known, but apparently he also gave his daughter Lily-Rose Depp, marijuana when she was just 13. He claims it’s because he would rather give her good quality drugs than something she would purchase from another dealer. He also claims that he checked with her mother Venessa Paradis first.

""She has a bad temper in my opinion, and I did not want her to yell at me."" Amber's team, meanwhile, has suggested that it was actually Johnny — who started referring to his missus as ""Amber Turd"" — who defecated in the bed.

5. Amber accused Johnny of hanging her dog out of the window 

Depp denied the claim that he held one of her two tea cup puppies out of moving vehicle which he denied but when confronted of their long running joke about putting the pup in the microwave, he didn’t deny and fessed up to giving him hashish on one occasion claiming that the dog “scooped it up before he could do anything about it”

6. Johnny wanted to drown and burn his wife

 The Sun presented texts as evidence between the Paul Bettany and Johnny who took drugs together, where Johnny joked about drowning and burning his then-wife ""to make sure she's dead."" In one exchange, they joked about buying a pet beaver for Amber and then recording Johnny shaving it so they could post a clip online titled ""Johnny Depp shaves Amber Heard's beaver.""

7. Depp kicked her after accusing her of having an affair with Faro then accused her of crying about it. 

He says he confronted her and then locked himself into the plane’s bathroom where he slept all night. 

8. She haymarkered him

Depp says when he told Amber he lost $750 million in a shady deal on the night of her birthday party she tried to punch him. She says he threw a champagne bottle, pulled her hair, grabbed her by the throat and pushed her and her sister. 

Depp gave his daughter drugs at 13

Depp’s drug habit is well known, but apparently he also gave his daughter Lily-Rose Depp, marijuana when she was just 13. He claims it’s because he would rather give her good quality drugs than something she would purchase from another dealer. He also claims that he checked with her mother Venessa Paradis first.
