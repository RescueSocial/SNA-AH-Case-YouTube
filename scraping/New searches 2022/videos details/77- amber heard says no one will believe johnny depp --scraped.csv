The full version was recorded by Johnny Depp and Amber Heard during their marriage (September 2015). The full recording is being used as evidence in the Johnny Depp v The Sun UK libel case. Depp decided to sue The Sun for publishing an article where they brand him a ‘wife-beater’, for abusing his then wife, Amber Heard. 

When the cut-up/edited 46 minute version leaked in January by Depp’s team, it was made to portray a certain narrative and was used as propaganda. It was leaked 6 months before the trial began and used to lead people and potential jurors to believe that it was somehow an official piece of evidence, which it was not. It was incomplete.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.
