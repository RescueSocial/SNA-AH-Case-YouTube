Don't you know that when you touch me baby that it's torture
Brush up against me I get chills all down my spine
When you talk to me it's painful
You don't know what you do to this heart of mine
Don't make this one dimentional
The way I feel is sexual
The way I feel is sexual
It can't just be intellectual
The way I feel is sexual
The way I feel is sexual
When you're next to me

I confess I watch your mouth move baby when you're speaking
Study your body when you walk out of the room
You'll see how much you value my friendship
But I want you addicted to my perfume
Don't make this one dimentional
The way I feel is sexual
The way I feel is sexual
It can't just be intellectual
The way I feel is sexual
The way I feel is sexual
When you're next to me
When you're next to me

Baby talk to me and let me kiss you
Let me show you the things I can do for you
Don't make this one dimentional

It can't just be intellectual
The way I feel is sexual
The way I feel is sexual

Don't you know that when you touch me baby that it's torture
Brush up against me I get chills all down my spine
When you talk to me it's painful
You don't know what you do to this heart of mine
