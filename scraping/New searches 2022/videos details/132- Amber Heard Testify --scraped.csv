She had testified for less than an hour the first time she broke down in tears. Guyger, who had previously showed little emotion and talked in very subdued tones while on the witness stand, suddenly began to cry and weep loudly.

State District Judge Tammy Kemp sent the jury out of the courtroom to allow Guyger to take a 10-minute break.

About an hour later, Guyger began crying again and telling people that she was sorry and that she will have to live with her decision to shoot an innocent man for the rest of her life.

“No police officer would ever want to hurt an innocent person,” Guyger said.

Guyger, 31, is charged with murder in the Sept. 6, 2018, death of her neighbor Botham Shem Jean, 26. She has said that she mistook Jean’s apartment for her own and thought he was an intruder.

Guyger, who was in uniform but off duty at the time of the shooting, was fired from the Dallas police force.

Guyger approached the door with her key in hand and stopped, she said.

“I saw it [the door] was cracked open,” Guyger testified. “I heard someone moving around in my apartment. There was a loud shuffling around. But me putting the key in the lock is pushing the door open.”

Guyger said she was scared to death and her heart rate sky-rocketed.

“I compare it to being in a car wreck,” Guyger said. “Right before you are going to hit, everything freezes up inside your body. It’s just fear, fear, fear.”

Guyger said she saw a shadow of a figure in the back of the dark room and yelled at him.

“Let me see your hands! Let me see your hands! And I drew my service revolver,” Guyger said. “Then I saw him coming toward me. I thought he was going to kill me. He was yelling, ‘Hey, hey, hey!’ in an aggressive voice.”

She said the figure was pacing back and forth near the back wall. Only a matter of seconds passed. Guyger fired two rounds.

Guyger said she shot because she believed the man was going to kill her. He was coming toward her at a “fast-paced” walk, she said, and she couldn’t see his hands and didn’t know if he had a weapon. Police later found Jean was unarmed, and prosecutors say he was never a threat to Guyger.

After shooting Jean, Guyger testified, she then walked to the kitchen counter area and that’s when she started to realize that she was in the wrong apartment and she had shot someone innocent.

“Before that I was only focused on the threat,” Guyger said.

Guyger testified that as she walked toward Jean’s fallen body she realized that she had no idea who he was.

“I was kneeling down next to him and I called 911,” Guyger said. “I knew I had shot him. I didn’t know where he was shot on his body.”

Guyger testified that she was calling 911 with one hand and doing chest compressions on Jean with her other hand. When questioned by a prosecutor, she said she stopped her attempts at first aid several times. Guyger told the jury that she walked outside so she could see where she was and give the location to the 911 dispatcher.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0jyvInqczVs/default.jpg,120,90,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0jyvInqczVs/mqdefault.jpg,320,180,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0jyvInqczVs/hqdefault.jpg,480,360,,,,,,,Edward Malone,22,none,Amber Guyger Testifies And Is Cross Examined In Her Murder Trial Concerning Botham Jean,"Ex-Dallas police officer Amber Guyger cried two times while she was being questioned during her murder trial on Friday.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

""It’s a sad day,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif, told Fox News on Tuesday. ""A calm day. A prayerful day."" For his part, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., called the hearings a ""solemn undertaking"" in a letter to colleagues.

Behind the scenes, House Democrats were predicting a ""phenomenal week,"" Fox News is told. At the same time, Republicans have been preparing a methodical and vigorous cross-examination of Democrats' witnesses, whose accounts of President Trump's alleged wrongdoing have been based largely on hearsay and intuition.

Capitol Hill security officials told Fox News they're not anticipating the kinds of organized protests that rocked the Supreme Court confirmation hearings of Brett Kavanaugh last year, but sources on both sides of the aisle have cautioned that the day will be unpredictable. The proceedings are to be held in the cavernous House Ways and Means Committee hearing room at the Longworth House Office Building.

With the bang of a gavel, Schiff will open the impeachment hearings Wednesday into Trump's alleged pressure on Ukraine to investigate 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden's dealings in the country. The former vice president, a Democrat, has boasted about pressuring Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, as his son Hunter Biden held a lucrative role board of a Ukrainian natural gas company despite having little relevant expertise.

A whistleblower's complaint about Trump's July 25 telephone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky ignited the impeachment investigation. During the hearing Wednesday, a key exchange during that 30-minute call, which has been outlined in a Sept. 24 transcript released by the White House, could take center stage. Zelensky has said he felt no pressure during the call.

""I would like you to do us a favor though,"" Trump said at one point in the call, after a mention of U.S. military aid to Ukraine. Ukraine apparently was not aware that the U.S. was withholding new military aid until August, approximately two weeks before the U.S. ultimately released the aid and well after Trump's phone call with Zelensky.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/J8TGO9-VvfM/default.jpg,120,90,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/J8TGO9-VvfM/mqdefault.jpg,320,180,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/J8TGO9-VvfM/hqdefault.jpg,480,360,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/J8TGO9-VvfM/sddefault.jpg,640.0,480.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/J8TGO9-VvfM/maxresdefault.jpg,1280.0,720.0,LiveNOW from FOX,25,none,PHONE CALL DEBATE: Witnesses Testify On Phone Call They Were Not On,"In a pillared House chamber at 10 a.m. ET on Wednesday, in the shadow of the 2020 presidential and congressional elections, House Democrats are set to host the first public hearing involving the potential impeachment of a president since November 19, 1998 -- and, they insist, they aren't happy about it.

According to TMZ, the 50-year-old actor was served with legal papers at the premiere of his new film ""Transcendence.""

TMZ reports that Depp will most likely have to take the stand in connection to a 2009 homicide where a Los Angeles limo driver has been charged with mowing down and killing a pedestrian. Nancy Lekon is set to stand trial later this month, but has pled not guilty by reason of insanity.
