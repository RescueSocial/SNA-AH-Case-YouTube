Amber Heard came under fire in April for failing to declare Yorkshire terriers Pistol and Boo to authorities on their arrival in Brisbane.

Australia has strict animal quarantine laws to prevent importing infections.

At the time, a minister said the dogs would be put down if they stayed.

""It's time Pistol and Boo buggered off back to the United States,"" agriculture minister Barnaby Joyce said.

The dogs left the country unharmed at few days later.

However, a subsequent Senate hearing was told that Depp and Heard could be sentenced to as long as 10 years in jail, or be forced to pay a fine of up to $265,000 (£172,000) if they were found guilty of illegally importing then.

Depp is currently filming the latest instalment of the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise on Australia's Gold Coast.

But it is Heard, the star of Friday Night Lights and Magic Mike XXL, who has been ordered to appear in court, Australia's department of agriculture confirmed.

""Ms Amber Heard was served with a summons issued by the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions on July 14,"" a statement read.

""The CDPP's action follows an incident where a biosecurity officer attended a Gold Coast property in April and found two dogs alleged to be illegally imported.

""All animals entering Australia must have an import permit, and have undergone relevant testing and health checks signed off by a government veterinarian from the exporting country to ensure pests and diseases from overseas are not brought here.""

Heard previously criticised the way the case had been handled, and suggested she would not return to the country.

""I have a feeling we're going to avoid the land Down Under from now on, just as much as we can thanks to certain politicians there,"" she told Australia's NBC.

Ms Heard, married to actor Johnny Depp, had pleaded guilty in court to making a false statement on her immigration card about the couple's Yorkshire terriers.

But the Queensland judge gave her a one-month good behaviour bond with no conviction recorded. If she breaks the bond she must pay A$1,000 ($770; £540).

The authorities also released an unusual video apology from the couple.

In the video, which was shown in court and made public by the Department of Agriculture, the couple expressed remorse and advised travellers to respect Australian quarantine laws.


Ms Heard and Mr Depp both attended Southport Magistrate's Court in Queensland state, amid a media scrum.

Her guilty plea meant Mr Depp was excused from giving evidence to the court.

Two illegal importation charges against her were dropped earlier.

They had carried a maximum penalty of 10 years in jail or fines of up to A$265,000.
Ms Heard brought the dogs, Pistol and Boo, to Queensland in a private jet in May 2015 to visit Mr Depp, who was filming Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales.
The dogs' presence in the country was noticed after a local dog groomer posted a photo of them on social media.

Ms Heard, 29, had pleaded guilty to declaring ""No"" on her immigration card under the section asking if she was bringing anything, including animals, into the country.

Her lawyer argued that the actress had done so because she thought Mr Depp's assistants had already sorted out the dogs' travel documents.

The dogs were quickly taken out of the country and Ms Heard vowed never to return to Australia.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4i72DcuG9FQ/default.jpg,120,90,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4i72DcuG9FQ/mqdefault.jpg,320,180,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4i72DcuG9FQ/hqdefault.jpg,480,360,NewsReport24,25,none,Depp's wife Amber Heard avoids Australia dog-smuggling conviction,"Actress Amber Heard has avoided a conviction for illegally taking her dogs into Australia.

Heard made her film debut in acclaimed sports drama Friday Night Lights, starring Billy Bob Thornton. After small roles in North Country and Alpha Dog, Heard played her first leading role in All the Boys Love Mandy Lane and appeared in The CW television show Hidden Palms.
Her breakthrough came in 2008 with roles in Never Back Down and Pineapple Express. She was awarded with Breakthrough Award at Young Hollywood Awards. She got widespread attention after her appearance in films such as The Informers, The Stepfather, Zombieland and The Joneses. She next starred in John Carpenter's The Ward, alongside Nicolas Cage in Drive Angry, and alongside Johnny Depp in The Rum Diary, for which she won a Spotlight Award at Hollywood Film Festival. Her recent films include Paranoia, Machete Kills and 3 Days to Kill.
Regarded as a sex symbol, Heard often appears in magazines' Most Beautiful and Sexiest lists. She is also involved in social activism for causes such as gay rights and abolishing slavery, and is a supporter of Habitat for Humanity, Girl Up United Nations Foundation, The Art of Elysium and Amnesty International.
While in Los Angeles, Heard made appearances in several TV shows and two music videos, Kenny Chesney's ""There Goes My Life"" and Eisley's ""I Wasn't Prepared"". She was cast as Liz in the pilot episode of The WB's Jack & Bobby (2004), as Riley in an episode of The Mountain (2004) and she had a brief cameo as a salesgirl in The O.C. (2005). Her first movie role was Maria in Friday Night Lights (2004), starring Billy Bob Thornton. Based on actual events, the movie was both a commercial and critical success. She next starred as Shay in Side FX (2005), an independent horror film, and had supporting roles in Drop Dead Sexy (2005), Price to Pay (2006) and You Are Here (2006). Heard had a more prominent role in Niki Caro's North Country (2005) where she played teenage Josey, Charlize Theron's character whom Amber is fan of. She also appeared in a minor role in Nick Cassavetes' Alpha Dog (2006). In the same year, she starred in an episode of Criminal Minds as Lila Archer, a love interest of main character Spencer Reid. Heard was next cast in the CW's Hidden Palms. On the show she portrayed Greta Matthews, who suffered the losses of both her mother and boyfriend, Eddie, and befriends Johnny, the antihero of the show. In order to get the part, Heard was asked to lose weight. It took her four months between the pilot and the second episode to lose 25 pounds, giving up alcohol, increasing her workouts and following a macrobiotic diet (no meat, dairy or processed sugar). Hidden Palms premiered in the US on May 30, 2007. Ultimately, the CW wrapped the summer series early; instead of the initial 12-episode arc, only 8 were aired. The show ended on July 4, 2007 two weeks earlier than originally planned.
She was cast in the title role in All the Boys Love Mandy Lane, a horror film that premiered at the Toronto Film Festival in September 2006. The film immediately garnered attention and a deal was secured with Harvey Weinstein. However, nearly a year after its Toronto début, the movie had not reached theaters. In July 2007, Mandy Lane found a new distribution home and the film finally was released in 2008 with a February UK release and June DVD release. The film's director Jonathan Levine said about Amber's casting in the title role that ""there was a certain type of beauty and a certain type of innate intelligence that Amber brought to it that is not something you find every day. Certainly, not something you would find in somebody her age. The wisdom she projects, I thought was pretty remarkable."" The Los Angeles Times praised's Heard's acting, saying it's her most ""definitive [performance] to date."" and The Washington Post stated that Heard gave a ""psychologically interesting performance."" 
In 2007, Heard also appeared in the 16-minute-long short movie Day 73 with Sarah and Jess Manafort's indie drama Remember the Daze (aka The Beautiful Ordinary), which premiered at the 2007 Los Angeles Film Festival. She then appeared in the Judd Apatow-produced comedy Pineapple Express and the martial arts drama Never Back Down, both of which were released in 2008. Both films were box office success and brought Heard into a mainstream attention, including a win for Breakthrough Award in Hollywood Film Festival. Richard Roeper praised Heard's performance in Pineapple Express.
Heard also made a brief appearance in Showtime's Californication and joined the ensemble cast of 2009's The Informers, based on the Bret Easton Ellis novel of the same title. She also filmed the horror film The Stepfather and the comedy film Ex-Terminators back-to-back in 2008 while promoting Never Back Down, Mandy Lane and Remember the Daze.

She also appeared in a minor role in Nick Cassavetes' Alpha Dog (2006). In the same year, she starred in an episode of Criminal Minds as Lila Archer, a love interest of main character Spencer Reid. Heard was next cast in the CW's Hidden Palms. On the show she portrayed Greta Matthews, who suffered the losses of both her mother and boyfriend, Eddie, and befriends Johnny, the antihero of the show. In order to get the part, Heard was asked to lose weight. It took her four months between the pilot and the second episode to lose 25 pounds, giving up alcohol, increasing her workouts and following a macrobiotic diet (no meat, dairy or processed sugar). Hidden Palms premiered in the US on May 30, 2007. Ultimately, the CW wrapped the summer series early; instead of the initial 12-episode arc, only 8 were aired. The show ended on July 4, 2007 two weeks earlier than originally planned.
She was cast in the title role in All the Boys Love Mandy Lane, a horror film that premiered at the Toronto Film Festival in September 2006. The film immediately garnered attention and a deal was secured with Harvey Weinstein. However, nearly a year after its Toronto début, the movie had not reached theaters. In July 2007, Mandy Lane found a new distribution home and the film finally was released in 2008 with a February UK release and June DVD release. The film's director Jonathan Levine said about Amber's casting in the title role that ""there was a certain type of beauty and a certain type of innate intelligence that Amber brought to it that is not something you find every day. Certainly, not something you would find in somebody her age. The wisdom she projects, I thought was pretty remarkable."" The Los Angeles Times praised's Heard's acting, saying it's her most ""definitive [performance] to date."" and The Washington Post stated that Heard gave a ""psychologically interesting performance."" 
In 2007, Heard also appeared in the 16-minute-long short movie Day 73 with Sarah and Jess Manafort's indie drama Remember the Daze (aka The Beautiful Ordinary), which premiered at the 2007 Los Angeles Film Festival. She then appeared in the Judd Apatow-produced comedy Pineapple Express and the martial arts drama Never Back Down, both of which were released in 2008. Both films were box office success and brought Heard into a mainstream attention, including a win for Breakthrough Award in Hollywood Film Festival. Richard Roeper praised Heard's performance in Pineapple Express.
Heard also made a brief appearance in Showtime's Californication and joined the ensemble cast of 2009's The Informers, based on the Bret Easton Ellis novel of the same title. She also filmed the horror film The Stepfather and the comedy film Ex-Terminators back-to-back in 2008 while promoting Never Back Down, Mandy Lane and Remember the Daze.

This is a breakdown of WHY the Australian Government has the stance it does on customs / bio-security.

The actress and her husband both smiled when the penalty was delivered by magistrate Bernadette Callaghan. They hugged each other tightly as the court room was cleared. Ms Callaghan said she accepted Heard had made a genuine mistake. ""I accept she did not set out to deliberately deceive the Australian authorities, I also accept she is not a person who thinks she is above the law,"" Ms Callaghan said. The actress will have to pay a $1000 fine if she does not remain of good behaviour for the next month.

Johnny Depp's wife Amber Heard's Australian court hearing over charges that she illegally brought the couple's two dogs into the country has been adjourned until November, the Associated Press reports.

The actress was summoned to the Southport Magistrates Court in Queensland on Monday to answer for the charges that she illegally imported the dogs – terriers Boo and Pistol – and produced a false document in May.

Heard did not appear on Monday, and the case was adjourned until Nov. 2, according to the BBC.

The star, 29, faces a possible 10-year jail term or large fine come November. Depp, however, has not been charged in the case. Australia's strict quarantine laws have been set to prevent diseases from entering the island nation, according to the BBC.

The legal debacle began back in April, when it was discovered that the couple allegedly failed to declare the animals to customs authorities when they arrived for Depp to film the new Pirates of the Caribbean film. The dogs' presence was discovered by Australian authorities after a dog groomer posted photos of the pups on Facebook.

Australia's Agriculture Minister Barnaby Joyce gave the pair 72 hours to return the dogs to the U.S., and threatened to euthanize the animals if Depp and Heard didn't comply with the orders.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JjDkP6D1D7A/default.jpg,120,90,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JjDkP6D1D7A/mqdefault.jpg,320,180,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JjDkP6D1D7A/hqdefault.jpg,480,360,Khalid Sindhu,22,none,Johnny Depp Dog Drama Continues: Amber Heard's Australian Court Case Adjourned Until November,"The dog days aren't over – yet.

She faces two counts of illegally importing Yorkshire terriers Pistol and Boo and one count of producing a false document, according to the Commonwealth Department of Public Prosecutions.
The 'tail' began in May when Agriculture Minister Barnaby Joyce accused Depp, 52, of smuggling the dogs aboard his private jet when he returned to Australia to resume filming the fifth movie in the Pirates Of The Caribbean series.
He said at the time: ""If we start letting movie stars - even though they've been the sexiest man alive twice - to come into our nation (with pets), then why don't we just break the laws for everybody?"" It's time Pistol and Boo b******* off back to the United States.""
Australia has strict quarantine regulations to prevent diseases such as rabies from spreading to its shores.
Importation charges carry a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a fine of AUD$102,000 (£48,000).
The false document charge, which relates to information on an incoming passenger card, carries a penalty of up to a year in prison and a fine of AUD$10,200.
The couple were given three days to send the dogs back to the US or the pets would be put down.
Just hours before the deadline, a Department of Agriculture officer escorted the terriers from the couple's mansion on Queensland's Gold Coast to the airport, where the dogs were put on a flight to the US.
Joyce's comments were parodied worldwide, prompted a petition to save Pistol and Boo and sparked the social media hashtag #WarOnTerrier.
Asked about the charges during an interview with Sky News, Joyce suggested Heard would not be getting any special treatment.
""You, I, everybody - we're equal before the law,"" he said.
The prosecutor's office would not answer questions about why Depp was not charged, citing the ongoing nature of the case.
Heard has been summonsed to appear in a Queensland court on 7 September.

Heard made her film debut in acclaimed sports drama Friday Night Lights, starring Billy Bob Thornton. After small roles in North Country and Alpha Dog, Heard played her first leading role in All the Boys Love Mandy Lane and appeared in The CW television show Hidden Palms.
Her breakthrough came in 2008 with roles in Never Back Down and Pineapple Express. She received the Breakthrough Award at Young Hollywood Awards. She got widespread attention after her appearance in films such as The Informers, The Stepfather, Zombieland and The Joneses. She next starred in John Carpenter's The Ward, alongside Nicolas Cage in Drive Angry, and alongside Johnny Depp in The Rum Diary, for which she won a Spotlight Award at Hollywood Film Festival. Her recent films include Paranoia, Machete Kills and 3 Days to Kill.
Regarded as a sex symbol, Heard often appears in magazines' Most Beautiful and Sexiest lists. She is also involved in social activism for causes such as LGBT rights and abolishing slavery, and is a supporter of Habitat for Humanity, Girl Up United Nations Foundation, The Art of Elysium and Amnesty International.
While in Los Angeles, Heard made appearances in several TV shows and two music videos, Kenny Chesney's ""There Goes My Life"" and Eisley's ""I Wasn't Prepared"". She was cast as Liz in the pilot episode of The WB's Jack & Bobby (2004), as Riley in an episode of The Mountain (2004) and she had a brief cameo as a salesgirl in The O.C. (2005). Her first movie role was Maria in Friday Night Lights (2004), starring Billy Bob Thornton. Based on actual events, the movie was both a commercial and critical success. She next starred as Shay in Side FX (2005), an independent horror film, and had supporting roles in Drop Dead Sexy (2005), Price to Pay (2006) and You Are Here (2006). Heard had a more prominent role in Niki Caro's North Country (2005), in which she played the teenage version of Josey, Charlize Theron's character. She also appeared in a minor role in Nick Cassavetes' Alpha Dog (2006). In the same year, she starred in an episode of Criminal Minds as Lila Archer, a love interest of main character Spencer Reid.
Heard was next cast in the CW's Hidden Palms. On the show she portrayed Greta Matthews, who suffered the losses of both her mother and boyfriend, Eddie, and befriends Johnny, the antihero of the show. In order to get the part, Heard was asked to lose weight. It took her four months between the pilot and the second episode to lose 25 pounds, giving up alcohol, increasing her workouts and following a macrobiotic diet (no meat, dairy or processed sugar). Hidden Palms premiered in the US on May 30, 2007. Ultimately, the CW wrapped the summer series early; instead of the initial 12-episode arc, only 8 were aired. The show ended on July 4, 2007 two weeks earlier than originally planned.
She was cast in the title role in All the Boys Love Mandy Lane, a horror film that premiered at the Toronto Film Festival in September 2006. The film immediately garnered attention and a deal was secured with Harvey Weinstein. However, nearly a year after its Toronto début, the movie had not reached theaters. In July 2007, Mandy Lane found a new distribution home and the film finally was released in 2008 with a February UK release and June DVD release. The film's director Jonathan Levine said about Amber's casting in the title role that ""there was a certain type of beauty and a certain type of innate intelligence that Amber brought to it that is not something you find every day. Certainly, not something you would find in somebody her age. The wisdom she projects, I thought was pretty remarkable."" The Los Angeles Times praised's Heard's acting, saying it's her most ""definitive [performance] to date."" and The Washington Post stated that Heard gave a ""psychologically interesting performance.""
In 2007, Heard also appeared in the 16-minute-long short movie Day 73 with Sarah and Jess Manafort's indie drama Remember the Daze (aka The Beautiful Ordinary), which premiered at the 2007 Los Angeles Film Festival.[20] She then appeared in the Judd Apatow-produced comedy Pineapple Express and the martial arts drama Never Back Down, both of which were released in 2008. Both films were box office successes and brought Heard into mainstream attention, including a win for Breakthrough Award in Hollywood Film Festival. Richard Roeper praised Heard's performance in Pineapple Express.
Heard also made a brief appearance in Showtime's Californication and joined the ensemble cast of 2009's The Informers, based on the Bret Easton Ellis novel of the same title. She also filmed the horror film The Stepfather and the comedy film Ex-Terminators back-to-back in 2008 while promoting Never Back Down, Mandy Lane and Remember the Daze.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

One day after Johnny Depp and Amber Heard released a video apologizing for illegally bringing their dogs into Australia, the country’s deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, and comedian Ricky Gervais mocked the couple’s cringeworthy attempt at saying sorry.

The Aussie politician, 49, reacted to the Hollywood stars’ awkward plea for forgiveness during a Tuesday, April 19, appearance on Sunrise.

“I think he’s auditioning for The Godfather,” Joyce joked of the Pirates of the Caribbean actor, 52. “He’s very good at playing every person except Johnny Depp.”

Asked if he had anything to do with the making of the video — which was posted on the Australian Government of Agriculture and Water Resource’s official YouTube page — Joyce couldn’t help but laugh.

“As far as me directing that atrocious movie? No,” he said. “Even I could have done it a little bit better than that. Do it again, Johnny. Do it with gusto, mate! A little gusto, come on.”

Joyce infamously threatened to euthanize Depp and Heard’s dogs,Yorkshire terriers Pistol and Boo, when he learned that the couple brought them Down Under without authorization.

In the bizarre 42-second snippet, Heard, 29, and her husband speak to the camera, touting the importance of declaring all animals upon entering the country. In addition to urging others to respect Australia's biosecurity laws, Depp dryly described Australians as “both warm and direct,” adding: “If you disrespect Australian law, they will tell you firmly.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Yeno_hxyI3g/default.jpg,120,90,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Yeno_hxyI3g/mqdefault.jpg,320,180,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Yeno_hxyI3g/hqdefault.jpg,480,360,Mohammad Ashir,24,none,"Johnny Depp, Amber Heard’s Dog Apology Video Mocked by Australian Deputy Prime Minister and Ricky","Apology not accepted?

Australian authorities were alerted to the presence of the Yorkshire terriers — Pistol and Boo — after Depp had them taken to a Gold Coast pet salon. Agricultural Minister Barnaby Joyce gave Depp and Heard 72 hours to have their dogs flown back to the U.S. or said they would be put to sleep.

Depp, who is currently filming the fifth installment of Pirates of the Caribbean, declined to comment. Filming was disrupted in March when Depp accidentally slashed his hand open on a glass door, requiring him to return to the U.S. for surgery.
