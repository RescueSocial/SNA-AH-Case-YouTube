If it seems like politicians spend more time these days talking about Aunt Jemima getting taken off pancake mix, and who can use what bathroom than they spend on domestic terrorism, voter suppression, and raising minimum wage, it’s only because you are absolutely correct.

In the last year, there’s been one discussion in Congress on raising the minimum wage, and it only lasted two hours and seven minutes. Meanwhile, there have been 14 hours of congressional testimony on “cancel culture.” If you’re wondering how we got here, maybe Amber can help in a segment called, “How Did We Get Here?”

Show Synopsis: Amber showcases her signature smart-and-silly take on the news of the week, responding to it all with a charming, late-night mix of seriousness, nonsense, and evening gowns.

Gender non-conformity is something often championed by feminists, but trans identity is something else entirely.

Amber Briggle is a small business owner, a community volunteer, a political junkie, and the mother of two incredible children -- Lulu (age 3) and MG (age 8), who have brought many surprises along the way -- including MG's revelation at the age of 2 that he was mislabeled at birth and identified not as a girl, but as a boy. Through trial by fire, Amber has quickly and earnestly become an advocate for transgender rights, helping her son navigate the world of boy/girl while simultaneously challenging society's gender stereotypes. She is also a board member of the League of Women Voters of Texas, a proud member of Rotary International, and she has a rescue dog named Bluebell who still hasn't figured out how to fetch Amber a glass of wine, but they're working on it.

Preet & Amber, IMT Ghaziabad","Goldman Sachs & Mahindra are few of the companies that most B-School students aim to start a career with in the field of finance or management. Wondering how to crack all steps leading to interning at your dream company and bagging a PPO as well! Two IMT students give insight on how to go about your preparation and the do’s-and-don’ts during the job placements in a B-school.

Read more stories about IMT Ghaziabad here - http://bit.ly/2WLAm3s

Preet Inder Kahlon is currently pursuing his PGDM in Marketing, and Amber Mangal is doing PGDM in Finance at IMT, Ghaziabad. Preet did his internship at Mahindra in the GMC Program. Whereas, Amber interned at Goldman Sachs in the internal audit department.
Both of them describe experiences comprehensively in their respective organizations. They deconstruct all the processes involved from the interview process, to executing tasks, and the final internship presentation.

They speak about how IMT Ghaziabad helped them in preparing for the summer internship and ultimately crack the PPO. Whether it is the teamwork that IMT induces in its students through activities taking place over the year or specific focus given to students interested in a particular domain, IMT helps in providing the best industry exposure to its students through the PGDM programme.

Here are a few key takeaways from Preet and Amber’s interview that all aspiring marketing or finance students must keep in mind:

1. Do thorough research about the organization and job profiles before you start interning.
2. Always give your inputs during a meeting.
3. Be productive and learn something new at every stage.
4. Make sure you put forward your strengths and weaknesses during the interview process.
5. Understand the customer and how your profile can help ease their experience.
6. Get an understanding of what your profile entails.
7. Try to be part of co-curricular activities in your B-School for a more holistic experience
8. Try to put in extra hours for academics and during your internship.
9. Pay attention to all topics in your curriculum even if you feel the topic is irrelevant.
10. Start preparing for your final presentation as you start interning.
