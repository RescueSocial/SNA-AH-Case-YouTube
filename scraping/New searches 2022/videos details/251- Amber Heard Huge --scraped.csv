Amber Athey, Washington Editor at the Spectator, joins to discuss whether President Biden is right about it being their fault and whether she thinks his plan to help bring down prices and help smaller farmers will work. COVID-19 has also been a problem with a surge in cases over the holidays. Only 14 reporters are now allowed in the White House press briefing room because of it. Athey shares her thoughts on that. COVID is also getting people banned from social media, including Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, who became the first member of Congress ever to be permanently banned from Twitter. Doctor Robert Malone, who is considered the inventor of mRNA technology was also banned from Twitter and Youtube. The Washington editor at the Spectator helps us understand what is happening. The bans are happening in the name of stopping misinformation. Athey explains who determines that, especially as Facebook recently admitted that its fact checkers were really just opinions.
