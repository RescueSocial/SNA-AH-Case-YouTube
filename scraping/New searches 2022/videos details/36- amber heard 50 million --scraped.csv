With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

Celebs React To Johnny Depp Winning $7 Million Settlement Against Amber!

INTRO: Johnny Depp finally gets a win after the consistent losses against his now ex-wife Amber Heard. But of course, the Pirates off the Caribbean actor didn’t win it alone the lawsuit but with the help of the mounting number of celebrities backing him up. So, what do they have to say?

The very long and tough divorce proceeding has finally reached new heights when the actor Johnny Depp and his legal team seized an opportunity when actress Amber Heard claims that she did truly donate all of the seven million dollars of Depp's settlement money to charity. The opportunity presented gave Depp a breakthrough in their persistent efforts to prove that the money is indeed not going any near to the charity she claimed. But his win only started to see the light of day when a New York court decision was in favor of the actor, effectively validating Johnny Depp's petition request. His appeal would mean mean that the ACLU will now have to submit documentation papers proving that Amber Heard gave the money she claimed to donate, to the charitorganization. Johnny Depp didn’t celebrate this victory alone, fans were ecstatic hearing this news, and his lawyers finally breath a sigh of relief, all considering the court ruling a win for Depp. This was a breakthrough in the expensive divorce procedure in both the United States and England especially after his defeat in the United Kingdom against the lawsuit he filed against The Sun. As most of you may know, Dep suffered from a staggering loss against the tabloid company in a defamation suit in November, when the publishing company labeled him in their 2018 headlines as a “wife-beater”, undoubtedly angering Depp. The headlines caught eyes of thousands of people since it was because Heard accused Depp in Los Angeles in 2016 for abusing the actress. The famous tabloid and the editor of the news won the case in the end, considering that the “victim” Amber Heard was their number one witness forcing the High court of London to give the win to the company. The judge also took into account that most, if not all, of Heard’s sexual harassment claims said in the news published by the company, checked out. After losing the law suit, it was time to go back home to America for the divorcees.


The dispute was continued in Virginia where Depp made the claims in an interview that, “She was the perpetrator, and I was the victim”, he continues saying “While mixing prescription amphetamines and non-prescription drugs with alcohol, Heard hit, punched and kicked me. She also repeatedly and frequently threw objects into my body, head, including heavy bottles, soda cans, burning candles, television remote controls and paint thinner cans, which severely injured me”. And the claims were not so easily shaken off by the public when a recording taken by Depp reveals the actress owning up to her mistake and apologizing, somehow, you be the judge of that. “Okay I’m sorry I hit you, I did mean to hit you but t was in response I just reacted in response to my foot. I just reacted and I’m sorry, it’s below me”. Well, whether Amber meant it or not, it didn’t matter to fans, and celebrities like Sia. The forty-five-year-old musician took her opinions on the matter to Twitter and defended Johnny tweeting “Just showing my public support for Johnny Depp. I mean, I’d just love him to get clean and stop with the jewelry, but he is clearly the victim after hearing those tapes”.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/61MJsLZcp3M/default.jpg,120,90,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/61MJsLZcp3M/mqdefault.jpg,320,180,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/61MJsLZcp3M/hqdefault.jpg,480,360,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/61MJsLZcp3M/sddefault.jpg,640.0,480.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/61MJsLZcp3M/maxresdefault.jpg,1280.0,720.0,Celebrity Zone,"['celebrity zone', 'celebrityzone', 'celebrity', 'amber heard', 'johnny depp', 'amber heard johnny depp', 'johnny depp amber heard', 'johnny depp and amber heard', 'johnny depp amber heard audio', 'justice for johnny depp', 'johnny depp interview', 'amber heard aquaman 2', 'johnny depp fired', 'johnny depp lawsuit', 'johnny depp vs amber heard', 'johnny depp sues amber heard', 'amber heard aquaman', 'amber heard deposition', 'johnny depp loses case', 'johnny depp wins', 'johnny depp vs amber heard case update']",22,none,,Celebrities React To Johnny Depp WINNING $7 Million Settlement Against Amber!,"Celebrities React To Johnny Depp WINNING $7 Million Settlement Against Amber!

His appeal would mean mean that the ACLU will now have to submit documentation papers proving that Amber Heard gave the money she claimed to donate, to the charitorganization. Johnny Depp didn’t celebrate this victory alone, fans were ecstatic hearing this news, and his lawyers finally breath a sigh of relief, all considering the court ruling a win for Depp. This was a breakthrough in the expensive divorce procedure in both the United States and England especially after his defeat in the United Kingdom against the lawsuit he filed against The Sun. As most of you may know, Dep suffered from a staggering loss against the tabloid company in a defamation suit in November, when the publishing company labeled him in their 2018 headlines as a “wife-beater”, undoubtedly angering Depp. The headlines caught eyes of thousands of people since it was because Heard accused Depp in Los Angeles in 2016 for abusing the actress. The famous tabloid and the editor of the news won the case in the end, considering that the “victim” Amber Heard was their number one witness forcing the High court of London to give the win to the company. The judge also took into account that most, if not all, of Heard’s sexual harassment claims said in the news published by the company, checked out. After losing the law suit, it was time to go back home to America for the divorcees.


The dispute was continued in Virginia where Depp made the claims in an interview that, “She was the perpetrator, and I was the victim”, he continues saying “While mixing prescription amphetamines and non-prescription drugs with alcohol, Heard hit, punched and kicked me. She also repeatedly and frequently threw objects into my body, head, including heavy bottles, soda cans, burning candles, television remote controls and paint thinner cans, which severely injured me”. And the claims were not so easily shaken off by the public when a recording taken by Depp reveals the actress owning up to her mistake and apologizing, somehow, you be the judge of that. “Okay I’m sorry I hit you, I did mean to hit you but t was in response I just reacted in response to my foot. I just reacted and I’m sorry, it’s below me”. Well, whether Amber meant it or not, it didn’t matter to fans, and celebrities like Sia. The forty-five-year-old musician took her opinions on the matter to Twitter and defended Johnny tweeting “Just showing my public support for Johnny Depp. I mean, I’d just love him to get clean and stop with the jewelry, but he is clearly the victim after hearing those tapes”.",,PT9M31S,2d,hd,false,True,rectangular,processed,public,youtube,True,True,False,6929,112,0,69

For 5 years now, Johnny Depp and his ex-wife Amber Heard have been jawing back and forth at each other to get an advantage in court on numerous cases that have been filed by them at each other. 

Johnny Depp filed a Defamation Suit against Heard for $50 million and she filed a countersuit worth $100 million. That case is still going on and has been delayed until 2022 due to the pandemic pushing back scheduling. 

But even though that’s going on, there are some things that aren’t adding up in Heard’s defense. Especially, with the new Bodycam footage

Since her acrimonious split from Hollywood star Johnny Depp in 2016, she's been linked to several high profile male suitors.  But on Sunday, Amber Heard engaged in some very public affection with a galpal in Palms Springs.The pair were seen kissing as they left a hotel in the upscale Southern California resort town before engaging in some heavy PDA in Heard's vintage Ford Mustang car.   The Aquaman star, who was in a four-year relationship with photographer Tasya van Ree before falling for Depp on the set of 2011's Rum Diary, laughed and joked with her friend as they waited for the hotel valet to bring round her car. The mystery woman is Bianca Butti, a cinematographer based in Los Angeles. They appeared to be looking at something on a phone before Butti placed a hand tenderly on Heard's hip and moved in for a kiss.Heard, 33, reciprocated, closing her eyes and leaning towards her 38-year-old girlfriend.   Heard looked casually stylish in a baggy plaid shirt and blue skinny jeans ripped at the knees.The blonde, who left her long hair loose, wore a white lace-up ankle boot on her right foot and a medical boot on her left.It's not known how the actress suffered an injury but she has been wearing the boot since the beginning of the year. Butti had on a cropped white sweater under a black knit cardigan and added turquoise pants and dark sneakers.She completed her look with a gray fedora over her long dark hair.  Heard is still dealing with the fall out from her breakup with Depp, whom she married in 2015. Their divorce was finalized in January 2017.She accused the Pirates Of The Caribbean star of domestic violence when they broke up and he filed a $50 million defamation suit against her after she wrote about her experience of being an abused spouse in an op-ed published in The Washington Post. Heard has claimed that Depp threw a cell phone at her which hit her face. She then took out a restraining order against him. Last month, it was reported that the judge in the defamation case had sided with Depp and will allow deposition testimony from two LAPD officers who responded to the couple's home on the night of the incident. Officers testified under oath they did not see any injuries to Heard's face when they saw her on the night of May 21, 2016. The defamation case is headed to trial sometime in 2020.    Following the end of her marriage to Depp, Heard started dating tech entrepreneur and Tesla CEO Elon Musk.They were together for several months before calling it quits in early 2018.Musk is now dating Canadian singer Grimes who announced last week that she is expecting a baby..By March 2019, Schnabel was out and in was Argentinian director Andy Muschietti who helmed the 2013 h",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Dd7yK_xZyYc/default.jpg,120,90,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Dd7yK_xZyYc/mqdefault.jpg,320,180,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Dd7yK_xZyYc/hqdefault.jpg,480,360,,,,,,,News USA,"['dailymail', 'tvshowbiz', 'Johnny Depp', 'California trump today news', 'today in news', 'fox news today', 'fox news', 'breaking news today', 'breaking news', 'usa today', 'usa today news']",22,none,,EXCLUSIVE: Amber Heard passionately kisses new woman during hot and heavy weekend away... as she mov,"Thanks for watching my video.

  Johnny Depp might be one of the world's most famous men, but he's not immune to a bit of heartbreak. The A-lister has enjoyed romances with Jennifer Grey, Sherilyn Fenn (aka Audrey off Twin Peaks), Winona Ryder, Kate Moss, Vanessa Paradis and, most recently, Amber Heard, to whom he was married until 2016. Depp's body is something of a record of his turbulent private life, with various tattoos that speak to experiences and relationships that he has had over his now 30 plus year career.  Now, in his first big interview since the split with Heard, he has revealed that he had a tattoo that referred to her removed from his body.Credit: PA Where once it said 'Slim' across his fingers, it now reads 'Scum'. It isn't the first time he has had one changed - a previous tatt that read ""Winona Forever"", inked in honour of his ex Winona Rider, now reads 'Wino Forever'. Speaking to Rolling Stone, Depp opened up on how he felt during to protracted saga of his divorce from Amber Heard.  ""I was as low as I believe I could have gotten,"" he said. ""The next step was, 'You're going to arrive somewhere with your eyes open and you're going to leave there with your eyes closed'. I couldn't take the pain every day.""I poured myself a vodka in the morning and started writing until the tears filled my eyes and I couldn't see the page anymore."" ""I kept trying to figure out what I'd done to deserve this. I'd tried being kind to everyone, helping everyone, being truthful to everyone. The truth is most important to me. And all this still happened.""Credit: PA Depp was accused of emotionally and physically abusing Heard throughout their relationship, something that he vehemently denies.  On top of that, he is in reportedly deep trouble financially, having had his fortune - which was thought to be more than $600 million - reduced by divorce, legal wrangling and excessive spending.  Depp has been cast in the new Fantastic Beasts movie, a move that has sparked outrage due to the allegations currently against him - allegations which, one suspects, it will take more than a tattoo artist to delete.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

Amber Heard is now trying to get the defamation suit against her dismissed. In this video, we break down what is going on this time.

Not only has he appealed the verdict, but he is also pursuing a 50 million dollar defamation case in Virginia against Amber Heard, his ex-wife. This case has had some recent developments whereby Depp will be required to turn over communications with his ex-lovers who include Keira Knightley, Angelina Jolie and Marion Cottillard.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

The topic that will be discussed today is  Johnny Depp Thanks His Fans For Getting a MASSIVE Win Over Amber Heard. But before we start, subscribe to our channel and don't miss any updates!

Johnny Depp paused for a minute to thank his allies on Friday in the midst of information his $50 million slander preliminary against ex Amber Heard will be pushed back due to Covid concerns.

He shared a video of himself in a work area before an enormous, loaded cabinet as he worked out a thank-you letter. Johnny reiterated the content of his note in the inscription, which read: ""Hi All! I simply needed to thank you all by and by for your consistent, and steadfast help all through many long, and intriguing scenes of my life… I am just here as a result of you — and I'm just here for you!!!"" 

Musician, author, and dissident Patti Smith was among the many fans who answered to the star, remarking, ""As the Libertine said: Ink not drink. Watching you compose fills me with joy. We as a whole love you generally.""

Johnny's appreciative energies could be identified with the news his body of evidence against his ex has been rescheduled from January to May.

Will the Johnny Depp vs. Amber Heard saga EVER conclude?! 

Johnny’s $50 million defamation trial against his ex-wife has just been postponed AGAIN and is now scheduled for April 11, 2022! Wow, that is a while from now.

This means we’ll be hearing and talking about this drama Johnny Depp and Amber Heard for at least another year!

But even though we have to wait to see how this trial plays out and who lied about what, some fans have already made up their mind.

Even those who used to be Team Amber are now uniting behind the #JusticeforJohnny​ hashtag and accusing Amber creating a stream of lies to ruin Johnny Depp’s career.

So while we wait for the case to wrap up, let’s take a look at all the evidence pointing to Amber Heard lying about Johnny being the bad guy.

This is definitely true any time a famous couple breaks up, especially when they go to court. Amber Heard and Johnny Depp know this all too well, as they’ve been making headlines for years as a result of their battle in court. And now Heard’s cast against Depp has involved the LAPD.

Following the end of the libel case across the pond, Amber Heard and Johnny Depp’s ongoing fight in court has remained stateside. Depp is suing his ex-wife for defamation to the cost of a whopping $50 million. And now Heard’s team have subpoenaed the LAPD in hopes of getting any and all records of the 2016 domestic disturbance incident that made so many headlines.

This latest report comes to us from Deadline, after the outlet obtained official court documents regarding Amber Heard and Johnny Depp’s infamous legal battle. This is reportedly not the first time the Aquaman star’s team have called on the LAPD, as a subpoena first arrived back in January. Heard’s representation are calling for the police department to:

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

The court case between the two Hollywood stars, Amber Heard and Johnny Depp has taken many years to conclude and even though most of us thought that this is the year that we shall put this whole saga behind us, it seems that it’s not yet over. The 50 million dollar defamation trial of Johnny against his ex-wife, Amber has been postponed to 11th April 2022 which means that we have one more year of listening to this drama. Now, we all know that the case started in confusion and most of us didn’t know who was telling the truth but as it continues to unfold, many people are slowly realizing who the actual victim is. In fact, most of the people who were team Amber have joined team Johnny. So, as we wait for the court to give its verdict, let us look at all the evidence pointing towards Amber not only lying, but also being the violent one towards Johnny.

Amber asked her former employee to lie under oath
Many people have come forward to accuse Amber Heard of being a pathological liar. Apart from Johnny Depp’s lawyer, David Sherborne, who called Amber Heard an unreliable witness and a compulsive liar, Johnny and Amber’s former employees have also come forward to expose just how far Amber’s dishonesty can go. Kevin Murphy, Johnny Depp’s former estate manager said that Amber Heard asked him to lie under oath after she was charged with bringing her two dogs to Australia illegally in May 2015. Murphy went on to say:

She wanted me to say essentially that it was my fault in one way or another that the paperwork wasn’t completed so that I could take the blame for her.

A lawyer then asked Murphy why he didn’t go to Mr. Depp to ask him to intervene and this is what Murphy had to say:

Because Amber wielded a lot of power and would have made my life miserable.

Amber pocketed her 7 million dollar divorce settlement
In 2016, Amber received a 7 million dollar divorce settlement from Johnny Depp. She then pledged to give the entire sum to charity. She in fact released a statement saying:

As described in the restraining order and divorce settlement, money played no role for me personally and never has, except to the extent that I could donate it to charity and, in doing so, hopefully, help those less able to defend themselves. As reported in the media, the amount received in the divorce was 7 million dollars, and 7 million dollars is being donated.

Amber was supposed to donate half of that money to the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation and the other half to the children’s hospital in Los Angeles. However, Johnny recently made claims that Amber kept the 7 million dollar settlement that she had promised to give to charity. The ACLU refused to comment on whether they received any money from Amber Heard but the L A’s children’s hospital has brought documents that show that the hospital has received one hundred thousand dollars which is a far cry from the promised 3.5 million dollars.

Amber’s legal team was also forced to admit that to this day, Amber hasn’t given the 7 million dollars she pledged to give to charity in 2016 claiming that Amber has already been responsible for seven figures in donations to charitable causes and intends to continue to contribute and eventually fulfill her pledge.

Amber faked her injuries.
In May 2016, Amber was photographed with visible bruising on her face while making a court appearance. She claimed at the time that the bruises were from an attack by Johnny. . She used this story to get a restraining order against Johnny Depp. However, according to the court documents filed by Johnny in 2019, not only had Amber lied about him physically hurting her, but she also went as far as to fake her bruises for her highly publicized court appearance. Johnny’s statement read:

I have denied Ms. Heard’s allegations vehemently since she first made them in May 2016 when she walked into court to obtain a temporary restraining order with painted-on bruises that witnesses and surveillance footage showed she did not possess each day of the preceding week.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

Now she is chilling and taking photos on set of the new Aquaman 2 movie. Set to hit theaters in 2022. This is enraging a lot of Johnny Depp supporters.

Johnny Depp says new police testimony and never-before-seen bodycam footage 'proves' Amber Heard is lying about the blowout fight that ended their toxic 18-month marriage.

Heard and her allies have given evidence in multiple legal cases saying Depp hurled a phone at her face and trashed their penthouse kitchen during the notorious May 2016 dust-up.

But the actor's lawyers claim the lurid depictions of damage - including broken candelabras, glass strewn on the floor and red wine sloshed on the walls and carpets - are completely at odds with what police remember.

Four different LAPD officers visited the stylish, loft-style apartment in downtown Los Angeles within the space of two hours after Heard's pals mistakenly dialed 911 twice.

The first two cops have given new depositions within the past month reiterating that they swept the $1.5 million property but didn't see any injuries, vandalism or evidence of a crime.

DailyMail.com can also reveal for the first time footage from a second set of responding officers who had cameras on as they entered Heard and Depp's former marital home later that night.

Their body-worn devices reveal a tidy hallway leading to an elegant kitchen and living area adorned with ornaments, fresh flowers, piles of books, numerous candles and candelabras.

The officers don't appear to spot anything suspicious, however, and there are no obvious signs of damage, disarray or staining to the floors or carpets in the three and a half minute videos.

Depp's attorney Adam Waldman says the footage proves there was never any wrecking spree and that Heard's account of the evening cannot be trusted.

'Amber Heard and her friends described a chaotic, messy crime scene but the newly released LAPD bodycam videos unambiguously show that the penthouse was utterly undamaged and that their testimony was one more grandiose lie,' Waldman told DailyMail.com in a statement.

The former couple are preparing to square off again in Fairfax County, Virginia, where Depp is suing his 34-year-old ex-wife for $50 million over a Washington Post op-ed in which she described herself as a domestic violence survivor.

The December 2018 article did not mention him by name but Depp, 57, claims he was booted from the lucrative role of Captain Jack Sparrow after the 'hoax' account led to speculation he was the abuser.

The Pirates of the Caribbean actor is fighting an uphill battle to salvage his reputation after Britain's High Court rejected a separate defamation claim last year over a 2018 article in The Sun newspaper that labeled him a 'wife beater'. 

Justice Nicol ruled that the depiction was 'substantially true' and that father-of-two Depp had attacked Heard a dozen times, causing her to fear for her life on three occasions.

The May 21, 2016 incident was included in the catalogue of abuse after Heard gave graphic testimony describing how her former beau hurled a phone in her face and tore out clumps of her hair.

The confrontation was said to have taken place inside penthouse 3 of the swank Eastern Columbia building, where Depp once owned an entire floor of five neighboring apartments, accessed via a private elevator.

After Depp's security team broke up the fight he went into penthouse 5, where Heard kept some of her stuff, to 'ransack' her possessions and cause further damage before finally leaving the building, it was claimed.

The Aquaman star's lawyers provided the court with time-stamped 'crime scene' images, including smashed photo frames, broken glass and wine spilled across hardwood floor and carpets.

Johnny Depp says new police testimony and never-before-seen bodycam footage 'proves' Amber Heard is lying about the blowout fight that ended their toxic 18-month marriage.

Heard and her allies have given evidence in multiple legal cases saying Depp hurled a phone at her face and trashed their penthouse kitchen during the notorious May 2016 dust-up.

But the actor's lawyers claim the lurid depictions of damage - including broken candelabras, glass strewn on the floor and red wine sloshed on the walls and carpets - are completely at odds with what police remember.

Four different LAPD officers visited the stylish, loft-style apartment in downtown Los Angeles within the space of two hours after Heard's pals mistakenly dialed 911 twice.

The first two cops have given new depositions within the past month reiterating that they swept the $1.5 million property but didn't see any injuries, vandalism or evidence of a crime.

DailyMail.com can also reveal for the first time footage from a second set of responding officers who had cameras on as they entered Heard and Depp's former marital home later that night.

Their body-worn devices reveal a tidy hallway leading to an elegant kitchen and living area adorned with ornaments, fresh flowers, piles of books, numerous candles and candelabras.

The officers don't appear to spot anything suspicious, however, and there are no obvious signs of damage, disarray or staining to the floors or carpets in the three and a half minute videos.

Depp's attorney Adam Waldman says the footage proves there was never any wrecking spree and that Heard's account of the evening cannot be trusted.

'Amber Heard and her friends described a chaotic, messy crime scene but the newly released LAPD bodycam videos unambiguously show that the penthouse was utterly undamaged and that their testimony was one more grandiose lie,' Waldman told DailyMail.com in a statement.

The former couple are preparing to square off again in Fairfax County, Virginia, where Depp is suing his 34-year-old ex-wife for $50 million over a Washington Post op-ed in which she described herself as a domestic violence survivor.

The December 2018 article did not mention him by name but Depp, 57, claims he was booted from the lucrative role of Captain Jack Sparrow after the 'hoax' account led to speculation he was the abuser.

The Pirates of the Caribbean actor is fighting an uphill battle to salvage his reputation after Britain's High Court rejected a separate defamation claim last year over a 2018 article in The Sun newspaper that labeled him a 'wife beater'. 

Justice Nicol ruled that the depiction was 'substantially true' and that father-of-two Depp had attacked Heard a dozen times, causing her to fear for her life on three occasions.

The May 21, 2016 incident was included in the catalogue of abuse after Heard gave graphic testimony describing how her former beau hurled a phone in her face and tore out clumps of her hair.

The confrontation was said to have taken place inside penthouse 3 of the swank Eastern Columbia building, where Depp once owned an entire floor of five neighboring apartments, accessed via a private elevator.

After Depp's security team broke up the fight he went into penthouse 5, where Heard kept some of her stuff, to 'ransack' her possessions and cause further damage before finally leaving the building, it was claimed.

The Aquaman star's lawyers provided the court with time-stamped 'crime scene' images, including smashed photo frames, broken glass and wine spilled across hardwood floor and carpets.

Después de que la actriz asegurara en 2018 que había sido víctima de violencia física y verbal durante su matrimonio, parece que ahora es ella la que podría acabar en prisión.

Según el International Business Times, Heard podría enfrentarse a una pena de hasta tres años de prisión por falsificar pruebas contra Depp.

La intérprete afirmó que tenía moratones en los ojos la noche antes de aparecer en The Late Late Show con James Corden en 2015.

Sin embargo, la estilista de Heard, Samantha McMillen, declaró que la actriz no tenía ninguna lesión.

Por su parte, Depp asegura haber escuchado que su exmujer se había ""pintado moretones"" para conseguir una orden de alejamiento.

Ambos comenzaron el proceso de divorcio en agosto de 2016, trámite que finalizó en enero de 2017.

Sin embargo, en diciembre de 2018, Heard escribió un artículo de opinión para el Washington Post en el que habló del maltrato que supuestamente sufrió durante su relación con Depp. Poco después el actor presentó una demanda por difamación de 50 millones millones de dólares contra ella.

Johnny Depp Finally Speaks On Defeating Amber Heard
https://youtu.be/RTZB62_g3cE

Number 5: The Beginning
Depp was 46-year-old with two children, and Heard was 22-year-old when they both met. Depp’s children were for his longtime partner, Vanessa Paradis. Few years down the line, both of them got married, which finally led to a divorce in just 18 months. Before the divorce, Heard already filed a restraining order against Depp. While she was walking in and out of the Los Angele court, photographers waiting in the courtroom took pictures of her with a scar on her face. The restraining order was based on the allegations that Depp abused her physically and verbally due to the influence of alcohol and drugs, and soon enough, these allegations spread far and wide. Depp, on the other hand, denied all allegations. He also claimed that the reverse was the case as Heard abused him instead.
 
Number 4: Effects 
Things have been pretty hard for Johnny Depp and Amber Heard after their divorce. Who is getting the most hit from this problem they are facing? Well, at first, it was Johnny Depp as he lost every court session with Amber Heard. He also lost many other things. Amber Heard had her position in Aquaman 2, while Johnny Depp was fired from his position in Pirates of the Caribbean Series. He was later reinstated by Disney when things started going in his favor. Like I said before, it's been a harder hit on Johnny Depp because apart from being sacked by Disney, he also stepped down from his role in the Fantastic Beast series by Warner Bros. 
 
Number 3: The Donation
To find out if Amber Heard actually donated her divorce settlement to the American Civil Liberties Union and hospital, Johnny Depp was granted a petition by a New York Judge. Given this petition, the ACLU is required to produce proof or document that Amber Heard went through with her pledge. Depp has lost a lot of lawsuits as regards allegations made against him by Amber Heard. Depp tried an appeal again in March that was turned down. The appeal by his lawyer was said to be on the basis that Heard’s pledge to donate the divorce settlement was just one of her ways to manipulate the ruling in her favor. There were also allegations stating that Amber Heard claiming to donate the money to charity was a complete lie and this information was passed on in 2019 to Johnny’s business adviser. 
 
Number 2: Allegations and court cases
In July, the high court came to a decision when Johnny Depp and Amber Heard were caught in a heated court case, making allegations against each other, making claims about fighting, drug abuse, drinking, and scattering the room. After all, was said and done, the Judge finally made a ruling that Heard’s claim of abuse by Depp was mostly true in favor of the publisher of the tabloid whom Depp filed a lawsuit against. The Virginia case followed shortly after when Amber Heard claimed that she was a victim of domestic abuse, accusing Johnny Depp as the person responsible. A while after, Johnny Depp filed a lawsuit, claiming that Amber Heard was lying against him and tarnishing his reputation. This lawsuit was worth about 50 million dollars.
In 2019, May to be exact, Johnny Depp decided to go on the offensive and claimed that Amber Heard had been molesting him. Not only that, but she also kicked and punched him. 

Number 1: What happens next?
So why exactly do the amount of the donation matter? It matters because one of the major reasons the judge believed Heard over Depp was because of the donations. While Depp claimed that the only reason Heard married him was because of his money, the judge overruled that because Heard already donated all of her divorce money, a whopping sum of 7 million dollars to charity, to ALCU like she said she would. Therefore, now that the court has petitioned that evidence should be brought that Amber donated the money, this might be a big plus for Johnny Depp if it is discovered that Amber Heard never released the money like she said she would. This would discredit her in the favor of Johnny Depp.

Number 5: The Beginning
Depp was 46-year-old with two children, and Heard was 22-year-old when they both met. Depp’s children were for his longtime partner, Vanessa Paradis. Few years down the line, both of them got married, which finally led to a divorce in just 18 months. Before the divorce, Heard already filed a restraining order against Depp. While she was walking in and out of the Los Angele court, photographers waiting in the courtroom took pictures of her with a scar on her face. The restraining order was based on the allegations that Depp abused her physically and verbally due to the influence of alcohol and drugs, and soon enough, these allegations spread far and wide. Depp, on the other hand, denied all allegations. He also claimed that the reverse was the case as Heard abused him instead.

  Winona Ryder vowed her ‘support’ for ex-fiancé Johnny Depp amid his ongoing $50 million defamation case against Amber Heard, a new report citing court documents claims!   Winona Ryder, 48, has reportedly come forward to vouch for her ex-fiancé Johnny Depp, 56, in his $50 million defamation case against his ex-wife Amber Heard, 33! Given Winona’s household name as the star of Stranger Things and Johnny and Amber’s back-and-forth domestic violence allegations, this would be a big move for Winona. The Oscar-nominated actress allegedly filed a declaration in Virginia and went on record to provide her side of the story, and she made it clear that she’s “in support” of Johnny, according to court documents that The Blast reviewed on March 12. HollywoodLife has not reviewed these documents, and therefore can only relay The Blast’s report — we’ve reached out to Winona’s rep for comment.   The ’90s darling began the declaration by reflecting on her relationship with Johnny; they began dating in 1989, and were engaged between 1990-1993. They even starred in Tim Burton’s 1990 classic, Edward Scissorhands, together. “I am aware of the violence allegations that have been made publicly for the last few years by Johnny Depp’s ex-wife Amber Heard,” Amber wrote in the declaration. “I knew Johnny very well years ago. We were together as a couple for four years, and I counted him as my best friend, and as close to me as family. I count our relationship as one of the more significant relationships of my life. I understand that it is very important that I speak from my own experience.”   Winona then confessed her stunned reaction to Amber’s allegations, according to the court documents. “I obviously was not there during his marriage to Amber, but, from my experience, which was so wildly different, I was absolutely shocked, confused and upset when I heard the accusations against him,” the Beetlejuice star continued. “The idea that he is an incredibly violent person is the farthest thing from the Johnny I knew and loved. I cannot wrap my head around these accusations.”   Finally, Winona insisted that she has never witnessed an ounce of “violence” in Johnny. “He was never, never violent towards me,” she continued. “He was never, never abusive at all towards me. He has never been violent or abusive towards anybody I have seen. I truly and honestly only know him as a really good man- an incredibly loving, extremely caring guy who was so very protective of me and the people that he loves, and I felt so very, very safe with him. I do not want to call anyone a liar but from my experience of Johnny, it is impossible to believe that such horrific allegations are true. I find it extremely upsetting knowing him as I do.”   This isn’t the first time Winona has publicly defended Johnny. In a 2016 interview with Time, she told the magazine, “He was never, never tha",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uVJfyMyjPyA/default.jpg,120,90,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uVJfyMyjPyA/mqdefault.jpg,320,180,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uVJfyMyjPyA/hqdefault.jpg,480,360,,,,,,,Daily Star,"['Amber Heard', 'Johnny Depp', 'Winona Ryder']",22,none,,Winona Ryder Defends Ex Johnny Depp: Amber Heard’s Accusations Are ‘Impossible To Believe’,"Thanks for watching my video.

Actor Johnny Depp and his ex-wife, actress Amber Heard arrived at the High Court in London on Thursday (9 July 2020) for the third day of a three-week trial over his libel case against a British newspaper.
Depp is suing News Group Newspapers, publisher of The Sun, and the paper’s executive editor, Dan Wootton, over an April 2018 article that said he’d physically abused ex-wife Amber Heard. 
The newspaper's lawyers plan to use Heard's allegations of abuse by Depp to defend the “wife beater” claim.
The trial opened on Tuesday. 
It is one of the first major cases to be held in person since Britain began to lift its coronavirus lockdown.
Depp, 57, and Heard, 34, met on the set of the 2011 comedy “The Rum Diary” and married in Los Angeles in February 2015. They divorced in 2017 and now bitterly accuse one another of abuse.
While Heard isn't on trial, the case is also a showdown between the former spouses, who accuse each other of being controlling, violent and deceitful.
It is set to put the two performers’ complex private lives under a microscope.
Depp is also suing Heard in the United States for 50 million US dollars for allegedly defaming him in a Washington Post article about domestic abuse. 
That case is due to be heard next year.
