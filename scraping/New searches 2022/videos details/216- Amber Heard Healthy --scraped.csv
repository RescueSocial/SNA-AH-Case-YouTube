#ketosis #carnivorediet #biohackerslab

In today's interview, we get a chance to talk about nutritional ketosis from an evolutionary perspective, and we break down all the essential micronutrients needed for a healthy brain. Amber also explains how the bioavailability of these micronutrients is a crucial factor to consider.

If you know someone who is interested in learning more about ketosis and the key role that micronutrients play in the development of a healthy brain in children, as well as in the long-term maintenance of brain health in adults, this interview is for them.

I enjoyed this interview with Amber as, once again, she shared some of her valuable knowledge. She really got me thinking about the way our brains have evolved and why they thrive on ketones as well as why we need to rethink RDA's given the vastly different types of diets people consume.

Today I had the privilege of recording podcast episode number 24 with my guest Amber O’Hearn better known as the ketocarnivore.  She will join me today to talk a little about how the carnivore diet has helped her deal with mental illness 

Amber studied Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Toronto. She has published papers in theoretical math, computer science and computational linguistics, cognitive psychology, evolution and ketogenic diets.  After experiencing significant dietary related health issues, Amber got relief through an “all meat” or “carnivore” diet. With many years of experience with this way of eating, she is one of the key figures leading the carnivore movement. 

During the podcast which will be released December 11th, we talked about the many reasons why the carnivore diet is not to be feared and for many of you may be exactly what you need to heal from many health conditions including that ones that impact our minds.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LJuus7YBY58/default.jpg,120,90,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LJuus7YBY58/mqdefault.jpg,320,180,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LJuus7YBY58/hqdefault.jpg,480,360,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LJuus7YBY58/sddefault.jpg,640.0,480.0,Dr Tony Hampton,27,none,Amber O'Hearn: POST Podcast Episode 24: Carnivore and Mental Health,"Podcast Episode 24 with Amber O'Hearn:

Inuit peoples are among the many cultures with a traditional diet of predominantly animal sourced foods and negligible carbohydrate. One might expect, then, that they would have been in ketosis most of the time. Some historical evidence suggests otherwise, leading to intense debate. Because the Inuit have been treated as an archetype and historical precedent for nutritional ketosis, stakes in this outcome appear high. If even the Inuit were not in ketosis, it seems that adopting a long-term, ketogenic lifestyle may be misguided, perhaps even dangerous. In this talk, I will present existing literature reporting ketosis measurements in Inuit populations, and explain why they are difficult to interpret. I will delve into research on the CPT1A Arctic variant, its effects on fat metabolism, and its potential selective advantages.

Awesome Health podcast - Episode 094

Is there a link between emotional eating and healing yourself? Our guest says yes and has invested years of her life and thousands of dollars uncovering it. 

Amber Romaniuk is an emotional eating, digestive and hormone expert who helps professional women achieve optimal health through mindful eating and self-care. Her podcast “The No Sugarcoating Podcast” has over half a million downloads, over 200 episodes and is listened to in over 82 countries.

Amber overcame her own emotional eating after gaining and losing more than 1000 lbs and spending over $50,000 on binge foods and 5 years balancing her hormones and digestion. She cycled her way through countless fad diets, skipped meals, caloric restrictions and endless workouts in an endless attempt to achieve her ideal weight. Even when she reached the body size she wanted, she couldn't sustain it. And in the process she hurt her body, blowing out her adrenal glands and messing up her hormones.

Now that she overcome those challenges, Amber helps other women avoid the same pitfalls and mistakes she made like self-sabotage through emotional eating.

On this episode of Awesome Health Podcast, Amber first explains what emotional eating is. She says it is eating for any reason other than physical/nutritional nourishment. This can look like everything from eating a few bites of chocolate because you had a bad day to a full-on eating binge as a way to numb yourself from everyday life. 

Amber goes on to share her personal story of this as well as how a difficult breakup led her to understand she needed better ways of coping with stress and had to learn how to fulfill her own emotional needs rather than look for love outside of herself.

She tells us the breaking point for her and why her cravings were so severe she removed all gluten and sugar from her life (something she doesn't necessarily recommend for everyone). And  once she stopped using food to deal with stress, she took up journaling, meditation, yoga and breath work to take care of herself. She also read more self-help books, especially those on the subject of the connection between our bodies and our mindset.

We dive deep into those topics, plus some of the more common challenges she sees that hold women back. You'll also hear Amber's suggested first steps you can take if you think you're an emotional eater. Be sure to listen in and hear her answers on episode 94 of Awesome Health Podcast.

In subsequent years, Amber struggled with weight fluctuations & mental health disorders. After first experimenting with a low-carb diet, then a ketogenic diet, Amber finally discovered she only required one food that alleviated her from psychiatric medications and weight issues…

Meat.

For the past decade, Amber has been following the carnivore diet and meticulously researching nearly everything about ketogenic nutrition. An “OG” carnivore and data scientist by profession, Amber joins the H.V.M.N. Podcast to share her story.

In this episode, Geoff & Amber discuss:

· Theories for her neurological issues and the possible explanations for why avoiding plants and eating meat was best for her brain and overall health.

· The issues with modern veggies & fruit…could they be playing a role in the development of autoimmune disorders?

· Nuances of protein consumption, ketosis, mTor activation, and AMPK stimulation

Supporting the Mitochondria with NAD and Peptides w/ Dr. Amber Krogsrud,"Supplementing naturally occurring peptides and nutrients helps support your body’s mitochondria. I’m joined by naturopathic doctor, Amber Krogsrud, to talk about how she uses peptides to improve both her and her patient’s overall health.

What You Need to Know About the Mitochondria

Dr. Amber joins me today to talk about peptides, but before we can talk about them, we need to go back to basics. First, we’re talking about mitochondria: what it is and what role it plays in our bodies.

She explains how we can support our mitochondria from a cellular level, by supplementing our diets, physical level with diet and exercise, and an external level with outside assistance. Amber shares some tips for how you can improve your diet for optimal health. She says that fasting, or intermittent fasting, is one of the most beneficial ways you can eat.

Amber uses a red light to improve her mitochondria function. The additional benefits of the red light she uses are hair growth and collagen repair.

The final bit of the mitochondria puzzle is the supplements you can take to support it. Amber loves NAD (Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide), a coenzyme that your body naturally produces. She explains the different ways you can supplement NAD in your wellness routine.

How to Use Peptides to Support Your Health

Peptides are naturally occurring biological molecules that are found in all living organisms and have a key function in all biological activity. They’re chains of amino acids that form the basis of almost everything our body does, including producing collagen in the skin.

Amber explains the different types of peptides our bodies use to keep them running in good condition. Some peptides are more commonly found in animal products, so vegans and vegetarians may need to supplement these.

An interesting study about CoQ10, a peptide that helps your cells generate energy, found that women with breast cancer have lower levels of this peptide. Amber explains what these findings show and how these results have shown up in her own medical practice.

Overall, peptides are a fantastic addition to your health. They can promote weight loss, improve collagen production, and benefit your skin and hair health. As Amber says, there really is a peptide for everything!

The average person will want to use peptides to help encourage their body to produce more themselves. You can expect a monthly investment between $300-400, depending on the peptide combination you use.

Amber O'Hearn","The conflation of ketogenic diets with starvation has led to confusion and alarm about their effects on hormones. Humans and many other animals are naturally in ketosis under sufficient caloric restriction, but in most animals, ketosis is difficult or impossible without it. In contrast, ketosis is easily achieved in humans as long as dietary carbohydrate is limited. This means humans can be in ketosis without suffering undernutrition. There are significant benefits associated with caloric restriction, many through mechanisms in common with ketosis. Likewise, there are similar hormonal effects seen in caloric restriction and ketogenic diets. Because ketosis and starvation have been conflated, hormone levels in ad libitum ketogenic dieters that resemble those in caloric restriction are sometimes taken as signs of stress. In this presentation, I will show why the changes in thyroid and cortisol that accompany ketogenic diets should be considered beneficial, not dangerous.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_CwnPTokcT0/default.jpg,120,90,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_CwnPTokcT0/mqdefault.jpg,320,180,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_CwnPTokcT0/hqdefault.jpg,480,360,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_CwnPTokcT0/sddefault.jpg,640.0,480.0,AncestryFoundation,28,none,"AHS17 Ketogenic Diets, Caloric Restriction, and Hormones - L.
