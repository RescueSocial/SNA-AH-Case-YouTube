Prairie Tide - Live @ John Barleycorn's
-
When Johnny Depp and Jimmy Kimmel disparaged the Emerald City, the 
Peerless Princess of the Plains, known on maps as Wichita, little did they 
realize we don't take slights lightly. This is the old stomping grounds of 
Carrie Nation and history well records how she made her feelings be known.
Jimmy Kimmel's comedy skit about Wichitawesome as an alternative ""Spring 
Break"" destination was just too superficial. It missed all the good stuff. 
This is to set that shortcomming right.

Always another beautiful night in Wichitawesome, those of us on ""Spring 
Break Forever"" found something other than Wet Parka Contests to amuse and 
delight. Life is a resort and we are all just here on vacation. Enjoy it.

It's worth noting that Charles Plymell, one of America's greatest poets, 
was involved with a loose gang of experimental writers and ""outsider"" 
artists centered around Wichita, Kansas in post-war 1950s America. Plymell 
once revealed, ""That was the advantage of nightlife in Wichita, Kansas. In 
Hollywood or New York, time would be in demand. Here it was spent for the 
good of it, not for the duty of it.""

For not just years, rather generations, Wichita has been famous in the 
underground as one of the hottest places with some of the coolest people. 
Nothing has changed. 
But never think that this level of same-o same-o ever gets boring. 
Not hardly.

This is an experimental film made with our new mod: a ""magic wand camera"" 
- like an ice cream bar on a longer stick (but that's indicative of our 
""magical"" mindset in Wichitawesome). It can be waved to achieve a level of 
intimacy not often ""scene"" .
This is not really a music video, per se.
It is more a portrait of a performance, a work of art (after we tweak it some to compensate for challenges during actual filming), a lens-painting of a band in an attempt to do what they do a little justice and capture a semblence of the enchantment.
(APPLAUSE for the band!)
Also, this is unrehearsed footage to preserve the authenticity of the 
encounter - we just show up and catch what we can, often never having heard the band before. 
A ""Spring Break"" blind date and we just got ""lucky"" as Jimmy Kimmel would say.
Then, it's the real deal.
Then, it's Wichitawesome!

Heard allegedly soiled the bed as a malicious prank after the Hollywood star arrived two-hours late for her 30th birthday party in April 2016, according to The Mirror.

Sources claim the warring couple’s housekeeper discovered excrement on the sheets after Depp, 55, stormed out of their Los Angeles penthouse following a heated row.

It’s understood that ‘strong photographic evidence’ links Heard to the reported incident, while the actress has since claimed the fecal matter was left by their dog, Boo.

A source told The Mirror: 'Boo has some serious bowel control issues. There was never a joke, it wasn’t something done to be disrespectful.

'It was an innocent thing, it’s what pets will do. We don’t have anything else to say. Ms. Heard is moving on and we do not want to engage in this nonsense.'

The dogs, Pistol and Boo, were last in the news when Heard flew them into Australia on a private jet without putting them through quarantine in 2015.

Depp's ex-wife avoided jail time when she pleaded guilty to falsifying border protection documents when when she imported the teacup Yorkshire terriers into Australia. Heard was handed a one-month good behavior bond and fined $1,000.

The couple also produced an apology video that was played in court, and later went viral. 'When you disrespect Australian law,' Depp deadpans in the video, 'they will tell you firmly'.

The incident sparked global headlines when Agriculture Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce said the dogs had better 'bugger off' back to the US or he'd arrange to have them put down.

It was alleged the pooches were not declared to customs officials on arrival.

The presence of the A-list canines was only discovered when their visit to a Gold Coast dog grooming salon was made public. The dogs were quickly whisked out of the country before a 72-hour deadline lapsed when the canines would have to be seized.

Under strict Australian laws designed to keep disease at bay, dogs entering from the United States must be declared and have to spend 10 days in quarantine. Penalties for contravening the Quarantine Act range from fines to a maximum of 10 years in prison for the worst cases.

Depp was never charged over the incident.

Pistol was said to be a gift to Heard from her former girlfriend, artist Tasya van Ree, while Boo originally belonged to Depp.

He is believed to have wanted to keep custody of the pair, saying the dogs should not be split up but it was Heard who was given custody of their beloved terriers.

Heard and Depp were married in 2015 but their relationship quickly unraveled.

A month after the bed defection incident, Heard that Depp  grabbed her cellphone during an argument, 'wound up his arm like a baseball pitcher and threw the cell phone at me striking my cheek and eye with great force,' according to court filings.

But police officers found 'no evidence of any crime’, despite Heard appearing bruised in a picture she claims was taken after the alleged attack.

Heard later claimed in court papers : 'Johnny has a long-held and widely acknowledged public and private history of drug and alcohol abuse. He has a short fuse.'

In legal papers submitted during the couple's divorce in 2017, Heard claimed he made “paranoid and irrational accusations about some delusional idea”.

'He began obsessing about something untrue and his demeanour changed dramatically. He became angry,' she wrote.

The actor is attempting to clear his name with a High Court case in London against a British newspaper that reported Heard's allegations earlier this year.

In court papers seen by the Mail On Sunday, Depp's legal team denies absolutely that the star assaulted his former wife.

'The phone did not hit Ms Heard on the face or elsewhere,' say his lawyers. 'Nor did [Depp] pull Ms Heard's hair or strike her, or grab her face or touch her.'

The High Court papers cite depositions from two Los Angeles police officers, who appear to contradict Ms Heard's version of events.

They say they arrived at the couple's home 25 minutes after the alleged attack, yet saw no damage to the property, adding that a crying Heard told them she wasn't hurt and did not need medical attention. Nor did they see injuries or swellings on her face.

His lawyers claim he brought two of his security team along with him because he 'was concerned' about what Ms Heard would do.

They too appear to contradict her version of events, claiming that Depp was not in fact physically close to his wife during the incident.

  Johnny Depp and Amber Heard's divorce has been messy to say the least.  She's accused him of being abusive towards her and slapped him with a restraining order before being awarded $7million from Depp as part of their settlement. He has reportedly thrown out a variety of accusations about Heard - including, now, that she 'deliberately left poo in their marital bed'. No, really. The Mirror reports that Depp alleges that the poo in the bed was a result of an argument that they had after he arrived two hours late for her 30th birthday party in April 2016.

If you’ve ever wondered, “Am I creative?” or “When is it good enough?” listen to this episode. My friend and rockstar salon owner, Amber Pope (@method_twenty_seven), and I dive deep into what it means to be creative, how perfectionism gets in the way of creative expression, and how to lead with creative awareness. 

We also talk about what creativity is, what happens when we absorb too much outside influence, and the breath-restoring difference between perfectionism and excellence.

ABOUT AMBER:
Amber Pope is a Stylist, owner of Salon27, educator, creative director, and content writer, with over 15 years in the hair industry. She’s also the only person I’ve trusted to cut my hair for the past decade.

If you’ve ever wondered, “Am I creative?” or “When is it good enough?” listen to this episode. My friend and rockstar salon owner, Amber Pope (@method_twenty_seven), and I dive deep into what it means to be creative, how perfectionism gets in the way of creative expression, and how to lead with creative awareness. 

We also talk about what creativity is, what happens when we absorb too much outside influence, and the breath-restoring difference between perfectionism and excellence.

ABOUT AMBER:
Amber Pope is a Stylist, owner of Salon27, educator, creative director, and content writer, with over 15 years in the hair industry. She’s also the only person I’ve trusted to cut my hair for the past decade.

Show notes and the transcript can be viewed here: https://alyssapatmos.com/redefining-tapping-into-creativity-amber-pope

With the shift in cultural focus by many people, it appears that access to consumption and sedentary lifestyle has created what many view as an epidemic, particularly in countries like the US, where obesity has ballooned, there are many reasons why this might be considered. However, with the existence of fat people, comes the existence of fat YouTubers.

Larger YouTubers are nothing particularly new, you’re dealing with a platform that is based online, many people on the platform are not the most active, and they might even find appeal within their great weight. 

However, from this transpired a new genre, this mainly revolved around weight loss, the reason should be fairly obvious: we as viewers, typically look for some element of ourselves in the creator, whether that’s something that we currently have, or something that we aspire to be, now when you have a weight loss YouTuber, this is someone that we should follow their journey with. We find inspiration in their progress, maybe you are an overweight person, but at the same time, you’re an introvert, or an agoraphobe, and don’t want to show your body at a Weight Watchers meeting, maybe they can give some advice on how to lose weight from the realms of the screen, although it may not be sufficient to make you lose weight on its own, they may provide inspiration, may provide you with that extra motivation, and then maybe you can document your journey online too, and inspire other people to come along with you.

The problem is that this vision doesn’t always happen, and sometimes people themselves aren’t strong enough to create that arc through their own volition, and thus the story changes very significantly, and because they’re documenting all on YouTube, suddenly this augments into something much uglier, this is where we reach today’s creator, the creator known as Amberlynn Reid. 

It was a late evening, I had worked on a video only to make the decision that actually, although I wasn’t a fan of the creator’s content, there wasn’t enough to make a video, so I decided to watching a few videos, I knew one of my fellow creators known as Danarchy had released a couple of uploads on these YouTubers who were rather notorious for the handling of their weight on the platform and so, in my crisis I decided to sit down and watch them, and although he was a tad too insulting for my rather polite demeanour, he touched on some important points, that I definitely feel could be expanded on in a Right Opinion video, his content definitely does a great job at individually calling out the YouTubers in question, but what is there beneath the surface? Well let’s talk about the YouTuber in question.

This is Amberlynn Reid, she is a 28 year old YouTuber from the United States of America, she recently become a target for a lot of YouTubers, for a multitude of reasons, typically the cycle consists of her doing something, people reacting, people noting her rather counterproductive efforts to lose weight, people noting various other negative traits, such as her apparent compulsion to lie, and deceive her audience, and alleged manipulation of certain situations. Hell, there is a whole channel dedicated to exposing Amberlynn for her weight, that is some spicy commitment considering that many of these videos receive more views than Amber’s videos themselves. 

Amberlynn appears to be a dubious character for more reasons than just her weight, and although I do consider many of them valid criticism, and would definitely implore people to look into that, that will typically be a secondary narrative of this video, because although I will definitely touch on that, there’s a lot of detail to these stories that I think you can only really see from the testimonies, and I don’t plan on addressing all of those. Though if you are interested, I’ll definitely reference and link some of the more controversial incidents sooner or later in the video, because there is a lot to cover.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/J9W8jLKTu-s/default.jpg,120,90,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/J9W8jLKTu-s/mqdefault.jpg,320,180,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/J9W8jLKTu-s/hqdefault.jpg,480,360,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/J9W8jLKTu-s/sddefault.jpg,640.0,480.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/J9W8jLKTu-s/maxresdefault.jpg,1280.0,720.0,The Right Opinion,25,none,Why This YouTuber Can't Stop Eating - Amberlynn Reid | TRO,"The Right Opinion: Why This YouTuber Can't Stop Eating - Amberlynn Reid | TRO

This amber is dated to around 100 million years old, representing the Albian - Cenomanian ages of the Cretaceous period, so would have been deposited whilst non-avian dinosaurs still walked the land.

 Fossils preserved in this amber include representatives from numerous different groups including arachnids, insects, vertebrates, and plants. Whilst the amber itself (as fossilised tree sap/resin) is produced in a terrestrial environment, some marine species have been caught up in amber. This includes such animals as ostracods, snails and surprisingly even an ammonite!

 In the first part of this series, we speak to Dr Javier Luque, Harvard University, about the discovery of a crab in amber. We put this discovery in context by first examining what crabs are, before turning our attention to their fossil record. In the next episode, we'll take a look at the details of the discovery.

 Following on from this, we will discuss the political situation in Myanmar and question whether or not working with Burmese amber is currently ethical.

Reserve your spot in the live studio audience for The Amber Ruffin Show at https://1iota.com/show/1210/the-amber-ruffin-show

Last week at a Trump rally, Republican Senator David Perdue mispronounced Kamala Harris’ name, and worse, he did it on purpose. That really made Amber Ruffin mad! Senator Perdue has worked with Kamala Harris in the senate for three years. He knows her name. And he definitely knows how to pronounce it. Amber is sick of white people acting like “Kamala” is just a name you can’t say. Guess what, if you refuse to learn someone’s name because it belongs to a person of color, you are a racist! 

Plus: coronavirus vaccine trials, Trump on 60 Minutes, and gossip about Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett.

Each week THE AMBER RUFFIN SHOW will showcase Amber’s signature smart and silly take on the week's news. No matter what's happening in the world, Amber will respond to it with a charming mix of seriousness, nonsense, and evening gowns. THE AMBER RUFFIN SHOW is a topical late-night show with just the good parts – the comedy. Amber Ruffin, Jenny Hagel, Seth Meyers, and Mike Shoemaker serve as executive producers.

Over the past couple years, more Americans have become familiar with the story of the Tulsa Race Massacre, where a white mob burned a vibrant Black community to the ground. Which is crazy. Even crazier? Dozens of other Black towns have been erased off the American map, not by burning them down, but by hiding them under water. Do you know what we mean? Let’s find out in a segment called, “How Did We Get Here?”

From whatever realm you hail, here ALL are welcome

For you have stumbled into the Tavern of Tales, friend, our very own inter-dimensional watering hole. Either by fate, or by choice, you are in for a spectacular evening.

I’m sure you’ve heard of Baxter, the esteemed patron of this establishment. He’s a spell caster of some renown after all. Just don’t stare too long when you see him.

Tonight we have a very special treat for all those gathered here. A tale from a place spoken only in hushed tones. Barovia. Or is it?
 
For in the Barovia we’re going Strahd is not king and five powerful vampire houses preside over the land. This place removed from time can only be entered via death, as our heroes discovered first hand.

So sit back, and grab a drink as tonight we join friends old and new, as alliances shift and friendships form, and perhaps if we're lucky find those thought lost along the way.

The Tavern of Tales presents Houses of Barovia, with political intrigue, dangerous monsters, seductive vampires, and honestly some inane nonsense along the way.

I'll turn this one over to The Teller of Tales. Well met, friend. Enjoy.""

Johnny Depp has accused former wife Amber Heard of deliberately soiling their marital bed in revenge for turning up two hours late to her 30th birthday bash.
The troubled actor claims the incident sparked the violent argument that led to the breakdown of their marriage.
Depp had stormed out of the couple’s Los Angeles penthouse after discovering the pile of poo between the sheets after Heard’s party in April 2016, a friend of the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" star told The Mirror.
Heard blamed the deposit on her dog Boo, who has bowel problems, but a housekeeper who had to clean up the mess the following day suggested the droppings were too large to have come from the little pooch.
Depp, 55, believes there is “strong, photographic evidence that connected Amber to the feces” and it was left as a “prank,"" the friend said.
But a representative for the actress denied any malicious intent, insisting it was an unfortunate accident.
“Boo has some serious bowel control issues. There was never a joke, it wasn’t something done to be disrespectful,” the rep told the Mirror.
“It was an innocent thing, it’s what pets will do. We don’t have anything else to say. Ms. Heard is moving on and we do not want to engage in this nonsense.”

How to prioritize your marriage + your business
When Amber works with a couple who are in business together, she starts by helping them nail down boundaries between work and home. She emphasizes that you have to make sure there’s space for both in your relationship. Then you create routines where you can separate the two. You also need to make time to intentionally connect as a couple. 
You have to create a dedicated time to talk about your relationship. If you’re in conflict all the time you know it needs to be addressed. The flipside is also true—if there’s no open communication, you need to connect. If you’re having a good day, you don’t want to ruin it by bringing up something you’ve been struggling with. And when you’re already enmeshed in conflict, that isn’t a good time either. That’s why creating a ritual where you come together and talk about your relationship is key.
What’s going well? Where are you struggling? If everything is going great, you’ve simply carved out time to have a conversation. But if you’re not talking at all, that dedicated time once a week or monthly is imperative. 
Mitigating burnout as a business owner
As a business owner, you have a lot of demands on your time and energy. The hustle culture makes it hard to set boundaries (but you need to). What are the signs of burnout?
You start to notice that you’re easily irritated and quick to anger.
You aren’t enjoying things that you normally do.
You feel exhausted no matter how much sleep you get (and other physical symptoms).
You struggle with compassion fatigue, especially for those in the helping professions.
You may dread going to work or don’t look forward to seeing your clients.
You procrastinate on the simplest of tasks. 
The first time Amber experienced burnout, she didn’t recognize it because she loves seeing her clients. But everything else in her business overwhelmed her. Simple administrative tasks stole her energy. She thought she was just struggling with her ADHD. But when you put off important things in your business—like billing clients—it becomes a problem. 
Strategies to avoid reaching the point of burnout
Amber’s favorite strategy is to hire and delegate (sound familiar?). Some things need to be done in your business and you may not be the best person to do them. That fact can be hard to swallow but it’s true. Amber also believes that you need to assess what’s important and see what you can delete off of your list immediately. If you struggle to let go, you can put a pin in it and return to it another time. 
Setting boundaries around how much you—and team members—work is key. You can experiment to see what works. Business owners are chronically over-scheduled and need to create more space in your day than you think you need. You must be diligent about not adding more to your plate. 
What else does Ambera recommend to avoid burnout? How can entrepreneurial couples strengthen their marriages? Listen to the whole episode to learn more!

We got the whole transcript over here in regards to the Johnny Depp lawsuit. We are going to go the most relevant and important parts where she talks about the Johnny Depp and the evidence against her. We will start to see how Amber Heard is going lose this court case. This clearly shows that Amber Heard is lying. You will hear what the judge had to say to Amber Heard. It is the newest piece of celebrity news

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

Talk description:

Amber has found that the skills and experiences she picked up studying and working within Psychology have guided her as a developer - sometimes in surprising ways, always in useful ways, and in some ways, she has yet to discover. She is excited to bring along her unique perspective on web development through the eyes of a discipline she knows so well. She'll talk to us about how folk that work on the web can be aware of other disciplines that surround us, embrace their lessons, and harness these to build both a stronger web and stronger bonds with each other.

About Amber:

Amber is a budding designer continually getting excited about everything to do with the Web. With her background pursuing a Master's degree in Child Psychology, she'll bring a unique perspective on both where we've come from and where we'll go.
