From GameHouse, makers of Delicious, Fabulous and Heart’s Medicine, comes a brand new time management adventure that will make your heart soar!

In Amber’s Airline - High Hopes, you’ll get a taste of the glamorous life of a flight attendant.

Meet Amber Hope, aspiring stewardess for Snuggford Airlines. Amber has dreamed of flying to exotic destinations around the world since she was a girl. But before she can join the elite crew of air hostesses, she’ll need to pass her exams. That’s not going to be easy, and she’ll need your help.

✈️Be transported by a truly wonderful story of love and loss
✈️Fly through 60 travel-themed levels, and 30 extra challenging levels
✈️Explore the world and get a behind-the scenes look at airport life with 6 unique locations
✈️Master 18 mini games that cover every aspect of flying – from check-in to security checks, suitcases to passports, safety demonstrations to serving passengers
✈️Fasten your seatbelt for amazing, all-new cinematics
✈️Experience what it’s like to be a real flight attendant - the ups and the downs
✈️”Unfasten” Amber’s diary and discover her secret thoughts as you earn game goals

Amber’s life seems wonderful. She shares her apartment with her pet fish, Sushi. She loves her job and dreams of the day she’ll be on an airplane, a full-fledged cabin attendant assisting travellers. The possibilities are endless - “the sky is the limit” as they say. But appearances can be deceiving…

Everything is overshadowed by what happened in her childhood and she can’t escape her past. Her lingering guilt and fear are holding her back from achieving the very thing she is trying to achieve.

When her plane crashes, Amber is forced to face her fears. As you’ve heard time and again during safety demonstrations, Amber will have to help herself before she can help others. Is she up to the task?

Share the highs and lows of Amber’s life. Be there for her and help her ascend to the highest heights!

Mattel if you see this, please we need a Lex figure and a Genaro figure with toilet or hut.  Even a Dodgson figure would be great since so many fans love that short scene with Nedry.

Song: Appearance Fall - NAGI☆
Item level: 729

As promised, Heroic Amber-Shaper Un'sok.

This boss is the exact same as Normal mode but the execution is going to have to be more precise.

Start by gathering Coagulated Amber (lots) because we're going to need to build up Soul Capacitor. The more Amber you pull the easier it is going to be to one shot the boss however, when an Amber dies it explodes dealing AoE damage (roughly 7-8k) so be mindful. Use the time gathering to cap at 5 combo points for Slice and Dice on pull.

Once you've gathered all of the Amber you'll need run behind the Amber-Shaper and wait for the Coagulated Amber to get close as we want to be very precise with boss timers. Once they are in range evasion and Killing Spree. Again at 3 to 4 seconds left on Soul Capacitor use Mirror of the Blademaster to kill the Coagulated Amber before Soul Capacitor detonates.

Before Soul Capacitor explodes make sure to use the Legendary Ring so we can carry some of the damage over to the Amber Monstrosity. 

Once Soul Capacitor explodes immediately run over to where the Amber Monstrosity will spawn with the stored damage via Legendary Ring. Make sure that you do not explode on the Pool-tender's. You can't really avoid splitting some of the damage to the Amber-Shaper or any Living Amber but, the extra damage dealt to the Monstrosity will put us ahead of Amber-Shaper Un'sok's Reshape Life timer.

Fall asleep just for today
I heard you say
We don’t need to do anything
The world outside is cold and grey
Said it looks like rain
Let’s stay in bed we’ll watch
The world just wash away

It’s you and me against the world
Just you and me against the world
But we won’t fall
No, we stand tall
It’s you and me against the world
Just you and me against the world
But have no fear
Cause I’m right here
So have no fear
Cause I’m right here

(Against the world, against the world)
(So have no fear cause I’m right here)
(Against the world, against the world)
(So have no fear cause I’m right hеre)

Cities getting loud
And wе can drown out every sound
Don’t wanna feel haste
So do it our way
With every trace
We can’t hear what they say
Sun don’t shine the way that it used to
Clouds still gray, but we’re safe in this room
Can I fall asleep laying with you next to me
There’s no place I’d rather be

It’s you and me against the world
Just you and me against the world
And I don’t mind
Just wasting time
It’s you and me against the world
Just you and me against the world
But have no fear
Cuz I’m right here
So have no fear
Cuz I’m right here
(don’t care cuz life ain’t fair)

(Against the world, against the world)
(So have no fear cause I’m right here)
(Against the world, against the world)
(So have no fear cause I’m right here)

She has created a live program that gives women the tools they need to become confident and walk through the fear that holds them back so they can live an exciting and fulfilling life.

In this episode of Construct Your Life with Austin Linney, Amber narrates how she struggled with alcohol addiction for many years and the pivotal moment she decided to break that generational pattern. She talks about her personal development journey and how she’s working towards financial freedom.

Listen in to learn how you can transform your life when you put your mind to it and be open to the possibilities of a better future.

[2:59] Reaching out to like-minded people and making genuine connections.

[7:34] A life transformation: from an alcoholic to a writer.

[29:38] The true meaning of self-love that radiates to everyone else.

[45:50] How to open up your mind to new ideas and opportunities.
