►What is fan made movie trailer?

In a nutshell fan made trailers are created for extreme movie fans. That's why its not for everybody because just like Pro-Wrestling, some hate it some love it. If you are into fan made trailers which means you appreciate bringing new ideas to your favorite movies. But my trailers, are not like any other, one word to describe it, REALISTIC.

Editing Details:

Creating Aquaman 2 was challenging because I was not into this franchsie. But my DC lover side made me appreciate this film more. I watched this film once and I thought it was decent. The fresh clips are not too hard to find since there are plenty of cosplay to chose from. To avoid making this dream trailer feel low budget I chose clips from the Aquaman movie it self. Such as the Atlantic City.

The music was great, despite the lack of humor the soundtrack by THE EQUALIZER 2 trailer #2 was great because it had lots of trailer fling to it. The main actor himself had lots of movies to chose from since this is the first time I made a project about him. Not the first Aquaman project though, I did one back in 2020 for one of the trailer style of the infinity saga.

The line ""is only a myth"" is great connection to how Aquaman is a mystical character. The film SEE had great lines talking about ""gods"" that perfectly fits this dream trailer. Speaking of perfectly fits, the clip with Aquaman attacks the bad guy we get a transition to a guy getting attacked in the water.

Many had heard about the water systems we were installing from others who were already enjoying clean water.  They heard about the difference that clean water was making in the health of families receiving it.  They heard that the water was affordable and even free if you couldn’t pay.

In this video I'm attempting to take my 18 year old, semi-auto ex-ambulance turned home on wheels and completely revive it, transplanting everything from a low mileage ""other"" T1n Sprinter & swapping the transmission over in the process.

The donor van has now been stripped and is gone.
The Engine, gearbox, wiring loom and all other vital parts are all now sat waiting.
The last thing left is to tear my van/home completely apart and start this mammoth task of rebuilding it from the ground up, converting it to manual transmission and fixing the ailments that have plagued this van.

I am not from a mechanical background and this is easily the biggest undertaking of any vehicle I've done, there's going to be a lot of ball's ups, going backwards, fits, blood, tears, and moments of victory.
But I have to make this work. If I don't, well my home can no long move.

Her career’s purpose is to help impact-driven business owners get their message out to the world in the most efficient and powerful way through digital marketing opportunities.

Before founding NGNG Enterprises with Amber Vilhauer (standing for NoGutsNoGlory) in 2007, Amber was an integral part of a multi-million dollar marketing company named Vector Marketing, while also attending the University of Arizona for Marketing and Graphic Design. As a young 20 year old, not only did Amber achieve the highest sales level in the company of Senior Field Sales Manager, she also moved through the management levels very quickly.

From her promotion of Assistant Manager after 3 short months, Amber went on to become a lead Sales Manager for her local district office. She was pursued to move to Denver for the position of Pilot Sales Manager, helping to run a division of 13 offices in 4 states. Amber trained new managers to open their own district office, was responsible for training and managing more than 30 receptionists in the division, all while continuing to recruit and train thousands of sales reps for the Denver district. Amber assisted in coordinating division-wide conferences throughout the year, regularly speaking in small workshop and 300-person conference settings.

At 25 years old, Amber was ready for her next challenge. She pivoted and organized the production of two powerful conferences designed to teach budding entrepreneurs how to grow their business online. As Amber connected with the speakers, some of the top online marketing experts of all time, her passion to test and refine their strategies was born.

Working one-on-one with her author, speaker and coach clients, Amber and her team have created more than 500 WordPress websites. Amber knows how a website needs to function in order to generate sales, build a fan base and attract long-term clientele. She works with clients to build a strong, branded social media presence, coaches each client on which manageable actions will help them achieve their online goals and then walks them through exactly how to do it.

In this week's video I'm taking you waaay back.
Before Portugal, trip 1 and 2, right back to August last year where Emma had bought a new van to replace her VW T4.
We decided early on that the one van approach wasn't going to work for us, we both enjoy our own time and space, so with the dual van option it gives us that, as well as the freedom to go off on our own, rescue either van, and because they're the same make, even share spare parts.

So this video takes you to the very start of Emma's build, Insulating, or trying to at least, followed up in part 2 by Adding the skylights and Giving the van a new colour scheme.

I've opened an Amazon store! It has all the items I've used to build the van, accessories I have or rate, tools, electrical items, dog bits and much more. This is aimed at answering all of your parts and kit questions:

https://www.amazon.co.uk/shop/projectamber

Updated regularly when I upgrade kit or find better alternatives. Also included is items I get asked about all the time so I've added what I would use if building a camper again.

About Us:
School of Pronunciation is a free English video pronunciation guide. We started this project in June 2019, with the intention of providing ourselves a reference for American English pronunciation. American pronunciation is one of the world’s most widely used. Our mission is one of confidence; to give our subscribers of all backgrounds the ability to be confident communicators on demand. At the moment, our pronunciation practice style involves us saying the word, then giving subscribers time to repeat the word aloud. This repetitive approach is believed to shorten the learning curve of subscribers whose goal is to speak English like a native. We aim to provide clear and accurate pronunciation of words that new English speakers commonly struggle with. We also strive to remain abreast of words that appear in the latest trending issues.

Amber Heard is back in the news. The actress who has been embroiled in back-to-back controversies may soon have some good news to share with her fans. The only project he has on his next schedule is Aquaman 2 from the DCEU. However, there have been several headlines about decreasing or increasing the actress' screen time. But it looks like Marvel has their eyes set on her. Even though there have been deceptive conversations that she could be fired from producing the DCEU for failing a medical exam, it seems Amber still has reason to rejoice.

Some things have been underlying for a while getting slowly worse, others have sprung out on me as a surprise. But now I have a lot of issues to contend with and a tough decision to make on the future of my van/home.

About Us:
School of Pronunciation is a free English video pronunciation guide. We started this project in June 2019, with the intention of providing ourselves a reference for American English pronunciation. American pronunciation is one of the world’s most widely used. Our mission is one of confidence; to give our subscribers of all backgrounds the ability to be confident communicators on demand. At the moment, our pronunciation practice style involves us saying the word, then giving subscribers time to repeat the word aloud. This repetitive approach is believed to shorten the learning curve of subscribers whose goal is to speak English like a native. We aim to provide clear and accurate pronunciation of words that new English speakers commonly struggle with. We also strive to remain abreast of words that appear in the latest trending issues.
