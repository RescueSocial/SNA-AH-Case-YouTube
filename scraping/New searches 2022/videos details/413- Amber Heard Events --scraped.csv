Get PAID: http://bit.ly/2XivKE0.  Amber Heard displays her punky new look as she flashes her toned abs at Puma x Balmain launch. She knows how to bring the glamour at stylish A-List events.

And Amber Heard showed off her punky new look at the Puma x Balmain launch event in Los Angeles on Thursday.

The Aquaman actress, 33, flashed her toned abs in a black and gold sports bra which featured the brand's name in shimmering gold lettering. 

The tiny garment drew the eye to her slender waist and teamed a glimpse of her decolletage, which was adorned with shimmering gold chains.

Amber paired her bra with floaty high-waisted red sequined trousers which had a strip of black and silver down the sides.

The star also donned a military style navy blue velvet jacket with statement shoulder pads and a gold trim around the sleeves.

She completed her look with accessories including a black leather belt with a gold buckle and added layers of gold chain necklaces. 

Amber wore her long blonde locks down for the star-studded event and let her curls cascade over her shoulders. 

She also added a bold red lipstick to accentuate her pretty features and complement her matching showstopping trousers.   

Joining Amber at the launch of Cara Delevingne's collaboration with Balmain, which was inspired by the boxing ring, was Eva Longoria, 44.

Eva also sported the black and gold sports bra, paired with a black double-breasted tuxedo jacket, featuring gold buttons.

She completed the look with the black joggers, black stiletto booties and gold hoop earrings, matching her necklace, bracelet and watch.

Cara, 27, was also at the launch and looked fantastic in the same black sports bra as Amber and Eva and slim black joggers, featuring gold zippers on the sides.

Underneath the Hammersmith born British catwalk queen wore a pair of black fishnet stockings, pulled up over her tight tummy.
