Here’s what the magazine printed:

“Amber Rose wrote the book on it. No, seriously: Kanye’s infamous ex, Wiz Khalifa’s baby mama, America’s toughest bald babe since Sigourney Weaver in Alien 3, is about to publish a book of life lessons called How to Be a Bad Bitch. Like Amber herself, it’s all heart. Unlike Amber, it’s not that thick! The teen stripper turned megalomaniac muse spoke to Carrie Battan about her beautiful dark twisted journey to the top.”

Ms. Rose didn’t find it so amusing. She screenshot the piece, posted on her IG, and gave her 2 cents.

“Really @gq??? I’m so much more then Kanye’s Ex or Wiz’s baby’s mama. Damn, why the (expletive) did u guys reach out to me for this article and photoshoot? To dumb me down? I talked about feminism and my Slutwalk… Wtf nice title smh I expected so much more from u guys and I’m so disappointed. I was so excited to be featured in GQ not realizing I was shooting for a tabloid. My slutwalk was for ignorant (expletive) like this. Oh “Her beautiful dark twisted journey to the top”? Nice pun. Negative af. Thx for nothing.”

Why did GQ choose to call her Wiz’s “baby mama” instead of “ex-wife?” Well, we spoke to the writer of the story, Carrie Baton to get her thoughts.

“If you notice, she cut out the title of the piece, which was ‘How to Be a Bad Bitch,’ which is the title of her book. Which is kind of the highest praise we could have given her.”

Carrie elaborates with her intention on the piece.

“My goal was to find a way to explain to people the challenges that she’s facing while she’s sort of transitioning in these two fazes of her life. and sort of what her feminism stand point is and how it ties into what people know her as.”

JAY-Z is missing out on a huge chunk of cash by refusing to allow Spotify stream his latest album, 4:44. How much? Hov is forfeiting weekly checks of close to a million dollars, according to Billboard.
The projected number is based on “share of the market and the average rate paid per song stream.” However, others project that the payout would be closer to $250,000 if he put the LP on Spotify’s paid tier for seven days. Either way, that’s a big sum to be leaving on the table.
Jigga initially released the album exclusively through his streaming service, Tidal and telecommunications giant Sprint. He later released the project through iTunes and Apple Music, but has yet to give Spotify the rights to the LP. There may be more to Spotify not getting the record than just not wanting to give his work to a rival company.
“[JAY-Z] would choose to frame this as potentially saying all music should be paid for and positioning his release against Spotify’s free tier,” said MIDiA Research analyst Zach Fuller. “Whether or not that argument stands up depends on who you speak to. You can commend Spotify for engendering this audience that previously would be downloading the music illegally.”
Despite not being on Spotify, 4:44 has been one of the top releases of 2017, sales wise.
Jay is on pace to drop a video for all the songs on the project, after releasing visuals every week since the album has been out. The most recent treatment for “Kill Jay Z” came out yesterday (July 21).",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0rWPtWCPxZM/default.jpg,120,90,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0rWPtWCPxZM/mqdefault.jpg,320,180,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0rWPtWCPxZM/hqdefault.jpg,480,360,,,,JordanTower,"['news', 'gossip', 'rumors', 'rap', 'exposed', 'entertainment', 'the truth', 'instagram', 'snapchat', 'twitter', 'jtnews', 'jay z', '4:44', 'gucci mane', 'drama', 'meek mill movie', 'breaking news', 'meek mill drake', 'drake meek mill', 'nicki minaj meek mill', 'jayz z 444', ""Amber Rose Put ON BLAST with High school Picture over her comment 'People Philly arent pretty'"", 'amber rose']",10,none,Amber Rose Put ON BLAST with High school Picture over her comment 'People Philly arent pretty',"Amber Rose Put ON BLAST with High school Picture over her comment 'People Philly arent pretty'

JAY-Z is missing out on a huge chunk of cash by refusing to allow Spotify stream his latest album, 4:44. How much? Hov is forfeiting weekly checks of close to a million dollars, according to Billboard.
The projected number is based on “share of the market and the average rate paid per song stream.” However, others project that the payout would be closer to $250,000 if he put the LP on Spotify’s paid tier for seven days. Either way, that’s a big sum to be leaving on the table.
Jigga initially released the album exclusively through his streaming service, Tidal and telecommunications giant Sprint. He later released the project through iTunes and Apple Music, but has yet to give Spotify the rights to the LP. There may be more to Spotify not getting the record than just not wanting to give his work to a rival company.
“[JAY-Z] would choose to frame this as potentially saying all music should be paid for and positioning his release against Spotify’s free tier,” said MIDiA Research analyst Zach Fuller. “Whether or not that argument stands up depends on who you speak to. You can commend Spotify for engendering this audience that previously would be downloading the music illegally.”
Despite not being on Spotify, 4:44 has been one of the top releases of 2017, sales wise.
Jay is on pace to drop a video for all the songs on the project, after releasing visuals every week since the album has been out. The most recent treatment for “Kill Jay Z” came out yesterday (July 21).",PT18M34S,2d,hd,true,True,rectangular,processed,public,youtube,True,True,False,3756,67,0,20,,,,en,,,

Nothing. The answer is nothing, and Amber Rose is here to remind you of that, as she should- since a few too many people on the internet found an issue with an adorable video of Amber’s son gushing over T-Swift concert tickets. The back story here is that Amber’s 5 year old son really loves Taylor Swift, so when Taylor sent tickets to Amber, of course she had to get his reaction on camera. But she obviously didn’t expect any backlash, including horrible comments about her son’s sexuality, for posting the video online. She quickly took to her Instagram, and in a series of stories, she shut those haters right down. 
She said QUOTE: ""Shout-out to all the hyper-masculine men and ignorant dumb-ass women that will call a 5-year-old gay for liking Taylor Swift. This is why young kids kill themselves. And this is also why our society is so f-cked up. Liking a certain type of music will not make you 'pick' your sexuality, you dumb f-cks.""P.S. My son just got accepted into the most prestigious private school in Los Angeles because he's smart as f-ck and creative as f-ck like his parents. We allow him to be himself. He can listen to whatever music he likes, he can like whatever color he wants and we let him be passionate about whatever his little heart desires.""
And that wasn’t powerful enough, Amber continued saying QUOTE 
Let's do better for the next generation, people. Grow the f-ck up and teach your kids to love and not hate. P.S.S. Regardless if he's gay or straight, when he gets older, he will be around the most amazing, loving people that will support him no matter what.""
And if THAT wasn’t powerful enough, she ended her rant saying QUOTE “He also has more money in his bank account than any of you trolls could even imagine.”
These are my favorite kind of rants, tbh, as a mother, and just as a human. 
But now it’s time for you to weigh in with your thoughts on Amber’s clap back, so drop it down in the comments below, and then click right here to see the adorable moment Amber’s son realized he was going to the Taylor Swift concert. Thanks so much for hanging out with me here on Clevver News, I’m Sinead de Vries, and I’ll see you guys next time.

Amber is a licensed therapist, multiple biz owner and former tech industry dropout. She hosts the Easily Distracted Entrepreneur podcast, where she supports ADHD {and ADHD-ish} business owners to overcome what she calls“shiny object syndrome.” 
Amber & her husband have both struggled with ADHD and we speak candidly about strategies for overcoming distractions in both home and business.
During our conversation Amber shares:
How she craves organization as a way to reclaim control 
The struggle to NOT do all the things (and strategies on how to work through it)
The importance of delegating (and how to do it)
If you or someone you love struggles with ADHD, this is a must-listen episode.  
Amber reminds us that with the right strategies, anyone can live an organized life. 
Make sure to check out the links we talked about below in our show notes, including her Free Shiny Object Checklist.  @ed

Acclaimed BC poets, Elizabeth Bachinsky, Marita Dachsel, Amber Dawn, and Jennica Harper read from their most recent books and engage in a discussion about the nature of truth in poetry, mining biography and autobiography in their works, and whether or not it is possible to be too true.

Her play Initiation Trilogy was produced by Electric Company Theatre, was featured at the 2012 Vancouver International Writers Fest, and was nominated for the Jessie Richardson Award for Outstanding New Script. She is the Artist in Residence at UVic’s Centre for Studies in Religion and Society. After many years in Vancouver and Edmonton, she and her family now live in Victoria.

AMBER HEARD | HOT TRIBUTE VIDEO COMPILATION

Amber Laura Heard (born April 22, 1986) is an American film and television actress. After a series of small roles in film and television, Heard had her first starring role in the horror film All the Boys Love Mandy Lane (2006). She first gained mainstream recognition for supporting roles in the action film Never Back Down (2008) and the comedy Pineapple Express (2008). In the following years, she appeared in films such as The Joneses (2009), The Ward (2010), The Rum Diary (2011), Drive Angry (2011), Machete Kills (2013) and Magic Mike XXL (2015).

In 2017, Heard joined the DC Extended Universe to play Atlantean queen Mera in superhero films Justice League (2017), Aquaman (2018), and Zack Snyder's Justice League (2021). In addition to acting, Heard has been a global spokesperson for the cosmetics giant L'Oréal Paris since 2018. She also engages in human rights activism.

Heard was married to actor Johnny Depp from 2015 to 2017. Their divorce drew significant media attention as she alleged that he had been abusive through most of their relationship. He then sued her for defamation in 2019 after Heard wrote an op-ed discussing being a public victim of domestic violence. He also sued the publishers of The Sun in a related libel suit in England. In 2020, the High Court of Justice of England and Wales ruled that Depp had lost his libel case and that the majority of Heard's allegations had been proven to a civil standard.

In 2017, Heard joined the DC Extended Universe to play Atlantean queen Mera in superhero films Justice League (2017), Aquaman (2018), and Zack Snyder's Justice League (2021). In addition to acting, Heard has been a global spokesperson for the cosmetics giant L'Oréal Paris since 2018. She also engages in human rights activism.

Heard was married to actor Johnny Depp from 2015 to 2017. Their divorce drew significant media attention as she alleged that he had been abusive through most of their relationship. He then sued her for defamation in 2019 after Heard wrote an op-ed discussing being a public victim of domestic violence. He also sued the publishers of The Sun in a related libel suit in England. In 2020, the High Court of Justice of England and Wales ruled that Depp had lost his libel case and that the majority of Heard's allegations had been proven to a civil standard.

I sit down with ameatuear model Amber Beauvillier. She’s French Canadian and how people sometimes talk differently. We discuss the Marvel Cinematic Universe and how excited we are for the films. We talk about what it means to be an “Instagram Model” and how to maintain relationships in the photo and modeling world. We talk about GWCs and how they’re effecting the photography and modeling community. We also talk about how I drink a lot of coffee and not enough water.

As a journalist, Amber Hunt has spent much of her career fine-tuning her BS detector in hopes of figuring out the truth to tell readers. She's been known to sanctimoniously grill sources she's caught in a lie how they sleep at night. But she's a also a big believer in some truths being more subjective than others, which can make her job incredibly complicated at times. Hunt is a New York Times bestselling author and nationally award-winning journalist who works as an investigative reporter with the Cincinnati Enquirer. She previously covered crime for the Detroit Free Press and oversaw reporters in North and South Dakota as a news editor for The Associated Press. Hunt has written three true-crime books, as well as the bestselling biography The Kennedy Wives: Triumph and Tragedy in America's Most Public Family. Hunt is a past Knight-Wallace Fellow at the University of Michigan, and she teaches multimedia journalism at the University of Cincinnati.

I've been to hell. Not literally. But if you call Plaidson New Jersey hell, you get where I'm coming from. You see in Plaidson you're either on 1 of the 2 sides.

A. rich
Or
B. poor

And you see Since I, Amber Rivera am a citizen of Plaidson... I guess ill give you some play by play or in others words advise. 

Point A: watch out for rich people...yes I'm poor.

Point B: when a rich boy pulls you in a closet you might as well yell ""rape!!!"".

Point C: ... I've got nothing

But as we conclude today's lesson we can say you're ready for Plaidson new jersey. See you there.

Love,

         Amber Rivera
  

Chapter 1

Nicole's POv

Living is something we only realize is beautiful until someone loses its possession. Last year my mother died. And I don't know my father. Don't get me wrong my life's not that out of the ordinary my mother wasn't brutally murdered, even thou that is terrible, she was sick with cancer.

That is why I'm here in Plaidson, New Jersey to live with my cousin Amber and her family. The funny thing is right now I don't know what to feel. I mean I feel grateful, because I had to sleep in an orphanage until now, but wow. You see dear friend I haven't heard the best things about Plaidson. And I'm guessing you got the whole point speech from Amber. Wow she gave it in letter form! Are you serious? Wow!

""Nicole time for school!"" 

That must be amber. Later.

""Coming,"" I screeched running down the stairs.

""Whoa Buba!"" I was shocked to see Amber standing there in a pair of daisy dukes.

""Are those the pants I let you borrow?"" Amber began to pout as if she was trying to forget.

""I know they are hideous. But they are all I have left all your other clothes are packed away and mine are in the wash."" She sighed while putting on a pair of dorky glasses and retainer. 

""What are you doing?"" I asked concerned.

""Getting ready for school,"" I gave her a look. ""Ok look I don't want to get raped or anything so I dress like a dork.""

What the hell was wrong with this school? I would not let amber hide her beauty. I took off the glasses and broke them in half after that I took out her retainer and crushed it. She gasped.

""If they touch you ill kick their ass!"" I gave her a reassuring smile she nodded.



On the other side of town on the front stairs of school

Nick's pov


""Why are we here?"" Zac asked in his pathetic tone.

I sighed

""To drink beer and think a little, stupid ass!"" I exclaimed.

""We all know you need time to think for once,"" Joey murmured loud enough for us all to hear.

We all laughed. That's why Joey is my best friend.

And at that same time Ryan walked up with Jessie Joey's little brother, both of them with crazy sex hair.

""Sup guys."" Jessie said lazily.

Joey gave him a look that meant 'we are talking later'
I opened my mouth to say something a little inappropriate when the screeching of wheels made all of our heads snap up.

Gvantsa Abuladze and her sister Baia make some of Imereti's finest wines across all genres, white, orange, pink, red, and sparkling. Imereti is the historical heart of Western Georgia and worlds away from Kakheti, the hotter, drier province responsible for the vast majority of the country's wines. Wines are traditionally crafted in tear-dropped shaped clay vessels called qvevri across both regions, but the offerings couldn't be more differently stylistically. 

As for food, think like a Georgian, which is not to say you have to find Georgian food, but adorn the table with a variety of options. I love Carla Capalbo's description of the traditional Georgian meal:
“At a supra, the table is laden with food before anyone sits down. The centre of a long table hosting, say, twenty people will be set with at least seven or eight cold dishes . . . Once everyone is seated and has started eating, other dishes - including hot stews, stuffed breads, dumplings and barbecued meats - begin to arrive and are placed beside (and sometimes even on top of) the first set of foods. If a serving plate is emptied, the dish is not removed but replenished by the attentive hosts.” 

Bill Jensen, sommelier for Michelin-starred Washington DC restaurant Tail Up Goat, and her sister Reveler's Hour, is a breakout star of the Covid-19 Pandemic with his virtual wine school. In an effort to stay in touch with his regulars and soon-to-be regulars, he launched #StayHome Wine School on March 29th, and continued every Sunday at 4 pm EST for 40 straight weeks.

This week's poem was January Flowers at Uplistsikhe by Ana Kalandadze 
 
In Bill's weekly recap email, he said this:
 A heartful ""Didi madloba!"" to everyone who joined us for yesterday's class! Winemaker Gvantsa Abuladze charmed us all from eight time zones away with our old friend Noel Brockett offering additional commentary from our neck of the woods. Gvantsa (along with her sister Baia and brother Giorgi) makes some of the country's most stunning wines in a style more elegant and easy-drinking than many Westerners have come to expect. It has been inspiring to watch the label evolve since Baia founded it in 2015; to witness Gvantsa become a more prominent part of the brand; to see the range of offerings expand and the wines become more delicious vintage in and out.
 
Like it's signature amber wines, Georgia is a place between - at the intersection of East and West with an economy poised between developing and fully industrialized. Over half the workforce remains employed in agriculture, and the wine sector, albeit ancient, is very much emerging:
 “In 2018, 245,000 tons of grape were processed by 292 winemaking companies; for a country with a tiny domestic consumption base, that is a lot of wineries. By comparison, La Rioja in Spain has 600 wineries drawing grape from 12,000 growers and 45,000 ha of vineyard, but it is at the heart of an enthusiastic wine-drinking country of 47 million people with huge loyalty to that appellation. [Georgia has a population of 3.7 million people.] The availability of various grants and subsidized loans over the past five years has enticed many urban professionals to mortgage their urban properties and engage in their dream of owning a small winery or vineyard with borrowed money.”
