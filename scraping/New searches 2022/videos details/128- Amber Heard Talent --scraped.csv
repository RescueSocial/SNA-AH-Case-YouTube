Amber shares her concept around talent mobility, The Growth Effect, and is an advocate for employees and employers to get past old structures and norms to create more growth for both parties. Amber drops many wisdom bombs in this episode, including great advice on how to manage your career in your 20’s, 30’s and 40’s.

It's hard not to have a good time being in conversation with Amber, so I hope you appreciate her enthusiasm and encouragement to build a career with more flexibility and growth no matter your stage and age.

Thank you for sharing so many great insights, Amber! I loved being in conversation with you!

I mean I get most of my business comes through referral-based in connecting with people they know, working well with my clients making a difference for them, and then they want to make a big impact for one of their friends who has a business or someone that they know in their network. So very much so through referral base. 

Reb Risty Great, great. Well, so the marketing question for you is in your business obviously its very relationship-based. How do you build your referral network? How are you going out in marketing yourself to grow your business? 

Amber Gough  I am a big believer in and connecting with people. And so when I am out networking whether it be through just socializing or in a formal networking setting I really strive to be very present. And so in the moment with the person - a matter of fact, my logo is a symbol for presence - and I believe so firmly I show up authentically and I, if I'm listening to someone, really hearing them, what's what their concerns are, what they're really - what their actual needs are, and connecting them with it as people. Then I'm able to serve them better, at whether that be through my business or referring to them to somebody else or what have you. So, I think that my ability to just show up and show someone that I care and that I'm really there with them in that moment, builds trust and people are more likely to refer people to me. 

Reb Risty: You know another good way to build trust is through webinars. So Amber was just sharing with me, that you've had some success with that. I'd love to hear about what you're doing, what your approach is with webinars. 

Amber Gough Absolutely. I was fortunate enough that through networking and connecting with someone. One of my friends, I built that trust, and she said you know, and she does a lot of webinars speaker, author, and she said you need to be teaching webinars. And she connected me with a few organizations that are H.R. (human resources base) which is very big in my industry and my primary contact, and connected me in. And fortunately, they set it up. It's very seamless and easy it only takes my time essentially in building out the PowerPoint presentation and the content in which I'm teaching, and then I'm able to present to as many as, my most recent webinar 800 people dialed in across the nation. 

Reb Risty  Wow

Amber Gough Yeah. Huge, huge footprint. And then others can actually access that as well through going to their website. I can present that content. It's fantastic. And through that typically at the end of the webinar throughout it you're offering some sort of freebie so it might be a survey or some way of analyzing purpose, you know alignment with a candidate in a company and then they reach out to you. It opens the door to a conversation and you're able to oftentimes convert that into clients. So, it's really powerful. Plus, it's fun. If you're talking about something, you're passionate about and enjoy it can be really, really fun as well. So, I love it.

Reb Risty [00:05:26] That's great, yeah. That's some great advice. I know obviously video as we're doing now podcasting, webinars are becoming more popular because people are just seeking information in a, I think in a different way, and they're trying to educate themselves, first, before they make decisions. So that's really, really neat. I love to hear that's working. 

Amber Gough [00:05:46] Absolutely and it's such a differentiator of being a subject matter expert too. Like this is what I know this is what I can do. I'm a subject matter expert so people are more likely to come to you, and it kind of builds that trust. 

Amber Gough It's really powerful. 

Reb Risty Right. Well, you heard it here. Content, subject matter expert, referral network, are all very important, especially in professional services. Amber if somebody wants to contact you learn more about what you're doing or how you're doing, how, what's the best way to reach you?

Born and raised in London, Ontario, Amber Marshall trained at Lester B. Pearson School for the Arts, as well as The Original Kids Theatre Company in London. Amber has appeared in numerous film and television productions, displaying a remarkable range and vulnerability. She is most known for her work as Amy Fleming on CBC's long running series Heartland, now filming season 9.

Amber was awarded with the 2013 Fan Choice Award at the Canadian Screen awards and has kept an intimate relationship with her fans through communication on her Social Media pages. A strong actress, she has had regular roles in television series such as Super Rupert, The Power Strikers and Dark Oracle, and has guest appeared on different series, including Twice in a Lifetime and Doc. Heartland, a television series filmed in Alberta has been her dream come true. The contemporary family drama follows Marshall's character, Amy as she works with troubled horses and their owners to find harmony.

She has also played the daughter to Rob Lowe in a TV Classic Christmas tale called, ""Christmas Shoes."" To add to her Christmas TV Movie collection, Amber starred in Heartland's Christmas Movie, titled; ""A Heartland Christmas."" She also recently added the role of Nicole on a SyFy Channel Movie of the Week called Fallout Asylum to her resume.

A former veterinary assistant who is passionate about all animals, Amber has been around horses as long as she can remember. She has been riding since a very young age and says that the two things she loves the most - acting and horses - have come together to create this dream role of Amy on the Heartland series. Amber loves to be outdoors and enjoys overnight mountain trips with her horses and dogs. As Heartland films in Alberta, she has made a home for herself with her husband on a ranch outside of Calgary where she is surrounded by stunning vistas and of course, her animals.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ugUcT0vnd7Q/default.jpg,120,90,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ugUcT0vnd7Q/mqdefault.jpg,320,180,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ugUcT0vnd7Q/hqdefault.jpg,480,360,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ugUcT0vnd7Q/sddefault.jpg,640.0,480.0,Talent Talk,"['Talking talent', 'talent talk', 'Talking talent online', 'Talking talent podcast', 'Talking with talent', 'Actors on becoming actors', 'Advice for aspiring actors', 'Actor Interviews', 'actors on actors', 'learning to act', 'working on film set', 'character acting', 'actors on acting', 'celebrity interviews', 'interactive interviews', 'garry maclean', 'Horses', 'heartland', 'amber marshall', 'cbc', 'canadian television', 'amber marshall interview']",24,none,Talent Talk Interview   Amber Marshall,"Talent Talk is an online talk show, showcasing professionals in various aspects of arts and media including, film & television, music, cosplay, arts, etc. Shows are streamed live on the scheduled dates and are interactive for guests to ask questions during the show.
