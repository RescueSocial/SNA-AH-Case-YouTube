Amber Heard alleged in a British courton Wednesday that ex-husband Johnny Deppthrew ""30 or so bottles"" at her as if they were ""grenades or bombs"" during a drunken and frenzied assault in Australia in March 2015 that also saw him accidentally sever part of his finger. Taking the witness box for a third day at the High Court in London during Depps libel case against a British tabloid, the actress refuted his allegation that it was she who lost her temper and that she had injured him. Heard has described her stay in Australia with Depp as akin to a ""three-day hostage situation,"" during which Depp was ""completely out of his mind and out of control"" following a binge on drugs and alcohol.  Heard has said that she feared for her life while at the rented property on Australias Gold Coast during a visit while Depp was filming the latest ""Pirates of the CaribbeanThe incident is central to The Suns labeling of Depp in an April 2018 article as a ""wife-beater.
