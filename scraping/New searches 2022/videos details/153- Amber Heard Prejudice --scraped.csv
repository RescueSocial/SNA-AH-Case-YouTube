Skylar Grey is a five-time GRAMMY-nominated singer, songwriter and multi-instrumentalist who is responsible for co-writing some of the most memorable songs of the past couple years. She penned Eminem’s/Rihanna’s “Love The Way You Lie,” which became one of the biggest songs of their careers. This lead to Grey writing Dr. Dre’s “I Need A Doctor,” Diddy Dirty Money’s “Coming Home,” and Kaskade’s “Room For Happiness”. Her work has lit up the Billboard Hot 100 and iTunes sales charts, totaling more than 15 million singles sold globally.

Lyrics :
Born on the wrong side of the ocean
With all the tides against you
You never thought you'd be much good for anyone
But that's so far from the truth

[Pre-Chorus]
I know there's pain in your heart
And you're covered in scars
Wish you could see what I do

[Chorus]
'Cause baby, everything you are
Is everything I need
You're everything to me
Baby, every single part
Is who you're meant to be
'Cause you were meant for me
And you're everything I need

[Verse 2]
You can say I'm wrong
You can turn your back against me
But I am here to stay
(I am here to stay)
Like the sea
She keeps kissing the shoreline
No matter how many times he pushes her away

[Chorus]
'Cause baby, everything you are
Is everything I need
You're everything to me
Baby, every single part
Is who you're meant to be
'Cause you were meant for me

[Bridge]
And everything happens for a reason
It's all a blessing in disguise
I used to question who I was
But now I see
The answer's in your eyes

[Chorus]
'Cause baby, everything you are
Is everything I need
You're everything to me
Baby, every single part
Is who you're meant to be
'Cause you were meant for me
And you're everything I need

Amber’s life seems wonderful. She shares her apartment with her pet fish, Sushi. She loves her job and dreams of the day she’ll be on an airplane, a full-fledged cabin attendant assisting travellers. The possibilities are endless - “the sky is the limit” as they say. But appearances can be deceiving…

Everything is overshadowed by what happened in her childhood and she can’t escape her past. Her lingering guilt and fear are holding her back from achieving the very thing she is trying to achieve. 

When her plane crashes, Amber is forced to face her fears. As you’ve heard time and again during safety demonstrations, Amber will have to help herself before she can help others. Is she up to the task?

Share the highs and lows of Amber’s life. Be there for her and help her ascend to the highest heights!
