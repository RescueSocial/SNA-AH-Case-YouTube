STORYLINE: LAWYERS: DEPP'S ESTRANGED WIFE HEARD HAS MADE A STATEMENT TO POLICE
Johnny Depp's estranged wife has given Los Angeles police a statement to support her account of an alleged domestic violence incident involving the actor, her lawyers said Tuesday.
Attorneys Samantha Spector and Joseph P. Koenig wrote in a statement that model-actress Amber Heard had spoken to Los Angeles police. The statement did not indicate when Heard gave the statement, and the Los Angeles Police Department says it has no information about Heard speaking with officers.
""With her statement Amber hopes to give the LAPD the opportunity to conduct an accurate and complete investigation into the events of that evening and before,"" Heard's lawyers wrote. ""If that occurs, and the truth is revealed, there is no doubt that Amber's claims will be substantiated beyond any doubt, and hopefully Johnny will get the help that he so desperately needs.""
Heard obtained a temporary restraining order against Depp on Friday, alleging the actor threw her cell phone at her face, striking her below the right eye during a fight on May 21.
Los Angeles police have said they responded to the incident but found no evidence of a crime.
Spector and Koenig wrote that Heard did not initially give a statement to police because she was trying to protect Depp's reputation and career.
An email message sent to Depp's publicist was not immediately returned Tuesday.
Heard submitted a photo of her bruised face when she applied for the restraining order. She also wrote that the actor pulled her hair, screamed at her and repeatedly hit her and violently grabbed her face.
She appeared at a Los Angeles court on Friday and had a bruise on her right cheek below the eye.
Heard filed for divorce on May 23, two days after the alleged abuse, citing irreconcilable differences. Depp's lawyer has accused Heard of using the abuse allegations to try to gain an advantage on the actor in divorce proceedings. She is seeking spousal support, but Depp is asking a judge to deny that request.
""Amber is simply a victim of domestic violence, and none of her actions are motivated by money,"" Heard's lawyers wrote. ""Amber is a brave and financially independent woman who is showing the courage of her convictions by doing the right thing against Johnny's relentless army of lawyers and surrogates.""
Heard and Depp met on the set of the 2011 film ""The Rum Diary"" and were married for 15 months before the divorce petition was filed. Heard wrote that May 21, the day of the alleged assault, was the first time she had seen Depp in a month.
The actress reported in a court filing that she has about $10,000 a month in income, but her expenses total nearly $44,000 a month.
Depp is traveling overseas on tour with his band, Hollywood Vampires. His latest film, ""Alice Through the Looking Glass"" bombed at the box office, earning just over $28.1 million in its opening weekend, according to figures released Sunday.

Amber Heard might have finally been exposed! Johnny Depp and Amber Heard’s highly-publicized legal battle has been going on for a few years. There seems to be no end in sight.

However, many people have recently come out and offered evidence in support of Johnny’s version of events.

After nearly having his career ruined and being fired from several big-budget projects, Johnny is now being backed by Disney, who has reportedly rehired him for his role as Captain Jack Sparrow in the upcoming Pirates of the Caribbean movie.

A report that surfaced on Thursday (7 January) claimed the Pirates of the Caribbean star, 57, was accusing Heard, 34, of keeping her $7m (£5.1m) divorce settlement. However, Heard’s US lawyer Elaine Bredehoft accused Depp of “planting” the Daily Mail  story while also acknowledging the Aquaman star has been “delayed” in her “goal” to fulfil her original pledge.

Bruises all over my body, bruises on my forearms from trying to defend the blows. I had 2 black eyes. I had a broken nose. I had a broken lip''Justice Nichols - I believe her.

Responding to a tweet in Spanish that read, 'Amber Heard talking to Jonny Deep's lawyer regarding a set of photos where she claims she was made wearing makeup to cover hit marks, a broken nostril, bruises and more made by Johnny...but...', the actress replied, 'And so?'Another user tweeted: 'The only reason why jd lost his case is bc he was up against Rupert Murdock, not Amanda Heard.

Sometimes it's important to wear the same thing twice'.The posts come after Heard and British tabloid The Sun said they were vindicated after a UK court refused Depp the right to appeal against a ruling that he was a wife-beater.  The Hollywood actor had sought to challenge a November 2020 ruling in a high-profile libel action that upheld claims in the newspaper that he beat Heard during their stormy marriage.A spokeswoman for Heard said she was was 'pleased - but by no means surprised by the decision', adding the 'evidence presented in the UK case was overwhelming and undeniable'.The Sun said the newspaper 'had every confidence that this leave to appeal application would not be granted and are pleased with today's decision'.Two judges at the Court of Appeal dismissed his application to challenge the High Court ruling, finding that the original hearing had been 'full and fair'.   The trial judge 'gave thorough reasons for his conclusions which have not been shown even arguably to be vitiated by any error of approach or mistake of law'.Depp was unlikely to overturn the findings of a trial judge on purely factual questions, they added.The original ruling saw the Pirates of the Caribbean star ordered to pay",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nOWQTN8Q5lY/default.jpg,120,90,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nOWQTN8Q5lY/mqdefault.jpg,320,180,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nOWQTN8Q5lY/hqdefault.jpg,480,360,vieiralira,"['dailymail', 'tvshowbiz', 'Amber Heard', 'Johnny Depp', 'Twitter']",22,none,Amber Heard takes a swipe at Johnny Depp's former lawyer,"Amber Heard has responded to those questioning injuries she sustained at the hands of Johnny Depp. Among the Twitter users was Adam Waldman - a former member of Johnny's legal team - who tweeted a picture of the actress on Friday as he tried to discount her allegations against her ex-husband.  Alongside the images he wrote: '12/15/15 allegation 'I had bruised ribs.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

Now she is chilling and taking photos on set of the new Aquaman 2 movie. Set to hit theaters in 2022. This is enraging a lot of Johnny Depp supporters.
