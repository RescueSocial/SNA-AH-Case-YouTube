Lyrics 

Talk, talk, talk, and it's breaking my heart
All you do is talk, talk, talk, talk (shut up)
Talk, talk, talk, and it's breaking my heart
All you do is talk, talk, talk, talk (hey, hey!)

You think I can't read your game
But I can beat your poker face any day, any day
You're all talk, all words
Let me tell you what I heard
You're always spinning stories

Ooh, I got your number down (oh-oh, oh-oh)
Don't need to put one over
'Cause you're so proud, so proud
You're all talk, sounds, words
Don't believe a single word
Is that all you got for me?

Blah, blah, blah are the words that you're saying
I didn't wanna know but now I know I can't go back
Blah, blah, blah is the sound that I'm hearing
Blah, blah-blah, blah, shut up

All you do is talk, talk, talk, talk (eh-eh, eh-eh)
Running on your mouth and thinking I'm not onto you
Talk, talk, talk, talk (eh-eh, eh-eh)
Stop wasting all my time yeah with your stupid lines (hey!)
I don't need no other reasoning not to bother
It's only that you never tell the truth boy
All you do is talk, talk, talk, talk (oh-oh-oh)
Talk, talk, talk, and it's breaking my heart

Can’t listen to you run your mouth
Everyone else gather round
Let me help you break it down (ooh-ooh-ooh)
Every time I hear you speak
It's like a game of hide and seek
Always lies, never truth
Tell you what you ought to do

Ooh, I got your number down (oh-oh, oh-oh, yeah)
Don't need to put one over
'Cause you're so proud, so proud
You're all talk, sounds, words
Don't believe a single word
Is that all you got for me?

Blah, blah, blah are the words that you're saying
I didn't wanna know but now I know I can't go back
Blah, blah, blah is the sound that I'm hearing
Blah, blah-blah, blah, shut up

All you do is talk, talk, talk, talk (eh-eh, eh-eh)
Running on your mouth and thinking I'm not onto you
Talk, talk, talk, talk (eh-eh, eh-eh)
Stop wasting all my time yeah with your stupid lines (hey!)
I don't need no other reasoning not to bother
It's only that you never tell the truth boy
All you do is talk, talk, talk, talk (oh-oh-oh)
Talk, talk, talk, and it's breaking my heart

(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Now I don't wanna hear it
I want you off my mind
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
No, I don't really need this
I need someone to believe in

How about you shut it, shut it up, shut it up, shut it up
How about you shut it, shut it up, shut it up, shut it up
How about you shut it, shut it up, shut it up, shut it up
Blah, blah-blah, blah

All you do is talk, talk, talk, talk (eh-eh, eh-eh)
Running on your mouth and thinking I'm not onto you

Lyrics 

Talk, talk, talk, and it's breaking my heart
All you do is talk, talk, talk, talk (shut up)
Talk, talk, talk, and it's breaking my heart
All you do is talk, talk, talk, talk (hey, hey!)

You think I can't read your game
But I can beat your poker face any day, any day
You're all talk, all words
Let me tell you what I heard
You're always spinning stories

Ooh, I got your number down (oh-oh, oh-oh)
Don't need to put one over
'Cause you're so proud, so proud
You're all talk, sounds, words
Don't believe a single word
Is that all you got for me?

Blah, blah, blah are the words that you're saying
I didn't wanna know but now I know I can't go back
Blah, blah, blah is the sound that I'm hearing
Blah, blah-blah, blah, shut up

Running on your mouth and thinking I'm not onto you
Talk, talk, talk, talk (eh-eh, eh-eh)
Stop wasting all my time yeah with your stupid lines (hey!)
I don't need no other reasoning not to bother
It's only that you never tell the truth boy
All you do is talk, talk, talk, talk (oh-oh-oh)
Talk, talk, talk, and it's breaking my heart

Can’t listen to you run your mouth
Everyone else gather round
Let me help you break it down (ooh-ooh-ooh)
Every time I hear you speak
It's like a game of hide and seek
Always lies, never truth
Tell you what you ought to do

Ooh, I got your number down (oh-oh, oh-oh, yeah)
Don't need to put one over
'Cause you're so proud, so proud
You're all talk, sounds, words
