Nearbuy (formerly Groupon India) just got recognised among the first 10 companies in India to successfully engage employees and predict attrition using A.I. in HR. 

3 Challenges Nearbuy faced before Amber:
a) Regular engagement with employees across locations
b) Huge manual effort + Lack of culture reports
c) Loss of employee pulse after month 1 of their joining

3 Key Results after plugging in Amber:
a) Automated entire process of employee interventions
b) Increased CEO productivity + Outsourced cultural audit
c) Helped entire workforce feel heard and valued

Companies like GE, Makemytrip, Airtel, Dominos and more are currently using Amber to help retain top talent while enhancing employee experience.

Amber is a smart A.I. assistant who talks to people in an organisation and enables CEOs and HR leaders to proactively help people who are unhappy or about to leave.

Amber is the only secure chatbot in this world that “asks” relevant questions to learn employee sentiment at crucial milestones in their lifecycle at the company whereas other bots can only “answer” queries.
