Bam Margera: The Tragic Real-Life Story

The Truth Revealed About What Happened To Bam Margera

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74zJi3EfGUQ

Bam Margera is a star and one of the most recognizable faces in the ""Jackass"" crew. However, he had developed a reputation as a hard-drinking, hard-partying wild person over the years. He also experienced multiple physical injuries, mental breakdowns, and the eating disorder bulimia. Well, this is clear that Bam Margera's image of a wild man was hardly a role and if you put all the things that happened to him together, you can see that his life has been far from easy. 
Multiple Physical Injuries
This is obvious that Bam Margera’s line of work requires various horrible injuries and it won’t really surprise anyone. Every time he filmed a new episode of the ""Jackass"", he literally had to risk his health and even life. But people never really thought about what Bam had to go through and how much he suffered. But when Bam Margera sat with 'Maxim' for interview, he revealed some of his absolute worst injuries and struggles. Here's the list of the worst ones: a broken tailbone, nasty faceplants and torn ligaments, broken ribs and feet. Seems like it’s been a lot on his plate. 
But you'd be surprised to know that the worst injury had nothing in common with his ""Jackass"" work. The worst one happened while shooting an episode of MTV's ""Cribs."" Bam had to drive a banana-shaped car in water, but suddenly something went wrong, and he ended up crashing headfirst into water that was far shallower than he had thought. 
""The water was only two feet deep and I totally cracked my head open,"" Bam Margera told the Cleveland Free Times. ""I was in the middle of nowhere. I had to drive an hour to this crappy hospital in rural Pennsylvania. I told the doctor I thought my neck was broken. They took an x-ray and were like, 'It's not broken, so you're good to go.' I said, 'What about the gash in my head.' When the doctor looked at it, he goes 'Oh my God.' That's when I knew I was in trouble.""
Death of the Best Friend
They say that mental pain can be as huge as the physical one and that’s true. It literally broke Bam when his friend and ""Jackass"" and ""Viva La Bam"" co-star Ryan Dunn died in a car crash in 2011. As for the moment, when Bam got call about his friend’s death, Ban shared by saying: ""I was with some friends having the best time ever and ... at 12:30 I just started punching out the windows of the rental van and ripping out the speakers. I don't even know why. I wasn't mad at anything or anybody. And if it was 12.30 there that means it was exactly when he crashed."" He added: “It was the worst phone call I've ever got in my life — waking up to that.” The shock of his friend’s death made Bam addicted because he wanted to escape the reality.
Alcohol Addiction
The things got really ugly for Bam and he even confessed in a 2017 interview with Vice, that he drank on a daily basis for an estimated three years: ""At its worst, I would probably just wake up around 11 AM and instantly start drinking vodka and purple Gatorade,"" Bam Margera said. ""By the end of the night, I would probably have ten pints worth of it."" And the other thing that made him such an addicted to alcohol, was the fact that he began hanging out with rock musicians a lot and it caused drinking alcohol in his routine. 

Obviously, Bam’s life is full of tragedy but now I want to know your opinion about all the things that happened to him. And also I want to know do you think it was fair to fire Bam from ‘Jackass’? Are you going to watch the 4th Jackass film despite all the things happened to Bam Margera? Let me know your opinion in the comments section down below.

""At some time between 4 am to 6 am, Mr Depp contacted me and asked me to come to Penthouse 5, which is the penthouse he owns in the Building adjacent to his principal home in Penthouse 3.

This argument lasted approximately 60 to 90 minutes.""   After claiming the argument got ""louder and more intense"" McGivern said he entered the room and after around 30 minutes Ms Heard threw a can of Red Bull.  McGivern continued: ""After Ms Heard threw the can of Red Bull, I recognized that Ms Heard had access to a variety of other items that she could throw from her position.
