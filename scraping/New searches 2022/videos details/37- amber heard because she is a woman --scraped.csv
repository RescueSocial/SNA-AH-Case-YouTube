First, there is Keith Talent (Jim Sturgess) a small- time crook and dart player always on the lookout for his next scam. Then there’s Guy Clinch (Theo James), an upper class banker who hangs out at Ned’s favorite pub, searching for distraction from his boring life, his spoiled wife, and their monstrous toddler. And, just like a scene from a movie, into their lives walks Nicola Six (Amber Heard), a spectacularly beautiful woman-of-mystery who instantly ensnares all three men with her charms.  Of course, Ned and Keith want to possess her, but Sam sees something else—in Nicola he sees the heroine of the book he so desperately wants to write. Following her, studying her, and watching her become a different woman depending upon which man she is seducing, Sam starts weaving a tale, based on Nicola, or Nicola as he imagines her to be. He also discovers that the reason she lives like there’s no tomorrow, is that she’s fed up with her life and has secretly been plotting her own murder.  Now that Sam knows the climax of his story, the only question is who will the murderer be? Is it Keith, the criminal, Guy, the millionaire, or is it Sam himself—a dying man practicing a dying art, who will do anything to end his book—and his life—with a big bang?

Based on the acclaimed international best-seller by Martin Amis, London Fields is a tantalizing, ultra-modern murder mystery about a murder that hasn’t taken place yet, a darkly comic vision of a world on the brink of collapse in which every character--and society itself--has a rendezvous with death. 

Directed by Mathew Cullen.

Starring Amber Heard, Billy Bob Thornton, Jim Sturgess, Theo James, Cara Delevingne.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

Dave Morales sits down with director Tom Hooper, Matthias Schoenaerts and Amber Heard to take you backstage with THE DANISH GIRL.

Synopsis:

The Danish Girl is the remarkable love story inspired by the lives of Lili Elbe and Gerda Wegener, portrayed in the film respectively by Academy Award winner Eddie Redmayne (The Theory of Everything) and Alicia Vikander (Ex Machina), directed by Academy Award winner Tom Hooper (The King’s Speech, Les Misérables).

In 1926 in Copenhagen, artist Einar Wegener is married to Gerda Wegener and is revered for landscape paintings. Gerda is also an artist, less renowned but steadily working as a portraitist of prominent citizens. Theirs is a strong and loving marriage, yet personal and professional epiphanies have eluded them both.

That all begins to change one day when, on deadline for a portrait, Gerda asks her husband to fill in for a model by putting on a dress so that she can finish the painting. The experience is transformative, as Einar soon realizes that being Lili is an expression of her truest self, and she begins living her life as a woman. Gerda unexpectedly finds that she has a new muse, and renewed creative ferment. But the couple soon brush up against society’s disapproval.

They leave their homeland for the more open-minded world of Paris. There, it is Gerda’s career that continues to flourish. The couple’s marriage evolves – and not without strain. But again and again Gerda supports Lili during her journey as a transgender woman. Through the other, each of them finds the courage to be who they are at heart.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YX4BocRASkc/default.jpg,120,90,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YX4BocRASkc/mqdefault.jpg,320,180,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YX4BocRASkc/hqdefault.jpg,480,360,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YX4BocRASkc/sddefault.jpg,640.0,480.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YX4BocRASkc/maxresdefault.jpg,1280.0,720.0,BackstageOL,"['Tom Hooper', 'Matthias Schoenaerts', 'Amber Heard', 'The Danish Girl', 'Eddie Redmayne', 'Alicia Vikander']",24,none,"THE DANISH GIRL: Backstage with Matthias Schoenaerts, Amber Heard & Tom Hooper","Subscribe to YouTube! ► http://ow.ly/LC9yE
