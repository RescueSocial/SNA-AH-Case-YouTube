amber claimed that johnny had been terrible with her at various points in their relationship. because of these allegations, news publisher the sun called johnny a very bad name, and a term that obviously offended johnny because he stays true to his statement that he never hurts anyone. johnny filed a libel case against the news company but unfortunately, he lost on this one. but aside from this, another incident also ignited the feud between the former couple, when amber heard wrote an op-ed article in the washington post, where she claimed to be a victim of domestic maltreatment. the article was entitled “i spoke up – and faced our culture's wrath. that has to change.”  in the op-ed, she explained that she was maltreated, and she spoke about the treatment of women in the same domestic cases. apart from this, she also became the face of the women empowerment movement, which many fans thought was the wrong place for amber to publicly raise her case. for starters, she never really had a legitimate proof that she was hurt by johnny depp, and he even had evidence against her that she was stating her facts the other way. these sets of evidence include the phone call that johnny made with amber, where she admitted hitting johnny. and the list goes on, including the alleged affairs of amber with actor james franco and multi-billionaire elon musk, and the missing donations to charity that amber claimed she would make after her $7 million dollar divorce settlement with johnny. despite not involving johnny’s name on her statement, johnny’s team felt that it was pertaining to him, having recently filed a complaint against him and, well, technically they just got out of their failed relationship.  so, triggered by this, johnny filed for a $50 million dollar defamation lawsuit against amber heard. this lawsuit is still ongoing to this day, and the latest trial will be held in court by july of 2021. however, amber had recently tried to dismiss this case for the second time, bringing up the lost libel case with the sun as her back up defense. but, aside from millions of fans who support johnny on this feat, countless friends, family, former lovers, colleagues, and other celebrities have stood up to defend johnny against his ex wife. who are they? and what lies did amber say that they claimed to be false? let’s find out in this video, but first, make sure to hit that subscribe button and smash that notification bell for more updates. let’s dive in!

it's not been a good time to be amber heard recently, that's for sure. yes, while she is working right now on being mera once again via aquaman and the lost kingdom, and she is a new mother via a surrogate. but, that's about all she has going for her, because her court case with former husband johnny depp has gotten deeper and more infuriating (for her and him both) with every single step it takes. for example, she recently had a bunch of rulings go against her, and now, she's apparently facing the wrath of the fbi. we'll break it down for you. be sure to like the video and subscribe to the channel!

will the johnny depp vs. amber heard saga ever end?! johnny’s $50 million defamation trial against his ex-wife has just been postponed again and is now scheduled for april 11, 2022!
this means we’ll be hearing about this celeb drama for at least another year!
but even though we’ll have to wait for a while to hear the final verdict on who lied about what, the fans have already made up their mind.
even those who used to be team amber are now uniting behind the #justiceforjohnny hashtag and accusing amber of weaving a web of lies to ruin johnny’s career.
so while we wait for the case to wrap up in court, let’s take a look at all the evidence pointing to amber heard lying about johnny being the bad guy.

the case between amber heard and johnny depp is one that people are following all over the world. the anticipation builds day by day while fans of the actors wait for the official court hearing. amber heard is starting to create a pretty bad name for herself, but now might be the time for an offical apology to johnny depp. a lot of other celebrities have been dragged into this mess - one is the tesla billionaire, elon musk (for some interesting reasons). and it does not seem like elon musk is quite done in this case, as depp is not done dealing with him.

amber heard faces 10 years in prison for accusations against johnny depp!!!

https://youtu.be/uvshwtghmts

amber heard and johnny depp have been involved in major legal battles for years now and
it seems that this drama is coming to an end now with new revelations and plot twists. it is
not easy to keep up with johnny and amber's case but what is most important here is that
amber heard is potentially facing jail time.
the court drama made a major plot twist when johnny depp filed a defamation lawsuit
against his ex-wife. he not only claimed that she lied in court, but also that she was abusive
toward him. however, the actors will need to wait even longer to get an official court ruling. if
the court rules in johnny depp’s favor, amber heard could be facing up to three years of jail
time.
basically, amber heard claimed that johnny depp had physically and emotionally abused
her. their original court drama in 2015 resulted in a restraining order against johnny depp,
but that’s also where the blurry lines began. johnny claims that amber had faked her black
eye seen at the court, and amber heard’s stylist corroborated this.
she stated, “throughout the day of december 16, 2015, i could see clearly that amber
heard did not have any visible marks, bruises, cuts, or injuries to her face or any other part
of her body.”
but this was not the only time amber heard lied and was caught lying. why would she do
that all the time? it was her strategy. she wanted to play a victim and she was good at it until
the truth came out. even in 2017 she still managed to convince everyone that in this
situation she suffered from johnny depp's actions against her. amber heard made people
trust her and, moreover, she almost ruined johnny depp’s career, as the publicity called him
a ‘wife beater’ and supported amber and sympathized with her.
while nothing could be proven, amber heard’s accusations against johnny depp were
enough to significantly damage johnny’s reputation and acting career. the story also almost
derailed the latest pirates of the caribbean movie, dead men tell no tales, johnny depp
has faced significant levels of hate and ostracizing over the past five years. but then things
have changed.
the first thing which ruined amber heard's vicious plan was the leaked audio. and since the
audio leak, the internet has already returned to johnny depp's side of the issue. johnny
depp filed a defamation lawsuit against his ex-wife just over a year ago, and amber heard
attempted to get the case dismissed but her request was denied.
johnny depp initially filed the suit to sue amber heard for $50 million. but now it appears
that she could not only be forced to pay the sum, but she could also be facing jail time.
according to the international business times:
“if heard will be proven guilty of faking her bruises, she could face three years of
imprisonment. according to the wallin & klarich law firm, the california penal code section
141 pc stated that it is illegal to alter, modify, plant, place, conceal, manufacture or move
any physical matter with the intention of causing someone to be charged with a crime. some
would face felony charges for this”.
but it doesn’t stop there. amber heard could also be charged with offering false evidence.
these are also considered felony crimes and each carry a maximum sentence of up to three
years.
and again, it doesn’t stop here. more and more evidence has come forward to showcase
that amber heard was the one who abused johnny depp and that she had a strategy of
making people think she was innocent. the number of times amber lied is impressive: she
was caught lying in court (the audio recording situation), she asked or even forced people to
lie for her in court and she stole her assistant’s s*xual assault story and used it as her own.
later it turned out that amber heard has a history of violence.
...
and now i want to know your opinion about this situation. do you think amber heard is
facing jail time? and what’s gonna happen with johnny depp’s career? let me know your
opinion in the comments section down below.

how amber heard destroyed her own career

amber heard’s lawyer exposes her for ruining johnny depp

https://youtu.be/pzr2_v4upgi

amber heard officially fired from aquaman 2 role! (reactions)

https://youtu.be/qbcexsvjbrm

amber heard was extremely successful after divorcing johnny depp: she got cast in the
biggest movie franchise of her career - dc's 'aquaman' - became the spokesperson of
cosmetics giant l'oréal paris, as well as american civil liberties union (aclu) ambassador
for women's rights with a focus on gender-based violence.
so many people even claimed they have never heard about amber until this infamous
divorce: “had no idea who she was until that divorce. i didn’t even know that it was her who
played mara!” - one fan said.
however, the tables have turned and now amber heard is finding that her career as an a-list
hollywood actress might be over. she has reportedly been kicked from aquaman 2 and she
is about to lose the contract with l'oreal paris.
so what was the reason for all of these problematic events for amber heard? apparently,
her well-planned strategy to ruin johnny depp’s life has been shattered. and now no one
believes that amber is an innocent victim as johnny showed in a court undeniable evidence
of amber being an abuser (audio, text messages and so on).
heard lost the appeal to dismiss johnny depp’s $50 million defamation lawsuit and we
learned that the aquaman star could be facing up to 3 years of jail time if found guilty of
manipulating evidence against her then-husband. but even beyond the former couple’s
seemingly never-ending legal battle, heard has come under a lot of fire after evidence
presented to the court as part of the lawsuit revealed that she’s physically and emotionally
harassed depp while twisting the narrative in her favor and painting the pirates of the
caribbean actor as a domestic abuser.
in fact, the petition to remove her from aquaman 2 recently reached a whopping 400,000
signatures and is on its way to passing the half-million threshold. this is essentially the same
kind of backlash and blacklisting that depp had to endure a couple of years ago, so you can
see why fans of the legendary star are asking for justice with such fervency. and now,
according to a new report by cosmic book news, warner bros. has gone forward with firing
heard from aquaman 2 by buying out her contract.
also there was one more petition against amber heard. “a liar and an abuser, a shame for
women,” begins one of two change.org campaigns to remove amber heard, 33, from her
role as global spokesperson for cosmetics brand l’oréal.
and yet, she has claimed in her court declaration countering ex-husband's $50 million
defamation suit against her that her career took a serious hit and she received death threats
that forced her to constantly keep on changing her contact details.
here is what amber declared in her motion to dismiss johnny depp’s lawsuit filed in fairfax
county, virginia circuit court:
""following my highly-publicized separation from johnny, i read accounts in the media
referring to me as a victim of domestic violence. in response, many people called me a liar

(without ever hearing my story). i was dropped from a global fashion brand's upcoming
campaign. i lost a part of a movie in which i had already been cast. people i have never met
or spoken to threatened me with violence. i received so many death threats i had to change
my phone number on a near-weekly basis.”
isn’t it fair that her career might be over with johnny as it started with him?
as reported by meaww earlier, although heard's career in the entertainment industry began
in 2003 when she appeared in two music videos - kenny chesney's 'there goes my life'
and eisley's 'i wasn't prepared,"" and went onto star in an array of tv shows and movies, her
career really took off in 2015 — the same year when she married depp — when she had
prominent roles in four mainstream movies.


now i want to know your opinion. do you think amber heard’s career will be over soon as

Amber Heard’s Lawyer EXPOSES Her For Ruining Johnny Depp

https://youtu.be/pZR2_v4UpgI

Amber Heard Officially FIRED From Aquaman 2 Role! (REACTIONS)

https://youtu.be/QBCEXSVjBrM

Amber Heard was extremely successful after divorcing Johnny Depp: she got cast in the
biggest movie franchise of her career - DC's 'Aquaman' - became the spokesperson of
cosmetics giant L'Oréal Paris, as well as American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) ambassador
for women's rights with a focus on gender-based violence.
So many people even claimed they have never heard about Amber until this infamous
divorce: “Had no idea who she was until that divorce. I didn’t even know that it was her who
played Mara!” - one fan said.
However, the tables have turned and now Amber Heard is finding that her career as an A-list
Hollywood actress might be over. She has reportedly been kicked from Aquaman 2 and she
is about to lose the contract with L'oreal Paris.
So what was the reason for all of these problematic events for Amber Heard? Apparently,
her well-planned strategy to ruin Johnny Depp’s life has been shattered. And now no one
believes that Amber is an innocent victim as Johnny showed in a court undeniable evidence
of Amber being an abuser (audio, text messages and so on).
Heard lost the appeal to dismiss Johnny Depp’s $50 million defamation lawsuit and we
learned that the Aquaman star could be facing up to 3 years of jail time if found guilty of
manipulating evidence against her then-husband. But even beyond the former couple’s
seemingly never-ending legal battle, Heard has come under a lot of fire after evidence
presented to the court as part of the lawsuit revealed that she’s physically and emotionally
harassed Depp while twisting the narrative in her favor and painting the Pirates of the
Caribbean actor as a domestic abuser.
In fact, the petition to remove her from Aquaman 2 recently reached a whopping 400,000
signatures and is on its way to passing the half-million threshold. This is essentially the same
kind of backlash and blacklisting that Depp had to endure a couple of years ago, so you can
see why fans of the legendary star are asking for justice with such fervency. And now,
according to a new report by Cosmic Book News, Warner Bros. has gone forward with firing
Heard from Aquaman 2 by buying out her contract.
Also there was one more petition against Amber Heard. “A liar and an abuser, a shame for
women,” begins one of two Change.org campaigns to remove Amber Heard, 33, from her
role as global spokesperson for cosmetics brand L’Oréal.
And yet, she has claimed in her court declaration countering ex-husband's $50 million
defamation suit against her that her career took a serious hit and she received death threats
that forced her to constantly keep on changing her contact details.
Here is what Amber declared in her motion to dismiss Johnny Depp’s lawsuit filed in Fairfax
County, Virginia Circuit Court:
""Following my highly-publicized separation from Johnny, I read accounts in the media
referring to me as a victim of domestic violence. In response, many people called me a liar

(without ever hearing my story). I was dropped from a global fashion brand's upcoming
campaign. I lost a part of a movie in which I had already been cast. People I have never met
or spoken to threatened me with violence. I received so many death threats I had to change
my phone number on a near-weekly basis.”
Isn’t it fair that her career might be over with Johnny as it started with him?
As reported by MEAWW earlier, although Heard's career in the entertainment industry began
in 2003 when she appeared in two music videos - Kenny Chesney's 'There Goes My Life'
and Eisley's 'I Wasn't Prepared,"" and went onto star in an array of TV shows and movies, her
career really took off in 2015 — the same year when she married Depp — when she had
prominent roles in four mainstream movies.


Now I want to know your opinion. Do you think Amber Heard’s career will be over soon as
she destroyed it on her own? Let me know what you think in the comments section down

did johnny depp just defeat amber heard?
good news for johnny depp fans: the actor is one step closer to winning the high-profile defamation case against ex-wife amber heard and he’s now determined to prove that amber lied when she accused him of domestic violence in her infamous 2018 washington post op-ed.

however, we’re also hearing that johnny is afraid that hollywood has already blacklisted him and that his career may never recover.
so what’s going on with johnny and amber’s legal battle? will johnny finally be able to prove his innocence? and if he does, will hollywood welcome him back?

it’s been a while since we heard any updates on johnny depp and amber heard’s messy court battle but that doesn’t mean the drama between the former spouses is over.
in fact, the already messy divorce saga has just gotten even messier after johnny scored a rare legal victory over amber.

this video was mainly to show the depositions and evidence side by side, to expose the truth while also keeping a proper timeline of what happened since 2016. keep in mind it doesn't include all the evidence johnny depp has. there's just too much for one video.

https://youtu.be/iak80fpywha


amber heard has zero chances of making people believe her she was a victim. now, the tables have turned and recently amber heard failed big time! l’oreal paris invited amber heard to model for the le defile l'oreal paris womenswear spring/summer 2022 on paris fashion week. but johnny depp’s fans were not happy to see her there so they booed her!
the annual paris fashion week is back and better than ever as the designer presentations hit the streets of paris. the event began on september 28 and closed on october 6. this event is always amazing, glamorous and so many fashionistas and influencers are looking forward to it. as always, the iconic fashion event continued to host an array of famous faces dressed to impress in their best attires. from oscar-winning actress helen mirren to the most recent cinderella, camilla cabello, the event had a seat for everybody at its table. but there was someone who was not really wanted to be seen… everywhere. yes, that’s amber heard who we are talking about.
ever since amber heard began her vicious johnny depp career ruining plan, people all over the world want her to be sued, punished and closed in prison. she literally ruined johnny depp’s life and career and many people think that’s unfair that someone like amber heard keeps on getting roles, having fun and being invited to really special events like paris fashion week.
just before showing up at such a huge event, amber heard took to twitter and shared a photo of herself getting her hair and makeup done as the cosmetics and skincare giant l’oréal paris celebrates the 50th anniversary of its slogan ""because you’re worth it."" in the photo, portions of amber heard's blonde hair are wrapped around brushes as a team of hairstylists blow-dries her tresses.
""it takes an army (of hair brushes). bts from @lorealparisusa @loreal lorealparis 50yearsofworth worthit,"" amber heard captioned the photo, without mentioning when the image was taken. and guess what, amber heard was mocked by some twitter users just for posting this photo! 
someone accused her of sharing sharing a pic from 2019, posting side-by-side images of the actress before and after getting ready. ""not amber heard posting backstage photos from sep 2019 w/l’oreal to make it seem like she is relevant and working in 2021. girl, your jewelry told on you,"" the person wrote. but the person was absolutely wrong…
in a follow-up post, amber heard shared a video of herself talking about the famous l'oréal tagline. ""50 years of worth is an anthem of action,"" she says in the clip. ""it's an anthem of our power, our importance, our value, and a reminder that it's worth fighting for."" and of course, this one was also attacked by mulriple johnny depp’s fans.
but what about amber heard’s appearance on paris fashion week? well, her appearance on the most amazing event of the fall in europe has left fans raging. amber heard hit the runway on october 3, alongside mirren for “le defile l’oreal paris womenswear spring/summer 2022."" amber heard wore a baby pink jumpsuit with feathered slitted sleeves and a deep neckline, complete with floaty drape details stemming from the waist. yes, let’s be honest, she looked good! but despite the fact that she looked good, fans were there not to estimate her looks. 
while the actress rocked the runway, many were left wondering how she had been allowed to attend in the first place. well, it is well-known that amber heard has been l’oréal paris face and ambassador for a while now. and people are said to be disappointed that amber heard remains a spokesperson for beauty brand l'oreal. she was among the brand representatives who walked the runway on sunday. and it’s not the first time when l’oreal paris shows their support to amber heard. when it became clear that amber heard was the one, who abused, l’oréal paris posted a picture of heard as part of their womenmakecinema series. and the company described amber heard as an actress who “highlights that a woman’s inner beauty is what we should value the most.”
but many fans / followers of l’oréal’s page were quick to point out the absurdity of supporting an abuser, let alone to portray her as an empowering role model for women. and fans even went that far so they called for a boycott to the brand, threatening to never buy l’oréal (or their affiliate brand, maybelline) again.

the ongoing court battle between johnny depp and amber heard is unlike any other case seen before, mostly because of how long it has continued on for. the case has caught the attention of so many around the world that a new documentary from discovery+ has set to air, telling the story of johnny depp and amber heard's relationship and subsequent breakdown, according to deadline. some seem to believe that the case has been followed by so many because of the fact that it still has not been entirely settled, as their court date got pushed back for various reasons. and it seems to be that the further the case gets pushed back, the more evidence is being revealed. allow us to break it all down for you but first be sure to like the video and subscribe to the channel below.

The ongoing court battle between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard is unlike any other case seen before, mostly because of how long it has continued on for. The case has caught the attention of so many around the world that a new documentary from Discovery+ has set to air, telling the story of Johnny Depp and Amber Heard's relationship and subsequent breakdown, according to Deadline. Some seem to believe that the case has been followed by so many because of the fact that it still has not been entirely settled, as their court date got pushed back for various reasons. And it seems to be that the further the case gets pushed back, the more evidence is being revealed.

since then several celebrities have chimed in with their statements supporting johnny and accused amber of being a liar and even some celebrities that supported amber have switched sides to johnny and apologized for taking her side in the first place! which begs the question, who were these celebrities and what did they say to defend amber which they are now sorry for?

celebrity breakups are a common occurrence, but the situation between johnny depp and his now ex-wife amber heard was messy to say the least. there have been some heavy accusations, and amber was quick to label her ex “mr. monster.” but was using her divorce settlement to make a huge charity donation really a noble act or is this star not what she appears to be? we’ll talk about the true story of this couple who met on the set of the rum diary and seemed to be head over heels in love. in addition to the defamation lawsuit, she’s also gone to court over the movie london fields and the surprising charge of. . .dog smuggling? new evidence has emerged in the form of a 911 call but instead of answering our many questions it’s just raised more of them since each celeb insists it corroborates their side of the story. johnny depp has no shortage of support from his family and ex-partners, including fellow star winona ryder, who has nothing but good things to say about her former boyfriend and co-star. 

they say there are three sides to every story: each person’s perspective and the truth. what do you think is really going on here and do you think either of these celebs deserved to be cancelled due to their actions? let us know what you think about this situation in the comment section below and don’t forget to click on the subscribe button for more videos from us here at the talko.

There have been some heavy accusations, and Amber was quick to label her ex “Mr. Monster.” But was using her divorce settlement to make a huge charity donation really a noble act or is this star not what she appears to be? We’ll talk about the true story of this couple who met on the set of The Rum Diary and seemed to be head over heels in love. In addition to the defamation lawsuit, she’s also gone to court over the movie London Fields and the surprising charge of. . .dog smuggling? New evidence has emerged in the form of a 911 call but instead of answering our many questions it’s just raised more of them since each celeb insists it corroborates their side of the story. Johnny Depp has no shortage of support from his family and ex-partners, including fellow star Winona Ryder, who has nothing but good things to say about her former boyfriend and co-star. 

They say there are three sides to every story: each person’s perspective and the truth. What do you think is really going on here and do you think either of these celebs deserved to be cancelled due to their actions?

amber heard’s lawyer quits & exposes amber for ruining johnny depp!?

https://youtu.be/neybc2ie2mu

body language analyst reacts to amber heard's cringe deposition | faces episode 15

https://youtu.be/hqffm_x2lps

johnny depp and amber heard have been battling in court over the validity of
her accusations of domestic violence. however, this story took an even juicier
side when amber heard's friends started supporting johnny depp and testifying
against amber heard.
make sure you stay till the end to see which amber heard’s friends sided with
johnny depp and what they have to say about amber.
despite the fact that amber heard’s vicious plan to ruin johnny depp’s career
was pretty successful lately, it seems like right now the tables have turned. as
you may already know, there have been several times when amber heard was
caught lying or using other people to stay in the driver's seat in this case. she
allegedly bribed her own sister, and used her assistant’s s*xual assault story.
basically, things got very dirty and it seems like her fans, friends and some
other people don’t want to be linked to the perfect liar.
so, let’s start with twitter and some fans’ thoughts on amber heard’s lies.
when amber heard said it out loud that johnny depp was an ab*ser and even
showed bruises, fans couldn’t help but bombarded amber with tweets and
comments. among the twitter users was adam waldman - a former member of
johnny's legal team - who tweeted a picture of the actress as he tried to discount
her allegations against her ex-husband.
alongside the images he wrote: “12/15/15 allegation 'i had bruised ribs. bruises
all over my body, bruises on my forearms from trying to defend the blows. i had
2 black eyes. i had a broken nose. i had a broken lip. justice nichols - i believe
her. uk appeals court - we believe him. but oops ... photo shoot!”
responding to the post, the actress said: “yes mr waldman, i may be wearing
makeup on this occasion but on every occasion you will still be short.”
then another twitter user commented, “i'd rather be short than an abusive gold
digger woman shrugging”, amber hit back, “it's good to be realistic with your
goals”. then, there was another tweet, written in spanish that read, “amber
heard talking to johnny deep's lawyer regarding a set of photos where she
claims she was made wearing makeup to cover hit marks, a broken nostril,

bruises and more made by johnny...but...”, the actress replied, “and so?” looks
like amber heard is having fun and doesn't care what people say about her.
amber heard could expect such a reaction from people and, probably, that is
why she is so calm and confident. but what she did not expect was that her
friends sided with johnny depp. you have to wonder who and why betrayed
amber heard, and we are going to break it down for you in a minute.
amber heard was shocked when laura divenere (interior decorator to the stars)
and amber’s former friend testified against her. laura divenere worked for
johnny depp and amber heard as their interior decorator in downtown la in
the eastern columbia building from july 2014 to sometime in 2016. and after
the pair splitted up laura continued to work for amber. she explains, ""i have
been and continue to consider myself a friend of amber's. i remain in regular
contact with amber. i have not communicated with mr. depp since 2016."" it is
an interesting ally in this case for johnny depp as she is the first person in the
case to identify as a friend of amber heard's but give testimony in support of
johnny.

plus i want to know your opinion about amber heard’s friends taking johnny
depp’s side. do you think they just don’t want to be linked to amber heard
because she is a liar? let me know your opinion in the comments section down
below. thanks for watching this video and don’t forget to hit that subscribe

Hurls Wine Glass | TMZ,"Johnny Depp went crazy on Amber Heard in their kitchen, throwing a wine bottle and glass ... and she videotaped it. 
We're told the video was shot months before the May 21 incident in which Amber claims Johnny struck her.
Amber asks Johnny if he drank a bottle of wine and tries to calm him down. She says she was sorry for something although she was not specific.   
Johnny isn't having it, and appears out of control. After throwing the glass and bottle, you see him swiping at Amber's phone ... trying to get it from her.

the lies amber heard’s perpetrated in court

intro:  a relationship that started as a romantic and endearing relationship quickly turned violent and messy. from being hollywood's favorite couple to being one of the worst and most toxic couples to be in the spotlight. the pair are still at it with their ongoing court battles and lawsuits and we are about to witness amber’s behavior towards most of it. 

but before we head on to the video, please don’t forget to hit the like button! and if you’re new here, do smash the subscribe button down below to see more from our channel! now on to the story:

amber heard and johnny depp are inarguably some of the most recognizable faces in hollywood today – and they’ve gotten even more recognizable and notable in recent years though it’s all for the wrong reasons. but to keep you guys in the loop, here’s a refresher of how a seemingly promising relationship went downhill after just one year of being married to each other. “working with johnny was torture. it was better than i ever imagined, which is really saying something,” she told vogue magazine once. they didn’t quite hit it off just yet as johnny was still in a tight-knit, 14-year relationship with vanessa paradis with which he has also shared two children. moreover, amber was also dating her former partner at the time, taysa van ree. but it wasn’t until 2012 that the two would eventually decide to break up with who they were with and start a new relationship altogether.

it is worth mentioning though that prior to dating, amber had been arrested in 2009 on the charge of physically assaulting van ree in washington. so, i guess johnny always had the red flags? who knows? but anyway, it wasn’t long until they were dubbed as the new it-couple of hollywood. they eventually tied the knot in 2015 in a private ceremony held in their la home. people were even wishing to have the same kind of relationship they had shown everyone that time.  but little did we know that there was more dark stuff happening in the background than what we’ve been led on to believe. 

but as mentioned, one year into the relationship, all hell broke loose and amber eventually filed for divorce from johnny and stated that she had been physically and emotionally abused by the “pirates of the caribbean” actor. everything came crashing down for both parties where speculations and assertions were made especially on depp. under many deliberations against him, she claims johnny threw a phone at her face that caused bruises. meanwhile, johnny completely and consistently denies all assertions regarding physical abuse. apparently, after investigations were made it was proven that her claims were false and that the photos of her bruises were all made up. moreover, the actress also claimed mental abuse on johnny’s part saying he was using his sexes to cause her pain and suffering. however, johnny’s exes denied all of this and even went on to come into his defense. “the idea that he is an incredibly violent person is the farthest thing from the johnny i knew and loved. i cannot wrap my head around these accusations,” winona ryder narrated.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4W_mVEK9uZU/default.jpg,120,90,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4W_mVEK9uZU/mqdefault.jpg,320,180,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4W_mVEK9uZU/hqdefault.jpg,480,360,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4W_mVEK9uZU/sddefault.jpg,640.0,480.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4W_mVEK9uZU/maxresdefault.jpg,1280.0,720.0,Celebrity Zone,"['celebrity zone', 'celebrityzone', 'celebrity', 'amber heard', 'johnny depp', 'amber heard johnny depp', 'johnny depp amber heard', 'amber heard and johnny depp', 'amber heard aquaman', 'amber heard aquaman 2', 'amber heard fired', 'amber heard loses in court', 'johnny depp amber heard audio reaction', 'amber heard johnny depp fight video', 'amber heard interview', 'amber heard interviews', 'amber heard loses', 'amber heard elon musk', 'amber heard johnny depp court', 'amber heard in court']",22,none,"""Shut Your Mouth!""

in may of 2016, actress amber heard  accused her husband johnny depp of hitting her with a phone and assaulting her. she posted pictures of injuries to her face and filed for divorce.
however, a leaked audio about their abuse and divorce  chronicle made some questions and shocking revelations.and the most significant question is that whether amber heard is a pathological liar.johnny depp is holding on these facts and wants to prove to the court that amber is a pathological liar.johnny depp wants to prove that amber submitted a fake hair to court.in amber’s court filing,  part of her statement wrote.  “hoping to avoid the violence, i tried to calm johnny down.” “and then i went upstairs to try to remove myself from the situation.”
“johnny followed me, hit me in the back of my head.”  “grabbed me by my hair again.”
 “got in front of me on the steps, and then dragged me by my hair up the last few steps.” 
depp tells a much different version of the same story in his declaration, with the building manager kevin murphy confirming some of the claims.  murphy  testified that, “heard’s face was utterly uninjured and unmarked.” “she appeared to be makeup free, as they spoke face to face.”
“she is  in good light the day after she alleged the brutal attack.” he also stated that heard showed him the clump of hair on the floor but not the place that hair was pulled from. then, upon viewing the hair image submitted to the court versus the one he saw, and photographed, murphy said that he believed they were different clumps of hair. johnny wants to prove that he didn’t cut off his own finger as amber claims. according to amber's version of the event. johnny, who was drunk and high on ecstasy, smashed several bottles and windows.  he also slammed a plastic phone against the wall unit.  she claims a piece of one of the items cut off a portion of the middle finger on his right hand. amber's version goes on ... she's a painter and had dark blue paint in the room.  she claims johnny dipped what remained of his forefinger in the paint. and then he used the gnarly digit to write various words on a mirror.  it includes ""billy bob"" and ""easy amber.""
amber had done a movie with billy bob thornton and she claims johnny accused the 2 of sleeping together. it is something she strongly denied. she added that he accused her of infidelity with other men as well. amber's people say johnny didn't get medical help for nearly 24 hours. the doctors could not reattach the fingertip. she said they used a flap from his hand to sew on a new tip.
however, this is johnny depp’s  story. he said  that he nearly lost his life to mrsa after she threw a bottle of vodka at him and severed his finger.  depp claims he severed his finger back in 2015 not because he was partying with friends.  he also claims he had to undergo multiple surgeries as a result of this attack. “while i was in australia filming a movie approximately one month after i married ms. heard.” “on a day where my then-lawyer tried to discuss with ms. heard the need that she sign a post-nuptial agreement with me.”  “she went berserk and began throwing bottles at me.”
“the projectile’s impact shattered the bone in my finger and entirely severed the tip of my finger.”
a photo submitted with the filing show's just how severe the injury was.  depp is clearly missing a large chunk of his finger.  “i had to have 3 surgeries to reconstruct my finger and contracted mrsa three times.”  “i feared that i would lose my finger, my arm, and my life,” states depp in his declaration. johnny wants to prove that he didn’t hit her so bad that the bed broke.
heard had claimed on december 15, 2015  that her ex-husband beat her up so badly that the actor was so violent that he ""broke the bed in the process.""  however, after the incident, multiple witnesses said that they saw amber in good light the day after the alleged brutal attack. johnny wants to prove that  she lied by calling a lesbian police officer a “homophobic”. amber heard's ex-girlfriend tasya van ree has claimed the officers who arrested her for domestic violence appeared to be ""homophobic"". but that doesn't seem to be the case. the star's former lover said the incident in 2009 was ""misinterpreted and over-sensationalized by two individuals in a powerful position.” however, there were reports that arresting officer beverly leonard is actually gay woman.
she has proudly posted pictures with her partner on facebook a few years ago. as well as appearing at pride weekend in the past.

She has proudly posted pictures with her partner on Facebook a few years ago. As well as appearing at Pride weekend in the past.

amber heard furious at johnny depp calling her out on live tv - vows to get revenge | the gossipy

https://youtu.be/4uwjyxz_zi8


it is a pattern. every time johnny depp speaks at any public event, amber heard posts something on her social media. this time response from amber heard came only a few hours after johnny depp had decried ‘cancel culture’ before receiving san sebastian’s top prize. was it a coincidence? or amber heard can’t stand the idea that jd is still loved by millions of people?
it seems like johnny depp and amber heard’s legal battle has taken another place to fight each other. not in a court, but in real life and on social media. and amber heard is yet again the one who attacks jd for no reason! 
on september 22 johnny depp was invited to the san sebastian film festival to receive a donostia award. it is great to know that although the entire hollywood is boycotting him, johnny still manages to get some awards during such difficult times! to list all the awards and nominations johnny depp has received in the past, we need to create another video, so let me just mention that he is a living legend!
his career started at the age of 21 as one of freddy krueger’s victims in a nightmare on elm street (1984), and over the years, a relationship with the audience crystallized in the early 90s with his lead roles in multiple movies. but his biggest role ever is undoubtedly, a captain jack sparrow! there’s no person alive who doesn’t like this crazy and funny captain! johnny depp has played writers, undercover cops or outlaws, almost always misfits, and he has actually starred with the most famous actors ever! like penélope cruz, kate winslet, morgan freeman, michelle pfeiffer, leonardo di caprio, angelina jolie, and many, many others! but now… even for all his merits and roles, his life has unpredictably changed, due to the legal fight with his ex-wife amber heard and hollywood took the position of boycotting the actor, because he was slandered and called a ‘wife beater’.
you all already know this story, so we won’t be repeating it again, so let’s jump straight to the latest updates on jd’s life and career. it's been the third time johnny depp visited the festival following his fleeting appearance in 1998 with terry gilliam, and his visit in 2020 for the participation of crock of gold: a few rounds with shane macgowan. every time jd appears on public events, he makes his fans crazy about him, and this time around his speech literally left the crowd stunned. 
after he took the stage and the audience greeted him with a thunderous ovation, johnny began his speech talking about his battered reputation and condemned cancel culture amid his ongoing legal woes with his ex-wife, amber heard. due to the fact that hollywood is currently boycotting him, johnny depp said that ‘no one is safe’ and stated: “it can be seen as an event in history that lasted for however long it lasted, this cancel culture, this instant rush to judgment based on what essentially amounts to polluted air”.
trailing off again while, presumably, looking for the right words, he shifted a bit, expressing that in his opinion, “it’s so far out of hand now that i can promise you that no one is safe. not one of you. no one out that door. no one is safe.” “it takes one sentence and there’s no more ground, the carpet has been pulled. it’s not just me that this has happened to, it’s happened to a lot of people.”
“this type of thing has happened to women, men. children have suffered from various types of unpleasantries. sadly, at a certain point they begin to think that it’s normal. or that it’s them. when it’s not.”
“i believe that if you are armed with the truth, then that’s all you need,” he continued. “it doesn’t matter if a judgement…has taken some artistic license,” he chuckled, perhaps referencing his unsuccessful bid to overturn a judge’s ruling in his u.k. libel case.

the tale of amber heard continues to get more and more curious as time goes on. because she is in a war in court with her ex-husband johnny depp and it doesn't look to be getting any simpler as time goes on. not the least of which is new evidence and more proof of her being a bad person coming to light. but she's holding fast and trying to keep going in the roles that she does have. which right now includes mera in the dceu, which will continue via aquaman 2. but a very familiar ""call to arms"" is happening that might just shut that down. we'll break it down for you. be sure to like the video and subscribe to the channel!

The tale of Amber Heard continues to get more and more curious as time goes on. Because she is in a war in court with her ex-husband Johnny Depp and it doesn't look to be getting any simpler as time goes on. Not the least of which is new evidence and more proof of her being a bad person coming to light. But she's holding fast and trying to keep going in the roles that she does have. Which right now includes Mera in the DCEU, which will continue via Aquaman 2. But a very familiar ""call to arms"" is happening that might just shut that down. We'll break it down for you.

when it comes to being a person in hollywood, you always want to go and get that ""dream role"" that can elevate you to new heights. but, ask any major actor and they'll tell you that it's not just important to get that dream role, but to keep getting those kinds of roles as they'll prove just how good you are and show your range as an actor. for amber heard, she's had that ""dream role"" via mera in aquaman, but in terms of proving herself in other films...not as much. and apparently a new indie film she's in isn't doing her any favors. we'll break it down for you.

ever since the johnny depp and amber heard scandal began, fans have been taking sides and choosing who they want to support in the legal battles. at first, everyone was on ambers side, supporting her story but now it seems the tables have turned.

fans of johnny have started a change.org petition to have amber heard removed from her role as mera in aquaman 2 and over 1.8 million people have signed the petition and the number just keeps rising! however, after the pandemic started last year, many movies and releases have been postponed and filmings have been rescheduled due to their inability to play in theaters, comic book movies were particularly impacted by this. but it seems that things are looking better in 2021 and movies will go back to resume filming and appear in theaters this year. which begs the question, who will play ""mera"" in aquaman? will amber continue her role, or will she be replaced by someone else?

johnny depp and amber heard were big names of the industry back when they met each other on the sets shooting for “the rum diary “ back in 2011. johnny depp, also lovingly known as the jack sparrow for his impeccable acting in pirates of the caribbean, was 47 and amber was 25 when they fell for each other. depp, being married to vanessa paradis, with whom he had two children, announced his separation from her in 2012. also heard was also known to split up with her partner tasya at the same time. rumors about a budding relationship between depp and amber were speculated around which were intensified after heard had posted an engagement ring on one of her social media accounts. 

in may 2016, amber heard filed for divorce from johnny depp. she alleged that depp used to physically abuse her during their relationship. she also quoted that during such an incident, depp had thrown his phone at her face, leaving severe bruises. he was also alleged to smash things all around the place in their apartment that night. there were negotiations and finally they reached a $7 million settlement as heard withdrew her domestic violence accusation. later, according to heard, she donated the money to charity as she wasn’t comfortable with it, holding the money of a domestic abuser. 

they simply said that throughout their relationships, depp has never been violent with them. depp claimed that heard was having an affair with elon musk also at the same time. depp has also alleged that heard hit him which she denied. heard, in response, said that she had received death warnings from depp several times. the trial continued in many hearings. depp was denied to appeal against the ruling two times in a row. during the evidence given at the application hearing, depp's team said that they had not received a fair trial and presented ""fresh evidence"" that alleged heard lied about donating her full $7 million divorce settlement to charity. depp's team andrew caldecott told the that heard's claim about the donation was a lie that ""tipped the scales against mr. depp from the very beginning,""

depp’s team claim that the false depictions of rampage which included red wine splashed over the place, a huge mess of broken glasses, and shabby walls of the penthouse are completely opposite to what the police quote. that night 4 lapd officers visited the couple’s royal penthouse when heard’s friends mistakenly dialed 911 twice within a span of two hours. the first officers who reported at the spot within 15 minutes of the assault were tyler hadden and melissa saenz. melissa saenz is a domestic violence expert. 

asked by depp's attorney, if she remembered spotting anything resembling the damage depicted in heard's photos during her inspection, melissa confidently replied: 'i did not.'hadden was of the same opinion as melissa regarding the incident.

despite one of heard’s friends claiming to have cleaned the place between the two police visits but he was quite sure that there was a big stain of the wine in the hallway. depp’s team says that it is impossible that two sets of cops can miss the large red wine stains and abides by his saying that heard has been lying throughout.
with heard and her partners having multiple times referred to this incident and tipping the judgment of the in their favor, this simply seems to be manipulating the with lies and false witnesses after seeing the clip. 

this controversy has dented depp’s image in the industry, he has already lost his role in the movie ‘fantastic beasts 3”. he also has to pay a hefty price to the ones he is fighting against after the jury decided against him in . but surely this news is important in the context of the case. this can change the outcome of the case as heard can be easily accused of misleading the case and falsely accusing depp of abuse. this case is getting more and more intense with time. me too movement

amber heard has been in the news so much this year. a lot of the controversy she’s been involved in has to do with her involvement with johnny depp’s libel case against the sun publication. this year she's gotten a lot of media attention and we saw a lot of dirt come out that painted a very different picture than what we previously interpreted of their marriage, but this isn't the only picture that faced a lot of backlashes.

Amber Heard has been in the news so much this year. A lot of the controversy she’s been involved in has to do with her involvement with Johnny Depp’s libel case against the Sun Publication. This year she's gotten a lot of media attention and we saw a lot of dirt come out that painted a very different picture than what we previously interpreted of their marriage, but this isn't the only picture that faced a lot of backlashes.

nang ngumiti ang langit: august 26-28 episode (with english subtitles)

fed up with his father's harsh remarks toward james (enzo pineda), michael (rk bagatsing) gives elizabeth's (tetchie agbayani) final letter to david (dante rivero). meanwhile, atty. sandejas (nina ricci alagao) informs divina (pilar pilapil) that grace (shaina magdayao) is the witness they are looking for. because of this, divina comes up with a wicked plan against the nurse. grace, on the other hand, tells ruth what she knows about lloyd (carlos morales). later, michael discovers the person who tampered with his paternity test with amber (krystal mejes).

katrina (cristine reyes) remains adamant on staying at michael's (rk bagatsing) home. she orders her men to get rid of grace (shaina magdayao) while grace tries to find stronger evidence of the tampered paternity test. sensing katrina's devious intentions, ruth (matet de leon) urges michael to protect grace. barbie (moi bien), meanwhile, discovers shocking information on the attack she suffered at her boss' old house. elsewhere, benjie (keempee de leon) finds a way to distract the children from the chaos at their home.

enraged over michael's (rk bagatsing)'s decision, katrina (cristine reyes) forces her daughters to pack their stuff. despite britney's (heart ramos) pleas, she drags her daughters along as she leaves michael's home for good. amber (krystal mejes), on the other hand, is outraged upon confirming katrina's lie. meanwhile, divina (pilar pilapil) hatches up a plan that will put david (dante rivero) behind bars. later, amber lashes out on britney for wishing to return to mikmik's (sophia reola) side.

Nang Ngumiti Ang Langit: August 26-28 Episode (With English Subtitles)

Fed up with his father's harsh remarks toward James (Enzo Pineda), Michael (RK Bagatsing) gives Elizabeth's (Tetchie Agbayani) final letter to David (Dante Rivero). Meanwhile, Atty. Sandejas (Nina Ricci Alagao) informs Divina (Pilar Pilapil) that Grace (Shaina Magdayao) is the witness they are looking for. Because of this, Divina comes up with a wicked plan against the nurse. Grace, on the other hand, tells Ruth what she knows about Lloyd (Carlos Morales). Later, Michael discovers the person who tampered with his paternity test with Amber (Krystal Mejes).

Katrina (Cristine Reyes) remains adamant on staying at Michael's (RK Bagatsing) home. She orders her men to get rid of Grace (Shaina Magdayao) while Grace tries to find stronger evidence of the tampered paternity test. Sensing Katrina's devious intentions, Ruth (Matet de Leon) urges Michael to protect Grace. Barbie (Moi Bien), meanwhile, discovers shocking information on the attack she suffered at her boss' old house. Elsewhere, Benjie (Keempee de Leon) finds a way to distract the children from the chaos at their home.

Enraged over Michael's (RK Bagatsing)'s decision, Katrina (Cristine Reyes) forces her daughters to pack their stuff. Despite Britney's (Heart Ramos) pleas, she drags her daughters along as she leaves Michael's home for good. Amber (Krystal Mejes), on the other hand, is outraged upon confirming Katrina's lie. Meanwhile, Divina (Pilar Pilapil) hatches up a plan that will put David (Dante Rivero) behind bars. Later, Amber lashes out on Britney for wishing to return to Mikmik's (Sophia Reola) side.
