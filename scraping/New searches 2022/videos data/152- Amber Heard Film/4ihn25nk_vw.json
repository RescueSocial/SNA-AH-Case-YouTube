            "description": "(25 Apr 2018) JASON MOMOA AND AMBER HEARD LAUNCH THE LATEST MOVIE IN THE DC UNIVERSE, 'AQUAMAN'\r\nJason Momoa and Amber Heard made a splash at CinemaCon in Las Vegas Tuesday (24 APRIL 2018), where they launched the latest DC Universe superhero movie, \"Aquaman.\"\r\nJoining director James Wan at the event, the actors teased the first footage from the upcoming Warner Bros. stand-alone and spoke about their experiences shooting the film. \r\nMomoa \u2013 known to fans of TV's \"Game of Thrones\" as hunky warlord Khal Drogo \u2013 said he could identify with Arthur Curry/Aquaman's origins.\r\n\"Obviously being a Pacific Islander half that, you know, being part Atlantean/part human is something I can identify with,\" he said.\r\nThe star added that \"it was just really cool to be brown and a brown skinned superhero was kind of neat to me for all the kids who, you know, all around the world who can have that and get to have that. So I think in these times it felt really need that Zack (Snyder) came up with that.\"\r\nHeard \u2013 who stars as Mera, a warrior of Atlantis \u2013 said it was great to play a strong female character.\r\n\"She's very much of this moment, which is, you know, people, you know, being fed up with these two-dimensional, passive reactionary female characters,\" she said. \r\n\"I think we're over that as an audience, as a society and you see the changes happening and Mera is very much a reflection of that demand for change. She's strong, she's empowered, she's cool, she's kickass, she's a warrior Queen and they pretty much pitched it to me that way.\"\r\nWan, known for horror movies including \"Saw,\" \"The Conjuring\" and \"Insidious,\" said making directing \"Aquaman\" has been an altogether new experience.\r\n\"In a lot of ways I feel like I'm making an animated feature here to some degree,\" he smiled. \"I joke that I'm making 'Finding Nemo 3' sometimes but I think it's a really cool way, and I try to find something different about this world that makes it unique and I think it's going to make a really cool looking visual world.\"\r\nAfter the subdued response to last year's \"Justice League,\" Warner Bros. will be hoping \"Aquaman\" swims its way to success when it hits U.S. and U.K. theaters December 21.\r\nCinemaCon at Caesars Palace, Las Vegas, runs 23-26 April.\r\n\r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives \u200b\u200b\r\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/25d76c350c463c13b0b258b8fe1f8011",
