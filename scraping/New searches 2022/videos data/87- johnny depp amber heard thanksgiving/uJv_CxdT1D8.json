Eleanor Laws QC, Depp's lawyer,asked her about being violent towards Depp during the fight, Heard said: 'He pushed Kate Moss down the stairs, I heard this from two people, and this was fresh in my mind'. Ms Laws accused Heard of 'adding' the Kate Moss incident during her evidence as she had never mentioned it before. The court was then played an excerpt of Heard's deposition in August 2016, in which she talks about the March 2015 incident. Laws repeated her allegation that there is no mention of Kate Moss.\n\nOriginal Article: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8544729/Amber-Heard-says-Johnny-Depp-pushed-Kate-Moss-stairs.html\nOriginal Video: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/video/johnnydepp/video-2214684/Video-Amber-Heard-Johnny-Depp-depart-court-eleventh-court-case-day.html\n\nDaily Mail Facebook: http://facebook.com/dailymail\nDaily Mail IG: http://instagram.com/dailymail\nDaily Mail Snap: https://www.snapchat.com/discover/Daily-Mail/8392137033\nDaily Mail Twitter: http://twitter.com/MailOnline\nDaily Mail Pinterest: http://pinterest.co.uk/dailymail\nDaily Mail Google+: https://plus.google.com/+DailyMail\n\nGet the free Daily Mail mobile app: http://dailymail.co.uk/mobile",
