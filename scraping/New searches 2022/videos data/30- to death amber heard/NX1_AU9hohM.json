It was originally titled \"When I Live My Life Over Again\", a title I prefer to the one distributor Starz chose instead. Oh well, whaddaya gonna do? That's Show Biz! When gorgeous Amber appeared, the paps went WILD and I had to capture it on camera, from within the belly of the beast. Somewhere in an alley nearby Donald Sutherland (as \"Homer Simpson\") is stomping an obnoxious child actor to death. If you don't know what I'm talking about, rent the classic film about Hollywood \"Day of the Locust\". Listen closely and you can hear me yell \"Day of the fucking Locust' over this modern day madness.",
