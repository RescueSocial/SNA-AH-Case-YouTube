The message\u00a0played into the stereotype that service-workers, such as housekeepers, nannies, and landscapers, would need to worry about an ICE checkpoint because of their legal status,\u00a0reinforcing the idea that all or most people who hold such jobs arrived in the country illegally. Some followers also accused the actress of relegating all\u00a0immigrants to the roles of \"the help.\"\u00a0  \u00a0She continued, \u201cCheckpoints on your home streets\u2026. Is this the \u2018great\u2019 America we\u2019re aiming for? Raids, fences and police-state like checkpoints don\u2019t feel like the \u2018land of the free\u2019 our immigrant ancestors built.\u201d  \u00a0Heard's message may have been sent with the best intentions\u2014to warn people near and dear to her friends and neighbors that they may be in danger\u2014but her delivery got in the way. Followers swiftly called on her to reconsider her comments. They explained that even if she meant the message to come across as a\u00a0tad satirical\u2014meaning to drag her neighbors for living lives of excess with hired help\u2014the post ultimately comes across\u00a0as racist and aloof.   \u00a0Following the backlash, Heard took down\u00a0the original tweet and posted a new message lamenting\u00a0that \"it is hard to make a simple statement w/out it being used to distract from the real issues.\"\u00a0  \u00a0Though her original message was muddled on Twitter, Heard's recent political activism points to just a poor choice of words this time.\u00a0On Instagram, the 32-year-old\u00a0has highlighted a variety of organization working to further\u00a0women\u2019s reproductive rights, plus the work of the United Nations Human Rights Council. She also recently headed to Texas to protest President Trump\u2019s immigration policy, and promoted the Families Belong Together rallies against it.   \u00a0Judging by Heard's\u00a0recent posts,\u00a0it's easier to give her the benefit of the doubt. But still, it served as another reminder to think before you tweet.
