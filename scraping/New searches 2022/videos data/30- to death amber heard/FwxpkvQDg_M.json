            "description": "Accepting her award in Sydney - which Heard joked was \u201con behalf of my dogs?\u201d - the actress spoke out about her sexuality, and how the marriage equality vote has impacted her personally.\n\u201cI feel really honoured to be in this room tonight with examples of real gentlemen, it's a rare thig these days, and I feel honoured. \u201cI also think the timing is amazing today: I flew in from Los Angeles after being here for eight months shooting, I thought I had finally escaped...but no. Two days later I flew back to accept this award...I'm assuming on behalf of my dogs Pistal and Boo. Well ufortunately they could not make it tonight.\n\n\u201cI was on the plane [to Sydney on Wednesday morning] and we were landing and the pilot came on the speaker and said, \"Welcome to Sydney... and by the way, we just got news that the vote came in\u2026 and the majority of Australians support the right for all Australians to marry the person they love.\" And I thought this is a commercial airline, and the pilot is announcing this news, and wow that's brave. And then something unbelievable happened: the whole plane erupted in this chorus of applause [...] Every single person on the plane clapped,\u201d she added. \nRemembering a time when being opening gay or lesbian wasn\u2019t ok, Heard recalls a time she was warned about being involved with another woman - and how it still impacts her to this day. \n\u201cI remember ten years ago when I refused to drop my girlfriend\u2019s hand at the time, everyone told me that was a death sentence in Hollywood. Ten years late the whole plane is clapping at this offhanded news announcement that the pilot decided to make, and it brought chills to my body and a tear to my eye - and here I am.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo I feel really lucky to be here today, and I feel really honoured and humbled. And I appreciate it very much.\u201d\n@GQ Australia\n\n-------------\nConnect with Amber Heard Online:\n\u2014 Visit the PHOTO GALLERY SOURCE: https://amber-heard.org/photos",
