I know TMZ owns the rights to this video because as soon as I uploaded it, it was copyright claimed BY TMZ. This means TMZ owns the rights to the video and I believe it was sold to them by Amber Heard. That\u2019s the logical deduction! All ad money goes to them, but it doesn't matter, getting the word out does! But it turns out Amber Heard or TMZ edited/doctored the footage.
