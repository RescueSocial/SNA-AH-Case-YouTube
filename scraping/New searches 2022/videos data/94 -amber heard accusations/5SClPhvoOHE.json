            "description": "'Fantastic Beasts' director David Yates defends keeping Johnny Depp despite Amber Heard\u2019s abuse accusations\n\nJohnny Depp appears at the end of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them as the villainous Grindelwald, and will have a larger role in the sequel, an unsettling prospect for many considering the domestic abuse allegations leveled against him by his ex-wife Amber Heard. The two reached a settlement after her suit, and issued a statement that read \u201cour relationship was intensely passionate and at times volatile, but always bound by love. Neither party has made false accusations for financial gains.\u201d Despite a Hollywood climate that has recently cracked down on abusive men in power such as Harvey Weinstein, director David Yates told Entertainment Weekly that he has no concerns about working with Depp. \u201cHonestly, there\u2019s an issue at the moment where there\u2019s a lot of people being accused of things, they\u2019re being accused by multiple victims, and it\u2019s compelling and frightening,\u201d Yates said. \u201cWith Johnny, it seems to me there was one person who took a pop at him and claimed something. I can only tell you about the man I see every day: He\u2019s full of decency and kindness, and that\u2019s all I see. Whatever accusation was out there doesn\u2019t tally with the kind of human being I\u2019ve been working with.\u201d\n\n\nYates also noted that Depp\u2019s exes, including Winona Ryder, have spoken positively of him. \u201cBy testament, some of the women in [Depp\u2019s] life have said the same thing \u2014 \u2018that\u2019s not the human being we know,\u2019\u201d Yates said. \u201cIt\u2019s very different [than cases] where there are multiple accusers over many years that need to be examined and we need to reflect on our industry that allows that to roll on year in and year out. Johnny isn\u2019t in that category in any shape or form. So to me, it doesn\u2019t bear any more analysis. It\u2019s a dead issue.\u201d",
