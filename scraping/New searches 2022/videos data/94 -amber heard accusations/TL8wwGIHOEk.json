            "description": "(21 Jul 2020) JOHNNY DEPP AND AMBER HEARD LEAVE COURT\r\nAmber Heard spent most of her second day of evidence in Johnny Depp's libel case against a British tabloid dismissing accusations that she fabricated allegations of domestic violence against her ex-husband.\r\nTaking to the witness box Tuesday (21 JULY 2020) at the High Court in London, the actress faced a barrage of questions over alleged incidents that are central to The Sun's labeling of Depp in an April 2018 article as a \"wife beater.\"\r\nDepp, 57, is suing The Sun's publisher, News Group Newspapers, and the paper's executive editor, Dan Wootton, over the article. The Hollywood star strongly denies abusing Heard and was at the court to hear his ex-wife.\r\nHis lawyer, Eleanor Laws, sought to show inconsistencies in Heard's allegations, accusing her of weaving a \"web of lies.\"\r\n\"You're making this up as you go along at times,\" Laws said to Heard, to which the 34-year-old actress replied: \"All this happened to me and I remember it.\"\r\nThe actress has alleged that Depp threw a phone at her \"like he was a baseball pitcher,\" hitting her on the right cheek and eye.\r\nHeard said she wears makeup when leaving home that could have camouflaged any injury.\r\n\"Of course I had an injury,\" she said.\r\nLaws also questioned Heard about text messages she sent Depp in the days after the alleged incident and about why she hadn't filed a restraining order immediately.\r\n\"I thought it could stay under wraps for a few days and those few days were a precious few days in the hardest time of my life, and presumably difficult for Johnny as well, and I would have done anything to have those few days of privacy,\" Heard said.\r\nHeard also denied she had an \"illicit relationship\" with anyone during her time with Depp, specifically with either Tesla CEO Elon Musk or actor James Franco. \"Not that that matters much,\" Heard said.\r\nLaws read out text messages on May 22, 2016, in which Heard allegedly tells Musk she is going to obtain a restraining order against Depp, and the billionaire offers to \"arrange 24/7 security.\"\r\nMusk allegedly said the offer would stand, \"even if you never wanted to see me again ... anyway, sorry for being an idiot. The radio silence hurts a lot. It only matters because I really like you.\"\r\nOn Monday, during her first day of testimony, Heard accused her ex-husband of abusing her both physically and verbally while he was allegedly bingeing on alcohol and drugs, claiming that at various times during their tempestuous relationship she feared for her life.\r\nDepp and Heard met on the set of the comedy \"The Rum Diary,\" released in 2011. They married in Los Angeles in February 2015. Heard filed for divorce the following year, and it was finalized in 2017.\r\nIn the first nine days of testimony at the High Court, judge Andrew Nicol heard from Depp and from several current or former employees who backed his version of events. In his testimony, Depp said he was the one being abused by Heard and that she had a history of being violent against him.\r\nVia audio recordings of the couple discussing various incidents played in court, Depp's lawyer sought to show that Heard admitted she had been violent against Depp. Heard said any contact was purely self-defense.\r\n\"That is what happens when you are in this situation, that's the truth,\" she said. \"I knew better than to fight with him about the details of the fight, and what he perceived as injuries to him. My job was to say sorry and get him on track, and move on to bigger things.\"\r\nHeard said the \"information\" was \"fresh\" in her mind at the time of the alleged incident and that she reacted \"in a flash\" to protect her sister.\r\n\r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives \u200b\u200b\r\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/0d3fba9f3c7944efba2102eedc622ea7",
