Although he has proved the necessary elements of his cause of action in libel, the defendants have shown that what they published in the meaning which I have held the words to bear was substantially true.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI have reached these conclusions having examined in detail the 14 incidents on which the defendants rely as well as the overarching considerations which the claimant submitted I should take into account.\u201d\n\nThe judgment follows a three-week hearing in July at London\u2019s Royal Courts of Justice, during which lurid allegations were made by each side concerning the torrid relationship between the \u201cPirates of the Caribbean\u201d star and his former spouse, \u201cAquaman\u201d actor Amber Heard.\n\nBoth Depp and Heard attended the hearing and also gave evidence. Other witnesses included friends of the two actors, and their present and former employees. Multiple and lengthy witness statements were also submitted, including those from Depp\u2019s former partners Winona Ryder and Vanessa Paradis.\n* Email: backsun95@gmail.com\n#WorldNews #NewsToday #News",
