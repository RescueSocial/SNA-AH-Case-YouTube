            "description": "I don\u2019t generally keep up with Hollywood goings on, but when I listened to this audio of Johnny Depp and Amber Heard\u2019s argument that came out Feb, I knew I wanted to share my thoughts on it.\nThis audio is a rare front row seat to so many of the games, manipulations and other traits of narcissists that we talk about all the time on this channel.  In this we can hear really profound examples of gaslighting, devaluing, love-bombing, tactics of anger, pressure, bullying, shifting to tears, victim-dance, and attacking from victim-stance, all of which combine to create and reinforce trauma-bonding.  Because all of this is caught on audio, I thought it could be very validating for so many of you who have been through this; to hear how crazy-making this is, to see how challenging these circular games are to navigate, and to hear how virtually ANYONE can get sucked into, and stuck in this type of toxic relationship.  The opportunity to talk about the games and tactics people with narcissistic traits play, with real live examples to refer to, just seemed invaluable.  So, I know this is a departure from my norm, but I think you\u2019ll understand why in short order.\nHere is the audio link if you want to listen;\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiuUzvZMyro\n\nSo often I am asked if I can do individual sessions with viewers, and saying no, without any suggestions, is painful for me, and unhelpful for you.
