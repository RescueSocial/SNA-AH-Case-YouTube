            "description": "In April 2011, 15 year old Seath Jackson was invited to a house (rented to Charlie Ely) by his former girlfriend, Amber Wright, under the guise of rekindling their relationship. Once the couple arrived at the house, though, it became quite clear that this invitation was a trap. Jackson was first beaten with lumber by a group of teens, Kyle Hooper and Justin Soto, and then shot multiple times, by Michael Bargo. Upon discovery that Jackson was still alive, the group tied Jackson up and placed him into a bath tub, breaking his knee-caps during the process so that he would fit into a bag. At that point, one of the teens (Michael Bargo) then shot Jackson in the face, ultimately killing the 15 year old. Once the murder was committed, the teens burned Jackson's body in a fire pit, shoveled his remains into 5 gallons buckets, and dumped the ashes into a local quarry.\n\nCircuit Judge David Eddy of Ocala, Florida sentenced Michael Bargo, the 21 year old mastermind behind this vicious crime, to death. In handing down the death sentence to Florida's now youngest death row inmate of 404 total, Eddy stated, \"I reference my experience to note this is the most cold calculated premeditated case of murder I have ever seen.\" Judge Eddy has served as a judge in Florida for 32 years. The decision came after the jury overwhelmingly voted in favor of the death penalty by a tally of 10-2.",
