Johnny Depp Reacts. | The HollyVibe\n\nJohnny Depp and Amber Heard are back on the frontlines of celebrity news. Amber Heard just had a baby girl and rumors are swirling on who the baby's father is. Many are saying it is Johnny Depp. But no public statements have been made in this regard by either Johnny Depp or Amber Heard. So no one knows for sure yet. In this video, we breakdown the story in detail. This celebrity drama goes down while the Johnny Depp Amber Heard civil court case rages on.  \n\nWith the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases.

Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.\n\n#JohnnyIsTheFather #AmberHeard #JohnnyDepp #JusticeForJohnny\n\n\nWe tell you interesting things about these Hollywood celebrities that you may have never heard before.\n\nPlease subscribe to our channel to stay up to date with interesting facts about Hollywood Celebs.\n\nCheers!",
