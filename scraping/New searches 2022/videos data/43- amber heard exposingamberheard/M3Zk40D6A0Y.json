            "description": "Johnny Depp REHIRED By Disney After This?!\n\nSubscribe to Binge Watch -  http://tiny.cc/bingewatch\n\nWATCH NEXT \ud83d\udc47\n\nAmber Heard Sentenced In Court After Shocking Details Surface\u2026\nhttps://youtu.be/Vjejpodph54\n\nRelated videos:\n\nCONFIRMED Johnny Depp Officially Rehired By Disney As Jack Sparrow\nhttps://youtu.be/8Ndq-3wMTlk\n\nSince the first accusations that Amber Heard proclaimed in 2016, Johnny\nDepp's career has been marred in controversy, with many of the most\nprestigious institutions in Hollywood largely blacklisting him due to ongoing\nlegal battles with his ex wife. But according to the latest news, there\u2019s a chance that our favorite Captain Jack Sparrow has a chance to make us laugh again.\nWhen Johnny lost a lengthy libel lawsuit against the UK News Group\nnewspaper, The Sun, his life and career have never been the same. For those who don't remember, the situation with The Sun began when the outlet published a 2018 report that Johnny Depp had ab*sed his ex-wife Amber Heard on multiple occasions throughout their relationship. The actress has since claimed that Johnny held her \u201chostage\u201d during a Pirates of the Caribbean film shoot in Australia, among other domestic ab*se allegations. Johnny Depp and his team, however, have denied the domestic violence claims from the start. And even two of Johnny Depp\u2019s exes, Winona Ryder and Vanessa Paradis, even leaped to his defense at various points throughout the libel trial against the British tabloid. But it didn't really help as after that trouble began to come out one after another. The actor was fired from two major roles - Captain Jack Sparrow in Disney\u2019s Pirates of the Caribbean franchise and Gellert Grindelwald in Warner Bros. Harry Potter Fantastic Beasts series. When Disney announced they had decided to end their relationship with Johnny Depp in 2020, it was one of the most tragic moments to come out for the actor\u2019s career but fans were quick to jump into his defence. Fans started sharing millions of posts and tweets, asking Disney to rehire Johnny Depp. However, it never helped. Then the one facet that has caught the most steam amongst fans online was via a change.org petition asking the studio to rehire Johnny as Captain Jack Sparrow (now fans decided to be official to become more powerful and intense in their requirements). The petition has a goal of 500,000 signatures and is well on its way to achieving it thanks to countless shares across social media platforms. Also, the petition's description pleads with readers to \"imagine no Jack Sparrow at all\" and mentions that \"they (Disney) have to bring him back to rule the seas again, UNLESS it is the actor's own choice to withdraw from the role.\" But did it really help to rehire Johnny Depp? However, an industry insider claims that if the situation happens to go to a retrial, the studio might consider reopening talks with the actor.\nHowever, it was ruled that the Hollywood actor cannot appeal the decision\nmade by Justice Andrew Nicol, who oversaw Depp\u2019s libel suit proceedings\n(because the actor didn\u2019t win the trial). Per The Guardian\u2019s report. This likely means that hope for Depp\u2019s coming to the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise is dimming since Walt Disney Studios indicated that the win was the only way they would consider Captain Jack Sparrow\u2019s return.\nHowever, there\u2019s no reason to cry because we have some interesting news to share with you. In case you somehow missed it, Xbox and Rare announced at E3 2021 that the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise would be entering the video game Sea of Thieves in a major way with Sea of Thieves: A Pirate's Life, bringing iconic characters like Jack Sparrow and Davy Jones along for the ride. \u201cUnfolding across five incredible tales packed with secrets and side-quests, this new campaign gives players a lovingly crafted story to play solo or with their crew,\u201d Microsoft said in a blog post.\nIn the new Sea of Thieves: A Pirate\u2019s Life expansion, you\u2019ll work to free Jack Sparrow from prison and avoid pursuit from the famous Pirates of the Caribbean villain Davy Jones. You\u2019ll also explore \u201cmemorable locations\u201d from both the Sea of Thieves and Pirates of the Caribbean franchise.\nAs of this week, Sea of Thieves: A Pirate's Life is now available in Sea of\nThieves, and while it does feature Johnny Depp's likeness as Sparrow, there\u2019s a mystery: is it actually Johnny Depp\u2019s voice? Is Johnny the one who talks for the Jack Sparrow character?\nUnfortunately, believe it or not, that\u2019s not Johnny Depp\u2019s voice, even despite the fact that it sounds really the same.\n\n\nBinge Watch - Binge Watch is the best source of the latest celebrity news.
