            "description": "Those were happier times. Amber Heard filed for divorce from her husband of just over a year, Johnny Depp, on Monday, May 23, a source confirmed to Us Weekly.\n\nBut though the Hollywood couple has been notoriously tight-lipped about their relationship, they have offered a few choice sound bites slip through during the course of their three-and-a-half year romance.\n\nThe pair first met on the set of 2011\u2019s The Rum Diary, when Depp, 52, was still with his longtime love, Vanessa Paradis. (They announced their split in 2012 after 14 years and two kids together.) Heard, 30, was in a relationship with photographer Tasya van Ree at the time.\n\nAfter months of secretly dating, the pair finally confirmed their relationship when the actress accompanied Depp and his children \u2014 Lily-Rose, 16, and Jack, 14 \u2014 on the international press tour for The Lone Ranger in July 2013.\n\nThe pair got engaged in January 2014, and one year later in February, they exchanged vows first at his West Hollywood home and then in a beautiful beach ceremony in the Bahamas.\n\nTake a look back at some of the things the pair have said about their relationship over the years.",
