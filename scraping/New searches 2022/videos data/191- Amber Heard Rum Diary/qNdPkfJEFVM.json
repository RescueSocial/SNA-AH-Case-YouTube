Johnny is a wonderful, special person.\"\n\nSpeaking to Entertainmentwise when the film was released late last year, the blonde bombshell was full of praise for Depp.\n\n\"Working with Johnny is wonderful,\" she said. \"I didn't know what to expect and didn't know what I was getting in to. Anything I expected he far surpasses.\n\n\"He's wonderful to work with, everybody on set respects him and likes him, and it's because he brings so much to work with him in such a wonderful presence.\n\n\"People are drawn to him in a way I've never really seen before. Perhaps that's why he is the movie star that he is. I also respect his work ethic, he's true character actor trapped in a leading man's body, and I respect that.\"",
