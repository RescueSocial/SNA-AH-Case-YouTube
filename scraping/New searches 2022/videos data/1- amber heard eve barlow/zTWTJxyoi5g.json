            "description": "A lot has been made over the recent years about the voices of fans. Because at times, their voices are heard LOUD AND CLEAR and as a result, major movements have been made. Such as with the Sonic the Hedgehog movie (which is getting its sequel next year...) where fans rioted over the look of the main character, so it was delayed and revised for the better. And of course, the Snyder Cut, which was said to \"not exist\" but fans new better and it became the most-talked about movie around for a while, especially on Twitter. But other times, fans aren't heard enough, and the situation with Amber Heard is proof of that. We'll break it down for you.

A look at how everything has gone down for Amber Heard in regards to her role as Mera in Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, and why fans are still protesting it even though the film has wrapped production. Do you think that having Heard still be in the film will hurt its box office results? Or do you think that people will check out the film in spite of her?
