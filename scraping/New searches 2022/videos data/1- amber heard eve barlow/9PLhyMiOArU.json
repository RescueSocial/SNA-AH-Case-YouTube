            "description": "James Franco Will Testify In Amber Heard  Johnny Depp Lawsuit James Franco has been deposed in Johnny Depp and Amber Heard's lawsuit and will be required testify on whether he knew of or saw any signs of abuse during his interactions with Heard. The news comes just shortly after Franco spoke out about the sexual misconduct allegations against him for the first time since the allegations first came out in 2017. He went on to deny the more serious accusations against him and indicated he settled the lawsuit only to bring an easy end to it. Now, he has found himself mixed up with another lawsuit. Franco and Heard worked together on Pineapple Express and while it is unknown if such an affair took place, Depp's lawyers have reason to believe that the two had ample interaction with one another. He will sit for the deposition early next year, with the trial set to take place in April of 2022. Rachel Ulatowski is a Freelance Movie/TV News Writer for Screen Rant.",
