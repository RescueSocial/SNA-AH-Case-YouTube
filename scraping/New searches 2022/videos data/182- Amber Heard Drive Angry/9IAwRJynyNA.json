He joins forces with Piper (Amber Heard) -- a sexy waitress with a '69 Charger, who's also seeking redemption of her own.  The two of them are hot on the trail of the deadly leader of the cult (Billy Burke), while being pursued by an enigmatic killer (William Fichtner) who has been sent by the Devil to retrieve Milton and deliver him back to hell.\nRated R for strong brutal violence throughout, grisly images, some graphic sexual content, nudity and pervasive language.",
