            "description": "Amber Heard was questioned about the build-up to her appearance on James Corden's The Late Late Show in 2015 at the High Court today in London. \u00a0The Magic Mike actress, 34, was giving evidence in former spouse Johnny Depp's libel case against News Group Newspapers. \u00a0Depp, 57, is suing the publishers over an April 2018 article, written by executive Dan Wootton, in which the Pirates of the Caribbean actor was branded a \"wife beater\". \u00a0Natasha Wass QC, representing Depp, said to Heard it had been suggested the actress had altered images of her injuries ahead of her appearance on James Corden\u2019s The Late Late Show.   \u00a0Heard simply responded: \"No.\" \u00a0Lawyer then asked Heard if she had asked anyone else to do it. \u00a0Once again, Heard replied: \"No.\" \u00a0Heard was then questioned over whether she had used make-up to enhance her injuries in the photographs. \u00a0Heard answered: \"Only to try and hide them.\" \u00a0Heard was then questioned over images, which were obtained by MailOnline in April 2019 of Depp and Heard\u2019s broken bed frame that the actress claims Depp broke during a physical altercation, a few days before Christmas in 2015.  \u00a0Lawyer asked: \"Did you break the bed?\" \u00a0Heard replied: \"No I didn't.\" \u00a0Lawyer then said: \"Did you pull out your own hair so you could leave it on the floor to take photographs?\" \u00a0Heard responded: \"No I did not.\" \u00a0Heard was then questioned if she asked anyone else to pull out her hair for the benefit of the photographs. \u00a0Heard answered: \"No I did not.\"  \u00a0Lawyer then asked why Heard called the nurse a couple of days after the alleged attack. \u00a0Heard said she called the nurse \"to drop off meds\". \u00a0Lawyer then asked if the nurse had undertaken a \"clinical examination\" of her. \u00a0Heard responded: \"No. She was dropping off meds and she said she was late.\" \u00a0Depp has denied all of Heard's allegations of domestic abuse.",
