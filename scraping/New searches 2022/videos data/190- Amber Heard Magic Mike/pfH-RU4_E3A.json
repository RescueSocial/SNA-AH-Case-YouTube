Guess not. But the good news is it\u2019s not too late for Amber to turn things around, and divorce him for a pasty blogger who lives in his mom\u2019s basement. I\u2019m telling you, that\u2019s guaranteed to get her more attention. Frankly, I\u2019m a little surprised her agent hasn\u2019t already called me. But better late than never, I guess.",
