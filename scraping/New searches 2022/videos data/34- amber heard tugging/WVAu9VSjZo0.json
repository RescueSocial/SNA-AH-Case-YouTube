            "description": "(10 Aug 2018) CHARLIZE THERON, AMBER HEARD ARRIVE TO HFPA'S ANNUAL GRANTS BANQUET, ATTENDEES ARE DIVIDED OVER OSCAR CHANGES\r\nLena Waithe is all for the new popular film category at the Oscars. \r\nThe actress and Emmy-winning \"Master of None\" writer is thrilled that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is introducing an award for \"outstanding achievement in popular film.\"\r\n\"I am all for it because a lot of those popular pictures have people in them that look like me and an Oscar is an Oscar is an Oscar. So people think it's so easy to win a popular Oscar? Do me a favor and go win one. But I think it's important. I think the Oscars have to change because the world is changing, people are changing. And Oscar day is like Christmas at my house. I have so many memories. I can still, you know, (remember) when Tom Hanks won the Oscar for 'Philadelphia.' He talked about the streets of heaven being lined with angels and 'act well the part and there the glory lies.' And Halle Berry winning the award and Whoopie Goldberg hosting that same night when they honored Sidney Poitier and Denzel Washington, all those things. It's an important show. It's sort of our Super Bowl. It represents us. So we have to make sure it's changing with the times because if we don't, then people will stop watching it and that will be horrible. So I'm here for the popular vote! Let's do it,\" she said. \r\nWaithe, who attended the Hollywood Foreign Press Association's annual grants banquet Thursday (9 AUG. 2018), was not surprised that Wednesday's announcement proved remarkably unpopular, at least among film critics and some academy members. \r\n\"Look, I mean, the Oscars is an institution and it's like apple pie. So nobody wants to change the recipe for apple pie. But if changing the recipe makes it taste better, then let's do it. I'm here for it, man. I think it's important,\" Waithe said. \r\nThe introduction of a \"popular film\" category, beginning with the upcoming Feb. 24 ceremony to be televised by ABC, did not sit well with some. \r\n\"I'm not so happy about that honestly. I think it's a difficult thing for\u2026 We are not the MTV Awards and I found it disappointing,\" said Tim Robbins, who's charity The Actors' Gang is supported by a grant from HFPA. \r\nWhile Christian Slater simply wasn't interested in the new category debate. \r\n\"Look, I don't really think about it too much really. God bless them. They've got to try to figure it out and there's so many other things going on in the world right now that actually have value and meaning that I don't think about it,\" Slater said.\r\nThe other new changes were met with a mix of praise and grumbling, like the move to shrink the broadcast to three hours and remove some categories from the live telecast.\r\n\"Coming from a stage background, I just know how important all of that stuff is and how hard they work and I think that they deserve equal presentation,\" said Cynthia Erivo. \"They earn their nomination just as much as everybody else has. So I don't know. I think that they deserve the same air time.\"\r\nThe HFPA, who puts on the Golden Globes, awards millions of dollars in grants to charities every year and celebrates their efforts work with an annual star-studded dinner. \r\nThis year, one of the HFPA grants went to RAICES, an organization that helps families separated at the U.S. border. \r\nWilliam H. Macy hosted the event. Amber Heard, Jennifer Garner and Charlize Theron were among the celebrity presenters.\r\n\r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives \u200b\u200b\r\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/b01db71e8b62bbc2d09142139a6db553",
