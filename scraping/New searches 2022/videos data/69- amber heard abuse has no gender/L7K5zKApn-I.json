            "description": "CWEB.com - Celebrity Amber Heard filed a domestic violence restraining order against Johnny Depp that includes a photo of an attack, which she reportedly alleges was not an isolated event. The couple has been married for 15 months. I truly hope that the allegations against Mr. Depp are false because it would be sad to see such a talented actor behave in such a manner. But I also hope that Ms. Heard is not lying about the verbal abuse because it will make it harder for victims of domestic violence to come forward. Either way nobody wins. Stay tuned for more reports and news and to find out if this rummors are true or not.\n\nGet a chance to win a free movie or a concert ticket when you vote for the celebrity or movie we review on http://www.CWEB.com",
