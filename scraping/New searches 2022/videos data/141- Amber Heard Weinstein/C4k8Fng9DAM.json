I get what women are asking for right now. They would like us to back off and sit down and be quiet for a change.Then once you've figured out what you need from us, you'll tell us and we'll need to get on board and support you.' \u2013 Amber Tamblyn on sexual assault. \n\nTamblyn recently wrote a book called \u201cEra of Ignition\u201d which chronicles her personal exploration of feminism in the Third Wave, but one of her favorite parts of the book is the Male Ally Manifesto. \n\n'When it comes to men being accused of bad behavior, let's leave the ancient, messy laws of the American justice system and instead listen to the rational and reasonable intelligence of women like Roxane Gay.
