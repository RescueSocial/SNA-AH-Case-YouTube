Everyone involved did their part to assist in making the duet as big and powerful as could be to ensure the poignant lyrical message could be heard loud and clear.\n\n\u201cWe recommend everyone listening to this at high volume and a lot of bass! \u00a0We wish nothing but good to everyone and we hope this brightens someone\u2019s day when they hear it. That\u2019s all this song was meant to do--bring positivity to the world,\" says Chris Davisson.\n\nA special thank you to the fans that submitted their own videos!\n\nListen to Greatest Show on Earth now: https://orcd.co/greatestshowonearth\n\n******************************************\nConnect with Davisson Brothers Band-\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/DavissonBros/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/davissonbros/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/DavissonBroBand\nWebsite: http://davissonbrothersband.com/\n ******************************************\nConnect with Amber Lawrence-\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/amberlawrencemusic/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/amberlawrencemusic/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/amberlawrence?lang=en\nWebsite: https://www.amberlawrence.com.au/\n******************************************\n\n#DavissonBrothersBand #GreatestShowOnEarth #AmberLawrence",
