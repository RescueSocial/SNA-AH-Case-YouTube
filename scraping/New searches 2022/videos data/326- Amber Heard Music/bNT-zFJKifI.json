This song took me a lot of courage to write because I was always apprehensive of the subject it talked about. I've been doing this job for a long time and right now I speak not as Amber of f(x) nor \"celebrity\" Amber, but just Amber. Just plain, simple, human Amber. \"Borders\" is more than a song; no glamorous concepts, no \"trying to be cool.\" Its a raw and real story about reality. Its shares, not only about my personal experiences but of people very close to me. Everyone involved in this project- the producers, my team DPR, the actors, to the staff- were people specifically chosen as they have never given up on me and believed in my vision. For that, I want to thank them for making this possible for me. When you guys listen to \"Borders\", there is just one thing i wish everyone could take from it: NEVER give up on yourself. There is always hope in the midst of this dark, demanding world. In the end, live for those that did not get the chance to and just keep fighting. Always, thank you you guys. You guys made it possible. \n\n\ub178\ub798 \ub098\uc624\uae30\uc804\uc5d0 \uc5ec\ub7ec\ubd84\ud55c\ud14c \uba87\uae4c\uc9c0 \ub9d0\ud558\uace0 \uc2f6\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub178\ub798\ub97c \uc4f8\ub54c \ub9ce\uc740 \uc6a9\uae30\ub97c \ub0c8\uc5b4\uc694 \uc65c\ub0d0\ud558\uba74 \uc774 \uc8fc\uc81c\uac00 \uc0ac\ub78c\ub4e4\ud55c\ud14c \ub9d0\ud558\uace0 \uc624\ud508 \ud558\ub294 \uc790\uccb4\uac00 \ub9ce\uc740 \uac81\uc744 \uac16\uace0 \uc788\uc5c8\uc5b4\uc694. \uc81c\uac00 \uc5f0\uc608 \ud65c\ub3d9 \ud55c\uc9c0 \uc624\ub798\ub410\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc9c0\uae08 \uc800\ub294 \uc5d0\ud504\uc5d1\uc2a4\uc758 \uc5e0\ubc84, \uc5f0\uc608\uc778 \uc5e0\ubc84\ub85c\uc11c \ub9d0\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\uc54a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc9c0\uae08 \uadf8\ub0e5 \uc5e0\ubc84. \uc778\uac04 \uc5e0\ubc84\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf4\ub354\uc2a4\"\ub294 \uadf8\ub0e5 \ub178\ub798\uac00 \uc544\ub2d9\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucf58\uc149 \uc9dc\uc11c \uba4b\uc788\uac8c \ub9cc\ub4e4\uc73c\ub824\uace0 \ud558\ub294\uac83\ub3c4 \uc5c6\uc5b4\uc694. \uadf8\ub0e5 \uc9c4\uc2ec, \uc194\uc9c1\ud568 \ub2f4\uc740 \ud604\uc2e4 \uc774\uc57c\uae30\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc81c \uc774\uc57c\uae30\uacfc \uc81c \uce5c\ud55c\ud14c \uc0ac\ub984\ub4e4\uc758 \uc774\uc57c\uae30. \uc774 \ud504\ub85c\uc81d\ud2b8 \ub9cc\ub4e4\uba74\uc11c \uc791\uace1 \uac19\uc774 \ud558\ub294 \uce5c\uad6c\ub4e4\ubd80\ud130, \uc81c \uc81c\uc791\ud300 DPR, \uc5f0\uae30\uc790\ub4e4, \uc2a4\ud0ed\ubd84\ub4e4\uae4c\uc9c0 \uc81c\uac00 \uc9c1\uc811 \uace8\ub790\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8 \uc774\uc720\ub294 \uc81c \uc606\uc5d0 \uc788\uc73c\uba74\uc11c \ud3ec\uae30 \uc808\ub300 \ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\uace0 \uc81c\uac00 \uac16\uace0 \uc788\ub294 \ud658\uc0c1\uc744 \ubbff\uc5b4\uc8fc\ub294 \ubd84\ub4e4\uc774\uae30\ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0. \uadf8\uce5c\uad6c\ub4e4\ud55c\ud14c \uac10\uc0ac\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \ub9d0\uc744 \ub2e4\uc2dc \ud558\uace0 \uc2f6\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \"\ubcf4\ub354\uc2a4\" \ub4e3\uace0 \uc774 \ub9e4\uc138\uc9c0 \uc804\ud558\uace0 \uc2f6\uc5b4\uc694: \uc808\ub300 \uc790\uae30 \uc790\uc2e0\ud55c\ud14c \ud3ec\uae30\ud558\uc9c0\ub9d0\uc544\uc694. \uc774 \uc5b4\ub450\uc6b4 \ud798\ub4e0 \uc138\uc0c1\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ud76c\ub9dd \ud56d\uc0c1 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9\uc73c\ub85c \uc0b4 \uae30\ud68c \uc5c6\uc5c8\ub358 \uc0ac\ub78c\ub4e4\uc704\ud574\uc11c \uc0b4\uc544\uc694. \ud798\uc744 \ub0b4\uc138\uc694. \uc5ec\ub7ec\ubd84 \ud56d\uc0c1 \uac10\uc0ac \ub4dc\ub824\uc694. \uc81c\uac00 \uc774\ub807\uac8c\uae4c\uc9c0 \ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc774\uc720\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec\ubd84\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\nAMBER Official\nhttp://amber.smtown.com\nhttp://www.youtube.com/Amberliumusic\nhttp://www.facebook.com/fx.smtown\n\nSM STATION Official\nhttp://www.instagram.com/smtownstation\nhttp://www.facebook.com/station.smtown\n\n[STATION] AMBER \uc5e0\ubc84 'Borders' MV \u2117 S.M.Entertainment",
