            "description": "Inclusive Behaviors and Language \n\nIn this episode, HERdacious host Lorelei chats with Amber Briggle about implementing inclusive behaviors and non-exclusionary language into the workplace. We might be familiar with increasingly common inclusive practices like offering our preferred pronouns or using gender-neutral language; but, what more can we do to promote non-discriminatory culture in the workplace? While Amber walks us through the endless possibilities, we quickly realize that the better question to ask is: what can\u2019t we do? As a small business owner and parent to a transgender child, Amber teaches us that although conscious and unconscious discriminatory behavior often pervade the workplace, uprooting these behaviors is well within reach. From breaking the habit of assuming gender and sexuality to rewriting parental leave policies, Amber emphasizes that being mindful of inclusivity through our interactions benefits the well-being of individuals and businesses alike. Although these actions appear slight, they are meaningful to people who are constantly excluded from the heteronormative mainstream. Being seen and valued is a privilege easily taken for granted, so let\u2019s pay it forward to everyone of all identities!\n\nHost: Lorelei Gonzalez\nCo-host: Amber Briggle, CMT\n\nAmber Briggle (she/her) is an activist, speaker, writers, and self-described \u201cmamabear\u201d of a transgender child.
