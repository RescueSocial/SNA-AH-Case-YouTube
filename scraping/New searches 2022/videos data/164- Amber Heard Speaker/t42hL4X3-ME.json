It was there that we received both a passion for Jesus and a passion for the nations. We received a call to the nations individually. Clinton's call came with the words \u201cThere is a nation out there that owns you, and the blood running through your body is not your own but theirs.\" With these words spoken over him, he lay on the ground rolled up in a flag for four hours.  Amber heard God speak, Isaiah 55:5, \u201cBehold, you will call a nation you do not know, and a nation which knows you not will run to you,\" to which she responded with, \n On August 15, 2001, we packed all that we owned into 9 suitcases and headed to southern Thailand and have been there for the last 14 years. \nIf you would like to help support this Missionary family you may do so here. https://aminternational.thankyou4cari...",
