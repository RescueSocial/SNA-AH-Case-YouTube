            "description": "Welcome to Episode #1 of The Parenting Biz Podcast - coming to you every Monday. This week's featured guest is Marina J. \n\nWhen Marina J became a single mum in 2001 her light went out. She couldn\u2019t find anyone to teach her; not just how to turn her life around, but actually how to flourish. \n\nSo she made a decision: She would do it. \n\nShe put herself on her own program and within 6 months her life turned around in a BIG way and her light turned back ON. \n\nShe had what those around her didn\u2019t: A system that took her out of her old life and into the new. \n\nSince then she\u2019s become a #1 best-selling author, a speaker and a life coach - because your happiness is everything! \n\nShe married the love of her life and lives by the beach near Sydney. \n\nShe\u2019s been interviewed by Channel 9\u2019s breakfast show, ABC radio, Fox Sports Radio, 2GB radio, Body + Soul, Better Health and Gardens, and more. \n\nHer motto? Is that you\u2019re built to heal; because you\u2019re built to live that life that\u2019s waiting for you!\n\nThis week, the entire interview has been constructed around The Grand Opening Night for the most famous show in town - \u201cIgnite Your Power\u201d & Marina J is the main character about to hit the stage! \n\nWe went behind stage with Marina, dove into the four acts of the show, had a remarkable encore and sat back and reflected in the dressing room once the show was over. \n\nIgnite Your Power demonstrates the foundational core of truly diving inwards to make a difference in not only our personal or business lives but most importantly, in our children\u2019s...\n\nHere are some key points summarised in the four acts:\n\nFirst Act: Decide What You Don\u2019t Want\nFirst step in igniting your personal power\nLots of self help saying \u201cdon\u2019t think negative\u201d = Marina completely DISAGREES.\nPay attention to this natural step or you\u2019ll be worse off in the future\nDecipher what\u2019s right for you AND what\u2019s wrong for you\nFind and write down where your energy drains are\nWorship and trust your B.S detector\n\nSecond Act: Desire What You Do\nIsn\u2019t that selfish? YES! The best kind of selfish\nStart small - example: what do you want for lunch?\nGo with your feeling in the here and now - the rest will follow\nWe\u2019re all energy...\n\nThird Act: Detox What\u2019s In Your Way\nFocus on emotional detox\nWhat are you more committed to?\nThe importance of asking more powerful questions\n85% of what\u2019s in our way, lives underneath in our subconscious \nYou can talk all you want, but until you go deep - you\u2019ll always be where you are\nReal healing = where you won\u2019t walk out of this year with the same problems you walked into this year with\nWe all hold 50% masculine & 50% feminine energy and truly NEED both\nMost of us, need to raise the feminine to match the already high masculine energy we\u2019ve all been taught\n\nFourth and Final Act: Self-Love Action\nSelf Love = It\u2019s the act of being kind to yourself\nHow kind are you being on yourself right now?\nYour children learn it from you\nIf you don\u2019t love yourself, how do you expect your child to love their self?\n\n\nLooking back and reflecting on your business & life journey, going back to whichever age you choose, what advice would you share with yourself and how old are you?\n\nMarina would go back to her 8 year old self and teach herself to keep some of the energy inwards - to not always give it all away... \n\nShe has always had a great deal of energy, but wasn\u2019t aware of how to manage it and would tend to give it out rather than keeping some in and replenishing herself. \n\nSo she would actually receive and invest in herself and move forward. \n\nShe simply didn\u2019t understand how to contain it... \n\nEventually she learned to keep some of it inwards for herself to move forward too. \n\nFinal thought: \nWhat turns you on?\nWhat turns you off?\nBegin asking yourself powerful questions and you\u2019ll be surprised of the wisdom that\u2019s already within you that just wants to be heard. \nIf you want to bring out the best in your children, focus on your own healing and that\u2019s the legacy you want to be passing onto the next generation...\n\nWant to contact the guest? \nReceive Glitter Bombs (enter your details on Marina J\u2019s Website): https://marinaj.net/ \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/MarinaJCoaching/ \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/marinajcoaching/ \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/MarinaJGoddess\n\nMusic in Interview is:\nBACK IN SUMMER by Nicolai Heidlas Music https://soundcloud.com/nicolai-heidlas\nCreative Commons \u2014 Attribution 3.0 Unported\u2014 CC BY 3.0 \nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/b...\nMusic promoted by Audio Library https://youtu.be/sGsC98vR4Q4",
