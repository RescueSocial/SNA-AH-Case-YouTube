            "description": "Amber Peters, BSc, staff biologist for the Valhalla Wilderness Society, presents a CREDtalk for the Columbia Mountains Institute of Applied Ecology. \n\nIn 2018 the Valhalla Wilderness Society sponsored a scientific expedition into the largest of two contiguous valleys to record an ecological inventory of plant, macrofungi and lichen species using standard sampling and photodocumentation methods. Biologists Toby Spribille, Curtis Bj\u00f6rk, Wayne McCrory, Tyson Ehlers and Amber Peters conducted exploratory research to determine the ecological and inland rainforest values of the newly discovered wilderness. An impressive diversity of rare habitats and species were discovered, including abundant growth of oceanic lichen species indicative of a true rainforest ecosystem. Researchers have since concluded that the Rainbow-Jordan Wilderness harbours stands of some of the richest Inland Temperate Rainforest yet found in the province, making the unroaded and unlogged wilderness a valuable refuge for wildlife and sensitive plant communities. The presentation will include a summary of rare and at-risk species that have been inventoried to date, as well as photography by the researchers and by well-known professional photographer Douglas Noblet.\n\nThe Valhalla Wilderness Society have submitted a proposal for this area of land to be included in a protected areas proposal currently under review with the province of British Columbia and the Federal government.\n\nMore info on the CREDtalk series can be found here: https://cmiae.org/event/cred-talks-columbia-region-ecological-discussions/",
