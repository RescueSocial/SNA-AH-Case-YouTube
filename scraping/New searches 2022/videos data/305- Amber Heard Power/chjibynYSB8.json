If you\u2019re looking for refuge, I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ve come to the wrong place, mi cari\u00f1o.\u201d\n\nTallow - \u201cLawmen sniff around here often?\u201d\n\nMarty - \u201cNot lawmen\u2026 Redtowns. I suggest you keep your head down, \u00bfvale?\u201d\n\nTallow - \u201cI\u2019ll take that into heart, amigo.\u201d\n\nMarty - \u201cI\u2019m flattered that you think we are friends. I cannot seem to think of anyone else I\u2019ve been able to say that to. At least not any more\u2026\u201d\n\nTallow - \u201cWell, friends are useful in a place like this, don\u2019t ya think?\u201d\n\nMarty - \u201cWell, Ms Tallow. There\u2019s a difference between those who are truly your friend and those who just want to use you. Friends don\u2019t have a \u2018use\u2019. Friends have a purpose. And that purpose is to be your friend.\u201d\n\nMarty and Tallow meet in person for the first time to share a nice conversation. Considering that Marty is older and wiser than Tallow, he shares his wisdom with her about living off the land and how she should handle relationships. They meet in the desert town of Kilbrook pass, which lawmen know as the town which houses the deadliest outlaws. Many lawmen refuse to investigate due to their lack of jurisdiction and gun power. Many detectives from private agencies sniff around, so outlaws in this town have to be careful about who they speak to.\n\nSong: Bjorn Olsson - Annika",
