Patriarchal Dominance models dogmatically and arbitrarily decree that ALL abuse is \"a manifestation of the oppression of women and the product of patriarchal [ie exclusively male] power\" - \"where women are only victims and only males are perpetrators\" - where \"males can never be oppressed [and therefore can never be 'real' victims]. The only abuse dynamic which this model is capable of accurately recognising is male-on-female abuse. \n\nWith same-sex violence and abuse, this model is as homophobic as the Westboro Baptist Church. It responds to male-on-male partner violence by condescendingly dismissing it as \"[just] male privilege backfiring\" and \"just men doing it to each other [so both parties, including the victim, need to address their toxic masculinity]\". It responds to female victims of same-sex partner violence by treating them like pathological liars, because \"women are only victims and only males are perpetrators\". This is a perpetual hate crime against abused members of the LGBTIQ+ community. \n\nWorse still, in cases of female-on-male abuse, as the only party capable of experiencing \"the oppression of women\" is the abuser and the only party capable of possessing \"[male] power\" is the victim, these models not only blame the victim, but accuse the victim of \"oppressing their abusers into abusing them? This is the sole position of female abusers (including child abusers, paedophiles, rapists and batterers), their excusers and their enablers. \n\nWorst of all, as people with a disability and especially disabled children have no real power, in cases of female-on-male abuse involving abused disabled men and abused disabled boys, these models essentially argue that the mere existence of said disabled abuse victim \"oppressed their abusers into abusing them\". This is the very argument the Nazis used to create a culture of collective and systemic abuse against the disabled, as a precursor to rounding them up into \"research hospitals\" and butchering them as guinea pigs to make the Final Solution a reality. In short, not only are patriarchal dominance models the argument of a Nazi in their ableism \u2014 they're literally tantamount to Holocaust Incitement.\n\nExposing the development of the Duluth Model: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwTBXdGS_j4\n\nBattered men more likely to be arrested than believed: https://www.nationalparentsorganization.org/blog/3972-researcher-what-hap-3972\n\n\"Study: 10 Percent of U.S. Youths Cause Sexual Violence\": https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/10/131007-sexual-violence-rape-teenagers-sociology/\n\n\"Congo\u2019s Forgotten Curse: Epidemic of Female-on-Female Rape\": http://world.time.com/2013/12/03/congos-forgotten-curse-epidemic-of-female-on-female-rape/\n\n\"Domestic violence support services failing lesbians\": http://www.starobserver.com.au/news/national-news/new-south-wales-news/domestic-violence-support-services-failing-lesbians/140608\n\nMale stat rape victims made to pay child support to their abusers: http://web.archive.org/web/20170507044705/http://www.ageofconsent.com/comments/numberthirtysix.htm\n\n\"Pedophile support programs challenge community hatred\": \nhttps://www.smh.com.au/national/pedophile-support-programs-challenge-community-hatred-20140328-35ofk.html\n\n\"Finally, there is an alarmingly high rate of sexual abuse by females in thebackgrounds of rapists, sex offenders and sexually aggressive men \u2013 59%(Petrovich and Templer, 1984), 66% (Groth, 1979) and 80% (Briere andSmiljanich, 1993).
