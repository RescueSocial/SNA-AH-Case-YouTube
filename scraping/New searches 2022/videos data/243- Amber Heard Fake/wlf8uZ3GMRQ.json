            "description": "Rasa Puronaite\u0307 from the Amber Gallery-Museum in Nida, Neringa, Lithuania explains how to check if Amber is Real or Fake.\n\nAmber Gallery-Museum in Nida is located in an old fisherman's house. The museum tells the story of the history of the Baltic Amber: formation, morphology, colours, and inclusions. Amber of different sizes and shapes. The biggest amber piece weighs 3,820 kilograms. Visitors may touch it and be filled with 50 million years amber energy and feel its warmth. There is also one amber nugget with a particularly strong energy. It is of an ox heart shape and diffuses exclusively intense energy from the sharp edge. The nugget was even used to heal the gallery owner. The museum shows an impressive collection of inclusions. Here you can find various insects and plants in amber. We also have an amber piece with a bird feather and a spider \"Sosybius Mizgirisi\". The latter piece of amber received this name when the researcher J. Wunderlich, who works at the Hamburg University of Geology-Paleontology Museum. Visitors can taste a special drink \u2013 \"Amber Drink\" and learn how to make the drink at home themselves.\n\nIn addition to the antique amber, prominent-Lithuanian artists works are displayed. You can buy jewelry and art works of amber. All items have certificates, guaranteeing that the product is made of natural Baltic amber.\n\nMuseum visitors can also visit exposition in the garden and walk along the irst part of the Amber Road which extends from the Baltic Sea to the Etruscan lands in Italy. \n\nAt the Amber Gallery-Museum you can learn to work with amber (who wants can try to become an amber \"master\" and make themselves a fortune amulet). Visitors can see a collection of inclusions, amulets from Juodkrant\u0117 Treasure, and then open a \"50 million year-old pine bole\" to understand how amber was formed inside. They can see how resin was piling up in the tree; dripping from damaged spots or dribbling down the tree bark. A boat previously used to fish amber and some ancient tools are part of the exhibition. The beginning of the Amber Road is marked with an obelisk placed in Curonian Lagoon.\n\nIn summer time artists come to the Artists\u2018 House, which is located near the Amber Gallery-Museum. These is a chance to observe the creative processes and visit the exhibitions.\n\nAmber Gallery-Museum, Nida, Neringa, Lithuania http://www.ambergallery.lt\n/en/disp.php?itm=en_museums_2%2Fen_museums_2_1\n\n\nNIDA CULTURE AND TOURISM INFORMATION CENTER \u201cAGILA\u201d\nTaikos str. 4, LT-93121, Neringa, Nida, Lithuania\nhttp://www.visitneringa.com\n\nLithuania Tourism http://www.lithuania.travel\n\nUnravel Travel TV on You Tube http://www.youtube.com/UnravelTravelTV\nUnravel Travel TV Twitter http://www.twitter.com/UnraveltravelTV\nUnravel Travel TV Pinterest http://www.pinterest.com/unraveltraveltv\nUnravel Travel TV Website http://www.unraveltravel.eu\nUnravel Travel TV Snapchat traveltv\n#UnravelTravelTV #UnravelTravel #TravelTV",
