            "description": "Johnny Depp repeatedly tells Amber Heard to \"cut\" him as she begs him not to hurt himself in disturbing audio played to the High Court yesterday. \u00a0The 57-year-old actor is suing The Sun\u2019s publisher News Group Newspapers and the paper\u2019s editor, Dan Wootton, over an article published in 2018 that referred to him as a \u201cwife beater\u201d. \u00a0In the muffled audio, Depp says: \u201cYou wanna cut me. Cut me wherever you want. \u00a0\u201cYou wanna cut me somewhere. On the arm, chest? Where do you wanna start? Cut me.\" \u00a0Heard says: \"Don't cut your skin. \u00a0\u201cPlease do not cut your skin.   \u00a0\u201cWhy would you do that? Please do not.\" \u00a0Depp then says: \u201cIt's easy.\u201d \u00a0Heard says: \u201cPlease do not do that. Please do not cut yourself. You don't need to cut yourself.\u201d \u00a0Depp tells Heard that \u201cI want your mark\u201d and then says: \u201cCut cut, cut.\u201d \u00a0He then calls her a \u201cp***y\u201d and tells her: \u201cYou f***ing hate me, come on.\u201d   \u00a0The court was told the recording came in July 2016 when their tumultuous relationship was coming to an end. \u00a0In May 2016, Heard filed for divorce citing irreconcilable differences. \u00a0Asking Depp about the audio, Sasha Wass QC said: \"You're threatening to cut yourself in front of Ms Heard and you're actually holding a knife at the time.\"  \u00a0Depp replied: \"I was asking her to cut me.  \u00a0\u201cIf she wasn\u2019t willing I would do it myself.\" \u00a0 The court has previously heard that Depp called Heard a \"gold-digging c*m guzzler\" in explosive text messages sent to a friend.   \u00a0 In another revelation, it emerged that the Pirates of the Caribbean star made \"Amber Turd\" jokes after blaming her for poo he found in their bed the day after her 30th birthday party on April 21, 2016. \u00a0Depp denies ever hitting his ex-partner Heard and rejects her claims that he was violent during their brief 18-month marriage.",
