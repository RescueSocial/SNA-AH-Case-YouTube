            "description": "Dr Amber Batson returns to CAM to discuss abnormal behaviours that can be associated with pain following her fantastic lives on sleep quality and chronic pain. Abnormal behaviour and pain is a hugely important topic. Recent work from the team at Lincoln University suggests that between 28-82% of clinical behaviourists\u2019 workload may be associated with underlying painful conditions! Amber explains that we must be vigilant for changes in behaviour, because the term \u2018abnormal behaviour\u2019 means anything out of the normal for that specific dog. Suggesting that deleterious/abnormal behaviours are only those that fall into specific categories such as repetitive or fear-based, will overlook a myriad presentations that are abnormal for that dog and suggest there is an underlying cause driving them that needs investigating. Amber then goes on to present common abnormal behaviours and the categories into which they fall, giving great case examples of dogs that she has seen. The pair take a tangent and discuss the gut microbiome and emerging evidence of its role in the central nervous system and behaviour. There is so much to learn regarding the biome, but there\u2019s a lot of speculative material circulating rather than hard clear evidence and Amber clarifies that bold statements regarding what to feed and when are not within reach yet. Finally, the two bring the conversation back to abnormal behaviours and pain and answer a number of questions posed by CAM followers such as whether we should avoid medications so as to preserve the biome, and how to improve communication with your vet. \n\nCAM is a self funded and self motivated initiative to improve the lives of dogs and their owners.
