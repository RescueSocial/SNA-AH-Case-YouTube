            "description": "The amazing Dr Amber Batson returns to complete her conversation with Hannah Capon on the intricacies of sleep quality and how this can influence chronic pain. After a brief recap on the importance of sleep, Amber talks in more detail about the effect of various medications on sleep quality and notes that some medication which is thought to aid sleep actually disrupts sleep patterns. She then moves on to exercise and sleep quality starting with an explanation of the kind of exercise that dogs have evolved to do as scavengers rather than hunters. Their bodies are more suited to longer duration, slower-paced activity and short bursts of high intensity, high speed movement can adversely affect the quality of their sleep. CAM has always been an advocate of good quality sleep and these sessions with Amber explain why it is so important.\n\nDr Amber Batson graduated from the Royal Veterinary College in 1999. She quickly became very interested in behaviour and undertook a number of qualifications on canine, feline and equine behaviour and welfare. Amber currently works primarily in providing education to owners and professionals in order to improve our understanding of behaviour, both to aid our relationships with animals and also to better recognise and address any health/welfare issues. She feels passionately about bridging the gap between up-to-date science and practical applications of that information.\nShe also continues to work in clinical practice as a behaviourist and as a vet.\n\nCAM is a self funded and self motivated initiative to improve the lives of dogs and their owners.
