The ad mentioned a blown head gasket but not the engine being halfway torn down already. I've already ordered the engine parts so as long as there are no big issues we'll probably have this little manual transmission truck back on the road in a couple days. After that it's going to take a ton of elbow grease and parts to wrap this build up. When it's finished this 1.6L powered beast will be better than new!\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCommon Questions:\n\nWhat motorcycle do I ride? A few. Ducati 1198, Honda Fury, Honda Grom, Honda Ruckus\n\nWhat do I do for a living? Make YouTube videos and work in enterprise data storage. \n\nCan you wheelie? No, I suck.\n\nAre you fast? Sort of. I suck mostly though.\n\nWhere can I keep up with you off the bike? \n\nInstagram: WatchJRGo\n\nFacebook: WatchJRGo (or JRGo, FB hates my branding)\n\nDo you go to school? College, for 2 classes.\n\nWhy do you ride so dangerously? What do mean? I was doing 25.\n\nDo you go to the track? Of course, hopefully there will be videos in the future.\n\nDo you play video games? No, but I might stream N64 Goldeneye at some point. Twitch: WatchJRGo\n\nAre you afraid the police will watch your videos and arrest you? Something something evidence something something warrants and due process of law\n\n#Geo #GeoTracker #CarRebuild",
