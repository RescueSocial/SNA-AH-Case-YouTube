I've gotten to the point in my life where I'm like, \"I can't even have a banana!? Banana!? Fruit!? It's a fruit!!\" Nope,' Amber bemoaned in a video posted to her Instagram account as she walked around a film set.\n\nAs the actress approached the entrance to the stunt rehearsal area, she shrieked, 'I can't even have banana. BANANA! Fruit!'\n\nAmber did not reveal why she had to cut the fruit from her diet, however it stands reason to believe it's part of her training for Aqauman 2.\n\nBack in July Amber shared video of her breaking her Aquaman diet as she indulged in a fork full of peas.\n\n'I can't help it, I can't help it!' Amber said as she helped herself to a bite of the salad. 'I'm breaking the rules 'cause it has peas on it!'\n\nIn the caption she wrote: 'Give peas a chance (peace sign emoji). #aq2diet.'\n\nShe also has been sharing video of her fitness regimen, from her weightlifting exercises to her kicks and jumps.\n\nAmber will be returning to her role of Mera in the upcoming film starring Jason Momoa, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom.",
