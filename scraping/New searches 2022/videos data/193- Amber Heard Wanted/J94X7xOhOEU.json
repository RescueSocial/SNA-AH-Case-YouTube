            "description": "Amber Heard ended a three-week libel case brought by her ex-husband Johnny Depp against the publishers of The Sun newspaper by making a heartfelt statement on the steps of London's High Court on Tuesday.  The 34-year-old actress has found herself at the centre of the trial after agreeing to act as a star witness for The Sun.  Depp is suing the publication for libel as well as the paper's Executive Editor after a comment piece from 2018 branded him a \"wife beater\". Speaking on the steps of the High Court in London, Amber Heard said: \"I travelled here to the UK to testify as a witness to assist the court.  \"After getting a restraining order in 2016 and finalising my divorce I just wanted to move on with my life.  \u00a0 \"I did not file this lawsuit and despite its significance I would have preferred not to be here in court.\"  Heard continued: \"It has been incredibly painful to relive the break-up of my relationship.  \"To have my motives and my truth questioned and the most traumatic and intimate parts of my life with Johnny shared in court and broadcast to the world.  \"I stand by my testimony and I now place my faith in British legal system.\"  \u00a0 Amber went on to speak of her hope that once the case is over that \"resources\" will be focused on more pressing issues, following the delay in various legal proceedings due to the Covid-19 pandemic.  \"I appreciate the dedication and the hard work and support of the defence legal team a well as my US and UK lawyers,\" she continued.  \"I also want to extend my thanks to the very diligent and kind court staff and the police who have been so supportive in ensuring my safety and protection.\"  \u00a0 Amber closed her speech saying: \"My heartfelt thanks for all of the tremendous and overwhelming messages of support I have received from all over the world.  \"You have given me so much strength and I send it back to you. Thank you.\"  The judge will now consider all aspects of the case before making a ruling.  It is thought it could be up to a couple of months before the verdict is reached.",
