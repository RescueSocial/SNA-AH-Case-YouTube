            "description": "Amber Heard was extremely successful after divorcing Johnny Depp: she got cast in the\nbiggest movie franchise of her career - DC's 'Aquaman' - became the spokesperson of\ncosmetics giant L'Or\u00e9al Paris, as well as American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) ambassador\nfor women's rights with a focus on gender-based violence.\nSo many people even claimed they have never heard about Amber until this infamous\ndivorce: \u201cHad no idea who she was until that divorce. I didn\u2019t even know that it was her who\nplayed Mara!\u201d - one fan said.\nHowever, the tables have turned and now Amber Heard is finding that her career as an A-list\nHollywood actress might be over. She has reportedly been kicked from Aquaman 2 and she\nis about to lose the contract with L'oreal Paris.\nSo what was the reason for all of these problematic events for Amber Heard? Apparently,\nher well-planned strategy to ruin Johnny Depp\u2019s life has been shattered. And now no one\nbelieves that Amber is an innocent victim as Johnny showed in a court undeniable evidence\nof Amber being an abuser (audio, text messages and so on).\nHeard lost the appeal to dismiss Johnny Depp\u2019s $50 million defamation lawsuit and we\nlearned that the Aquaman star could be facing up to 3 years of jail time if found guilty of\nmanipulating evidence against her then-husband. But even beyond the former couple\u2019s\nseemingly never-ending legal battle, Heard has come under a lot of fire after evidence\npresented to the court as part of the lawsuit revealed that she\u2019s physically and emotionally\nharassed Depp while twisting the narrative in her favor and painting the Pirates of the\nCaribbean actor as a domestic abuser.\nIn fact, the petition to remove her from Aquaman 2 recently reached a whopping 400,000\nsignatures and is on its way to passing the half-million threshold. This is essentially the same\nkind of backlash and blacklisting that Depp had to endure a couple of years ago, so you can\nsee why fans of the legendary star are asking for justice with such fervency. And now,\naccording to a new report by Cosmic Book News, Warner Bros. has gone forward with firing\nHeard from Aquaman 2 by buying out her contract.\nAlso there was one more petition against Amber Heard. \u201cA liar and an abuser, a shame for\nwomen,\u201d begins one of two Change.org campaigns to remove Amber Heard, 33, from her\nrole as global spokesperson for cosmetics brand L\u2019Or\u00e9al.\nAnd yet, she has claimed in her court declaration countering ex-husband's $50 million\ndefamation suit against her that her career took a serious hit and she received death threats\nthat forced her to constantly keep on changing her contact details.\nHere is what Amber declared in her motion to dismiss Johnny Depp\u2019s lawsuit filed in Fairfax\nCounty, Virginia Circuit Court:\n\"Following my highly-publicized separation from Johnny, I read accounts in the media\nreferring to me as a victim of domestic violence. In response, many people called me a liar\n\n(without ever hearing my story). I was dropped from a global fashion brand's upcoming\ncampaign. I lost a part of a movie in which I had already been cast. People I have never met\nor spoken to threatened me with violence. I received so many death threats I had to change\nmy phone number on a near-weekly basis.\u201d\nIsn\u2019t it fair that her career might be over with Johnny as it started with him?\nAs reported by MEAWW earlier, although Heard's career in the entertainment industry began\nin 2003 when she appeared in two music videos - Kenny Chesney's 'There Goes My Life'\nand Eisley's 'I Wasn't Prepared,\" and went onto star in an array of TV shows and movies, her\ncareer really took off in 2015 \u2014 the same year when she married Depp \u2014 when she had\nprominent roles in four mainstream movies.\n\n\nNow I want to know your opinion. Do you think Amber Heard\u2019s career will be over soon as\nshe destroyed it on her own?
