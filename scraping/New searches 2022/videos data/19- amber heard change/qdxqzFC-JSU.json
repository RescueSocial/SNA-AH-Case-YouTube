It is no longer a question but instead answered.\n\nJudge Nichol even tried to use this 7 million donation as a reason why he believed her. Well, she didn't donate as stated countless times. There's just no way she can spin this. She lied under oath when she said she donated money.\n\nShe said she donated the 7 million...end of story. Instead, she has kept 7 million since 2018.
