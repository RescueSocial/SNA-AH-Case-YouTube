Recorded on the 22nd July 2020.\n\nAbstract:\nWhy should a person interested in Artificial Intelligence, care about competition law? To begin a conversation on this topic, consider how increasing digitalisation has revolutionised not only the marketplace and the way economic actors operate but also consumer experience. However, are developments in this regard always positive? For instance, do digital markets allow for greater transparency and symmetric dissemination of information? Can new actors enter the marketplace easily and expand without any significant hurdles? Assume, for today, that the answer to both these questions is yes. That is, start from the premise that no one player dominates the market and the risk of concentration of power in the hands of one player is reduced. This suggests that digital markets and platforms are largely beneficial for their customers in that they offer them lower prices and greater choice, that is, they increase \"consumer welfare,\" the keystone of current competition policy and market regulation. However, the reality is somewhat more complicated due to digital markets increasingly utilising a range of algorithms which whilst increase transparency in the market, also allow for overt or tacit collusion amongst market competitors which has an adverse impact on competition in the market and on consumer welfare. This paper questions whether given the wide ranging impact of computer generated algorithms, it may be appropriate for competition law to recognise and treat computers as independent market actors and subjects of competition law in their own right; it examines actions of the computers -- algorithms -- that may properly be examined under competition law and explores possible regulation which will not only sanction anti-competitive algorithmic collusion but will also ensure that artificial intelligence/machine learning is, at the very least, trustworthy, legal, ethical and robust. More broadly, it considers how granting \"civil rights\" and/or \"legal personhood\" to an autonomous system such as a robot or an artificial intelligence product, may alter this picture.\n \nBio: Amber Darr is a Lecturer in Law at Coventry University and a Senior Research Fellow at the UCL Centre for Law, Economics and Society.
