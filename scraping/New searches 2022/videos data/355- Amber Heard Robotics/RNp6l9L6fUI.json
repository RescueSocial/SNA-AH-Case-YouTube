            "description": "Dr. Sarah Russell-Smith, 12 May 2021. \n\nSmartShift\u2122 makes home appliances and batteries smarter.\n\nAmber is an innovative Aussie energy company giving households access to the real-time wholesale price of electricity. Customers can make additional savings on power bills by using power at times when it's cheaper and greener, and using less when it's expensive and fossil-fueled.\n\nOur new beta product, SmartShift\u2122, puts these cheaper and greener savings on autopilot. It's technology that optimises everyday home devices (such as electric hot water systems, pool pumps, and household batteries) to lower energy bills. This means a cheaper Amber bill for customers, and greater demand for renewable energy in Australia.\n\nIn mid-2020 we began trialling SmartShift\u2122 with eligible customers in South Australia, with support from the SA government. We plan to make SmartShift\u2122 available in other states soon. The focus of this talk will be to share the initial results of SmartShift\u2122 trial.\n\nThis webinar is the final in a series of eight webinars on consumer-centric energy, being held between October 2020 and May 2021, co-hosted by the Energy Transition Hub and the Climate and Energy College, sponsored by the Victorian Clean Technology Fund.",
