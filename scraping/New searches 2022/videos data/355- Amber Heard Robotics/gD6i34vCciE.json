Further, a well-established program that becomes sustainable can be used in broader impacts programs of future proposals in related fields. However, these programs can be difficult to develop, time-consuming to implement, and challenging to attract a large number of participants. The purpose of this session is twofold. First, we will use two examples of STEM challenges we host at the Center for Science and the Schools (CSATS) at Penn State to illustrate some of the obstacles and solutions we have found in the development and implementation of these programs. Second, we will begin to form an affinity group of BI professionals involved or interested in this style of BI program.",
