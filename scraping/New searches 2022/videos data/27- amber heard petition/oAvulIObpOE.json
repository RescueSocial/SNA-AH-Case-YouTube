            "description": "Subscribe I n  News English YouTube Channel To All The Big News Of The World.\n\nA petition to remove Amber Heard from Aquaman 2 reaches over 900K signatures. Heard first appeared as Mera, the princess of Xebel, one of the underwater kingdoms, in Zack Snyder's Justice League in 2017. She went on to reprise her role opposite Jason Momoa in 2018's Aquaman, now the highest-grossing DC movie of all time. Heard is set to return for Aquaman 2 in 2022.\n\nHeard has lately been the center of a controversy with ex-husband Johnny Depp. Depp and Heard, who met on the set of the 2011 film The Rum Diary, married on Depp\u2019s private island in the Bahamas in 2015. After filing for divorce in 2016, Heard obtained a restraining order against Depp, accusing him of physically and verbally abusing her. Other allegations against the actor included Depp trying to have Heard fired from Aquaman and prevent her from being hired on other Warner Bros. projects. All of the troubling allegations led to criticism over Depp being cast as Grindelwald in the Fantastic Beasts films in 2016. Depp sued Heard for defamation in 2019, after she wrote an op-ed for The Washington Post claiming to be a victim of domestic violence during their short-lived marriage. Depp also sued the U.K. publication The Sun after they called him a \"wife-beater\" in one of their articles. The case went to trial in July, and last Monday the judge ruled against Depp, stating that he belied there was enough evidence to support Heard's claims. Shortly after, Depp announced that he was asked to resign from Fantastic Beasts 3, with the studio confirming he would be recast.",
