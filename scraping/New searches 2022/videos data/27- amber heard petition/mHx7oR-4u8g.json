            "description": "Johnny Depp Reacts To Being Left Out Of NEW Pirates & The Caribbean...\nThe court and public battle between Amber Heard and Johnny has been raging on for so long that it's honestly hard to pinpoint where certain things began and where certain things have ended. But with every victory or delay or defeat that has happened, both sides have helped make it clear exactly where they stand on certain things.
