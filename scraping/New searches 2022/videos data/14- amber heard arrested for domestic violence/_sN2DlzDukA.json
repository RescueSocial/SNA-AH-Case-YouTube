The full version was recorded by Johnny Depp and Amber Heard during their marriage (September 2015). The full recording is being used as evidence in the Johnny Depp v The Sun UK libel case.

It was incomplete.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to read the official case documents, they can be found here: https://www.nickwallis.com/depp-trial\n\nThis recording was obtained through CourtTV and can be found here: https://www.courttv.com/news/amber-heard-witness-statements-depp-blamed-the-monster-for-physical-verbal-abuse/\n\nYou can listen to the FULL recording here: https://youtu.be/k9pbrBmHI58\n\nComments are disabled to combat abuse.",
