A source connected with Amber says she advanced the money, relying on Johnny paying her the settlement. \r\nSources also said that although Amber made it a point to send Children's Hospital the money, she didn\u0092t get to proceed because she and Johnny began squabbling over the settlement deal.\r\nAmber's lawyer, Pierce O'Donnell, says he's confident the settlement will be signed very soon.",
