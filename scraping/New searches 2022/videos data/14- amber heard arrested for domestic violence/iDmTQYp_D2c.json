We don\u2019t have anything else to say. Ms Heard is moving on and we do not want to engage in this nonsense.\u201d \u00a0Heard, 32, hinted at the bizarre row when she filed for divorce. She got a temporary restraining order, claiming Depp made \u201cparanoid and irrational accusations about some delusional idea\u201d. \u00a0She alleged that during the row: \u201cHe began obsessing about something untrue and his demeanour changed dramatically. He became angry.\u201d  \u00a0A month later, in May 2016, the couple had another row about the poo. It was during this that Amber alleges Johnny threw her mobile phone at her, hitting her in the face. \u00a0Two policemen who attended the scene have since claimed in legal papers there were no marks on her face. Heard withdrew the request for a restraining order when their divorce was settled. \u00a0Depp denies domestic violence. A representative did not respond to requests for comment. \u00a0The couple\u2019s dogs, Pistol and Boo, hit headlines in 2016 when they were smuggled into Australia while Depp was shooting the fifth Pirates of the Caribbean film there. \u00a0He and Heard filmed a bizarre apology. \u00a0She got custody of both dogs when their divorce was settled in January 2017.  \r\n#Blazing, #that, #ended, #JohnnyDepp, #AmberHeard, #marriage, #over, #pile, #POO, #their\r\n#JohnnyDepp, #Pets",
