            "description": "Amber Heard has reportedly decided not to press charges against Johnny Depp over alleged domestic abuse injuries. Johnny has denied all claims of domestic abuse, as Amber has also denied she is attempting to blackmail her estranged husband. Meanwhile, it\u0092s unclear yet as to why Amber has decided to drop those charges. Sources suggest it has something to do with the domestic abuse having started way back last year.\r\nMuhammad Ali has been taken to hospital with breathing problems. The boxing legend hasn\u0092t been seen in public since April. Ali was diagnosed with Parkinson\u0092s syndrome in 1984 - it\u0092s thought the condition was due to the head trauma he received during his boxing career. \r\nJustin Bieber and Rita Ora were seen partying together during a night out in Los Angeles. It just so happened that Rita suffered a wardrobe malfunction while climbing out of her car and Justin hid his face from cameras as a result!\r\nBilly Ray Cyrus talked about his daughter Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth's rekindled relationship on The Today Show. Billy addressed the rumours and their reconciliation in the best possible way, saying, \"they\u0092re really happy together right now, and if they want a preacher, they\u0092ve got one!\"",
