Jul 11, 2018  \u00a0AceShowbiz -   Johnny Depp has amended a knuckle tattoo he originally had inked in honour of his former wife Amber Heard.  The \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" star initially had the word \"SLIM\", his nickname for Amber, tattooed across his right hand after their 2015 wedding, but months after their bitter split in 2016, he had the skin art altered to read \"SCUM\".  Now it seems Johnny has chosen to update the piece once more.  His Hollywood Vampires bandmate Tommy Henriksen recently shared a photo of Depp's latest tattoo change online, revealing he's had a red anarchy symbol inked over the \"U\", so it now reads \"SCAM\".  Johnny has yet to comment on the reason for his tattoo change, but he separated from actress Amber in May, 2016, when she accused him of domestic abuse. They settled the nasty divorce last year.
