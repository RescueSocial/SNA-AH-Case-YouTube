            "description": "Amber N. Wiley, Ph.D. (UVA alumna, MArH), is an assistant professor of art history at Rutgers University specializing in architecture, urbanism, and African American cultural studies. Her research interests are centered on the social aspects of design and how it affects urban communities - architecture as a literal and figural structure of power. She focuses on the ways local and national bodies have made the claim for the dominating narrative and collective memory of cities and examines how preservation and public history contribute to the creation and maintenance of the identity and \u201csense of place\u201d of a city. Wiley was named a 2016 Emerging Scholar by Diverse: Issues in Higher Education magazine, was awarded the inaugural H. Allen Brooks Travelling Fellowship from the Society of Architectural Historians and is an active leader in preservation policy. Her publications cover African American cultural heritage, urbanism in New Orleans, school design, urban renewal, and preservation.",
