This is because it has been reported that she is going to be removed from Aquaman 2. Not only that she is going to be kicked out from the cast of Aquaman 2, but she is also losing a contract with L'Oreal Paris. \n\nNumber 7: The Scheme\nAs we all know, Amber Heard had recently set up a seemingly unbreakable scheme against Johnny Depp in an attempt to ruin his life but this plan was foiled when some evidence was brought forth in court showing that Johnny Depp was indeed the one being wronged. Audio text messages, lost chats, and other pieces of evidence were brought to light and this has exonerated Johnny Depp greatly. Because of this, there is a high chance that Amber Heard will be sent to prison for three years if she is found guilty, although I think she's going to be found guilty. \n\nNumber 6: The Petition\nOf recent, the petition that was signed for her to be kicked out of Aquaman has reached over 400,000 signatures and has almost clinched the 500,000 thresholds. With all this, it is not a shock that Johnny Depp's fans are seeking Justice against Amber Heard. She also said that her career was heavily damaged and she had received multiple threats from a lot of people which made her change her phone number many times.  \n\nNumber 5: The Rising Star \nAlthough Amber Heard's entertainment career started in 2003 when she starred in two music videos and also showed up in some movies, her career took a great leap in 2015 when she married Johnny Depp. During that time, she had four major roles in four different huge movies. She starred in movies like Magic Mike XXL, The Danish Girl, The Adderall diaries, and last but not least, the popular musical drama known as One More Time. Her career skyrocketed even more after this. In 2017, she joined the DCEU also known as the DC extended universe and was cast as Aquaman's queen in Justice League. \n\nNumber 4: Johnny\u2019s Testament \nJohnny Depp also testified that he knew Amber Heard had a plan to come after his fame and money. He said she was incredibly beautiful and she showed some interest in him which made him fall for her. He said she tricked him with what appeared to be love but he later realized that she had a plan of her own. \n\nNumber 3: The Analysis \nA lot of her videos were analyzed in court by so many body language analysts who proved that she was indeed lying. If you watch some of the videos, you will notice that during some interviews, she rolled her eyes and smiled as she talked about hitting Johnny Depp. She denied she ever hit him and if you watch the video closely you would notice that the way she was behaving was strange. \n\nNumber 2: The Website and the Anonymous Personality \nHave you heard about the news and entertainment website known as LatestLY? Well, an anonymous source posted saying that Amber Heard failed her physical examination. This is also mentioned that she added some weight and was in bad shape and that the contract that was signed by her required her to be in good form in Aquaman 2. The claim went viral and Ryan Parker; an editor for Hollywood reporters went on Twitter and mentioned that he was informed by a reliable source that the rumors of Amber Heard being kicked off Aquaman 2 were all lies.\n\nNumber 1: Bad Reputation\nA lot of people mentioned that the main reason Amber was not popular in Hollywood was that she has a bad reputation. It was also brought to light that the only sensible role Amber has ever gotten was the role of Mera in Aquaman. She also had not-so-great roles in movies like Magic Mike XXL and The Danish Girl. She also made a name for herself being an advocate for people who suffered from what Johnny suffered and this is a huge reason people did not believe Johnny Depp was who Amber Heard claimed he was. A lot of people also said that Amber Heard gave them bad vibes when talking to her.\n\nViral Film Talk is the #1 celebrity channel dedicated to bringing fans the latest celebrity news, best tv shows, movies, entertainment, and exclusive video commentaries & more.
