She says that glass from one such assault sliced the top of Depp\u2019s finger off.\n\nAnd then she mocked him. Because she knew no one would believe his word over hers.\n\nYou think life is fair?\n\nThis is a man who was physically assaulted by his wife and then torn down on global television because we all love a villain.\n\nWe all love a villain, even when they\u2019ve done nothing wrong.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMy wife was killed on the way home from work, August 31st 2020, Colorado Springs Colorado on Highway 94. She was just trying to get home. State patrol says that they think she reacted to a deer or someone in her Lane( no Witnesses) . She swerved to miss them and lost control of the vehicle and went into the westbound Lane and was T-boned and and crushed to death almost instantly. She was a school teacher for a local school district. She taught second grade. The kindest person you could ever meet. She was 36 never lied, cheated, stole. The kindest most moral person you could meet, an Earth Angel. Did all the right things in life had a master's degree, good career. We are planning to have a baby that year. She was robbed of everything in seconds and so I now I come home to an empty house. My best friend is gone, my soulmate, the love of my life, my everything is gone. We have been married for 15 years, all gone. How fair is that, that's our story of how unfair life can suddenly be. There are no guarantee tomorrow's as we all know. Cherish what you have it can be taken from you in seconds. Next time you get into your vehicle take a good look at your home, it might be the last time you ever see it. You never know, car accidents are all far too common these days. \ud83d\ude14",
