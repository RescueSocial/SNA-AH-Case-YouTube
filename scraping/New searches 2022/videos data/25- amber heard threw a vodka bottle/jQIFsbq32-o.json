So far, 4935 have signed. \u00a0It comes after Depp fans launched another petition to have Amber removed from Aquaman 2, calling for Warner Bros. to take action against the star amid the domestic abuse allegations.  \u00a0Nearly 350,000 people have signed the petition. \u00a0Metro.co.uk has reached out to Amber Heard\u2019s rep.  \u00a0In November, it was reported Amber is trying to get Depp\u2019s defamation lawsuit dismissed and it has now been pushed back to August 2020.  \u00a0She and Depp married in 2015, before divorcing two years later in 2017.  \u00a0In May 2016, Amber filed for a domestic violence restraining order against Depp, accusing him of abusing her. Depp denied the claims and the exes settled their divorce out of court for \u00a35.6million.  Need support?
