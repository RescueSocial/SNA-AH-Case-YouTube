Johnny met Amber on the sets of the Movie \"The Rum Diary\" in 2011. The couple dated for a few years before finally getting married in February 2015. However Josh Richman who was present there at the wedding said that Johnny's friends were not \u201cTHAT\u201d happy about the marriage. He also said that she was always manipulative and emotionally abusive. None of Johnny's friends wanted him to marry her. He also said that Amber used to keep Johnny away from his real friends. Amber filed the divorce case stating that she was physically abused under the effect of drugs and alcohol. She also stated an incident in which Depp allegedly threw his phone at her which leaved a bruise on her face. However a police spokesman said that no crime was found under his investigation. Johnny denies all the allegations saying that this was an attempt to secure a premature financial resolution by alleging abuse. However Amber did receive $7 million from the divorce which according to THE PEOPLE was donated to charity. The divorce was settled one year after the case was filed. And a non-disparagement clause was inserted into the settlement. This clause was to prevent either party from saying anything negative about the relationship\n\nSubscribe To Celeb Daily: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfQKp0ceRBlIs3oV8pabRhw\n\n#AmberHeard #JohnnyDepp #justiceforjohnnydepp #celebrity #celebritynews",
