Ms Heard's sister was also present. I cannot recall the specifics of what was being said but there was a lot of shouting mixed in with some moments of calmer communication. This argument lasted approximately 60 to 90 minutes.\" \u00a0After claiming the argument got \"louder and more intense,\" McGivern said he entered the room and after around 30 minutes Ms Heard threw a can of Red Bull. \u00a0McGivern continued: \"After Ms Heard threw the can of Red Bull, I recognized that Ms Heard had access to a variety of other items that she could throw from her position. I therefore moved next to Mr Depp to ensure that he would not get hit by anything else.",
