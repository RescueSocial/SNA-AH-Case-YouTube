            "description": "Johnny Depp has confirmed he left a rented home in Australia \"wrecked\" after an argument with his ex-wife Amber Heard. \u00a0Giving testimony in his libel trial against News Group Newspaper yesterday, the 57-year-old spoke about his 2015 stay in the property. \u00a0Depp is suing the NGN group after they published a 2018 article which branded him as a \"wife-beater\" \u2013 a claim he denies. \u00a0NGN's legal representation, Sasha Wass QC, asked the actor about the damage caused to the house, which occurred while he relocated down under to work on a Pirates of The Caribbean film. \u00a0After an argument with his then-wife Heard, Depp admitted they left the house \"wrecked\".   \u00a0MC Wass claimed there had been \"five-figure sums\" worth of damage done, with one of Depp's staff estimating the figure amounted to $150,000 (\u00a3120,000). \u00a0The court heard that a member of Depp's team sent a message after the argument, which read: \"I have got a lot of blood off the floor. I scrubbed the paint off.'' \u00a0The floor also had to be sanded for restoration, and Depp's blood was discovered on two sofas. \u00a0A window and a television, worth $15,000 (\u00a312,000), were smashed in the process of the row.   \u00a0When MC Wass asked Depp whether he remembered the window or TV breaking, he said he didn't. \u00a0The actor confirmed there was \"quite a lot of blood\" but claimed his ex-wife was responsible for the damage, though he conceded he was \"party\" to the damage. \u00a0Depp told the court: \"She broke two bottles one of which took the tip off my finger.\" \u00a0When asked about the bloodstains on the sofa, he replied: \"That was me bleeding.\"  \u00a0Depp was hospitalised after the row, but first, he scrawled notes on the mirror in his own blood and applied the blood to the lampshades and walls, the court heard. \u00a0During the argument, Depp's finger was severed, which he claimed happened when Heard threw a vodka bottle in his direction. \u00a0MC Wass alleged the argument concerned the couple's pre-nuptial agreement, which Depp confirmed, claiming Heard grew upset after discovering documentation regarding the agreement. \u00a0Throughout the argument, there was shouting, screaming and the smashing of glass from the window, the court heard.  \u00a0MC Wass also alleged that Depp urinated in the house before he was taken to hospital. \u00a0The court heard that Heard claimed Depp had consumed a bottle of vodka, a bottle of Malbec wine, and 10 ecstasy pills. \u00a0In a text he sent to his doctor in the aftermath, which was read to the court, he said Heard was \"as full of s**t as a Christmas goose,\" calling her a \"malicious, evil and vindictive c***\". \u00a0He continued: \"She is so f*****g ambitious. That is probably why I was acquired, mate.\"",
