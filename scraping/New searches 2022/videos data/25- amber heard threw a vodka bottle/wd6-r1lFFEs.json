            "description": "Johnny Depp #AmberHeard Courtroom Showdown, Series Of Claims And Accusations Explained\n#JohnnyDepp is suing the British newspaper The Sun for a 2018 article which labelled him as a wife beater. The trial started on 7 July 2020 and both Head and Depp have been giving their own version of what happened. \n\nIt is slightly difficult to know what is true and what isn\u2019t, but it is like watching a movie. We bring you the top moments from Amber Depp abuse case based on headlines we have seen. \n\n1. Depp accuses Heard of manipulating him into a relationship. \n\nThe two met on set in 2011 while filming for \u201cThe Rum Diary\u201d and married in February 2015 before filing for divorce in May 2016 which formally concluded in 2017. So a very short marriage. \n\nAccording to several media reports, he has described the actress as \"a narcissist\" who's \"calculating,\" and \"sociopathic\". According to him \u201cshe had an agenda, namely to get married to me in order to progress her own career and/or to benefit financially, and she knew how to bring it about.\u201d \u201cShe presented herself as a carbon copy of me, with precisely the same interests, thoughts, favorite writers, taste in music and art as me,\" he claimed\n\nApparently she went as far as telling him she admired all his films except he later discovered she hadn\u2019t seen any of them. \n\n2. He claims she \"severed his finger with the second of two thrown vodka bottles\" and put out a cigarette on his face during a March 2015 row in Australia. \n\nShe says he caused the injury himself when he smashed a telephone against a wall.\n\nApparently he then used the blood from his hand to write \u201cI love you\u201d on the mirror as well as accusing her of being a fraud and cheating on him with Billy Bob Thornton.  \n\nAmber then supposedly had a mental breakdown \u201cbegging Johnny not to leave the house\u201d while also \u201cscreaming at him for running away.\u201d According to Johnny\u2019s body guard. \n\nThey used a coverup story of injuring his finger while cutting onions to avoid bad press. \n3. In the same incident in Australia Amber says it was a \u201cthree-day ordeal of physical assault\u201d and she was \u201cscared for her life\u201d\nAmber says that he spat in her face, choked her against a fridge causing her to run to the bathroom. By the end, she had \"a broken lip, swollen nose and cuts all over her body.\"\n\nApparently, they had also caused $150,000 worth of damage to the property including leaving blood on sofas and urinating on walls. \n\n4. Amber or one of her friends defacated in the bed\n\nThe day the marriage was called off was the day Amber or supposedly one of her friends defecated in the bed in their department. She later said it had just been \u201ca harmless prank\u201d. \n\nThen when the housekeeper sent the pictures to Depp of the faeces, Heard accused her of trying to ruin her marriage. \n\n\u201cMs. Heard continued to disagree with me, but I wanted to end the conversation as quickly as possible,\" said the housekeeper on the sixth day of trial. \"She has a bad temper in my opinion, and I did not want her to yell at me.\" Amber's team, meanwhile, has suggested that it was actually Johnny \u2014 who started referring to his missus as \"Amber Turd\" \u2014 who defecated in the bed.\n\n5. Amber accused Johnny of hanging her dog out of the window \n\nDepp denied the claim that he held one of her two tea cup puppies out of moving vehicle which he denied but when confronted of their long running joke about putting the pup in the microwave, he didn\u2019t deny and fessed up to giving him hashish on one occasion claiming that the dog \u201cscooped it up before he could do anything about it\u201d\n\n6. Johnny wanted to drown and burn his wife\n\n The Sun presented texts as evidence between the Paul Bettany and Johnny who took drugs together, where Johnny joked about drowning and burning his then-wife \"to make sure she's dead.\" In one exchange, they joked about buying a pet beaver for Amber and then recording Johnny shaving it so they could post a clip online titled \"Johnny Depp shaves Amber Heard's beaver.\"\n\n7. Depp kicked her after accusing her of having an affair with Faro then accused her of crying about it. \n\nHe says he confronted her and then locked himself into the plane\u2019s bathroom where he slept all night. \n\n8. She haymarkered him\n\nDepp says when he told Amber he lost $750 million in a shady deal on the night of her birthday party she tried to punch him. She says he threw a champagne bottle, pulled her hair, grabbed her by the throat and pushed her and her sister. \n\nDepp gave his daughter drugs at 13\n\nDepp\u2019s drug habit is well known, but apparently he also gave his daughter Lily-Rose Depp, marijuana when she was just 13. He claims it\u2019s because he would rather give her good quality drugs than something she would purchase from another dealer. He also claims that he checked with her mother Venessa Paradis first. \nAmber stole her PAs sex abuse story\nAccording to the former PA she stole the story and made it into her own Many other abuse stories between Depp and Amber including her cheating with Elon Musk.",
