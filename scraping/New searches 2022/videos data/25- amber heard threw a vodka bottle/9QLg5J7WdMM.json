            "description": "Johnny Depp's former estate manager Ben King was in court today giving evidence in day seven of the actor's libel trial against The Sun. \u00a0Depp, 57, is suing the tabloid\u2019s publisher News Group Newspapers (NGN) and its executive editor Dan Wootton over an April 2018 article branding the actor a \"wife beater\". \u00a0King says he worked for the actor in October 2014 in London, 2015 in Australia and a year later in Vancouver, Canada. \u00a0The estate manager said he was tasked with finding the star's severed finger. \u00a0Depp claims that his finger was cut off during an altercation with his ex-wife Amber Heard, claiming she threw a vodka bottle at him during a trip to Australia.  \u00a0The actor also claims he used his severed finger to write a bloody message on a mirror. \u00a0In a previous statement, Heard claimed he'd hurt his hand while smashing a plastic phone against the wall repeatedly and she was not present at the time of the injury. \u00a0King was shown the video, which was played on day one of the trial and again yesterday, of Depp kicking kitchen cupboards and pouring himself a pint of red wine for breakfast.  \u00a0Asking about the actor's behaviour on the video Sasha Wass, QC for The Sun asked: \"Did you ever see Mr Depp conduct himself like that during the time you worked for him?' \u00a0Mr King answered he had not. \u00a0King said he learned from the media that Depp lost his finger when a vodka bottle was allegedly thrown at him. \u00a0Ms Wass asked: \"You were not told at the house or at any time when you were working you were not told this explanation?\"  \u00a0King replied: \"I don't recall being told that.\" \u00a0Ms Wass said on March 8, 2015 the scene was \"chaos\" and the house was \"wrecked\", as Mr King agreed \"it was not in a good state\". \u00a0Ms Wass said Mr King was tasked with finding Depp's severed digit, as King replied: \"It wasn't my job but I was told it may be somewhere while I was cleaning up.\"  \u00a0King was tasked with cleaning up the house after the row in which Heard claims Depp pushed her into a ping-pong table, choked her against a fridge and throttled her. \u00a0Depp has admitted he wrote on a mirror in blood from his severed finger. \u00a0Talking about cleaning up after a fight at their house in Australia, King said: \"There was blood in the bar area. \u00a0\"There was a trail of blood up the stairs and then bloodspots in one bedroom mainly, but then a couple of other rooms.\"",
