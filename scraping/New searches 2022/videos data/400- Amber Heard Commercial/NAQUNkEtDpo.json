            "description": "Canada's wireless telecommunications industry, in partnership with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), the Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) and AMBER Alert agencies across the country, created the Wireless AMBER Alerts program in May 2010. The initiative, hosted and powered in-kind by OLSON, allows customers of most Canadian wireless service providers to opt-in to receive free AMBER Alerts as text messages on their cell phones.\r\n\r\nWireless AMBER Alerts add a valuable method to assist AMBER Alert agencies in providing the public with immediate and up-to-date information about a child's abduction, and to solicit the public's help in the safe and swift return of the child.\r\n\r\nThe completely free Wireless AMBER Alerts program is available to cell phone users in all 10 provinces and three territories. Subscribing is easy to do either online at www.WirelessAMBER.ca or directly from your wireless device by texting AMBER to 26237 (AMBER).\r\n\r\nThe wireless industry extends its sincere appreciation to the thousands of Canadians and our industry partners and ambassadors that have joined together to ensure that our most precious citizens can count on us when they may need us most. This new PSA is designed to encourage all Canadians to invest the few short minutes it takes to register, because \"together, we can find a child\".",
