            "description": "Johnny Depp's security guard of seven years Travis McGivern has claimed he saw Amber Heard be physically violent towards the Hollywood actor.  Speaking to the High Court in London, McGivern said he saw Ms Heard throw a can of Red Bull at Depp before she spat on him and punched him with a closed first in the face.  Mr McGivern said under oath: \"On 23 March 2015, I was working a security shift at Mr Depp\u2019s residence where Mr Depp was also staying at the time.  \"At some time between 4 am to 6 am, Mr Depp contacted me and asked me to come to Penthouse 5, which is the penthouse he owns in the Building adjacent to his principal home in Penthouse 3. He also asked me to bring a nurse who works for Mr Depp called Debbie Lloyd.  \"I do not recall him specifying why he wanted Nurse Lloyd to come.

I cannot recall the specifics of what was being said but there was a lot of shouting mixed in with some moments of calmer communication. This argument lasted approximately 60 to 90 minutes.\" \u00a0 After claiming the argument got \"louder and more intense\" McGivern said he entered the room and after around 30 minutes Ms Heard threw a can of Red Bull.  McGivern continued: \"After Ms Heard threw the can of Red Bull, I recognized that Ms Heard had access to a variety of other items that she could throw from her position. I therefore moved next to Mr Depp to ensure that he would not get hit by anything else.  \"At this point, Ms Heard was standing on the landing above Mr Depp and I witnessed her spit on Mr Depp from above.

Approximately 10 minutes before we left, I witnessed Ms Heard punch Mr Depp in the eye with a closed fist.\"  McGivern went on to claim it was `one-sided' fight with Heard the aggressor.  \u00a0He said: \"After Ms Heard punched him I walked him downstairs to get him out of the situation to protect him.\"  \u00a0Cross examining him, Wass QC acting on behalf of The Sun said: \"You are lying about your description in order to assist Mr Depp who was extremely angry and extremely violent on that occasion?\"  \u00a0 McGivern replied: \"No maam. I'm not lying.\"   \u00a0 The revelations come on day nine of Depp's libel case against The Sun and it's Executive Editor Dan Wootton.  Amber Heard is The Sun's star witness in the case.",
