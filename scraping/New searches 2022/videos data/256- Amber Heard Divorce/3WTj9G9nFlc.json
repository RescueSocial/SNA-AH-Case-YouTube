            "description": "Amber Heard has filed for divorce from Johnny Depp , shockingly 3 days after Johnny's mom died.\nAmber filed her divorce petition Monday, citing irreconcilable differences. The couple married in February of last year, yet Amber is asking for spousal support. \nOur sources say the couple had NO prenup.\nIt's especially harsh because Johnny was extremely close to his mother. She says in the divorce docs that they separated on May 22 , 2 days after Johnny's mom passed.\nAs if that's not enough. Johnny's new movie, \"Alice Through the Looking Glass,\" opens Friday.\nThe last time we saw them together was awkward, to say the least their video apology for the dog smuggling incident in Australia.\n\nSubscribe to Celebritytalkies Youtube Channel !\nFollow us on Google + : http://goo.gl/EKVtqu",
