            "description": "Amber Heard has filed for divorce from her husband of just over a year, Johnny Depp.\n\nA source confirms to Us Weekly that the 30-year-old actress decided to legally pull the plug on their relationship on Monday, May 23. According to TMZ, which was first to report the news, the actress cited \"irreconcilable differences\" as the reason for her filing.\nThe pair have not been spotted together in public as of late. The Alice Through the Looking Glass actor was supposed to attend the Met Ball at the beginning of the month, but backed out at the last minute.\n\nThough they have largely kept the details of their relationship under wraps, the Hollywood couple has occasionally expressed their affections for one another to the press.\n\nDepp, 52, expressed his gratitude for Heard\u2019s unwavering support in January at the Palm Springs International Film Festival. \u201cI also have to thank my wife, Amber, for putting up with me, for living with all these characters, which can\u2019t be easy,\u201d he said as he accepted the Desert Palm Achievement Award, in reference to his many eccentric roles over the years. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for me \u2014 it\u2019s got to be hard for her.\u201d\n\nThe couple, who have a 22-year age difference, tied the knot twice in February 2015 \u2014 once at their West Hollywood home, and then again in a beautiful beach ceremony in the Bahamas. (The pair met on the 2011 set of The Rum Diary.)\n\nAnd in a November interview with Marie Claire, Heard called being a stepmother to Depp\u2019s two children \u2014 Lily-Rose, 16, and Jack, 14 \u2014 \u201cthe greatest, most surprising gift.\u201d She told the mag: \u201cI feel new flavors that I didn\u2019t know existed. New colors that I didn\u2019t know existed have been added to my life. I\u2019m so happy.\u201d",
