            "description": "New Delhi, March 26 (ANI): She came out publicly about her bisexuality in 2010 and now, Amber Heard has opened up about how difficult it was. Speaking at The Economist's Pride & Prejudice event at New York, the \u2018Danish Girl\u2019 star claimed that the filmmakers doubted whether she could play a straight woman in a romantic lead, reports The Independent. Heard was quoted saying, \u201cIt was not easy. I was the only one working in this way, so it was definitely difficult because no one had done it.\u201d The 30-year-old actress added, \"I did that even though everyone told me it would end my career, without a doubt.\" The actress also shared about her \"coming out\" announcement and why she never hid her sexuality. \u201cWhen I hear someone comment about me coming out, I think it's funny because I was never in. Then I realised the gravity of what I had done.\u201d On a related note, Amber Heard will be next seen in Zack Snyder\u2019s \u2018Justice League\u2019 alongside Ben Affleck. \n--------------------------------------\nEnjoy and stay connected with us!!\n\u261b Follow us: https://twitter.com/ani_news\n\u261b Like us: https://www.facebook.com/ANINEWS.IN\n\u261b Visit our Official website: http://www.aninews.in/\n\u261b Send your suggestions/Feedback: shrawankp@aniin.com",
