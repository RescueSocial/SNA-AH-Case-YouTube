She alleged that Depp had physically abused her during their relationship, and said it had been usually while under the influence of medication or alcohol. She alleged that at the time of filing for divorce, an occasion had recently taken place during which Depp threw his phone at her, leaving her with a bruised face. However, a police representative told individuals who an examination concerning the homegrown episode radio call tracked down that no wrongdoing had occurred. Depp denied these charges and through his representatives said Heard was \"endeavoring to get an untimely monetary goal by asserting maltreatment.\" \n\nAmber Heard's father threatened to shoot Johnny Depp during the couple's harsh separation, consistent with a witness within the actor's defamation case. David Killackey, who worked on both Heard and Depp's classic cars at his California shop Performance Allison Transmissions within the wake of their 2016 split, claimed that Heard was abusive toward him while her father, David Heard, made 'death threats' toward Depp on telephone calls. Killackey's allegations were delivered to light within the court battle over Depp's $50million accusing Heard of defaming him by writing in an exceedingly Washington Post op-ed that she was a survivor of force.She never named him in it yet Depp claims that in light of the fact that their harsh separation was so open, it induced he had been savage towards her - something he demands could be clearly false.\n\nDepp's say that Killackey's account proves that Heard was motivated by money to talk out against her ex-husband. In documents obtained by The Blast, Killackey portrayed a few 'very threatening' discussions with both Heard and her dad after he moved toward them about paying for the fixes to their vehicles.\n\nKillackey said the abuse began after he told Heard that each one's work on the cars would need to be paid directly, instead of through Depp's management. 'I received what can only be described as a very hostile response from Amber,' he said within the documents. 'I did my best to convey to her that I failed to wish to induce within the middle of the dispute between her and Mr. Depp. She failed to receive this information okay.\n\nDepp's Adam Waldman said Killackey's record firmly upholds the contention that she blamed the entertainer for maltreatment for monetary reasons. 'Mr. Killackey's chilling direct involvement in Amber Heard and her family uncovered the thought process behind Amber Heard's maltreatment deception \u2013 cash,' Waldman disclosed to The Blast. 'Money is why Amber Heard moved her sister and 4 other co-conspirators into Johnny Depp's multimillion-dollar penthouses rent-free. Money is why Amber Heard chopped Mr. Depp's finger off with a tossed vodka bottle the day his requested that she consent to a postnuptial arrangement. 'Cash is the reason Amber Heard trapped Mr. Depp with a maltreatment lie the day he educated her he was separating from her. Cash is the reason Amber Heard's PR team sent Mr. Depp an extortion letter before placing her hoax on the quilt of individuals Magazine. Money is why Amber Heard's father threatened to kill Johnny Depp.' Heard's haven't publicly commented on Killackey's claims.\n\nHeard desires to crush Depp's slander claim by demonstrating her charges that her ex is a drunkard with addictions to drugs who regularly kicked her, beat her and, on occasion, was fierce to the point that she blacked out. Depp denied those allegations and insisted that Heard was the violent one in their relationship, claiming that he needed to possess his finger surgically reattached after she hurled a vodka bottle at him. Heard's have asked the judge to stay the whole case under seal because, she says, she doesn't want private details of their friends and families' lives to become public which they inevitably will if they're submitted as a part of the record. Depp, however, says he has nothing to cover and desires to hash the whole thing out publicly.\n\n#AmberHeard #JohnnyDepp #DavidHeard #JusticeForDepp #JusticeForJohnnyDepp #JohnnyDeppDefamation #Heard #Depp #JohnnyDeppCase #AmberHeardCase #AmberHeardAudio #Aquaman2 #JusticeForJohnnyDepp #TheSpotlight #JohnnyDeppDefamation\n#3JD",
