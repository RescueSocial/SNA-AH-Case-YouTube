After the enormous problem in which the actor has been involved, many studios have closed their doors and many friends have turned their backs on him. However, in difficult times it is always good to know who you can count on. Some had Johnny's back from the beginning and didn't step down even when the pressure from the fans became a lot. Now that the tables are slowly turning in Johnny's favor, he's spoken big thanks to his fans and supporting friends. But what is it exactly that his friends said? And what effect did it have on Amber Heard?\n\n#JohnnyDepp #AmberHerad",
