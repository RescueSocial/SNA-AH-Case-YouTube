            "description": "Johnny Depp\u2019s wife, actress Amber Heard, has been charged for illegally bringing the couple\u2019s dogs to Australia in an incident that led to the country\u2019s agriculture minister warning that the terriers could be euthanized.   \n\nThe Commonwealth Department of Public Prosecutions said Thursday that Heard faces two counts of illegally importing Yorkshire terriers Pistol and Boo into Australia and one count of producing a false document in May.\n\nThe charges carry maximum penalties of 10-years imprisonment and a fine of $102,000 and up to one-year imprisonment and a fine of $10,200, respectively.\n\nA summons has also been issued for her to appear before a Queensland court Sept. 7.\n\nAgriculture Minister Barnaby Joyce told reporters Thursday that he was not concerned that legal actions against Heard could be considered mean internationally.\n\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not. The law is the same for everybody,\u201d the Australian Associated Press quoted him as saying. \u201cThere is no preferential treatment here.\u201d\n\nStressing that a rabies outbreak would be catastrophic, he warned of its possible impact on Australia\u2019s \u201cmassive\u201d wild dog population and bat population in many towns.\n\n\u201cWe've got enough problems with them [bats], let alone if they became rabid,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Australian cited a Department of Agriculture spokesperson as confirming the summons issued to Heard.\n\n\u201cAll animals entering Australia must have an import permit, and have undergone relevant testing and health checks signed off by a government veterinarian from the exporting country to ensure pests and diseases from overseas are not brought here,\u201d she said in a statement.\n\nThe dogs had been brought into Australia while Depp was based on the Gold Coast filming Pirates of the Caribbean 5: Dead Men tell No Tales.\n\nAustralia's ports and airports have some of the toughest screening measures in the world. The country has extremely tight biosecurity laws, given that much of its flora and fauna is unique, and some have no resistance to foreign disease or bacteria. \n\nThe quarantining of dogs is enforced very strictly as some have been found to carry rabies. The minimum period for animals entering Australia is 10 days.",
