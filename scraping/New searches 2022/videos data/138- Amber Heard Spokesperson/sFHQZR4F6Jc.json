Heard was charged Tuesday with two counts of illegally importing the pups, Pistol and Boo, into the country and one count of producing a false document, a spokesman for the Commonwealth Department of Public Prosecutions confirmed to PEOPLE. She has been issued a summons to appear at the Southport Magistrates Court in Queensland on Sept. 7. The importation charges could lead to a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a fine of $75,000. The false document charge carries a penalty of up to a year in prison and a fine of $7,500.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear here, Amber Heard is a white lady, so if she is sent to prison in a foreign country or killed by an immigrant, Obama must call her family personally. I know there\u2019s a country to run, but again, a white lady is in danger. The ANZUS treaty should be totally contingent on Amber Heard being cleared of all charges. The free trade agreement that Bush signed should be revoked and sanctions should be put in place if Amber Heard steps foot in an Australian prison. This may seem extreme, but please understand, Amber Heard is white.",
