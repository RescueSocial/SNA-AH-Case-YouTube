The dogs are Amber\u2019s so she should really have done the thorough checks.\u201d\n\nEven though Amber officially began the legal process to end their union, it was reportedly Johnny who had \u201cenough\u201d of their marriage.The Hollywood couple, who met on the set of \u2018The Rum Diary\u2019, married in a private civil ceremony at their home in Los Angeles in 2015.\n\nDepp and Heard do not have children together, but Depp has a daughter, Lily-Rose and son, Jack from his previous relationship with Vanessa Paradis.",
