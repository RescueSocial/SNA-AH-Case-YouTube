I try to explain on the channel I stole this footage from that they are intersexed couple. You can hear it in his voice.\nGo over to the channel where it is up the whole conversation.\nI think Johnny must have recorded it. It came out in court and then on you tube.  If you hear it, listen for the words that incriminate these two and let you know they are intersexed.  Easy if you know what to look for. I need another listen to it. only when Amber says ,\"Jerking them off\" sounds like\na girl doing guys.  Meaning she says that Depp is doing it or something like that. Enjoy.",
