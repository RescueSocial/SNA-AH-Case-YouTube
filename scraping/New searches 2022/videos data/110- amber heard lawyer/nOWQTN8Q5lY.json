Bruises all over my body, bruises on my forearms from trying to defend the blows. I had 2 black eyes. I had a broken nose. I had a broken lip''Justice Nichols - I believe her. UK Appeals Court - we believe him. But oops ... PHOTO SHOOT! [sic]'  Responding to the post, the 34-year-old actress shared: 'Yes Mr Waldman, I may be wearing makeup on this occasion but on every occasion you will still be short.'As another Twitter user responded, 'I'd rather be short than an abusive gold digger Woman shrugging', Amber hit back, 'It's good to be realistic with your goals'.  Responding to a tweet in Spanish that read, 'Amber Heard talking to Jonny Deep's lawyer regarding a set of photos where she claims she was made wearing makeup to cover hit marks, a broken nostril, bruises and more made by Johnny...but...', the actress replied, 'And so?'Another user tweeted: 'The only reason why jd lost his case is bc he was up against Rupert Murdock, not Amanda Heard. So in VA, it's gonna be vastly different....', as Heard noted, 'It must be so hard'.   Heard also made a statement on Monday as she shared an Instagram post that seemed to be targeted at Depp, 57.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She shared an image of herself leaving the L.A. County Courthouse back in 2016\u00a0after she had filed a temporary restraining order against Depp, and another in the same outfit during the libel trial last summer.\u00a0She penned:\u00a0'One dress, four years apart. Sometimes it's important to wear the same thing twice'.The posts come after Heard\u00a0and British tabloid The Sun said they were vindicated after a UK court refused Depp the right to appeal against a ruling that he was a wife-beater.  The Hollywood actor had sought to challenge a November 2020 ruling in a high-profile libel action that upheld claims in the newspaper that he beat Heard during their stormy marriage.A spokeswoman for Heard said she was was 'pleased - but by no means surprised by the decision', adding the 'evidence presented in the UK case was overwhelming and undeniable'.The Sun said the newspaper 'had every confidence that this leave to appeal application would not be granted and are pleased with today's decision'.Two judges at the Court of Appeal dismissed his application to challenge the High Court ruling, finding that the original hearing had been 'full and fair'.   The trial judge 'gave thorough reasons for his conclusions which have not been shown even arguably to be vitiated by any error of approach or mistake of law'.Depp was unlikely to overturn the findings of a trial judge on purely factual questions, they added.The original ruling saw the Pirates of the Caribbean star ordered to pay",
