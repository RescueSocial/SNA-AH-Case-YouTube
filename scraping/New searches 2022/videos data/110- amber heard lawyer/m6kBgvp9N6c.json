            "description": "A judge denied Johnny Depp's lawyer's request to depose Amber Heard and neighbor Raquel Pennington on Friday, a week before the June 17 court hearing scheduled to determine whether to extend the temporary restraining order issued against Depp. \n\nDepp's lawyer, Laura Wasser, filed a request to compel Heard's deposition immediately. But according to sources and court documents obtained by PEOPLE, the Court denied the motion, reasoning that the original notice of deposition failed to give Heard the required 10-day notice.",
