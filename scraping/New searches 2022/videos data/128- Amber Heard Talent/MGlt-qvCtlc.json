            "description": "That's a really good question, typically through referral. I mean I get most of my business comes through referral-based in connecting with people they know, working well with my clients making a difference for them, and then they want to make a big impact for one of their friends who has a business or someone that they know in their network. So very much so through referral base. \n\nReb Risty Great, great. Well, so the marketing question for you is in your business obviously its very relationship-based. How do you build your referral network? How are you going out in marketing yourself to grow your business? \n\nAmber Gough  I am a big believer in and connecting with people. And so when I am out networking whether it be through just socializing or in a formal networking setting I really strive to be very present. And so in the moment with the person - a matter of fact, my logo is a symbol for presence - and I believe so firmly I show up authentically and I, if I'm listening to someone, really hearing them, what's what their concerns are, what they're really - what their actual needs are, and connecting them with it as people. Then I'm able to serve them better, at whether that be through my business or referring to them to somebody else or what have you. So, I think that my ability to just show up and show someone that I care and that I'm really there with them in that moment, builds trust and people are more likely to refer people to me. \n\nReb Risty: You know another good way to build trust is through webinars. So Amber was just sharing with me, that you've had some success with that. I'd love to hear about what you're doing, what your approach is with webinars. \n\nAmber Gough Absolutely. I was fortunate enough that through networking and connecting with someone. One of my friends, I built that trust, and she said you know, and she does a lot of webinars speaker, author, and she said you need to be teaching webinars. And she connected me with a few organizations that are H.R. (human resources base) which is very big in my industry and my primary contact, and connected me in. And fortunately, they set it up. It's very seamless and easy it only takes my time essentially in building out the PowerPoint presentation and the content in which I'm teaching, and then I'm able to present to as many as, my most recent webinar 800 people dialed in across the nation. \n\nReb Risty  Wow\n\nAmber Gough Yeah. Huge, huge footprint. And then others can actually access that as well through going to their website. I can present that content. It's fantastic. And through that typically at the end of the webinar throughout it you're offering some sort of freebie so it might be a survey or some way of analyzing purpose, you know alignment with a candidate in a company and then they reach out to you. It opens the door to a conversation and you're able to oftentimes convert that into clients. So, it's really powerful. Plus, it's fun. If you're talking about something, you're passionate about and enjoy it can be really, really fun as well. So, I love it.\n\nReb Risty [00:05:26] That's great, yeah. That's some great advice. I know obviously video as we're doing now podcasting, webinars are becoming more popular because people are just seeking information in a, I think in a different way, and they're trying to educate themselves, first, before they make decisions. So that's really, really neat. I love to hear that's working. \n\nAmber Gough [00:05:46] Absolutely and it's such a differentiator of being a subject matter expert too. Like this is what I know this is what I can do. I'm a subject matter expert so people are more likely to come to you, and it kind of builds that trust. \n\nAmber Gough It's really powerful. \n\nReb Risty Right. Well, you heard it here. Content, subject matter expert, referral network, are all very important, especially in professional services. Amber if somebody wants to contact you learn more about what you're doing or how you're doing, how, what's the best way to reach you? \n\nAmber Gough Number one for recruiters: LinkedIn, always.
