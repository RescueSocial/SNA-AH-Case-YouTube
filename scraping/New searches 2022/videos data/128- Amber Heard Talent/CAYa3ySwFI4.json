            "description": "Joining me on the seventh episode of the Sustainable Ambition Podcast is Amber Beam, a collaborator and fellow career coach who brings wisdom around managing your career over time, especially for mid-career changers.\n\nAmber shares her concept around talent mobility, The Growth Effect, and is an advocate for employees and employers to get past old structures and norms to create more growth for both parties. Amber drops many wisdom bombs in this episode, including great advice on how to manage your career in your 20\u2019s, 30\u2019s and 40\u2019s.\n\nIt's hard not to have a good time being in conversation with Amber, so I hope you appreciate her enthusiasm and encouragement to build a career with more flexibility and growth no matter your stage and age.\n\nThank you for sharing so many great insights, Amber! I loved being in conversation with you!\n\nSee the links below for more resources on Sustainable Ambition!\n--------\n\u2022 Subscribe to the newsletter: \nhttps://sustainableambition.com/subsc...\u200b\n\n\u2022 Listen to the Sustainable Ambition Podcast:\n https://sustainableambition.com/podcast\u200b\n\n\u2022 And find it on: \nApple Podcasts: https://apple.co/2Pz4SA8\nGoogle Podcasts: https://bit.ly/3gKtpNy\nSpotify: https://spoti.fi/32RuNGf\nStitcher: https://bit.ly/3t4hYDe\nOvercast: https://bit.ly/3tXiP9O\n\n\u2022 Get your FREE Sustainable Ambition Self-Assessment : https://sustainableambition.com/sasel...\u200b\n\n\u2022 Website: \nhttps://sustainableambition.com/\u200b\n\nStock media provided by Filip Halon, Serhii Kot, and Sahin Koc, courtesy of Pond5 - \nhttps://www.pond5.com/?gclid=Cj0KCQjw1PSDBhDbARIsAPeTqrfCs79VAd59BkMHYleTyN5gvkJDvoE1u0zd6KBFox-6sFDdxN6kFAEaAt2OEALw_wcB",
