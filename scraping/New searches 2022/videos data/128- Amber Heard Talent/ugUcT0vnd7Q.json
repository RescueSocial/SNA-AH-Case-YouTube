Pearson School for the Arts, as well as The Original Kids Theatre Company in London. Amber has appeared in numerous film and television productions, displaying a remarkable range and vulnerability. She is most known for her work as Amy Fleming on CBC's long running series Heartland, now filming season 9.\n\nAmber was awarded with the 2013 Fan Choice Award at the Canadian Screen awards and has kept an intimate relationship with her fans through communication on her Social Media pages.

She has been riding since a very young age and says that the two things she loves the most - acting and horses - have come together to create this dream role of Amy on the Heartland series. Amber loves to be outdoors and enjoys overnight mountain trips with her horses and dogs. As Heartland films in Alberta, she has made a home for herself with her husband on a ranch outside of Calgary where she is surrounded by stunning vistas and of course, her animals.",
