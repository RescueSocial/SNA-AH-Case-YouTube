            "description": "She's been busy promoting her role as Mera in the upcoming Aquaman movie.And Amber Heard didn't appear to be slowing down one bit as she was seen arriving at JFK Airport in New York Saturday.The star, 32, flattered her svelte figure in a pair of skinny jeans as she touched down in the Big Apple.This comes just after it was revealed that her ex-beau Elon Musk has moved on with another woman.The Tesla and SpaceX founder is reportedly dating Tyler Haney, who is the founder and CEO of athletic-apparel startup Outdoor Voices.A source told Page Six that Haney and Musk 'have been dating for a few weeks'.If Heard was bothered by the news, she didn't show it.Amber looked very fashionable during her airport outing.She accentuated her slim figure with a braided leather belt.Tying the look together, the Texas-born talent donned a Western hat and a studded purse at her side while wearing pointy patent leather shoes with a single buckle.Further adding to her accessories, the actress put on a copper pendant necklace, silver earrings and round sunglasses.Heard\u00a0kept her hair down, looking naturally tousled, also keeping her face makeup free.The ex of Johnny Depp also carried a sizable leather purse stuffed with things for the trip.While making her way out of the airport, the Magic Mike XXL actress reached over her head to check her hat before getting into her ride.On Friday the star was in LA, where she attended a benefit for the Syrian American Medical Society.Amber's been dedicated to the plight of Syrian refugees.Her work with the Syrian American Medical Society took her to Zaatari Refugee Camp in Jordan last month, where she spent time with people fleeing violence in their home country.And before that Heard was in Las Vegas promoting her upcoming blockbuster Aquaman, which comes out December 21.This year will also see the release of her film London Fields and the star has three other projects in the pipeline beyond 2018.",
