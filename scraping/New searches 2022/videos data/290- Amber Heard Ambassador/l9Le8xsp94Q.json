            "description": "During our mission to Jordan with SAMS Goodwill Ambassador Amber Heard this April, we met 12-year-old Weam. Weam is a dialysis patient who suffers from a life-threatening condition called thalassemia. She and 12 other children living in Jordan\u2019s al-Zaatari Refugee Camp have not received needed treatments due to high costs and budget cuts earlier this  year. We followed up with Weam in July to check on her progress and her hopes for the future.\n\nTo learn more and support Weam and other youth with Thalassemia in Zaatari Camp, visit Amber Heard's Crowdrise campaign here:  \n\nhttp://crowdrise.com/amberheard",
