            "description": "Johnny Depp 's court case continued today at London's High Court as he arrived at his third day of giving evidence in his libel trial against News Group Newspapers over a story published in The Sun in 2018.  \u00a0In the story, the Pirates of the Caribbean star was labelled a \"wife beater\" in the publication's headline - which he strongly denies. \u00a0During today's appearance, Depp told the court how he used his mangled finger to write a message in blood after severing the top of his finger so the bone could be seen during a row with his ex-wife Amber Heard, who The Sun alleged he was violent towards. \u00a0The A-List actor, 47, recalled the story after Sasha Wass QC, for NGN, asked Depp about an argument he had with ex-wife Heard during a 2015 trip to Australia, where he was filming a Pirates Of The Caribbean movie.   \u00a0The courtroom heard how the couple, who wed in 2015 and divorced in 2017, ended up erupting into a heated row at the house they were renting at the time. \u00a0During which, Depp suffered a severed finger and was left \"feeling upset\" as he admitted to then using the blood soaked stump to write a chilling note on the mirror in the bathroom. \u00a0Ms Wass told the court: \"These [pictures] are of the house - you had written on a mirror. You had dipped your injured finger in paint to write the graffiti.\"   \u00a0Depp than clarified that the message was written in his own blood, adding: \"Yes I started using the blood from my finger... \u00a0Using his own blood as well as paint and lipstick the court heard how Depp scrawled messages on a mirror, a wall and a lampshade. \u00a0Ms Wass asked: \"Why did you feel it okay to paint graffiti all over the house all over the house, which was not your house. Which must have taken a long time.\"   \u00a0Depp replied: \"It didn\u2019t take that long - help and security arrived.\" \u00a0In the photos one of the messages read \"Good luck\", Depp explained he wrote it because he felt their relationship was over. \u00a0He then said he \"went into some kind of breakdown.'' \u00a0Lawyer Ms Wass claimed the actor had lost the tip of his finger while smashing a plastic phone against a wall repeatedly while arguing with Heard. \u00a0Depp denied this version of events, telling the court: \"I didn't spend much time on the phone.\"   \u00a0He has previously alleged his finger was injured after his former wife threw a glass vodka bottle at him during the row. \u00a0During today's testimony, Depp said of the injury: \"I had just lost the tip of my finger and as a musician it\u2019s a little upsetting when you see the bone sticking out.\" \u00a0Ms Wass said Ms Heard came downstairs to find him nursing the injury and denies she was present when it happened. \u00a0A picture of Depp being treated for the injury while laying on his back in a hospital bed had previously been presented to court during the opening statements.   \u00a0The actor, who was filming as his character Jack Sparrow at the time for the Disney pirate franchise, went on to claim that as he was due at work the next day for filming he told the production c",
