            "description": "Amber Heard appeared on a US chat show with \"two black eyes\" the night after she was allegedly assaulted by ex-husband Johnny Depp.  \u00a0The American actress claimed she was slapped and pulled up the stairs by the Pirates of the Caribbean star during a furious bust-up at their LA apartment in 2015.  Depp, 57, has admitted to headbutting his former spouse at their penthouse but claimed it was \"accidental\" when he took to the stand at the High Court.  The court was told today how Heard, 34, appeared on James Corden's Late Late Show the night after the alleged incident on December 16 2015.  Heard allegedly told her stylist Samantha McMillen after her television appearance: \"Can you believe I just did that show with two black eyes?\"  Read More Related Articles  Read More Related Articles  \u00a0 The Hollywood stylist took to the stand today in the libel case, claiming she had not seen Heard with any visible marks on her body or face.  In a witness statement to the court, Ms McMillen said: \"I saw her throughout the day, in good light, at close range, wearing no makeup.  \"Throughout the day, I could see clearly that Amber did not have any visible marks, bruises, cuts, or injuries to her face or any other part of her body.  \"After the show, Ms Heard said to me, 'Can you believe I just did that show with two black eyes?'

Sasha Wass QC, representing News Group Newspapers, later referred to a message sent by Heard in December 2015 which read: \"Johnny did a number on me last night.\"  \u00a0\"Did Ms Heard ever say to you that Johnny 'did a number on her?',\" the barrister asked Ms McMillen.  She replied: \"She never said anything about that to me.\"  Ms McMillen later admitted she was loyal to Depp saying: \"I'm loyal because he is kind and loyal back, but not for any other reason than that.\"  The stylist was then questioned about an email sent by Heard to her publicist, Jodi Gottlieb, in the early hours of December 16 which read: \"I'm really bruised or might have a black eye or two tomorrow.  \u00a0 \"I might not be fit for tomorrow but I won't know how bad the bruise is until the morning.\"  And she said she couldn't think of a reason why Heard would have sent the email if she didn't have any injuries.
