            "description": "Photographs were shown in London's High Court today of the poo, which reportedly \"destroyed\" Amber Heard and Johnny Depp's marriage. \u00a0Depp, 57, had accused Heard of pooing in their marital bed, which he said was the final alleged incident that gave him the resolve to break up with her. \u00a0Heard, 34, released a statement denying she was responsible for the stool found by Depp's cleaner beneath a top sheet in a bed in the Los Angeles penthouse apartment they shared the morning after the actress's 30th birthday. \u00a0She appeared to point the finger at the Pirates Of The Caribbean star. \u00a0Depp had walked out the night before after a bust-up when he was late for a dinner party Heard was hosting for 12 pals.

It was not left by a 3lb or 4lb dog. \u00a0\"I was convinced that it was either Miss Heard herself or one of her cohorts involved in leaving human faeces on the bed.\"  \u00a0Depp said he suspected it could also have been Heard's US photographer and TV host pal Tillett Wright who had been at the dinner party and was \"crass enough to commit such an act\". \u00a0Depp's housekeeper Hilda Vargas, who gave testimony today said she was \"horrified and disgusted\" when she found the stool. \u00a0She said she knew it was \u201chuman\u201d, took photos and sent them to one of Depp's staff. \u00a0Giving evidence via videolink from Beverly Hills, through a Spanish interpreter, she said she knew neither Boo \u2013 nor Heard's miniature dog Pistol \u2013 were responsible because they could not climb on the bed by themselves and the turd was \"too large\". \u00a0She said leaving her to scoop the poop signalled a \"lack of respect\". \u00a0After cleaning it up Hilda moved to Depp's house in West Hollywood to start work there when Heard suddenly arrived.  \u00a0She said: \"Miss Heard then called me over to talk to her in the living room. \u00a0\"She told me that the pictures I had taken of the faeces had destroyed her marriage. \u00a0\"I was very nervous and so I apologised, even though I did not believe that their marital problems were my fault or that I had done anything wrong. \u00a0\"I also told Miss Heard that the faeces were there, that there was nothing I could do. \u00a0\"Miss Heard argued with me saying there were no faeces in the bed.\" \u00a0Vargas continued: \"I, again, said the faeces were there, that they were large and smelled awful.  \u00a0\"Miss He",
