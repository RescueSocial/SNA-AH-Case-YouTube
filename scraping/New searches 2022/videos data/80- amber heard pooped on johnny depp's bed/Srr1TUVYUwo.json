            "description": "Johnny Depp and his ex-wife Amber Heard appeared at the Royal Courts of Justice in London today for the start of his libel case.  \u00a0During the trial, the 57-year-old was asked about his past drug use as well as some violent incidents. \u00a0He said that he was introduced to drugs when he was a child and gave his daughter Lily-Rose cannabis when she was 13. \u00a0The Hollywood actor said that he gave his daughter the drug as he wanted her to have a safe experience with it. \u00a0The Fantastic Beasts star claimed he believed that it was \"responsible parenting\" allowing Lily-Rose to try the drug.
