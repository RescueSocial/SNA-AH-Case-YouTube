However, a surprising new turn in their case could spell a lot more trouble for the Drive Angry actress than her husband.\nOne petition is trying to have her fired as the L\u2019Oreal spokesperson, while another wants her gone from the upcoming Aquaman sequel. Of course, it could be some time before Johnny Depp and Amber Heard\u2018s court battle comes to any kind of resolution, but it seems like things will only get worse before they get better for the former couple.",
