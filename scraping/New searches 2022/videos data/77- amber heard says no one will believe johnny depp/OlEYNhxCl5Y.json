I talk about the dynamic between them as well as the traits I believe I can see in Amber Heard, that are consistent with some of the traits of Borderline Personality Disorder and of Narcissistic Personality Disorder.\n\nI have a BSc (Hons) in Psychology, have trained and worked as an ABA therapist and I have a post graduate diploma in Integrative Counselling and another in Counselling Psychology. I have done extensive research on narcissism and the effects of narcissistic abuse. I work as a coach specifically with people who have experienced narcissistic abuse.
