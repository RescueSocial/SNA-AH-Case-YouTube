            "description": "(25 Apr 2018) AMBER HEARD DISCUSSES HER RECENT TRIP TO JORDAN, HELPING SYRIAN REFUGEES, CALLS IT LIFE CHANGING\r\nActress Amber Heard has described the \"unimaginable\" conditions endured by Syrian refugees and those affected by the country's civil war.\r\nHeard recently spent a spent a week in Jordan as part of a delegation of the Syrian American Medical Society (SAMS), visiting the kingdom's largest camp for Syrian refugees and rehabilitation centers for those wounded in Syria's seven-year-old civil war.\r\nSpeaking at CinemaCon in Las Vegas Tuesday (24 APRIL 2018) while promoting upcoming DC superhero movie \"Aquaman,\" the actress explained how she first got involved with the Syrian aid effort.\r\n\"I have an amazing group of Syrian friends and as the family and friends, as more and more people come over from Syria and are affected by the crisis, I was once at a dinner at my adopted Syrian family's house and I said, you know, 'I'm just hearing and more of these stories and how can I help?'\" \r\n\"I was lucky enough to have sat next to someone who had an answer and he said, 'My friend's uncle is a doctor and he said I work with this organization called the Syrian American Medical Society - SAMS for short. And it's not political it's not like, you know, there's no like creed or anthem and it was like no agenda. It's just simply to bring medical care to some of the most vulnerable people in the world which are the people that are affected by the Syrian crisis.'\" \r\nIn early April, Heard joined SAMS's 53-member medical mission to Jordan, home to about 660,000 of some 5.5 million Syrian refugees. Most of the displaced Syrians have settled in overburdened regional host countries, struggling to survive on menial jobs, food vouchers and small cash stipends from aid groups.\r\nOver the week, the medical mission visited Zaatari, Jordan's largest camp for Syrian refugees, as well as rehabilitation centers for the wounded.\r\n\"The Zaatari camp, which is the one I visited, is the largest for the Syrian refugees in the world and over half, well over half the population at the camp, are children,\" said Heard. \"How could you not be affected? \u2026 I wanted to be there on the ground and wanted to bring as much attention and awareness as I possibly could.\" \r\nThe actress added that she was touched by \"the light and the spirit and the joy and the generosity and the warmth in the eyes of every person I met at that camp.\"\r\n\"I look at the gift of my life and that around us and I will continue to work tirelessly for not just people like that, but organizations that help people like that because that's key. You know? You can't fight for yourself. You need someone to do it for you.\"\r\n\r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives \u200b\u200b\r\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/0837a083581132bbea1f3f26fc4c6061",
