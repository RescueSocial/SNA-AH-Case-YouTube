            "description": "#aquaman #amberheard #jasonmomoa \nAmber Heard And Jason Momoa Best and Worst Moments\n\nAquaman is one of the best movies made by DC. This movie was an adaptation of DC comic books. Additionally, you may know Aquaman also from Justice Leagues with other DC superheroes: Batman, Superman, and Wonderwoman. Many famous names share the screen in Aquaman such as Amber Heard, Jason Momoa, Nicole Kidman, Patrick Wilson, Rendall Park etc \n\nThe main co-stars in the film are Jason Momoa as Aquaman and Amber Heard who plays Mera in the movies. \n\nAquaman\u2019s are kind of unique because they share lots of embarrassing/awkward moments. Sometimes the awkwardness can reach fans of the DC movies and the 2 actors. However, this doesn\u2019t mean those Aquaman Co-stars don\u2019t share best moments together. We will be covering the worst and best moments of the Aquaman costars: Amber Heard and Jason Momoa. \n\nWe will be having more of these moments as Aquaman 2 is filming now, so wait for our updated video.",
