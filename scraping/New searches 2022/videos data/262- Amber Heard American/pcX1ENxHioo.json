As passionate fans of these shows, we provide news, analysis and fan engagement on America\u2019s Got Talent, Britain\u2019s Got Talent, The Masked Singer, The Voice, The X Factor, American Idol, The Four and its contestants.\n\nABOUT AMERICAN IDOL\nAMERICAN IDOL, the iconic series that revolutionized the television landscape by pioneering the music competition genre, returned to the airwaves in February 2019 for its third season at its new home on ABC. The nationwide search for the next superstar kicked off in August 2018, as the Idol Bus traveled from Portland, Oregon, to Orlando, Florida, in its pursuit for talent, covering 23 cities across the country. Auditioning was made easier than ever as hopefuls also had the opportunity to submit audition videos online, as well as via select social media platforms using an official tag, #TheNextIdol, cultivating over 300,000 posts. Also, for the first time in \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d history, hopefuls had the opportunity to audition through a livestream platform. Helping to determine who America will ultimately vote for to become the next singing sensation, are music industry forces and superstar judges, Luke Bryan, Katy Perry and Lionel Richie. Emmy\u00ae Award-winning host and producer Ryan Seacrest will return as host of the beloved series.\n\nTalent Recap\nhttps://goo.gl/nZgzW8",
