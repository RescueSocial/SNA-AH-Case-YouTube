Welcome back!  Or if you're here for the first time, welcome, and feel free to look around.\n\nI am aware of all the latest happenings going on.  Between Johnny suing Amber, and her recent 292 page filing for a motion to dismiss the lawsuit, there is a lot to cover.  However, I had this video planned for weeks.  I worked on it when I could carve out the time.\n\nThis is an addendum video to my first 3 videos.  If you haven't seen those, I will link them at the top of this description.  These were discoveries and points I researched and found after completing my others and I even incorporated some of the new filings to make some important discoveries.  If you have seen my first videos, I'd greatly appreciate it if you gave this one a look too.  Thanks everyone and take care!",
