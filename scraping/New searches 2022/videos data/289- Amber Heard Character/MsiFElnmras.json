In the still photo, the outfit\u2019s green scales and ornate crown come to life from the illustration. Mera\u2019s look was created by costume designer Michael Wilkinson and illustrator Ian Joyner.\n\nThis will be Heard\u2019s first major role since she filed for divorce from Johnny Depp in May. The actress had to schedule some of the divorce proceedings around her busy schedule filming Justice League in London.\nWhile Mera will be introduced in Justice League, she is expected to play a bigger role in James Wan\u2019s standalone Aquaman film, scheduled to hit theaters on July 27, 2018.",
