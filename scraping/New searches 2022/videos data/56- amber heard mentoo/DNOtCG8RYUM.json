            "description": "Amber and her wife started out in an open relationship but when she recently hooked up with a guy, it didn't go over so well. Where did she meet the guy? What exactly went down between them? How did her wife react and how did she feel about the hook up? Is she still seeing him and if so, does her wife know about it? Tune in to find out plus hear all about Amber's crazy past which include she overcame both a heroin and alcohol addiction, how she use to hook up with guys and how she eventually realized she was homoromatic (she explains what that means) and started hooking up with women, how she came out of the closet and how her parents took the news, and a whole lot more.\n\nFor extra content and early access to the show, become a Patreon member at https://www.patreon.com/StrictlyAnonymousPodcast \n\nFollow the show:                                                                  \nInstagram https://www.instagram.com/strictanonymous/                                                              \nTwitter https://twitter.com/strictanonymous?lang=en                                                               \nFacebook https://www.facebook.com/strictlyanonymouspodcast/\n\nWebsite\nhttp://strictlyanonymouspodcast.com\n\nEverything else:\nhttps://linktr.ee/Strictlyanonymouspodcast",
