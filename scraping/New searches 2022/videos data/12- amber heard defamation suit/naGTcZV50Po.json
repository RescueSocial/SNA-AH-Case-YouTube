            "description": "Amber Heard\u00a0will be allowed to pursue her $100 million defamation countersuit against her ex-husband,\u00a0Johnny Depp,\u00a0after a judge stopped the actor\u2019s attempt to use new legislation to have the case against him thrown out.\nAccording to legal documents obtained by\u00a0The Hollywood Reporter,\u00a0Fairfax County judge\u00a0Bruce D. White\u00a0blocked Depp\u2019s attempt to have Heard\u2019s countersuit dismissed based on a new anti-SLAPP (strategic lawsuits against public participation) law passed in Virginia last year. This new legislation is intended to prevent people from using courts and the threat of lawsuits to intimidate people who are exercising their First Amendment rights. Those being sued most often invoke it to strike down a case because it involves speech on a matter of public concern. The judge cited precisely this lack of public concern as the reason to dismiss Depp\u2019s request, adding that Heard has alleged sufficient facts to support her defamation claims, specifically \u201cthat Mr. Depp may have made these statements with actual or constructive knowledge or with reckless disregard for whether they are false.\u201d\nHowever, while Heard will be able to pursue her countersuit, the judge did throw out one aspect of her case that cited the Virginia Computer Crimes Act and claimed that Depp organized a social media bot attack against her to have her removed from\u00a0Aquaman.\u00a0White determined there was a lack of evidence to support this claim, explaining, \u201cThe pleading fails to demonstrate that the social media accounts communicated obscene language, suggested obscene acts, or threatened illegal or immoral acts. Rather, it appears that Mr. Depp texted those statements, privately, to two of his friends, and Ms. Heard has not alleged that Mr. Depp intended for her to see them.\u201d\n\nDepp is\u00a0suing Heard for defamation\u00a0in Virginia courts over a 2018 op-ed she wrote for\u00a0The\u00a0Washington Post\u00a0in which she called herself a survivor of domestic abuse, although she never mentioned Depp by name. The actor is seeking $50 million in damages. Heard initially filed her defamation counterclaims in response to this suit after Depp\u2019s attorney\u00a0Adam Waldman\u00a0called her allegations of domestic violence \u201cfake\u201d and a \u201csexual violence hoax\u201d last year. The judge sided with Heard in this initial ruling, saying that Waldman\u2019s statements were not protected opinion because \u201cwhether Mr. Depp abused Ms. Heard is a fact that is capable of being proven true or false.\u201d He added that Depp\u2019s and his attorney\u2019s remarks \u201cimply that Ms. Heard lied and perjured herself when she appeared before a court in 2016 to obtain a temporary restraining order against Mr. Depp\u201d and \u201cimply that she has lied about being a victim of domestic violence.\u201d He continued, \u201cIn light of the #MeToo Movement and today\u2019s social climate, falsely claiming abuse would surely \u2018injure [Ms. Heard\u2019s] reputation in the common estimation of mankind.\u2019 Therefore, this Court finds that the statements contain the requisite \u2018sting\u2019 for an actionable defamation In November, Depp\u00a0lost his very high-profile libel case\u00a0against\u00a0The Sun\u00a0over a 2018 headline dubbing him a \u201cwife-beater,\u201d which the judge deemed to be \u201csubstantially true,\u201d although Depp has denied all instances of abuse.\u00a0\nThese competing Virginia lawsuits are expected to move to trial later this year.",
