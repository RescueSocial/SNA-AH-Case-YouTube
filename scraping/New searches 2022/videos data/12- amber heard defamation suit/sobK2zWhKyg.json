            "description": "Johnny Depp today said that he decided to divorce Amber Heard after she or one of her friends 'defecated in their marital bed' after he allegedly threw a magnum bottle of champagne at her on her 30th birthday. Depp is being cross-examined by The Sun's lawyer on the fourth day of his  libel trial at the High Court in London, where he is facing questions about an alleged assault against his ex-wife Amber Heard in LA in 2016. Depp is suing The Sun for libel after it labelled him a 'wife beater'. He called the accusation 'utter falsity' and 'fraudulent' and has claimed Heard abused him throughout their marriage.\n\nOriginal Article: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8509529/Johnny-Depps-friend-Paul-Bettany-assistant-two-LA-cops-stand.html\nOriginal Video: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/video/news/video-2208312/Video-Johnny-Depp-Amber-Heard-arrive-day-four-libel-trial.html\n\nDaily Mail Facebook: http://facebook.com/dailymail\nDaily Mail IG: http://instagram.com/dailymail\nDaily Mail Snap: https://www.snapchat.com/discover/Daily-Mail/8392137033\nDaily Mail Twitter: http://twitter.com/MailOnline\nDaily Mail Pinterest: http://pinterest.co.uk/dailymail\nDaily Mail Google+: https://plus.google.com/+DailyMail\n\nGet the free Daily Mail mobile app: http://dailymail.co.uk/mobile",
