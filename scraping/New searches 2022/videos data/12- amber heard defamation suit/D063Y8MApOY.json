Accordingly, this Court is unpersuaded by Defendant's argument.\"\n\nThe decision marks a major victory for the actor in his ongoing warfare with his ex, which began in 2016 during their divorce in California and has now outlasted their brief, tumultuous marriage. \n\n\u201cMr. Depp is most gratified by the Court\u2019s decision,\u201d said Depp's lawyer, Benjamin Chew of Brown Rudnick in Washington D.C.",
