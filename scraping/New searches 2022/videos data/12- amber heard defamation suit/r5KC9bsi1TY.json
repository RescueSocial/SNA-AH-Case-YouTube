            "description": "Johnny Depp's ex-partner Vanessa Paradis, is set to appear at the High Court in London today in support of the actor's sensational libel claim against a newspaper over an article that labelled him a 'wife beater'. Depp, 57, is suing The Sun publisher News Group Newspapers (NGN) and its executive editor over an April 2018 article which alleged he was violent towards ex-wife Amber Heard, 34, during their tumultuous relationship. Actress Paradis, who was in a relationship with Depp for more than 14 years and had two children with him, is expected to give evidence in support of the Pirates Of The Caribbean star's case over a videolink today. Part of Paradis's witness statement said: 'I have known Johnny for more than 25 years. We've been partners for 14 years and we raised our two children together. Through all these years I've known Johnny to be a kind, attentive, generous, and non-violent person and father.' The actress is due to give evidence on the eighth day of the case, when witnesses could also include Starling Jenkins and Alejandro Romero, who worked at the Eastern Columbia Buildings in LA where Heard and Depp lived.\n\nOriginal Article: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8529043/Johnny-Depp-Amber-Heard-High-Court-day-eight-trial.html\nOriginal Video: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/video/newsalerts/video-2211698/Video-Day-Eight-Johnny-Depp-Amber-Heard-arrive-High-Court.html\n\nDaily Mail Facebook: http://facebook.com/dailymail\nDaily Mail IG: http://instagram.com/dailymail\nDaily Mail Snap: https://www.snapchat.com/discover/Daily-Mail/8392137033\nDaily Mail Twitter: http://twitter.com/MailOnline\nDaily Mail Pinterest: http://pinterest.co.uk/dailymail\nDaily Mail Google+: https://plus.google.com/+DailyMail\n\nGet the free Daily Mail mobile app: http://dailymail.co.uk/mobile",
