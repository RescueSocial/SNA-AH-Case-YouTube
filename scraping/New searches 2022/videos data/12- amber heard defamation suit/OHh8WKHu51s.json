Depp strongly denies the claim. Depp, 57, and model-actress Heard, 34, met on the set of the 2011 comedy The Rum Diary and married in Los Angeles in February 2015.  They divorced in 2017, and now bitterly accuse one another of abuse. Both Depp and Heard are expected to give evidence at the three-week trial, one of the first to be held in person since Britain began to lift its coronavirus lockdown.  Witnesses are likely to include Depps former partners, Vanessa Paradisand Winona Ryder, both of whom have submitted statements supporting the Pirates of the Caribbean star. Depps claim centers on an April 2018 story in the British tabloid headlined: \"Potty - How can JK Rowlingbe genuinely happy casting wife beater Johnny Depp in the new Fantastic Beasts film?\"Depp and the tabloid have hired some of Britains highest-profile lawyers, and pre-trial hearings have already exposed radically differing accounts of Heard and Depps tempestuous marriage. The tabloids lawyers tried to have the suit thrown out on the grounds that Depp failed to disclose text messages he exchanged with an assistant showing that he tried to buy \"MDMA and other narcotics\" while he was in Australia with Heard in 2015. Heard alleges that Depp subjected her to \"a three-day ordeal of physical assaults\" while they were in the country after drinking and taking drugs. The newspapers lawyer, Adam Wolanski, said withholding the texts was a breach of a previous court order requiring Depp to provide all documents from separate libel proceedings against Heard in the United States.  Depp is suing Heard for $50",
