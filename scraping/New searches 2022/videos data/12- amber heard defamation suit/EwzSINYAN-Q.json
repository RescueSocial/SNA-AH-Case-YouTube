Depp, 57, is suing The Sun\u2019s publisher, News Group Newspapers, and the paper\u2019s executive editor, Dan Wootton, over the article. The Hollywood star strongly denies abusing Heard and was at the court to hear his ex-wife.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\nIn the first nine days of testimony at the High Court, judge Andrew Nicol heard from Depp and from several current or former employees who have backed his version of events.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\nHeard's testimony is now expected to last for four days, through Thursday.\r\n\r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives \u200b\u200b\r\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/50bae02833604f889734da023470b052",
