I've never seen him happier. I've never heard him play better, and the way the press would have it is 'he's a total destruction and ready to die.' Totally not true.\u201d \nJOHNNY DEPP SUES EX-WIFE AMBER HEARD FOR $50M, CLAIMING DEFAMATION, AFFAIR WITH ELON MUSK \nCooper said the band\u2019s upcoming album will include songs by Depp about his frustrations over the abuse allegations against him. \n\u201cI'm spewing his venom on this album, which is kind of good,\u201d Cooper said. \nDepp filed a $50 million defamation lawsuit against Heard earlier this month, claiming she accused him of domestic abuse to advance her career. The lawsuit cites an article by Heard published on the Washington Post in which she talks about her experience with domestic abuse. Depp said that even though he isn\u2019t named in the article, it was clear she was referring to him, adding that the allegations leveled against him were \u201ccategorically and demonstrably false.\u201d \nJOHNNY DEPP APPEARS FRAIL AND GAUNT IN NEWLY SURFACED INSTAGRAM PHOTOS \nThe \u201cPirates of the Caribbean\u201d star also claimed Heard\u2019s relationship with Tesla founder Elon Musk began a month after the former couple got married in 2015. \nThe actor also sparked concerns last June when photos emerged of him looking frail and gaunt. Fans questioned whether Depp\u2019s emaciated appearance was due to his public divorce with Heard, which a source previously told Fox News was \u201cmentally draining\u201d and took a toll financially for the actor.",
