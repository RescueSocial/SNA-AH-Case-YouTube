            "description": "(16 Jul 2020) JOHNNY DEPP, AMBER HEARD LEAVE UK HIGH COURT\r\nJohnny Depp and Amber Heard departed from Britain's High Court Thursday (16 JULY 2020) after another day's proceedings in Depp's libel suit against a British tabloid that accused him of assaulting his former spouse.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\nDepp is suing News Group Newspapers, publisher of The Sun, and the paper\u2019s executive editor, Dan Wootton, over an April 2018 article that called him a \u201cwife-beater.\u201d He strongly denies abusing Heard.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\nOn Thursday, Depp\u2019s security chief alleged that Amber Heard physically abused Depp during the couple\u2019s tempestuous marriage, giving testimony to support Depp\u2019s claim.\r\nIn a written witness statement released as he appeared in court, security officer Sean Bett said that \u201cthroughout the course of Mr. Depp and Ms. Heard\u2019s relationship, Ms. Heard was verbally and physically abusive towards Mr. Depp.\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\u201cOn many occasions, I witnessed her shout at Mr. Depp. I was also told by Mr. Depp on multiple occasions that Ms. Heard had physically abused him,\u201d he said.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\nBett, a former Los Angeles sheriff's deputy who has worked for Depp for a decade, said he regularly had to remove the \u201cPirates of the Caribbean\u201d star from bad situations when Heard was in an \u201cabusive mood.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\u201cMs. Heard often behaved in this way when she had been drinking. I learnt quickly to recognize the signs, so that we were able to leave the situation before it escalated further,\u201d he said.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\nDepp, 57, and Heard, 34, met on the set of the 2011 comedy \u201cThe Rum Diary\u201d and married in Los Angeles in February 2015. Heard filed for divorce the following year, and the divorce was finalized in 2017.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\nThe Sun\u2019s defense relies on 14 allegations made by Heard of violence by Depp between 2013 and 2016, in settings including his private island in the Bahamas, a rented house in Australia and a private jet. He denies them all and claims Heard was the aggressor during their volatile relationship, which he has likened to \u201ca crime scene waiting to happen.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\nIn a week and half of testimony, judge Andrew Nicol has heard from Depp - who accused Depp of compiling a dossier of fake claims against him - as well as several employees of Depp and Heard who have backed his version of events.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\nHeard is due to give her side of the story in evidence later in the trial, which is scheduled to last three weeks.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\nBett was cross-examined Thursday by The Sun's lawyer, Sasha Wass, who questioned his claim that he had never seen Heard with bruises of marks on her face or body but had several times seen Depp with bruises inflicted by his wife.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\nWass suggested Bett was lying to protect Depp, his employer.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\u201cMa\u2019am you can call me a liar a hundred times. I\u2019m not a liar. I\u2019m telling the truth,\" Bett said.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\nDepp\u2019s former romantic partners Vanessa Paradis and Winona Ryder had been scheduled to give evidence, but Depp's lawyer said Thursday that they would no longer be appearing.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\nDavid Sherborne, said Thursday that he no longer needed to call them, \u201cmuch as it would have been a pleasure to have them here,\u201d because The Sun does not contest Depp\u2019s claim that he never hit them.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\nDepp and French singer Paradis had two children during a 14-year relationship that ended in 2012. American actress Ryder dated Depp between 1990 and 1993.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\nIn a written witness statement disclosed in part at a pretrial hearing, Ryder said Depp \"was never, never violent towards me. He was never, never abusive at all towards me.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\nParadis said in a witness statement that she had always known Depp to be \"a kind, attentive, generous, and non-violent person and father.\u201d\r\n\r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives \u200b\u200b\r\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/522b537b0bae4aa4956bb68bb2771028",
