            "description": "Johnny Depp goes after Amber Heard with $50M defamation suit - Latest News  \u00a0Johnny Depp has had a lot of legal run-ins the past few years, but this time it is distinctly personal. \u00a0Almost three years after news of the breakdown of \u201cThe Pirates of the Caribbean\u201d star\u2019s marriage to Amber Heard hit the public record, Depp is now suing his ex-wife and \u201cAquaman\u201d star for $50 million for defamation. \u00a0\u201cMs. Heard is not a victim of domestic abuse, she is a perpetrator,\u201d says the suit in reaction to an op-end the actress penned for The Washington Post in mid-December last year.\u201c I had the rare vantage point of seeing, in real time, how institutions protect men accused of abuse,\u201d Heard said. \u201cI spoke up againstual violence \u2014 and faced our culture\u2019s wrath. That has to change\u201d entitled Post piece, which never actually mentioned Depp by name but clearly didn\u2019t have to \u2013 at least not for this lawsuit. \u00a0\u201cMr. Depp never abused Ms. Heard, the compensatory damages and punitive damages seeking complaint from the actor goes on to say. \u201cHer allegations against him were false when they were made in 2016,\u201d it adds in reference to the claims that Heard made in the couple\u2019s short-lived union. \u00a0A marriage that ended with a temporary restraining order against Depp and later a $7 million settlement, that Heard donated to charity. Having long since denied the abuse allegations, the Hollywood Vampires guitarist clearly now thinks there was more going on.\u201c They were part of an elaborate hoax to generate positive publicity for Ms. Heard and advance her career,\u201d Friday\u2019s lawsuit postulates of the allegations of Depp\u2019s violent misconduct. \u00a0\u201cThis frivolous action is just the latest of Johnny Depp\u2019s repeated efforts to silence Amber Heard,\u201d the actress\u2019 attorney Eric M. George told Deadline. \u201cShe will not be silenced.\u201d \u00a0\u201cMr. Depp\u2019s actions prove he is unable to accept the truth of his ongoing abusive behavior, the Browne George Ross LLP partner added. \u00a0\u201cBut while he appears hell-bent on achieving self destruction, we will prevail in defeating this groundless lawsuit and ending the continued vile harassment of my client by Mr. Depp and his legal team.\u201dRepresentatives for Depp did not respond to request for comment on the filing.However, if their past legal entanglements are any indication, expect the ambassador on women\u2019s rights at the American Civil Liberties Union to not enter her own POV into the docket soon. \u00a0This latest suit comes against the backdrop of Depp still battling it out on several other legal fronts. Despite a big win last summer, one of those battles include a $30 million malpractice action against the actor\u2019s ex-attorneys at Bloom Hergott Diemer Rosenthal LaViolette Feldman Schenkman & Goodman LLP.
