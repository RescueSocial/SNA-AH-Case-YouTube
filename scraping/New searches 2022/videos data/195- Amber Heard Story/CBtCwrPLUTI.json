This video is here because of different reasons, not grammar. The most people are able to understand the meaning of the story and that's important. If you care so much about grammar then dont watch my video. Dont waste your time posting more comments about grammar because I will remove them. Only comments about Amber's story will remain there.I will add this under all of my stories videos. You know, I can take english classes, but I will never be native speaker. I will always make mistakes.***",
