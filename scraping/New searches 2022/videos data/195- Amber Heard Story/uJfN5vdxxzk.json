            "description": "On January 13, 1996, nine-year-old Amber Rene Hagerman was abducted while riding her bike in Arlington, Texas. Four days later, a man was walking his dog near the Forest Hill Apartments, just a few miles from where the Amber had been snatched. At the bottom of a creek bed, he saw a child\u2019s body. Amber Hagerman had been found. By 1999, the task force had been disbanded and the case had gone cold. The killer has gone undetected now for eleven years. 1996 the AMBER Alert was created. This is a tribute to Amber Hagerman and her family. Though she is not missing, her killer has not been found.",
