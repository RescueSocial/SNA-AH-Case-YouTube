            "description": "My father always encouraged me to be an actress. I guess, as a parent, you can look at your child and see what they are kind of prone to and I was that kid; I had a video camera when I was a child and filmed everything and organized plays and I was always on camera too. I would never just be behind the camera, hello! I would put myself in as the star. I did do the plays in high school before I dropped out and finished high school on my own. I fell in love with theater in high school and it was something that my parents really encouraged, probably up until the moment I said `I`m gonna go do it tomorrow`. They`ve been great. - aheardfan.com",
