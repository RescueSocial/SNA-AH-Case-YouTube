Minutes before going to air, Sherlock looked at the video feed in the studio monitor and realised they all looked like Goldie Hawn, Diane Keaton and Bette Midler in that final scene of The First Wives Club where they all wear white and sing.\u201cI need Julie to put a jacket on because we\u2019re all in white. I asked her before we came on \u2014 Julie, you need to put a jacket on,\u201d a perturbed Sherlock demanded.\nAs Snook began to explain she just hadn\u2019t had time to source a jacket before going into the studio, Sherlock cut her off: \u201cCome on, I told you two hours ago.\u201d\nSherlock then pulled her iPhone out and informed Snook she\u2019d personally call the Nine wardrobe department to \u201cget something\u201d.\nFellow guest, psychologist Sandy Rea, could hear all this going down from her studio and looked appropriately uncomfortable with the exchange.\nRea tried to defuse the problem by suggesting she\u2019d get a jacket herself.\n\u201cYou\u2019re fine Sandy but there can\u2019t be three of us. And I made this clear two and a half hours ago,\u201d Sherlock shot back while angrily thumbing at her iPhone, perhaps scrolling through Portmans\u2019 online store to buy Snook a new outfit herself.\n\nRemaining calm, Snook tried to reason with her flustered colleague.\n\u201cAmber, if it\u2019s an issue I can get on out of here (the studio),\u201d she said.\n\u201cIt is an issue. Go and grab a jacket,\u201d Sherlock demanded. Snook pointed out she was actually wearing light blue and not white but this was all swings and roundabouts for Sherlock and the technicality annoyed her more.\nShe called out for a producer to find Snook a jacket. Any jacket. Even if they had to just rip one off Tracy Grimshaw.\nThe passive aggressive back-and-forth continued.\nSnook: \u201cIf there\u2019s an issue I can just head on out and get back to work because I\u2019m flat chat, I genuinely forgot.\u201d\nSherlock: \u201cFine, jump on out, if that\u2019s what you\u2019d like to do.\u201d\nSnook: \u201cAmber, please, this is not the only thing I\u2019m doing today.\u201d\nAt this point, the footage cuts to black.\nThe next time we see Snook, she\u2019s been strapped into a jacket.",
