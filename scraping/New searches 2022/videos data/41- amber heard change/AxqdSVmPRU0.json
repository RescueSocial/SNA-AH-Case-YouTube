In this video, we are going to talk about Johnny Depp and Amber Heard, who have been on each other\u2019s throats ever since they split up and how Amber Heard might be facing jail time for one mistake she made in all this.\n\nWith the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. \n\nEver since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.\n\n#AmberHeardJail\u200b #AmberHeard\u200b #AmberHeardCourt\u200b #JusticeForJohnny #JusticeforJohnnyDepp\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWelcome to The Gossipy.
