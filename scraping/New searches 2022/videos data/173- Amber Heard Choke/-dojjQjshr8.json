There have been several iterations of the Marvel team on film over the years. The original two films came out in 2005 and 2007.

Since then, fans have wondered how the MCU will introduce the quartet into their already established universe. The Fantastic Four is an extremely popular group, so it's safe to say that at some point they will be introduced. As to when exactly that will happen is under wraps.\n\nNew fan art by ApexForm imagines a new Sue Storm being taken over by Amber Heard. The art shows off Sue Storm's powers of invisibility. Heard is wearing the Fantastic Four uniform inside what looks to be a laboratory. Heard is translucent, her body refracting the sunlight through the windows behind her.",
