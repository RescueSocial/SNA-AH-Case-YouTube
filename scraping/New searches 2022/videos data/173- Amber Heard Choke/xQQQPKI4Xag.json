She has tried to use the Metoo movement, LGBTQ, and other social movements for her personal gain. \n\nI will not stand behind a woman who is malicious and deceitful. And now to see her try to silence real people who care about Johnny as fans, it just makes me sick and angry. \n\nI'm already upset about the media trying to be biased. \n\nJohnny never deserved any of this abuse from Amber. \n \nhttps://afriendorfoe.home.blog/2020/08/21/heavy-on-my-heart-im-not-a-bot/\n\n#JusticeforJohnny #Can'tsilencethepeople #I'mnotabot #Wejustdon'tlikeyouAmber",
