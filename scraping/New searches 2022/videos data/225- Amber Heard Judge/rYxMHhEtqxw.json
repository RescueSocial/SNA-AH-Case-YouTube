            "description": "Joshua Brown expressed he was in fear for his life. He was forced into the Amber Guyger trial via subpoena. Lee Merritt spoke on Full Circle Anderson Coopers show on CNN. He stated it\u2019s likely Joshua\u2019s past caught up with him, but nobody should be ruled out including Dallas PD. The courts knew Joshua Brown was in fear for his life. During Joshua\u2019s Testimony there was an intermission for a break. Audio unintentionally was heard of Judge Tammy Kemp \u201cof course he\u2019s here\u201d \u201cI\u2019m surprised he came\u201d They failed to protect this witness, especially having everything broadcasted live via stream. I personally feel this maybe he past catching up with him but everything needs to be looked into. Joshua Brown would have also been a witness testimony for the civil case. \n\nNew York Post:\nBrown fled the state for California, where he remained as the trial got underway, according to Meritt.\nBut prosecutors \u201chounded him\u201d and threatened to issue a warrant for his arrest if he didn\u2019t appear in court. \u201cSo he got on a plane and came straight from the airport to the courthouse,\u201d Merritt said.\nOnce he arrived, Brown met with the judge in her chambers about his concerns, but ultimately ended up taking the stand, Meritt said \nhttps://nypost.com/2019/10/08/joshua-brown-fled-texas-to-avoid-testifying-against-in-amber-guyger-case/\n\n\nPodcast Links:\niTunes https://apple.co/2mOMrZg\nSpotify  https://spoti.fi/2mD0XDu\nGoogle http://bit.ly/2nfxdwP\nStitcher http://bit.ly/2AKBrju\nhttps://www.ickedmel.com/\nDonate Options \ud83d\udcb0  \nCash APP $iCkEdMeL\nwww.paypal.me/ickedmel \ud83d\udc48\nhttps://www.patreon.com/iCkEdMeL \u2705 $1 monthly support.\nhttps://teespring.com/stores/ickedmel-store\u2705 \nhttps://amzn.to/30RNnuA\u2705 (Amazon Merch) \n\n*YouTube/Business* Contact:\nEmail: ickedmel@ickedmel.com \ud83d\udcbb\nJoin the mailing list and stay up-to-date\ud83d\udc48\nhttps://www.ickedmel.com/mailinglist/\ud83d\udc48\n\n*My Social Media* \ud83d\udcbb\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/iCkEdMeL/ \nInstagram: www.instagram.com/ickedmel\n\nSubscribe & hit the notification bell\ud83d\udc47\niCkEdMeL (Main Channel) http://bit.ly/2kiMqZL \ud83d\udd25\nSupport the channel by using my affiliate link @ no extra cost \nhttp://amzn.to/2Dqp7Yy  I earn a small commission \n\nCONTENT DISCLAIMER: Due to the social nature of this channel, videos may contain content copyrighted by another entity or person.
