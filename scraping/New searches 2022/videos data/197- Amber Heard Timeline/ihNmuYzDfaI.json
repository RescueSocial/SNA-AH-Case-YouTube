            "description": "So if you\u2019ve never heard of Amberlynn Reid you should count yourself lucky. Our queen Amberlynnstarted as a weight loss channel almost a decade ago and well\u2026 you tell me how that\u2019s going. Nowadays, Amberlynn Reid no longer identifies her channel as a weight loss one but she\u2019s more of a daily vlogger -- but you\u2019d be wrong to think she\u2019s out here shooting some David Dobrik style wild ass vlogs. Unlike everyone else, Amberlynn changed up the whole vlogging game by making it super boring. Now, if you\u2019re new to Amberlynn Reid\u2019s channel, you\u2019d notice how she\u2019s always getting hate bombed and all her \u201cfans\u201d seem to be just reading her to filth in the comments all the time. Amberlynn Reid is such a notorious liar she made like a 20-minute video confessing to all the lies she\u2019s said. Amberlynn Reid has lied about some serious stuff but since this isn\u2019t a deep dive, I\u2019ll just stick to the basic stuff but if you do want a deep dive into the history of Amberlynn Reid and the detail about all the stuff she\u2019s done please leave a comment letting me know. Now, let me introduce you to a crucial character in our story: Becky. Ms. Becky is Amberlynn Reid\u2019s girlfriend. Or should I say WAS -- but we\u2019ll get into that later. So here\u2019s the thing, Amberlynn started talking to Becky the second she broke up with her other ex, Destiny. Keep that in mind cuz it\u2019s gonna come up. So, almost immediately, Becky and Amberlynn Reid move in together. Now, this is when we start seeing Becky be dragged down by Amber and also fall into the same bad eating habits as her. You can see how Becky gains weight over time throughout this relationship. You can also see Becky try to help Amber by telling her to eat healthier and encouraging her to exercise more but I guess Amber had more influence on Becky\u2019s lifestyle than Becky did on Amber\u2019s. You can also start seeing how Becky enables Amber by walking the dogs herself, by taking Amber to eat out every day, or by covering up for her when she\u2019s caught in lies. During all this, you can also see Amber does not really appreciate just how much Becky does for her. Buttt things take a turn...\n\n\n\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728\n\nFOLLOW ME! \u2764\ufe0f \n\ud83d\udcf8 Instagram: @reyrahimi\nhttps://www.instagram.com/reyrahimi/\n\n\ud83d\udc26 hot tea Twitter: @hotteayt\nhttps://twitter.com/hotteayt\n\n\ud83d\udc26 Personal Twitter: @rey_rahimi\nhttps://twitter.com/rey_rahimi\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe to my second channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt9I...\n\n\ud83c\udfb6 TikTok: @reyrahimi\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@reyrahimi\n\n\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728\n\nGet my YouTube Creator MasterClass FREE for 14 days:\nhttps://skl.sh/34V3Kvt\n(You can unsubscribe before your first payment)\n\n\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728\n\nFor business inquiries: reyhanehrahimi2@gmail.com\n\n\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728\n\nWelcome to hot tea, where we spill all the tea in the YouTuber/ influencer community.
