She was once human before regaining her grace, but forgot all her memories in the long run...all she remembers is from when she was saved and grew her golden wings. She was told to make sure Sam never gave into Lucifer, to make sure he never said yes. But soon, the angel grew sick, death reaching closer and closer, so Sam had to do something...since he hasn't felt this way about anyone since Jess, and he couldn't lose another.\n\nWhile the angel was in the hospital, Sam left to give in, fighting his brother, and Michael along the way. She awoken once the pit was opened, and ran through the grave yard to find her human. Sam was already ready to jump in when she got there, and vanished before she could take old of him. The woman sat beside Dean, who was broken and torn, and waited for a miracle. When the pit closed, she suddenly remembered everything of her past...why she's pained and what brought her to fall...all the humanly worldly pleasures, and disadvantages she faced...including killing both her parents, and burning the house she once called home. The angel asked Castiel to kill her...because her doing to Sam has failed...and that's exactly what he did.\n\nSoon, she woke up in the mental hospital, human once again, not remembering Sam, or anyone else she came in contact with that was down his line. When she came face to face with the brown haired broken man in the same hallway, it was basically like meeting him for the first time...but felt like she knew him in a past life. Sam still loves her, and will do anything...to make things right.",
