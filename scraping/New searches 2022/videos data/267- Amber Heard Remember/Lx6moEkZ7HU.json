            "description": "Amber Heard shared her witness statement at London's High Court on Monday, as she gave evidence in Johnny Depp's libel case against News Group Newspapers (NGN). \u00a0Depp, 57, whom Heard, 34, was married to from 2015-2017, is suing publishers NGN over an April 2018 article in The Sun, written by executive editor Dan Wooton, in which he was branded a \"wife beater\". \u00a0During Heard's witness statement she spoke at length about numerous alleged incidences of domestic abuse, including one in which, she claimed Depp told her: \"I\u2019m going to f***ing kill you and f*** your corpse.\" \u00a0Heard claimed the alleged incident occurred after Depp had been using cocaine and drinking Jack Daniels.

He was still drinking booze from the bottle. He was so mad at me and I didn\u2019t know why. His eyes were black. I told him to put it down and to stop. He became extremely mad, screaming at me 'f*** you, I f***ing hate you'. He offered me the bottle, 'you want it?' and 'what are you going to do?'. He was threatening me with the bottle of liquor. He provoked me to take it. I said 'yeah', and I took it and smashed it on the ground.\" \u00a0She continued: \"This set him off. He picked up another bottle and threw it at the wall right next to me.\" \u00a0Heard claimed that later on in the day Depp ripped her dressing gown open and pinned her up against the fridge. \u00a0She alleged: \"He had me up against the fridge and he grabbed the front of my gown and ripped it open, so at some point I was bare chested. I don\u2019t remember what he was saying, but he was mocking me, touching my breasts. He ripped off the rest of the gown so I was naked. He grabbed me by my breasts and kept shoving me up against the fridge.\" \u00a0Heard continued: \"At some point he pulled me around by my neck and pushed me down against the bar, I was against the bar, naked, bent over backwards, my back against the marble. He was pressing so hard on my neck I couldn\u2019t breathe. I was trying to tell him that I couldn\u2019t breathe.  \u00a0\"I remember thinking he was going to kill me in that moment. \u00a0\"The floor was wet and I was slipping; I couldn\u2019t get a purchase and I was kicking my feet trying to stand up, but nothing was catching. I was using my forearms to try to raise myself up and cutting myself on the broken glass on the counter. \u00a0\"I remember pleading with Johnny saying he was hurting and cutting me and asked him to let me up. He ignored me, continuing to hit me with the back of one closed hand. He was screaming at me, over and over again, 'you ruined my life, I hate you, I'm going to f***ing kill you and I'll 'f*** your corpse'. He said it so loud and over and over: 'I am going to f",
