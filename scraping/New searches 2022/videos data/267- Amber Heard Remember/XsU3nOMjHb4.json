Insecurities, possessiveness, anger, hunger for wealth, what more is left between them? \nAfter truckloads of allegations and dark secrets coming out to the public, both Amber Heard and Johnny Depp have lost a lot of respect and fandom. The last time I remember, Amber was exposed lying about being the perfectly gentle and sweet wife of Johnny as Johnny\u2019s team presented a phone recording from the past in which Amber herself admitted to being agitated and hurting her then-husband. \nAnd more and more accusations against the two, it is pretty hard to understand and trust any one of them. No matter what the actual scenario is, the fact is that the two were toxic together and should have never been together.
