            "description": "SONG CRUSH SUNDAY WITH AMBER SWEENEY \n\nStrong Enough by Sheryl Crow\n\nI picked this song for a couple reasons. The first being that I get to go see Sheryl Crow for my birthday this week, and I wanted to pay homage to a woman who has been teaching me all these years and didn\u2019t know it. The first time I heard Sheryl Crow, my mind was blown. It was the first time I understood how powerful words could be, and how a really good song also told a really good story. This song tells such a sad, but real story. When I was younger, I remember wanting people to be in my life so bad, that I would rather they pretend to be something to me, than to be true to themselves and leave. I\u2019m sure some of that came from unresolved abandonment issues. I learned the hard way that it\u2019s better to live authentically than to pretend. Pretending can build resentment over time, and that resentment makes a deeper cut than the tear way back at the beginning would have been. That\u2019s at least what this song means to me. \n\nI\u2019m playing my trusty Breedlove acoustic, and we filmed this at my home studio in Southwest Washington. \n\nIn honor of giving credit where credit is due, here is the songwriter information for \u201cStrong Enough\u201d: \n\n\u201cStrong Enough\u201d written by -\nKevin Gilbert\nBill Bottrell\nSheryl Crow\nBrian Macleod\nDavid Baerwald\nDavid Ricketts \n\nThanks for watching and listening with your heart!\n\n~Amber",
