            "description": "In 2015, actress Amber Heard was charged with bringing then-husband Johnny Depp\u2019s two Yorkshire terriers into Australia illegally. The case was closed back then, but now, Heard is being investigated for allegedly committing perjury during the dog smuggling incident.\n\nThe allegations came out during Depp\u2019s libel lawsuit last year against a British tabloid. During that case, Depp\u2019s former estate manager testified that Heard asked him to lie under oath for her after she was charged with illegally importing the dogs into Australia. As E!News reported, Heard didn\u2019t obtain a permit for the dogs prior to bringing them into the country on a private jet and without having them quarantine for two weeks.\n\n\u201cAfter Australian\u2019s agriculture minister threatened to have the dogs euthanized unless they \u2018buggered off back to the United States,\u2019 Depp and Heard had the dogs flown back, again on a private jet,\u201d E!News reported. \u201cFacing the prospect for a maximum 10-year prison sentence, the actress pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of falsifying a travel document to sneak the dogs into the Australia. Her lawyer told the court the actress was jetlagged, worried about a hand injury that Depp suffered during filming Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales, and believed her assistants had sorted out the paperwork for the dogs.\u201d\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\u25c6 Latest news videos: https://bit.ly/3kyYoOb\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\u2605 CONNECT WITH US \u2605\n\n\u25c6 Email: alexanna0711@gmail.com\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nVideos can use content-based copyright law contains reasonable use Fair Use (https://www.youtube.com/yt/copyright/)",
