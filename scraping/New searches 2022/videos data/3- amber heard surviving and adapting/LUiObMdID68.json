            "description": "The REAL Reason Amber Heard Is Hiding The Truth!!\n\nSubscribe to The Spotlight \ud83d\udc49  https://bit.ly/3txAgy1\n\nPlease support this video by commenting *Hashtag* JusticeForDepp as well as subscribing and giving the video a like to improve the algorithm on Youtube and spread awareness for Depp! \ud83c\udfc6\n\nWATCH NEXT: \u25b6\ufe0f\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk62Q2ve1Ck&t=120s\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R74lQyLJmR8\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRgawOgSsbw&t=445s\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRELATED VIDEOS:\ud83d\udc47\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qHw0PtrdQI\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgnkeDWNzgc\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_XOf43VV8w\n\nThe woman took an all-time low and faked bruises so as to make Johnny look like he was in the wrong. In fact, she used this at court, in the year 2016, to file a restraining order against Depp which truly shows how low the woman could stoop to. If you guys are curious about what the complaint that she filed stated, it was all lies and no truth. She stated that he hurt her by flinging her iPhone at her right eye causing her to receive a blue eye which she was donning that day.\n\nNow, what evidence against this lie was brought up?\nBut the truth always does come out and it did. Johnny and his team delivered footage dating back to that same day where she was in the elevator and guess what? No bruises at all.  \nSo basically she just wanted to paint Depp as the bad guy in a series of events and then finally be able to get all of his money.\n\nDo you guys think the lies stopped here?\nOf course not! Amber Heard\u2019s sister, Whitney Heard was seen sporting bruises once upon a time. On being questioned about it, she didn\u2019t wish to speak about it as she wasn\u2019t comfortable doing so. \n\nThe recent events involve her sister Whitney, siding with Amber in one of her other lies. This lie included Johnny assaulting his sister due to his apparent anger issues to which he denied. \n\nOn further investigation, a large sum of money had recently been transferred from Amber\u2019s account to Whitney\u2019s account. Could it have been a bribe Amber gave to Whitney for covering her tracks? Was it Amber that had been the one that actually hit Whitney?\n\nWell, this is what Johnny\u2019s team thinks because he has taken a stand that he did not do such a thing at all. \n\nWas Kate James also involved in the part of Amber\u2019s lies?\nFor those of you who do not know who Kate James is, Kate James was a former personal assistant of Amber Heard. She has seen a side of Amber\u2019s that many didn\u2019t. They were quite friendly initially which resulted in Kate opening up to her boss and sharing the traumatic story of her past which involved her facing an assault while she was in Brazil in her early 20\u2019s.\n\nAmber took no remorse to Kate\u2019s feelings, modified the story, and played the narrative of the story as if it was her own. This totally destroyed Kate causing her to come out and speak against this in 2020. Clearly, everyone was scared of Amber, and it took them some guts and willpower to finally come onto the pedestal to use their story, their voice, and the truth to put Amber down. \n\nBut, what was the real reason why Roberta Kaplan withdrew herself from offering her services to Amber Heard?\nRenowned American lawyer, Roberta Kaplan, has been fighting with Amber\u2019s team for quite a while now. She finally decided to withdraw herself from the team in 2020 stating it was due to logistic and travel difficulties due to the ongoing pandemic that is causing her difficulty in meeting the needs of the team as well as Amber\u2019s. It was not only her who withdrew from the team, but many other members too did leave the team and the case. \n\nThe drama did not end here. The biggest evidence that exposed her entirely were the leaked audio tapes from 2015 which came out to the public only in 2020. This was the biggest evidence against her where she claimed Depp to be an assaulter and one due to whom she had to face a series of domestic violence. The audiotape included her differentiating between a hit and a punch trying to defend herself so weakly that even the judges weren\u2019t convinced with the crapload of lies that she was fumbling to say. She eventually gave in and stated she did hit him.\n\nFrom all these facts we can clearly state that Amber Heard had some real anger issues and was in dire need of anger management. Due to her not seeking help, she tended to take out all her frustration towards her marriage and other close ones around her, who will be the only ones to provide a description of the kind of person Amber really was. \n\nThe people of the industry and the world were most angry due to the fact that she took advantage of the MeToo movement to get Depp into trouble, causing both his personal and professional life to shatter to pieces. aquaman 2 \n\n #AmberHeard #JohnyDepp #JusticeForDepp #JusticeForJohnnyDepp #JohnnyDeppCase #AmberHeardCase #TheSpotlight #Aquaman2 #JasonMomoa",
