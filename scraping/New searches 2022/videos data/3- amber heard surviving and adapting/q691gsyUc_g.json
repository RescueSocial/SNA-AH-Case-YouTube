            "description": "Music used in this video\nLost Sky - Fearless pt.II (feat. Chris Linton) [NCS Release]\n\nAmber Laura Heard (born April 22, 1986) is an American actress. She made her film debut in a minor supporting role in the sports drama Friday Night Lights (2004), followed by a series of other small roles in television and film. Her first leading role was in the horror film All the Boys Love Mandy Lane (2006), but it was not released in the United States until 2013 due to distribution problems. Her second major role came in the short-running The CW television series Hidden Palms (2007).\n\nHeard's breakthrough came in 2008 with roles in the action film Never Back Down and the stoner comedy Pineapple Express, both box-office successes. The same year, she received the Breakthrough Award at Young Hollywood Awards. Heard continued her career with roles in films such as The Informers (2008), The Stepfather (2009), Zombieland (2009), and The Joneses (2009). In 2011, she played the female lead opposite Nicolas Cage in Drive Angry, and opposite Johnny Depp in The Rum Diary. Subsequently, Heard appeared in 3 Days to Kill (2014), Magic Mike XXL (2015) and The Danish Girl (2015). She also starred in the indie film The Adderall Diaries (2015), the television musical drama One More Time (2015), and the Martin Amis adaptation London Fields (2018). The latter was due to be released in 2015, but became the subject of a series of lawsuit between its director, Heard, and the film's production company over its editing and other issues.\n\nIn 2017, Heard acted as part of an ensemble cast in the indie film I Do...Until I Don't (2017) and made an appearance as Mera in the superhero film Justice League (2017). She reprised that role opposite Jason Momoa in Aquaman (2018), the most profitable DC Extended Universe film up to that point, and the fifth highest-grossing film of 2018.[2][better source needed] The same year, Heard was named a global spokesperson for the cosmetics giant L'Or\u00e9al Paris. In 2019, she appeared in supporting roles in the independent films Her Smell and Gully, and in 2020, she starred in the miniseries The Stand, an adaptation of Stephen King's novel.[undue weight? \u2013 discuss]\n\nHeard engages in activism for causes such as LGBTQ rights and domestic and sexual violence awareness. She is an American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) ambassador[undue weight? \u2013 discuss] and has been named a Human Rights Champion for the Stand Up for Human Rights campaign by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.\n\nHeard was married to her Rum Diary co-star Johnny Depp from 2015 to 2017. Their divorce drew significant media attention as Heard alleged that Depp had physically and verbally abused her during most of their relationship. In 2019, he sued her for defamation after she publicly discussed being a victim of domestic violence, alleging that she had been the abusive party; Heard denied this. Depp also sued the publishers of The Sun in a related libel suit, with Heard as a key witness for the defendants. In November 2020, the High Court of Justice of England and Wales ruled that Depp had lost his case and that the majority of Heard's allegations had been proven to a civil standard. Depp intends to appeal.",
