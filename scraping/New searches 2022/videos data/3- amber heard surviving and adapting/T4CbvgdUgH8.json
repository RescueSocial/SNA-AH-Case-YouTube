            "description": "Are we witnessing the successor to the great Scarlett Johansson?  Seemingly coming out of nowhere, Amber Heard's wrestling competence is for real and now she wants to rise to the top.  A match against a former CWWL Champion will be a good measuring stick to see if she's up to the task of competing for the CWWL Title.  Paris Berelc has taken a break from the scene after losing the Wonder Woman Title to Demi Lovato.  Berelc admitted she never embraced the Title to begin with and only wanted to defeat the lewd G Girl in winning the respective tournament.  \"I'm unsure what she wants with that costume, but I can assure you it would tarnish the reputation of the great Amazon princess\", proclaimed Paris when asked further.  Berelec gets back into the ring to see if she can stifle the rising star, Amber Heard. #WWE 2K20 #women wrestling #amber heard",
