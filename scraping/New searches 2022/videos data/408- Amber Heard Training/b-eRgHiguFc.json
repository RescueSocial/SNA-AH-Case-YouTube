            "description": "In this episode of Disruptors at Work: an Integrated Care Podcast, Dr. Cara English, DBH is joined by Lyndsey Steele and Amber Eck of Milestone Pediatrics. They dive into the topic of integrated pediatric care services for children and families with disabilities including an innovative protocol, Astronaut Training. Astronaut Training is a precise, powerful, therapeutic protocol that is designed to to develop optimal vestibular function, an essential foundation for all sensory processing and movement control. This protocol is administered by occupational and physical therapists that have received advanced education.\n\nMilestone Pediatrics was founded in 2009 by two ambitious women looking to make a difference in the special needs community. To effectively meet the challenges of raising children with disabilities, families have a strong ongoing need for therapeutic interventions for their loved ones. As Milestone Pediatrics saw that need, they decided to fill that void by creating several programs for individuals with disabilities. Their services include Speech Therapy, Occupational therapy, Physical Therapy, Music Therapy and caregiving services. Milestone Pediatrics acts to ensure that people with intellectual and developmental disabilities have meaningful opportunities in our community and can be a part of an inclusive society.
