            "description": "Amber Valentino, PhD, BCBA-D\n\nChildren with autism and other developmental disabilities often have limited functional language to request access to preferred items/activities.  B.F. Skinner (1957) used the term \"mand\" to refer to this type of language.  In the absence of functional mands, behaviors such as \"tantrums,\" aggression, or self-injury may be more likely to develop because these behaviors might produce access to preferred items or events. Thus, it has been recommended that mands be targeted early in behavioral treatment. A large literature exists to support mand training procedures, and there are many nuances to consider in order to ensure that such training is successful. This presentation will emphasize the functional importance of mands, considerations for early mand training, and critical literature-based teaching strategies.",
