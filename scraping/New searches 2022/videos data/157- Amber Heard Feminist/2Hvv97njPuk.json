            "description": "Amber feels that a part of being a good GM is being exposed to different viewpoints and drawing from real experiences in order to create more authentic characters. Because of that, she wanted to try her hand playing a game from the #Feminism  anthology. It\u2019s a collection of nano games written by women that focus on feminist issues. Amber played How to be Ava White by Eva Wei with Kristin and Brandon. This game is about the unrealistic expectations of being a woman. They donned roles of aspects that live in Ava White\u2019s head and debated their fiercely held beliefs. There is a  long debrief after the debate so this episode is about 50% roleplay and 50% talk show.\n\nDisclaimer: The views of the aspects as they are played do not necessarily represent the views of the players.\n\niTunes: https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/shapeshift/id1256535739\nOur Website: http://geekspective.com\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/geekspective\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/geekspective",
