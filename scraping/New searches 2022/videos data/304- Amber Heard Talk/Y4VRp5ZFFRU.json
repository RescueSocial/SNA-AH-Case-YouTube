            "description": "After over a decade of eating a low carb diet high in plant foods, I discovered extraordinary benefits giving up plants in favour of a carnivorous diet. In my quest to understand how this could be so, I found multiple lines of evidence showing that a diet of mainly animal fat and protein was necessary for the evolution of our uniquely human brains. In this talk I will review some anthropological and physiological evidence for the central role of meat eating in humans. On the other hand, despite repetition by authorities, there is no reliable scientific evidence that plant foods contribute to health when adequate meat and animal fat is included in the diet. I will address common myths about the role of plant foods, including vitamins, fibre, and drug-like substances such as phytochemicals. Recorded live at Ketofest 2017 at the Garde Arts Center in New London, CT July 16, 2017. Produced by Pwop Studios",
