I don't know if Mattel heard me but here he is at last.  He looks great. I'm thrilled. I'm so happy with the awesome job Mattel has been doing with the Legacy Series that is based only on the first movie.  For me it's the only Jurassic Park that matters.  Mattel if you see this, please we need a Lex figure and a Genaro figure with toilet or hut.  Even a Dodgson figure would be great since so many fans love that short scene with Nedry.\n\n\nI hope there won't be problems with the comments. I NEVER close comments on new posts.
