The more Amber you pull the easier it is going to be to one shot the boss however, when an Amber dies it explodes dealing AoE damage (roughly 7-8k) so be mindful. Use the time gathering to cap at 5 combo points for Slice and Dice on pull.\n\nOnce you've gathered all of the Amber you'll need run behind the Amber-Shaper and wait for the Coagulated Amber to get close as we want to be very precise with boss timers. Once they are in range evasion and Killing Spree. Again at 3 to 4 seconds left on Soul Capacitor use Mirror of the Blademaster to kill the Coagulated Amber before Soul Capacitor detonates.\n\nBefore Soul Capacitor explodes make sure to use the Legendary Ring so we can carry some of the damage over to the Amber Monstrosity. \n\nOnce Soul Capacitor explodes immediately run over to where the Amber Monstrosity will spawn with the stored damage via Legendary Ring. Make sure that you do not explode on the Pool-tender's. You can't really avoid splitting some of the damage to the Amber-Shaper or any Living Amber but, the extra damage dealt to the Monstrosity will put us ahead of Amber-Shaper Un'sok's Reshape Life timer. Use Drums of Fury to finish the Amber Monstrosities remaining health.",
