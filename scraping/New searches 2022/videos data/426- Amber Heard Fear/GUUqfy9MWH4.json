            "description": "So this boss was nearly impossible to 2-man or 3-man on Heroic due to the mechanics of the boss turning a random player into a Construct.  There are videos out here of a Hunter soloing this on Normal and a 3-man group doing this on Heroic but they're apparently old and mechanics have been changed a bit since those videos.\r\n\r\nAnyway, we just turned the difficulty down to Normal and went ham.  Pretty simple on 3-man.  I'm not sure we could have done 2-man on Normal though because 2 of the 3 people in this run were turned into Constructs and if you do 2-man and both people get turned into Constructs, the raid resets. -- Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/pjstartv",
