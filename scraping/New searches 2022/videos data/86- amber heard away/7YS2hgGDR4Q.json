            "description": "Johnny Depp and Amber Heard threw an engagement party Friday night at an awesome, out-of-the-way venue that had Medieval touches. The party was thrown at the Carondelt House, miles away from Beverly Hills or Hollywood near downtown L.A. Lots of stars showed up, including Johnny's director Jerry Bruckheimer, Marilyn Manson, Rick Ruben and Ryan Adams. Steven Tyler says neither Johnny nor Amber stole the show -- that honor went to Johnny's mom.. There was a ton of food, including lots of vegan selections, to accommodate Amber.",
