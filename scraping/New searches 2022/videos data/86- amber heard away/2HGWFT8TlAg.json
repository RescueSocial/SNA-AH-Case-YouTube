            "description": "Amber Heard and Vito Schnabel were first spotted together in the back seat of a dark SUV in New York City\u00a0in early May.And it looks as if the spark has just gotten stronger between the budding lovebirds.On Tuesday the 32-year-old actress from Texas and the 31-year-old Brooklyn-born art curator look to be going strong as they were pictured holding hands while walking in New York City.Vito was puffing away on a cigarette as he smiled, clearly relishing his time with the ex-wife of Johnny Depp.He had on a white shirt and slacks with blue sneakers and wore a pair of yellow-tinted mirrored sunglasses.Heard was all dolled up for her date with the art guru with pretty makeup and her hair brushed back.The Justice League actress wore a very thin white T-shirt that left little to the imagination with an unusual thin-strapped dress over it.There was also a large hole on her left side that exposed her nude-toned bra.The blonde beauty - who can next be seen in Aquaman - added black pointed boots that showed off her long, toned legs.She also had marks on her legs from her tight socks she must have worn earlier.A long black-and-gold shoulder purse by YSL added pizzazz as did a silver chain necklace and stylish earrings.And the star -\u00a0who made her film debut in the 2004 sports drama Friday Night Lights with Billy Bob Thornton - added several silver rings on her left hand.The couple looked in sync as they walked past an outdoor restaurant as fans took a gander.Later they crossed a street and walked to a parking area where the 3 Days To Kill actress opened her purse to pay a fee.Later the lovebirds got very close as they enjoyed a very long dinner at Italian restaurant Bar Pitti on Sixth Avenue.They had on the same clothes and appeared to be in a riveting conversation over a bottle of red wine and some Italian sparkling water.Vito was no doubt charming his lady love with all his knowledge of the art world.In early May, they were caught by surprise as they seemed to be deep in conversation in a car.Heard was last linked to Tesla founder Elon Musk and Schnabel broke off his romance with supermodel Heidi Klum last year.Amber wore her flaxen locks down and had on a casual white T-shirt as she appeared a bit sleepy while looking out her opened window.Vito wore his sunglasses down on his nose and was slouched down in his car seat as he had an intense expression on his face.The pairing is unusual because they have never been seen together before and no one knew they were friends.Also, while Amber lives in Los Angeles, Vito calls New York City home.Heard was last linked to Musk, who she was on and off with from 2016 until 2017.Musk is now dating musical artist Grimes and they made their public debut as a couple the Met Gala, where Heard was also a guest.Heard was previously married to Depp from 2015 until 2016.They had an ugly and very public split that included accusations of physical and mental abuse.Schnabel dated America's Got Talent star Klum, 44, off and on from 201",
