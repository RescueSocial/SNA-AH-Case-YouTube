            "description": "In the last two videos we heard Amber Heard admit to physically abusing Johnny Depp three times in six weeks. We can't be sure of the details of their relationship but in the context of the audio recording, we also heard her being emotionally abusive towards him. So why was Johnny Depp attracted to a person like Amber? And why are so many people attracted to abusive partners?\n\nI have a BSc (Hons) in Psychology, have trained and worked as an ABA therapist and I have a post graduate diploma in Integrative Counselling and another in Counselling Psychology.
