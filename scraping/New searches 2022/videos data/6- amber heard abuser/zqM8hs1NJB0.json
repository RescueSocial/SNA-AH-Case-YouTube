            "description": "Read full article here: https://readnews.io/86cawy\n\n\n\nAmber Heard was a compulsive liar and the abuser in her marriage to Johnny Depp, the high court was told on the final day of the three-week libel case that has exposed the couples troubled relationship. From the big points to the small points, Ms Heard has proved herself to be a wholly unreliable witness, and, frankly, a compulsive liar, and I dont say that lightly, David Sherborne, Depps lawyer, told the court in his closing submissions. A recording made between Depp and Heard, in which she refers to hitting the Pirates of the Caribbean star, demonstrated her propensity to violence, he said.  At its very core, we say it demonstrates that she is the abuser, not Mr Depp.  He is no wife-beater, Sherborne told Mr Justice Nicol. He added: If it was a man who had said what Ms Heard said and who had admitted to what she admitted to, if this was Mr Depp for example, and it was the other way around, can you imagine what consternation there would be?, he said. Highlighting one text message sent by Heard, in which she wrote: This is Amber and I get what I want, Sherborne said Heard had chopped and changed her evidence, and accused others of lying as she maintained her allegations that Depp was violent towards her. Doctors were lying, nurses were lying, police officers are lying, only Ms Heard, who was at pains to repeat the well-rehearsed mantra that she was not here to call anyone a liar, only Ms Heard was correct at all times no matter what, said Sherborne. Depp, 57, is suing the Suns publishers, News Group Newspapers, and its executive editor, Dan Wootton, over an article that called him a wife beater and referred to overwhelming evidence that he had attacked Heard.  Depp denies ever hitting Heard, 34, who has submitted details of 14 occasions during their relationship when she claims he assaulted her. Sasha Wass, QC, for News Group Newspapers has said its defence is one of truth, namely",
