            "description": "New Audio recordings leaked. A conversation between Johnny Depp and his ex-wife, Amber Heard, rajen while they were still married. Amber filed for a divorce a couple years ago, claiming Johnny was abusive to her. When the new broke out, Johnny a lot of career opportunities like, he won\u2019t be in the pirates of the Carribean movies anymore :/ and all this other stuff. Everyone believed Amber and we thought this stuff was in the past UNTILLLLL this audio came out :)\n\nTake a listen..\n\nIn my honest opinion, \nAmber sounds insane in the audio lol\nLike she has allegations against him, claiming that she could never get a say in any conversation without Johnny getting violent. In these recordings, she doesn\u2019t stop yelling or insulting, and Johnny just takes it. Calmly, hardly raising his voice. He seems to be the voice of reason throughout all of the conversation. \n\n#justiceforjohnnydepp",
