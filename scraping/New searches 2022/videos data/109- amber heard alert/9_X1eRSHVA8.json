            "description": "KANSAS CITY, MO (KCTV) -\u00a0Police in Kansas City have recovered the vehicle believed to be used in the abduction of a 15-year-old Kansas City girl on Thursday.\n\nBrajean Sledge was abducted from a home in the 2700 block of Elmwood Avenue after a man entered her grandfather's home and shot her 60-year-old\u00a0grandfather.\n\nAn Amber Alert has been issued in both Missouri and Kansas for Sledge.\n\nPolice say Sledge's grandfather was\u00a0taken to an area hospital and is in serious but stable condition.\n\nThe suspect, who could be with Sledge, is described as a black male between the ages of 18-20. He should be considered armed and dangerous.\u00a0\n\n\"We believe she is with the shooting suspect and we believe she is also in danger,\" said Kansas City police officer Jake Becchina. \"They were last seen northbound from here in a 2017 KIA forte license plate MB5 G5B.\"\n\nAt about 8 a.m. Friday, officers recovered the suspect vehicle near 112th Street and Bennington Avenue.\n\nDetectives are actively searching the area and are processing the contents of the vehicle.\n\nSledge was last seen wearing a white V-neck t-shirt and dark pants. Police say she has black hair with a blonde weave.\n\nThe suspect is described as a black male in his late teens last seen wearing a gray hoodie.\n\nNeighbors say they heard gunfire in the area and were shocked to find out what happened.\n\n\"If I was the parents, I would be worried as well,\" neighbor Montay McKinney said. \"I know it's a tough situation for the family. I send my condolences.\"\n\nPolice delayed making a statewide Amber Alert Thursday because they believed the girl was still in the Kansas City area. They have since expanded their search.\n\nIt should be noted that Sledge goes by multiple different names and aliases:\n\nBrajaean Sledge\n\nBrajean Sweeten\n\nBre-Shawn\n\nBrayshawn\n\nBrajean\n\nRayshawn\n\nAnyone who sees Sledge or has information about the suspect or their whereabouts is asked to call 911.",
