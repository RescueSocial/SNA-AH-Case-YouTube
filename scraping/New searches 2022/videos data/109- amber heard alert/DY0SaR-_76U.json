            "description": "Local, state and federal authorities are investigating the disappearance of a 5-year-old girl who is missing in Tennessee. 5-year-old Summer Wells was last seen walking from her home Tuesday evening in the Beech Creek community of Hawkins County. Authorities initially issued an endangered child alert, but as of Wednesday upgraded it to an AMBER Alert, citing \u201cnew information and growing concern,\u201d\n\nPolice held a press conference on Wednesday detailing the search efforts and the challenges facing investigators, but have said very little about the circumstances of Summer\u2019s disappearance. Police have not publicly identified a suspect or issued a vehicle description, details that often accompany AMBER Alerts.\n\nHawkins County Sheriff Ronnie Lawson said at Wednesday\u2019s news conference that the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation and the FBI were aiding local authorities in the search, which involves dense, challenging terrain. Lawson also said at the press conference that investigators are having difficulty communicating because of spotty cell phone service in the remote area of eastern Tennessee.\n\n\u201cWhat makes it so hard is communication between boots on the ground, searchers in the woods and the different agencies. We aren\u2019t like in these towns where they\u2019ve got a lot of cell service,\u201d Lawson said\n\nLawson said that Summer\u2019s family is cooperating, and that it was too early in the investigation to determine if foul play was involved in the little girl\u2019s disappearance.\n\nSummer Wells is described as 3-feet tall with blonde hair, recently cut short. When she was last seen, she was wearing a pink shirt and grey shorts. Anyone with information or who sees her should immediately call 911.\n\nThis video is for educational purposes.\n\nDon't forget to Subscribe:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5c1crGPtnf3ZJ5TKWl918Q\n\nSubscribe to my new vlog channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHOYcyT3bHfeEh4n65C1TYQ/\n\nBecome a Patron:\nwww.patreon.com/JimevaCrimeTime\n\n#summerwells",
