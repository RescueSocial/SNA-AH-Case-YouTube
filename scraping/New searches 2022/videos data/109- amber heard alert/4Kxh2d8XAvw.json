            "description": "Barney Fife mentions \"Amber alert\" on The Andy Griffith show.  Anyone ever hear of the Mandela Effect? I have, and I think this might be an example.  The Amber Alert was named after a little girl named Amber who was kidnapped and murdered in Texas in 1996. She was born in 1986 and was just 9 years old when she went missing many Years after this show was televised. So why does Barney Fife use the phrase named after a little girl in the future, and practically uses it in the proper context. Its normally used as an emergency alert for missing or abducted children but he uses it in an emergency situation on the show. Close enough.   What do you think. Do your own research on the show and the Amber Alert and tell me what you think.",
