            "description": "Sofia Lucerno Juarez disappeared years ago and has never been found. Many people have heard of her case because she was the first child for whom an Amber Alert was issued in the state of Washington. However, far fewer people have heard of the decades-old cold case of Roland Jack Spencer III, who vanished without a trace and has hardly been talked about since. Today, we'll explore both cases of these tragic disappearances, and the lives of these children who were taken too soon.\n\nSofia Lucerno Juarez: 0:00-10:38\nRoland Jack Spencer III: 10:39-16:35\n\nIF YOU HAVE INFORMATION ON SOPHIA, CALL:\n1-800-THE-LOST\n509-585-4208\n\nIF YOU HAVE INFORMATION ON ROLAND, CALL:\n1-800-THE-LOST case #1149796\n(509)865.7765\n(325)423.2458 (to set up a DNA appointment, NOT for high-priority info)\n\nDISCLAIMER: I do not mean any disrespect in the creation of this video.
