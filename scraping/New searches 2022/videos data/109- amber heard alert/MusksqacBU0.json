With no certainty that anyone is looking for her, and seemingly hours away from home, she's forced to play house wife with a man that has had twelve other 'wives'. \n\nEach of them now dead. \n\nFrom breaking a rule, and making another as they escape. With 12 rules and the obvious exits blocked, from how the previous girls escaped. Is the only way out to play along and be a 'loving wife' or will she die during the chase? Would anyone know what happened to her or would she be labeled as a runaway? Where is she in the first place?\n\nLink to Story: http://www.wattpad.com/story/1657022-amber-alert\n\nLink to my account to make trailers: www.wattpad.com/user/TaylorMonet \nor\nwww.wattpad.com/user/StolenGlances",
