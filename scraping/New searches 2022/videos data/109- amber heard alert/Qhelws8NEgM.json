            "description": "This video is dedicated to our Fallen Angels, children everywhere that have fallen victim to abuse and crimes of violence.\n\nRomans 12:19 Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.\n\nWhile talking with my sister one night last Fall she recanted a story that she claimed she had heard on the news. It was about a little girl who had been abducted from her bedroom in the middle of the night while her parents were sleeping in a nearby room. When they woke up the next morning they called the police immediately to report it, however, an Amber Alert was not issued because her Dad was on Welfare and her Mom was a dancer at a local exotic dance club. I was never able to verify the story but the next day I wrote this song and called it Amber Alert.\n\nYou can find all of these Fallen Angels pictures and news stories on the Internet.\n\nIf you are in need of prayer either email me or add your prayer requests to the comments section and I will pray for you. \n\nCopyright\nGeorge Deveaux",
