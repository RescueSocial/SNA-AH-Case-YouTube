            "description": "This is a very advanced reverse. Both because of speaking patterns that change very slightly,\nand because of many words and phrases that sound the same but are just one minute bit different. \nThe symbolism carries through very well, however. Those of you who are familiar with my videos understand the symbolism between the Hair and the Heritage in dreams, and embedded deep in the human psyche. You can imagine the psychological symbolism of have \"Fake Hair\" then. or being \"Bald\".\n\nBut there are actually 2 or three underlying stories. \nMissy describes being found by \"Lesbian Feminists\" who showed up to her \"Dancefloor\" and not only didn't dance But stopped all of the dancing because they don't dance. They offered good money and so \"bought her voice\" They want to fight skinny women over the \"Boy\" and Missy describes \"Grabbing popcorn and watching\", she thinks it is entertaining because it is an impossible fight, men are attracted to thin women. These same women idolize Missy because she is not affected by this, but in her own words, she's still at \"School\" learning a lesson and gives the advice to \"Eat Right\", \"work out\" and then just say \"Hi, hi, hi, hi\".\n\nWhen I do a reverse I not only pay attention to the audio, but I get to see every frame in the video.\nPedophilia is both referenced in the Lyric of reversed speech and In video by the Girl with the Pizza Purse who ushers the fatter girl into \"Missy Land\". If you have heard about MKULTRA the british alter is the most common one created amongst MK alters @4:54\n\nThere are several side arcs including a story about a Woman who pays a \"Fag\" to make her pregnant, and then the \"Fag\" later \"Sues her\" for custody of the child. This is not a reverse for the feint of heart, or the weak minded. There is an awful lot to unpack with this one.\n\nThe \"Wizards\" or Produces of the video, were shooting for a \"Spell\" or a scene of \"Bring your weave, we a rich nigga\". But \"The Owl, forgetful and the will deep winning\". @1:32\nThe \"Deep will\" for a way out of this mess is what has changed the actual meaning from the Producer's intent.\n\n\"Amber Alert\" is a call for help to the people, when a child has gone missing. Over 50% of black children are aborted, The social acceptability of Homosexuality has become the new pillar that pedophiles stand on.\nThis is an amazing point brought up by this video, The widespreadness of Homosexuality, is a counter swing\ncaused by the \"War between men and women\". Of which, even in Missy's words \"She patented\", was the pioneer of some of these ideas which caused harm. Because women \"Stole\" and committed \"Sin\" they become \"Bald\". No Heritage, no lineage. The idea of men as \"Slaves\" is portrayed visually (By them being the motive force of the Vehicle) an allegory for financial slavery of men, using \"Divorce\" as a toy.  In the war of men and women, the war is not one of the \"Gun\" @2:43\nThe school is shown as \"Choices, waste your time\", women are warned by her that they are \"To slow\" to have children. If they wait too long their \"Hair grow old\" and eventually they run out of time at all for children. In later verses she says they \"had no-one\" and end up all alone. Perhaps something that She is still in the process of learning herself because she admits \"She still at school\" too.\n\n\"Here is Help\" Missy says with a good number of the pre-chorus lines. But even within the lyric her reverse mind tells us she shouldn't really be commended. She's a sinner, and on this one tiny issue, is on the side of good in the war, but on many other things she has caused much harm with her platform. It is a Mirror to KRS ONE, where he has a mostly positive and good track record but one one or two issues does harm, Missy has a mostly negative track record but on this does very good. Even though she is being hired by these people, she doesn't agree with them, and they don't understand her music or even what she is about. Her thoughts are, don't lash out at the pretty girl because she gets the boy, work out, eat right, and go and say hi. This may be a lesson learned from her own personal life, because I bet once she lost a little weight, she felt the male attention increase in her own life.\n@2:24 \"Blister ya, but Jam with this little Issue.\"",
