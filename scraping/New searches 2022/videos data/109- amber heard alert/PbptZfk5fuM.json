            "description": "Amber Heard talks about career roadblocks due bisexual revelation\n\u2018Danish Girl\u2019 starlet Amber Heard was shocked to see how coming out as bisexual in 2010, impacted her career.\n\nAddressing the second annual Pride and Prejudice Summit in New York, Amber revealed the truth about her sexuality to a reporter.\n\n&ldquo I just answered honestly,\u201d she revealed in her interview that took place seven years ago. \u201cI could tell by the look on this person\u2019s face it was a big deal. My poor publicist! Then I realised the gravity of what I had done and why so many people -studio execs, agents, advisers -did not want this coming before my name. I became attached to a label. So, I watched as I quickly became not actress Amber Heard but out lesbian Amber Heard.\u201d\n\nThe warnings given by Hollywood execs did carry some truth within about being stigmatised.\n\nThe thirty-year-old actress revealed how it affected her career, stating, \u201cIt did impact my career; it was difficult. It was not easy. I was the only one working in this way, so it was definitely difficult; because no one had done it. I did that even though everyone told me it would end my career without a doubt.\u201d\n\nHowever, her confession was worth the entire struggle she went through. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen myself defined by the person I\u2019m with. I saw myself being in this unique position and having a unique responsibility. So, I bit the bullet,\u201d she stated.\n\nAround that time, she had credits in Zombieland and Pineapple Express under her belt and she was on the rise.\n\n\u201cAs a leading lady, there\u2019s a certain amount of wish fulfilment. I was asked \u2018How is anyone going to invest in you romantically if they think you\u2019re unavailable?\u2019\u201d she recalled. \u201cI said, \u2018Watch me do it.\u2019\u201d\n\nAmber dated artist and photographer Tasya van Ree at that time and they split in 2012, after four years of dating. She fell for The Rum Diary co-star Johnny Depp and they got married. \u201cWhen I hear someone comment about me coming out, I think it\u2019s funny because I was never in part because I was very stubborn, I guess, and also in part because I just didn\u2019t feel it was wrong,\u201d she commented.\n\nShe concluded, \u201cI stand here now among many of my romantic leading lady peers who are out and fluid. I\u2019m one of many now, and I\u2019m working. If every gay man that I know personally in Hollywood came out tomorrow, then this would be a nonissue in a month. We have a long way to go.\u201d\n\nLast her, Heard finalised her divorce with Depp and lately, she\u2019s been linked to billionaire Elon Musk.",
