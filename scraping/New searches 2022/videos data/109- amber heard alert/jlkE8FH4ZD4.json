Maddie told her sister to promise that shell never leave her, she promised.\n\nWhen they went in, the played allot of games, they got a little bored so they have decided to play hide and seek, Maddie wasn\u2019t feeling good about it but she went with it. Kenzie looked for places to hide but she didn\u2019t find a good spot, she went far from her sister, But she didn\u2019t know where she was heading.\n\nKenzie went to an unknown place, she saw a k!dnapper with a dead body, when the k!dnapper saw Kenzie she ran to catch her. \n\nMaddie was done counting and went to search for Kenzie but unfortunately she didn\u2019t find her anywhere. She went to her parents and told them about Kenzie. \nMean while with Kenzie, the k!dnapper took her and tried to put her in a chair and tie her up, but Kenzie kept making it difficult by moving the chair. When Kenzie got hurt in her feet the k!dnapper turned her and sat her down then tied her up.\n\nMaddie was in a search for Kenzie with her parents, she started to have flashback about the sweet moments of Kenzie, she started to be emotional because she realized that someone is really on her side and loved her. \n\nThe k!dnapper decided to call her friends for backup, she didn\u2019t want to murder a 9 year old. Maddie was still searching.\n\nWhen the k!dnapper\u2019s friends came, she asked what to do with Kenzie, her friend brought poisonous pills with her, they all agreed to poison her.\n\nHer friend held her and opened Kenzie\u2019s mouth so they can put the pill on her mouth, Kenzie accidentally swallowed it and became dizzy. Her friends heard footsteps and ran away. \n\nMaddie found Kenzie and she hugged her, she thought that Kenzie was alive... When Maddie raised her head she noticed that she was poisoned, Maddie got emotional and ran away she never looked back...\n~~~\nThat\u2019s it :DDD\u2764\ufe0f\n_______________________\nVideo:\nTime taken: 1 day (Including break)\nApps used:\n\nKineMaster \nIbis paint\nMagic eraser \nGacha life\nM y  f i n g e r s\n\nThumbnail:\nTime taken: 8 Minutes ;^\nApp(s) used:\n\nIbis paint \nGacha life\nMagic eraser\n\nVideo Inspiration: \nhttps://youtu.be/RQlNFqxw3Ac\nMusic Used: \nhttps://youtu.be/RQlNFqxw3Ac\nOriginal music: \nhttps://youtu.be/UmJsYbMOXFw\n\nOriginal by: ItsMoonlight edits\n_______________________\nTysm for watching :DD \u2764\ufe0f\n\ud83d\udc96\u2728\ud83d\udc97\u2728\ud83d\udc95\u2728\ud83d\udc93\u2728\ud83d\udc9e\u2728\ud83d\udc98\u2728\ud83d\udc9d\u2728\ud83c\udf38\u2728\ud83c\udf08\u2728\ud83d\udcab\u2728\ud83c\udf5f",
