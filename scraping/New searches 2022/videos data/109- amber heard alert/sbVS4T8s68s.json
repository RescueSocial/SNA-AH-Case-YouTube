            "description": "First time I\u2019ve heard an alert on my radio that is non-weather related. It will notify you though, because it is a \u201cweather/all hazards\u201d radio. AMBER ALERT was issued around 1:40 earlier this afternoon in Putnam County. Suspect stole the child in McNabb, Illinois, which is about 40 miles north of where I live. Just got news that the baby and suspect were found in Oglesby, IL about an hour later. The suspect is in custody. Thankfully the baby is safe. That tone sounded more eerie than the severe weather alert tone. I don\u2019t know if the alert tones are different for advisories, watches, and warnings, but this was a different tone. Definitely more spooky than the severe weather one.",
