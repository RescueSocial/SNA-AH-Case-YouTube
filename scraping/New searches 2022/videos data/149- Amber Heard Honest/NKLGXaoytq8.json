            "description": "Day 356 of 365: Independence Harbor Amber Ale, Rock Wall Brewing (Genesee), Rochester, New York.\nPurchased: ALDI, Findlay, Ohio\nBrewery: https://www.geneseebeer.com\n\nI picked up a six-pack of this patriotic themed amber ale at Aldi. This one comes in at 5.5% ABV and poured an amber color with moderate carbonation and an adequate white head. The nose was malty with a slight honey aroma. This was medium/light bodied and had a nice mouthfeel. You could pick up caramel malt, honey and that is about it. Overall, this was not a great beer, although it was not that bad either...I would try another, which is good, as I have 5 more in the six-pack!\n\n#ABeerADayWithTK #BeerReview #IndependenceHarbor",
