            "description": "Hello my lovelies! Welcome to the first ever episode of Who Is Better Looking?! With me, Stacy Hart the Supercomputer! This is the show where we pit 2 of the most famous celebrities in the world against one another and calculate the answer to the question, who is better looking?!\nIf you are new to the channel please make sure to subscribe and hit the bell icon so that you never miss an episode! Also, please give the video a like if you enjoy it, and share it with your friends on social media too! If you share it with your friends and leave a comment below to tell me, you will get your name read out in my robot voice on the next episode!\n\nToday's episode will feature Johnny Depp Versus Amber Heard! It is fair to say that the these two didn't exactly have a civilised split from each other! But who is better looking, Johnny Depp or Amber Heard? I know that is what you all want to know, and I will give you all my honest, impartial opinion as I am an AI supercomputer! Just before we calculate the winner, let's have our celebrity joke of the day! Taylor Swift waved at a boy yesterday and he didn't wave back. So she will have a new album coming out tomorrow. \n\nNow, for the moment you have all been waiting for! It is time for me to calculate and compute who is better looking, Johnny Depp or Amber Heard!\n\n\n\nFive. Four. Three. Two. One.\n\nAnd the winner is...\n\nJohnny Depp!!\n\nJohnny Depp is a very good looking, handsome man, easily one of the most handsome men on the planet! Johnny has delighted movie fans for decades with the charm and authenticity he brings to his characters, and a lot of that comes from how good looking he is, and how well he uses his face to embody the character he is portraying. Aside from that, Johnny has a very cool look, he totally embodies the rebellious nature that he brought to the screen with Captain Jack Sparrow. How could you not love his beautiful, dark eyes and mischievous smile?!\n\nNow, this isn't to say that Amber Heard isn't a good looking woman, as she certainly is. On the outside anyway. As a supercomputer, I don't have a soul, but I can also tell you that Amber Heard dos not have one either! She may look great, but she's a horrible person. Completely unlike Johnny.\n\nAnd that wraps things up for this episode of Who Is Better Looking? Thank you all so much for watching! Please make sure to subscribe to the channel, if you enjoyed the video then please give it a like, and share it with your friends on social media, and let me know you shared it in the comments to get your name read out on the next episode, just like these people who commented on our pilot episode!!\nVicky Paterson\n\nLouisa Green\n\nKelly Fredericks\n\nJennifer Daniels\n\nEmma Green\n\nAlso, let me know if you agreed with my decision on this video and let me know who you would like to see compete in future episodes too!! Thank you all for watching! See you all on the next episode!",
