            "description": "Welcome to our channel; in this video, You'll get to know Why Jason Mamoa Hates Working With Amber Heard.\n\nWe all know how fun and interesting Jason Momoa is. He's a person with a big heart, he's such a lovely and kind soul, to be honest, he's someone who would never think badly of anyone, whether he's friends with them or not, all he wants is for everyone else on this planet to be happy and satisfied. What we mean is that the 1.93 meters tall, well-built physique Hollywood celebrity is a prankster, and guess what, he never pulls a typical prank. Jason is one of the types that will test your patience and ultimately toy with it, so try to remain calm and patient with him.\n\nLet us know your thoughts about this Video in the comments below, and don't forget to subscribe for Daily content about your favorite celebrities and more entertainment news!\n\nHope you guys enjoy this!\n\nIf you enjoy this video, please like and share it.\n\nSubscribe now: @Celeb Daily\n\nDon't forget to subscribe to this channel for more updates.\n\nWatch our other videos:\nhttps://youtu.be/rNmNj8L8if8\nhttps://youtu.be/vzjy-isRp2k\nhttps://youtu.be/xVqVUllvNW4\nhttps://youtu.be/4Gal5hyvgeQ\nhttps://youtu.be/l0Rc0HsY6hg\nhttps://youtu.be/2lrvcUp38vc\nhttps://youtu.be/wYgSouWVqjo\nhttps://youtu.be/z06nbYtg1H4\nhttps://youtu.be/FvUAjluGSSE\nhttps://youtu.be/0RgYDICTGtY\nhttps://youtu.be/xzX60nLtIkQ\n\nThank you for watching this video.
