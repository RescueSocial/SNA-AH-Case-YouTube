            "title": "Amber Heard at Tribeca Film Festival for \"The Adderall Diaries\"",
            "description": "Based on the bestselling memoir by Stephen Elliott, The Adderall Diaries is the story of an author (James Franco) paralyzed by writer's block and an escalating drug dependency who is sucked down the rabbit hole of a high-profile murder case. As Elliott becomes increasingly obsessed with the trial his own nightmarish childhood memories resurface, particularly of his cruel and distant father (Ed Harris). But when his estranged father returns with his own story to tell, fact and fiction become blurred in an amphetamine-induced haze.\n\nFeaturing supporting performances by Amber Heard, Cynthia Nixon, and Christian Slater, Pamela Romanowsky's first feature is an unflinchingly honest drama about fathers and sons, what it means to tell the truth, and the way we choose to write our own story.\n\nSubscribe to Entertainment Scoop!\nhttp://www.youtube.com/subscription_c...\n\nVisit our website for more celebrity and entertainment news!\nhttp://www.entscoop.com \n\nAre we friends yet?
