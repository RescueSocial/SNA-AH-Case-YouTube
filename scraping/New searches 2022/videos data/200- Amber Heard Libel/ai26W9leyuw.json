            "description": "Amber Heard 's claim that she gave her \u00a35.5million ($7million) divorce settlement to charity was a 'calculated and manipulative lie', Johnny Depp 's lawyers have told the Court of Appeal. The Hollywood star (left in London last year) is trying to overturn a damning High Court ruling that he assaulted his ex-wife (right last year) and put her in fear for her life, and is asking the Court of Appeal to order a retrial of his libel claim against The Sun. Following a three-week trial in July last year, Mr Justice Nicol ruled that Mr Depp, 57, assaulted Ms Heard, 34, on a dozen occasions and put her in 'fear for her life' three times. The judge found that an April 2018 column calling Mr Depp a 'wife beater' was 'substantially true'.  He said 'a recurring theme in Mr Depp's evidence was that Ms Heard had constructed a hoax and that she had done this as an 'insurance policy', and that Ms Heard was a 'gold-digger'. But he added: 'I do not accept this characterisation of Ms Heard.' Today the actor's legal team (David Sherborne QC inset) was back in court to claim the star 'did not receive a fair trial' and is applying for permission to appeal against the ruling at the Royal Courts of Justice in London on Thursday. Neither Mr Depp nor Ms Heard (her lawyer Sasha Wass QC inset) were in court today.\n\nOriginal Article: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9375995/Johnny-Depps-lawyers-accuse-Amber-Heard-lying-giving-5-5m-divorce-settlement-charity.html\nOriginal Video: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/video/newsalerts/video-2378896/Video-Johnny-Depp-seeks-appeal-against-ruling-wife-beater-libel-case.html\n\nDaily Mail Facebook: http://facebook.com/dailymail\nDaily Mail IG: http://instagram.com/dailymail\nDaily Mail Snap: https://www.snapchat.com/discover/Daily-Mail/8392137033\nDaily Mail Twitter: http://twitter.com/MailOnline\nDaily Mail Pinterest: http://pinterest.co.uk/dailymail\nDaily Mail Google+: https://plus.google.com/+DailyMail\n\nGet the free Daily Mail mobile app: http://dailymail.co.uk/mobile",
