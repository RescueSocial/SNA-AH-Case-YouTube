The newpaper has earlier claimed that the Pirates Of Caribbean actor was an abusive husband and a wife beater referring to his married life with ex-wife Amber Heard. \nJohnny Depp has sued \u201cThe Sun\u2019s executive Director\u201d Dan Wootton and News Group Newspapers over an article accusing the actor of being involved in domestic violence and physical altercation towards Amber Heard when they were together. \nBut on Monday, November 2nd, 2020 the UK high court has ruled in favor of the tabloid. But does it mean the court has also confirmed Johnny Depp as a \u201cWife Beater\u201d? \nAs reported by CNN: \nCiting evidence, including photos, audio recordings and Depp's own text messages, lawyers for the newspaper group argued in court filings that Depp \"beat his wife Amber Heard, causing her to suffer significant injury, and on occasion leading to her fearing for her life.\"\nJudge Andrew Nicol has passed a historical judgment favoring the News outlet and categorically mentioned the claims made by the News Outlet are substantially true. \n\"I have reached these conclusions having examined in detail the 14 incidents on which the defendants rely, as well as the over-arching considerations which the claimant submitted I should take into account,\" the judge said.\nDuring the trial Depp has admitted having problem with drugs and alcohol but has always denied the accusation of being violent with his partner. \nThe case was highly publicized and got heated in the month of July this year and Amber Heard has narrated her side of story acknowledging the tabloid\u2019s claim to be correct. \n\"When Johnny puts his attention on you, with all his intensity and darkness, it is unlike anything I've ever experienced,\" she said in a written witness statement submitted to the court.\n\"Some incidents were so severe that I was afraid he was going to kill me, either intentionally or just by losing control and going too far. He explicitly threatened to kill me many times, especially later in our relationship,\" Heard told the court, according to the UK's PA Media news agency.\nThe tabloid is one of the subsidiaries owned by Media Magnet Rupert Murdoch released a statement following the verdict: \n\"The Sun has stood up and campaigned for the victims of domestic abuse for over 20 years. Domestic abuse victims must never be silenced and we thank the judge for his careful consideration and thank Amber Heard for her courage in giving evidence to the court.\"  \nNow it will be interesting to see if Amber Heard is motivated to pursue it further and take legal action for what has already been substantiated by London High Court, or it\u2019s the case closed. \nWhat are your thoughts? \nThanks \u2026..",
