            "description": "(9 Jul 2020) Actor Johnny Depp and his ex-wife, actress Amber Heard arrived at the High Court in London on Thursday for the third day of a three-week trial over his libel case against a British newspaper.\r\nDepp is suing News Group Newspapers, publisher of The Sun, and the paper\u2019s executive editor, Dan Wootton, over an April 2018 article that said he\u2019d physically abused ex-wife Amber Heard. \r\nThe newspaper's lawyers plan to use Heard's allegations of abuse by Depp to defend the \u201cwife beater\u201d claim.\r\nThe trial opened on Tuesday. \r\nIt is one of the first major cases to be held in person since Britain began to lift its coronavirus lockdown.\r\nDepp, 57, and Heard, 34, met on the set of the 2011 comedy \u201cThe Rum Diary\u201d and married in Los Angeles in February 2015. They divorced in 2017 and now bitterly accuse one another of abuse.\r\nWhile Heard isn't on trial, the case is also a showdown between the former spouses, who accuse each other of being controlling, violent and deceitful.\r\nIt is set to put the two performers\u2019 complex private lives under a microscope.\r\nDepp is also suing Heard in the United States for 50 million US dollars for allegedly defaming him in a Washington Post article about domestic abuse. \r\nThat case is due to be heard next year.\r\n\r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives \u200b\u200b\r\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/db2f4c0be67b49ce949681eaeaac4f4d",
