            "description": "Amber Heard has arrived at the High Court today after going out on the town with her sister until the early hours of this morning on the third day of Johnny Depp's blockbuster libel trial in London. The 34-year-old actress was seen leaving Oswald's, a private members club with bottles of wine costing hundreds of pounds, just after 1.40am with her sister Whitney and other friends. Heard appeared to be wearing a similar outfit to the one she has worn to each day of Depp's libel action in the High Court, while\u00a0Whitney - who is set to give evidence during her sister's trial - wore a blue jumpsuit. Heard arrived at the High Court this morning as Depp, 57, is expected to take the stand again after days of evidence where he has been accused of being violent towards her. Depp is suing The Sun for libel after it labelled him a 'wife beater' in a trial that is set to take three weeks and feature celebrity witnesses including Vanessa Paradis and Paul Bettany.\n\nOriginal Article: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8505199/Amber-Heard-hits-town-small-hours-morning-day-three-Johnny-Depp-trial.html\nOriginal Video: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/video/newsalerts/video-2207490/Video-Day-Three-Johnny-Depp-Amber-Heard-arrive-High-Court.html\n\nDaily Mail Facebook: http://facebook.com/dailymail\nDaily Mail IG: http://instagram.com/dailymail\nDaily Mail Snap: https://www.snapchat.com/discover/Daily-Mail/8392137033\nDaily Mail Twitter: http://twitter.com/MailOnline\nDaily Mail Pinterest: http://pinterest.co.uk/dailymail\nDaily Mail Google+: https://plus.google.com/+DailyMail\n\nGet the free Daily Mail mobile app: http://dailymail.co.uk/mobile",
