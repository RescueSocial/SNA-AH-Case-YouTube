The other side of him was a monster but I always held out hope he would get clean and sober.\u201d\r\nIn her first three days of testimony, Heard, 34, has accused Depp of an array of acts of violence, including throwing bottles at her \u201clike grenades,\u201d headbutting her and even of stubbing out a cigarette on his cheek. She has claimed that she often feared for her life during their tempestuous relationship.\r\nDepp denies abusing Heard and claims she was the aggressor during their tempestuous relationship. \r\nDepp, 57, is suing The Sun, specifically its publisher, News Group Newspapers, and its executive editor, Dan Wootton, for labeling him in an April 2018 article as a \u201cwife-beater.\u201d \r\nThe Sun\u2019s defense relies on 14 allegations made by Heard of violence by Depp between 2013 and 2016, in settings as varied as a rented house in Australia, his private island in the Bahamas and a private jet. \r\nThe case is due to finish next week with closing submissions from both sides\u2019 legal teams on Monday and Tuesday.\r\n\r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives \u200b\u200b\r\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/9ff36041b0cb438ea2093143cee2727f",
