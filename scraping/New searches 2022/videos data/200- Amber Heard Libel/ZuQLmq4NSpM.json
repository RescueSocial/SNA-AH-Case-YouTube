            "description": "Actor Johnny Depp lost his libel case against\u00a0Britain\u2019s The Sun newspaper after they called him a\u00a0\u201cwife beater\u201d in 2018, after a tumultuous relationship with ex-wife Amber Heard,\u00a0Us Weekly confirmed on Monday, November 2. \u00a0Judge Andrew Nicol from the Royal Courts of Justice in London ruled that the publication\u2019s allegation was\u00a0\u201csubstantially true,\u201d according to court documents obtained by Us Weekly. In his 129-page judgment, Nicol also wrote that there was sufficient evidence that the Pirates of the\u00a0Caribbean\u00a0actor, 57, had physically assaulted Heard, 34, at least 12 of the 14 times she claimed he did. \u00a0\u201cI accept her evidence of the nature of the assaults he committed against her. They must have been terrifying,\u201d the judge wrote. \u201cI accept that Mr. Depp put her in fear of her life.\u201d \u00a0Nicol also stated that Heard\u2019s allegations \u201chave had a negative effect on her career as an actor and activist.\u201d Previously, the actress said that she was\u00a0\u201csubjected to a campaign of targeted online abuse on social media as well as online petitions calling for [her] to be removed from any future sequel to Aquaman and from [her] association with L\u2019Or\u00e9al,\u201d according to her witness statement from March.  The Way They Were: Amber Heard and Johnny Depp's Relationship Timeline  \u00a0Heard alleged that Depp struck her multiple times. He denied the allegations and accused her of having hit him. While speaking to the court, Heard recounted this 2015 incident and explained she was protecting her sister, Whitney Heard, claiming her ex tried to shove Whitney down a flight of stairs. \u00a0Depp and Heard first met in 2009 on the set of The Rum Diary and tied the knot in 2015. She filed for divorce in 2016 and obtained a temporary restraining order against the actors which was ultimately dropped. After their divorce was finalized in 2017, Heard donated the $7 million settlement to various charities. \u00a0Following Judge Nichol\u2019s ruling, Heard\u2019s lawyer, Elaine Charlson Bredehoft, told the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0that judgment was \u201cnot a surprise\u201d and that she is \u201ccommitted to obtaining justice\u201d in the United States, where Heard and Depp are set to appear in court over a Washington Post op-ed\u00a0she wrote in December 2018.\u00a0In a statement to Reuters,\u00a0Depp\u2019s British law firm, Schillings, called the judgement \u201cas perverse as it is bewildering.\u201d \u00a0\u201cThe judgment is so flawed that it would be ridiculous for Mr. Depp not to appeal this decision,\u201d the statement read. \u00a0If you or someone you know is experiencing domestic violence, please call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-7233 for confidential support.",
