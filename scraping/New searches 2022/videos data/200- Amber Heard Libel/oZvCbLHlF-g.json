            "description": "LONDON (Reuters) - Hollywood star Johnny Depp accused his ex-wife, actress Amber Heard, of conducting extra-marital affairs and lying about him beating her up when he appeared in a London court on Tuesday to pursue legal action against a British tabloid newspaper. \u00a0Depp, the 57-year-old star of the \u201cPirates of the Caribbean\u201d films, is suing The Sun\u2019s publisher, News Group Newspapers, and its executive editor, Dan Wootton, for libel over an article Wootton wrote in April 2018 calling him a \u201cwife beater\u201d. \u00a0Lawyers for Britain\u2019s Sun tabloid said they would demonstrate that the accusation was accurate and that the actor\u2019s recollection may be affected by his excessive drug use. \u00a0Depp, wearing a dark suit and glasses and speaking in a deep clear tone, took the stand at the beginning of the case, while Heard, who arrived wearing a red scarf tied around her face, is also due to give evidence. \u00a0\u201cFor the avoidance of any doubt, I have never abused Ms Heard, or, indeed, any other woman, in my life,\u201d Depp said in a witness statement. \u00a0Depp\u2019s lawyer David Sherborne said in a written opening statement to London\u2019s High Court that Heard had first aired abuse allegations in May 2016 when she obtained a restraining order against Depp and appeared to have bruises on her face caused in an incident six days earlier. \u00a0\u201cThere is a substantial body of evidence ... which clearly demonstrates that this was a lie manufactured by Ms Heard and her friends,\u201d Sherborne said. \u00a0\u201cThe Claimant\u2019s position is clear; Ms Heard\u2019s allegations are complete lies. The Claimant was not violent towards Ms Heard, it was she who was violent to him.\u201d Actor Johnny Depp arrives at the High Court in London, Britain July 7, 2020. REUTERS/Peter Nicholls\u00a0In papers submitted to the court, Depp\u2019s team also said Heard had begun an affair with Tesla chief executive Elon Musk in early 2015 shortly after they had got married and had engaged in at least one extra-marital relationship with her co-stars, with actor James Franco named. \u00a0Depp\u2019s lawyers also said he was the victim of attacks from his ex-wife and had himself sought to avoid confrontation. \u00a0THREE-WEEK CASE \u00a0The couple met on the set of the 2011 film \u201cThe Rum Diary\u201d and married in February 2015. Heard filed for divorce after 15 months and days later obtained a restraining order against Depp.  \u00a0Their divorce was finalised in 2017 when the restraining order was dismissed. \u00a0Lawyers for The Sun said they will suggest Depp is either a \u201cpathological liar or his excessive alcohol and drug abuse have detached him from any insight into his own conduct\u201d. \u00a0Cross-examined by lawyer Sasha Wass, Depp agreed he had taken \u201cevery drug known to man\u201d by the age of 14 and said he had had a difficult childhood and struggled to come to terms with his fame and success. \u00a0\u201cEven when I speak my own name it sounds foreign to me,\u201d he said. Slideshow (4 Images)\u00a0The Sun\u2019s lawyers said it was Depp\u2019s false accusation of infidelity by Heard which led to the violence. \u00a0The case is",
