This role is currently occupied by Amber Heard. Many comic book fans are boycotting Amber Heard for the Johnny Depp lawsuit. The Emilia Clarke Amber Heard saga has been ongoing on the internet. Many fans wants Emilia Clarke to replace Amber Heard in Aquaman 2 or have Amber Heard replaced by Emilia Clarke in other roles. Let's watch the video and see what is going on.\n \nWith the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. \n\nEver since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.\n\n#amberheard #johnnydepp #amberheardlawsuit #Aquaman2\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWelcome toThe Gossipy.
