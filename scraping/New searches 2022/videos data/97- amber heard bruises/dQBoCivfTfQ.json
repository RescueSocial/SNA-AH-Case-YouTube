Very rarely.   \u00a0\"She had a beautiful complexion.\"Six days after the alleged fight, she says Heard sported \"a red cut underneath her right eye and red marks by her eye\" on May 27, 2016.Esparza went on to allege that two weeks after Depp left the Penthouse on June 4, she saw Heard with more injuries.She claims Heard had a bruise on either side of her neck \"in the shape of fingers and a bruise on her left cheek\".Probed by Depp's legal team as to the location of the defendant during this time, Esparza replied: \"Out of the country.\"   \u00a0Asked as to whom Heard had been \"interacting with\" during this time, she simply added: \"Elon Musk.\"Asked if there was anybody else, she replied: \"No.\"Two months later (July 2016), Esparza said she saw Elon Musk go to the building to visit Ms Heard.While Musk was there she said she noticed marks on Heard's body \u2013 the \"left side\".She may also have seen a \"band aid\".The Sun's QC Wass probed: \"You want to suggest that Elon Musk must have injured her?\"   \u00a0Esparza added: \"I didn't suggest that. I don't know what happened.\" \u00a0Adam Waldman, Depp's lawyer, said: \"Johnny Depp left the country after Ms Heard's most notorious abuse hoax where she claimed he threw a phone into her right eye.
