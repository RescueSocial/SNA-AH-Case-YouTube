USE CAUTION WHEN WATCHING\"  I explored the possibility that the bruises on Amber Heard's face could actually be makeup and I also explored if Johnny Depp was drugged in the pictures where he was passed out on the couch and floor. \n\nIn the comment section of the video some people suggested or wondered if it were possible that Amber Heard either had or was passing off a skin condition as bruises. In this video I seek to demystify whether this is true or not and to also explore the possibility that the bruises could be from plastic surgery. Lastly, I revisit the possibility that the bruises are actually makeup. \n\nIn the end, you be the judge on whether the so called bruises on Heard's face are some sort of skin condition, plastic surgery, or makeup.",
