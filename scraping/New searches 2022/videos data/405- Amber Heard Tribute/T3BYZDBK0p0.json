This is a little vieo I made that shows clips of her in the past as well as the hospital scene, the crash and death, and when she saved House.\r\n\r\nI heard Passing Afternoon, and I knew this would be the song I used the video too. For one I liked it, and for another, this was the song that played when Amber saved House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n****** Disclaimer- I do not own House, or any actors, or the clips. \r\n\r\nThanks to Kate J. for the ending of Wilsons Heart\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy my tribute to Amber.\r\n\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\n\r\nOh yeah, I forgot to add, some of the clips were STUBBRON... so thats why they stopped for like 3 seconds and then worked... \r\n\r\nnot everything was coorperative for me...",
