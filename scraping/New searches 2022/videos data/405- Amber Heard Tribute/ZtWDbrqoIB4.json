            "description": "I first heard 311 in 1998. I was in middle school and it was an awesome time in my life. I was just beginning to play drums in the school band and I was discovering lots of new music. As soon as I heard Chad play drums I thought to myself, one day I want to be that good. He had that super tight style with an amazing sounding kit. So here we are 23 years later. A huge influence to me as a young drummer and I still love to play 311 on the drums. Seen them live 4-5 times and they put on a hell of a show. I hope I did it some justice. Thank you Chad!",
