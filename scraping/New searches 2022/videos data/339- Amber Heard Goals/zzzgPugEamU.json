They talk about what he learned from his experience, the improvements they\u2019ve seen in the people they\u2019ve helped, why they call their grants \u201cfoundational healing grants,\u201d and how the current psychedelic renaissance is missing a key element in the power of psychedelics: that maybe the issues we are working to try and heal (and their solutions) may be more physiological than we realize.\n\nVETS has raised the money to provide grants to 300 veterans (and some spouses as well), and aims to do more, as they are currently working with the Stanford Brian Simulation Lab on a brain imaging study to investigate the potential physiological improvements from ibogaine.\n\nhttps://psychedelicstoday.com/",
