Hear the fascinating challenges individuals have had to persevere through.  Soak in the wisdom of talented men and women that have had the grit and focus to get to business glory.

Its stories and people!  I want people outside of Gainesville to hear this podcast and go \"Whoa! I want to go/move/build a business/etc. there!\"  2.  Keep some of our Top 6 University of Florida talent here by showing them that Gainesville is SO MUCH MORE than a place you go to college!  3.  Build as many connections within the community as possible!  I can't begin to tell you how many people tell me, \"I heard of that business for the first time on your podcast and now I'm collaborating/doing business/friends with them!\"  I'm inspired by the impact this podcast has already had and can't wait to see what the future holds!
