It was reportedly filmed months before the 30-year-old actress was granted a temporary domestic violence restraining order against Depp and filed for divorce. Heard denied releasing the tape in a statement to PEOPLE but otherwise both sides have declined to comment.\n\n\n========= Join Us ============\n\n** Channel Link : http://bit.ly/2aUXmso\n\n** Chimney Fire burns 850 acres near Nacimiento Lake: https://youtu.be/N7Xav9guuOI\n\n** Hundreds of Tiny Montserrat Tarantulas Hatch in Zoo: https://youtu.be/BtglHldFhVQ\n\n** Bill Clinton Talks Email Controversy: https://youtu.be/DHE1pCdQgNE\n\n** Donald Trump Recruits Election Observers to Avoid a 'Rigged' Election: https://youtu.be/hkbfqrS2aIg\n\n** Historic' Louisiana Floods: https://youtu.be/OiyVaDKDVJ0\n\n** 2 wildfires in California send residents fleeing from homes: https://youtu.be/tQ9jbs1JNE0\n\n** Virginia Plane Crash - 6 Victims Identified: https://youtu.be/6xAgbVb1mO0\n\n** Explosion of Steam Pipe at Chinese Power Station Kills 21: https://youtu.be/VImgTAFR2RY\n\n** Huge fire and explosion destroys Md. apartment complex: https://youtu.be/Dm6JbfpxD18\n\n** Pilot fire grows to more than 7,700 acres: https://youtu.be/m98zL5CkyCM\n\n** Blind Kid Throws D backs First Pitch in Game: https://youtu.be/auBKq18TuiQ\n\n** Kuznetsov Scores World Class Goal \u25cf Ice Hockey: https://youtu.be/vqZtuVe4YSM\n\n** Stipe Miocic knocks out Fabricio Werdum : https://youtu.be/1y0ZD3Y0NS0",
