For those who still do not know the full story, in July of 2020, the three-week libel trial began, Depp fought News Group Newspapers, the publisher of The Sun, in court over a 2018 article in which they called him a \"wife beater\" in reference to Depp and Heard's former marriage. Depp sued both the publisher and The Sun's executive editor Dan Wootton for libel.\n\nSoon after, news were released that Depp had assaulted Amber Heard on a dozen occasions and put her in \"fear for her life\" three times. The court refused permission for Depp to appeal. Speaking at the Royal Courts of Justice in London, Lord Justice Underhill said: \"We refuse Mr Depp's application to admit further evidence in support of his proposed appeal and we conclude that the appeal has no real prospect of success and that there is no other compelling reason for it to be heard.\"We accordingly refuse permission to appeal.\" However, Johnny Depp and his legal team were not only surprised, if not devastated, because they knew what is now known. And it is that after all the evidence that has come to light, that the world has begun to understand that the one who was really physically and psychologically abused in that relationship was Johnny.\n\n#JohnnyDepp #AmberHeard",
