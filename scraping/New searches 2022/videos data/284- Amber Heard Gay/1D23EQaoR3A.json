Its up to him and Mera to find out what happened. \n\nHey guys I would like to make it clear that this trailer is fan made.

That's why its not for everybody because just like Pro-Wrestling, some hate it some love it. If you are into fan made trailers which means you appreciate bringing new ideas to your favorite movies.

But my DC lover side made me appreciate this film more. I watched this film once and I thought it was decent. The fresh clips are not too hard to find since there are plenty of cosplay to chose from. To avoid making this dream trailer feel low budget I chose clips from the Aquaman movie it self. Such as the Atlantic City.\n\nThe music was great, despite the lack of humor the soundtrack by THE EQUALIZER 2 trailer #2 was great because it had lots of trailer fling to it. The main actor himself had lots of movies to chose from since this is the first time I made a project about him. Not the first Aquaman project though, I did one back in 2020 for one of the trailer style of the infinity saga.\n\nThe line \"is only a myth\" is great connection to how Aquaman is a mystical character. The film SEE had great lines talking about \"gods\" that perfectly fits this dream trailer. Speaking of perfectly fits, the clip with Aquaman attacks the bad guy we get a transition to a guy getting attacked in the water.\n\nVIDEO CREDITS | AQUAMAN | SEE (2019) | 3 DAYS TO KILL | THE HOLLOW | THE UNDOING | TOGO (2019) | CANDYMAN (2020) | CREATING AQUAMAN'S SUIT | IKON COLLECTIBLES 1:1 BY COSPLAY CHRIS | AQUAMAN COSPLAY BY MIKE KIRTS | AQUAMAN'S MERA COSTUME | DIY AQUAMAN COSPLAY TATTOOS BY THE WOODLAND ELF | MULHER MARAVHILHA VS AQUAMAN BY FRANKLIN FERNANDES\nMUSIC CREDITS | THE EQUALIZER 2 TRAILER #2 SOUNDTRACK\n---------------------------------------\n\u25baMusic Credit: YouTube Audio Library and thanks to Feature Presentation YouTube Channel for providing the trailer soundtracks. \n\n-------------------------------------\n\nIf you like this video feel free to hit that NOTIFICATION ICON to become part of the MacamTVFAM. \n\n\n\u25ba\u25baSubscribe to my Youtube Channel:\nyoutube.com/c/MacamTV\u200b\n\n\n\u25ba\u25baTwitter @Macamtvofficial\n\nWhy you should follow me on TWITTER?\n\nI will be posting what I'm currently working on.
