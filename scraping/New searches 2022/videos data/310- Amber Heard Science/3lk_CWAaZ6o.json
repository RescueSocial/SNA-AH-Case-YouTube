A fun, interactive session for primary ages kids to learn about the oceans and the people who work on it!\n\nThis week, I am giving our guest speakers a break and presenting myself again! 1330BST Friday 22nd May, aimed for primary but all welcome.\n\nThe first session I shared with you was about the deep sea, NOW, I am going to talk to you about one of my favourite parts of the deep sea I work on - hydrothermal vents.
