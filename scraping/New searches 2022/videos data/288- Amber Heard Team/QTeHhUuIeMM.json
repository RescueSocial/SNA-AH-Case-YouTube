            "description": "I came to the realization that Amber's skills are close to worthless, but her normal charged attacks are a very reliable attack to abuse the Melt reaction with. Using her like this with some compromises, she became a legitimately good damage dealer in my eyes. Although I don't think she's the best damage dealer in the game or anything like that, having a free-to-play option that deals damage as well as she can could be something valuable. In this video, I will give you guys some of my advice on how to build Amber to maximize your damage with the weapons you have, and how to make a team comp around her with various options to increase her damage and consistency. I hope this video helps you guys out or is at the very least interesting!
