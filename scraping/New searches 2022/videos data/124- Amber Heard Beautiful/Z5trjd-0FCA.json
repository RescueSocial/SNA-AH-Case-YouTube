            "description": "Synopsis\n\nBased on the best-selling book, SYRUP is an edgy comedy that exposes the cut-throat world of advertising through the eyes of a young prodigy chasing fame, fortune, and the woman of his dreams. Fresh out of school with a degree in marketing, Scat will do anything to prove that he has what it takes to swim with the rich and wildly successful. Scat comes up with a brilliant new product that gives new meaning to the old saying \"sex sells.\" He is sure it will send him right to the top...if only he can convince his boss, the beautiful and mysterious \"6,\" that it's an idea worth millions. Betrayed by his best friend \"Sneaky Pete,\" Scat stumbles through an industry riddled with deception. As he begins to realize that fame and fortune have cost him his morality, he must rediscover his true self behind the elaborate image he has created or risk losing the love of his life.\nCopyright \u00a9 2013 Magnolia Pictures",
