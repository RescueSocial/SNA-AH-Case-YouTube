As the words \u201cI made that bitch famous\u201d echoed throughout Madison Square Garden the crowd chanted Yeezy before proceeding  to shout \u201cyou made that bitch famous.\u201d Kanye kicked off his 4 minutes by introducing himself and said that he would be presenting his video, but first he was going to talk. \nKanye joked about being nominated against Beyonce saying QUOTE \u2013 \u201cLater in the night Famous might lose to Beyonce but I cant be mad because I\u2019m always wishing for Beyonce to win.\u201d And speaking of Famous, you know he had to defend the video heard around the world featuring naked wax figures of T-Swift, Kim K, Amber Rose, and Donald Trump just to name a few. Many people jumped on him for exploited women\u2019s bodies by depicting them naked, but Kanye defended his artistic vision by pointing out that he even put Ray J in the bed! In other words he even put his wife\u2019s sex tape co-star in his video. He then pointed to Amber Rose in the audience who is also featured in the video to give a nod to their past relationship. Amber was a good sport when Kanye put her on the spot by smiling back while Kanye joked saying QUOTE \u2013 \u201cMy wife is a G. Not many people\u2019s wives would let them say that.\u201d \nKanye also spoke about social issues such as gun violence and racism saying that if you see people dying constantly, you might start to see your life as worthless. He also talked about how people have told him not to compare himself to the greats and that three tactics used to keep people impoverished include taking away their self-esteem, resources, and taking away their role models. In Other words, he\u2019s not going to let anyone tell him that he\u2019s not great. He then gave special shout outs to 2 Chains, Jaden Smith,  called Diddy his idol, said Chance the Rapper is the future, and of course gave love to his wife, Kim Kardashian. \nFollowing his speech he then exclusively presented his video \u201cFade\u201d starring Teyanna Taylor. Her body will make you give up cake for life.
