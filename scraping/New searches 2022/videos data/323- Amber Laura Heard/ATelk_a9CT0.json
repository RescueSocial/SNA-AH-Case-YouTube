            "description": "Bring it Back - Eddie Said Remix\n\nFive-time Golden Guitar winner, Amber Lawrence, is bringing original music back with her brand new July 30 single release. The upbeat, powerful, and stirring \u2018Bring it Back\u2019 is a timely ode to the music industry, to both the artists and the fans. It laments the loss of our old ways, with Amber musically pleading for life to soon go back to the way it was. Produced by Stuart Stuart (Sheppard, The Veronicas, Lee Kernaghan, Taylor Moss), and co-written with APRA nominee Melanie Dyer, Amber\u2019s new single is an evolved sound we haven't yet heard across Amber's past releases. With soaring vocals and a hugely catchy melody, it is set to be a new fan favourite, and will be supported by Amber\u2019s \u2018Bring it Back\u2019 tour commencing late 2021, and early 2022. \u2018Bring it Back\u2019 is the first taste from Amber\u2019s 7th studio album - set for a 2022 release date.\n\nTo purchase or stream Bring it Back - Eddie Said Remix - \nhttps://snd.click/BringItBackRemix\nTo Subscribe to Amber's Youtube Channel -https://www.youtube.com/c/AmberLawren...\n\nLYRICS\nBRING IT BACK - Amber Lawrence/ Melanie Dyer\n\nI can hear it, calling in the air tonight \nFeel the rhythm, hits me then it takes me high \nAs the sun sets, feel the rumble of the crowd \nOh how we miss this, just the chance to sing out loud \nOh sing out loud\nCHORUS\nWe\u2019ve been waiting for so long, for the band to play our song \nCome on bring it back \nWe\u2019ve been told to just hang on when everything we love is gone \nCome on bring it back \nBring it back, bring it back\n\nThere\u2019s a soundtrack for all the moments in our lives \nIt\u2019s only music, but we need it to survive\nI wanna feel alive \n\nSo sing it loud, sing along and take it back  to what it was. \nTo those days, when we raised up a cup to the stage, \u2018cause\n\nWe\u2019ve been waiting for so long for the band to play our song \nCome on bring it back \nWe\u2019ve been told to just hang on when everything we love is gone \nCmon bring it back \n\nCan you hear it, calling in the air tonight\n\nAmber's Socials\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/amberlawrenc...\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/amberlawren...\nTikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@amberlawrence...\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/amberlawrence\n\n#amberlawrence, #bringitback, #australiancountrymusic",
