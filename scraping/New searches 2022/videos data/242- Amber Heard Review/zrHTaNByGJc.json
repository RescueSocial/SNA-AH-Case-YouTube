With designer Philippe Starck, and using contemporary art and a party vibe, he invented this cool and aspirational boutique hotel.The 194 all-white bedrooms are so plain they could pass for a posh hospital, but they\u2019re designed to drive people into public spaces for entertainment such as the Argentinian-tinged restaurant Leynia, or the small but chic Doheny Room, which aims for an indie 1980s club feel.Is the Delano pretentious? Yes, a little. Most hotels in Miami have a swimming pool, but the Delano has decreed that it has a water salon because most of the pool is designed to be shallow enough for guests to wade in at chest height while sipping cocktails, but it is a great deal of fun.Location report: At the corner of Collins and 17th Street, this is where South Beach\u2019s hotels become bigger and \u2013 crucially \u2013 have gates that lead straight on to the beach.The Delano is surrounded by a clutch of luxury hotels, including SLS and The Raleigh.A tall hedge separates it from the street and keeps gawkers away. Key attraction: When Ian Schrager took over the Delano, he wanted to make hotels as exciting as nightclubs.It still takes fun very seriously.

The pool bungalows \u2013 adored by A-listers such as Leonardo DiCaprio \u2013 are the most popular.Inside, the lobby continues the spectacle with a clear grand piano which is played, when the mood takes her, by Queen Latifah.In the news: The Delano is no longer quite as cutting-edge, but it still has a vibe that other hotels envy.The weekend pool parties have become a South Beach institution; giant inflatables and a DJ playing by the bar so that guests don\u2019t have to leave their sunlounger.It still attracts celebrity guests \u2013 last year Johnny Depp\u2019s ex Amber Heard checked in.Good enough for the rest of us?If you\u2019re not staying there, the all-you-can-eat brunch is a South Beach bargain at $70 (about \u00a353) a head, with unlimited mimosas or Bloody Marys for just $15 (\u00a311) more.",
