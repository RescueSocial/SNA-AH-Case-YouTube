            "description": "Do amber teething necklaces perform up to their hype? My son has been using an amber teething necklace since he was about a month old and I can't talk more positively about it. I LOVE THIS NECKLACE!! I never would have thought that this necklace would actually work but it does.\n\nHow it works? The necklace is made of pure amber which when heated up by the skin releases a natural inflammatory and pain reliever. This is why it is used so much with babies who are teething. I found that the necklace helped Nolan with his slobber more than anything. He would slobber through an entire outfit so quickly before he wore this necklace. It did help him with pain I believe. There is really no way of knowing since he can't talk to us however the lack of slobber was AMAZING!! \n\nI call this necklace a miracle worker because within 24 hours he was a totally different baby. Try this necklace out for yourself and see if it helps your baby. Every baby is different and every necklace is different. Find the right size and color for your baby and you will fall in love with the teething necklace just like I have!!\n\nThe necklace that we use:\n\n https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00M5CYB0Q/ref=sxts_bia_sr_1_a_it?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_p=3182441022&pd_rd_wg=a1WpD&pf_rd_r=A6DBNT72K40F675ED7V3&pf_rd_s=desktop-sx-top-slot&pf_rd_t=301&pd_rd_i=B00M5CYB0Q&pd_rd_w=7ll44&pf_rd_i=amber+teething+necklace&pd_rd_r=QJ65AG6R12S2KBJT6MD1&ie=UTF8&qid=1506556158&sr=1\n\n\u2193\u2193\u2193Check these out\u2193\u2193\u2193\n\nReviews:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7GC-UdCaXRW45i0qHloO2OK7TXR3ZUlp\n\nNolan's News: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7GC-UdCaXRWhKtr2ritJKlOZpe2rMMy-\n\nPregnancy Updates:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7GC-UdCaXRUmE4y_B5GkZkaY3gdeoPwz\n\n\nONLY business ideas contact me via email at: daysofmay19@gmail.com\n\nMake sure to follow me on Social Media!!\n\n\u2193\u2193\u2193Follow me\u2193\u2193\u2193\n\nInstagram:\n@daysofmay19\n\nPinterest:\nhttps://www.pinterest.com/daysofm/\n\nTwitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/daysofmay19\n\nxoxo Megan (SAHM)\n\nSeptember 2017",
