            "description": "\u201cAquaman\u201d is a 2018 superhero movie about a man of royal blood that was born outside of the borders of his parent's native country. That country is very secluded and has exotic, advanced technology beyond anything in the rest of the modern world is aware of. There are factions within the country that believe a conflict with the outside world is not only inevitable, but their country should rule the because of its biological and technological superiority. The man of royal blood decides to journey to the reclusive nations and challenge for the throne of the kingdom in order to lead its people into a new geopolitical future. \n\nIf that read like the premise of \u201cBlack Panther\u201d, then you'd be correct. The newest DCEU movie is very similar to multiple super hero and science fantasy films of recent times, and I make references to those similarities throughout this YouTube video. I also offered a grade of B+ (with reluctant bias), which is explained within the presentation. Strap yourselves in. Batten down the hatches. There are some rough waters ahead.\n\nThe movie was directed by James Wan.
