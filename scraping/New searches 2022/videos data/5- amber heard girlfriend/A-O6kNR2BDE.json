Amber Heard and her new girlfriend Bianca Butti have been putting on quite the shows of affection in public over the last week.And Saturday was no different when the new couple were seen holding hands and flashing big beaming smiles when they arrived at the 4th Annual Women's March in Downtown Los Angeles.The Aquaman star not only lent her support she also was one of the many celebrities and speakers to address the enthusiastic crowd that first gathered at Pershing Square.  The new couple were spotted moments after getting out of their car and heading to the heart of the gathering.Heard, 33, kept it casual in tight blue jeans and a fitted black shirt and just one black heeled shoe, which was one short because of the ankle boot on her injured left leg.\u00a0 She also wore her blonde tresses long and wavy, well past her shoulders, and a part in the middle.\u00a0  Butti, who's a cinematographer, went in an all-black ensemble, consisting of black skinny jeans and a black button down jacket over a matching t-shirt.\u00a0Earlier this week, the pair were first spotted together, sharing a passionate kiss or two outside a hotel in the Southern California resort city of Palm Springs.Turns out Butti has been getting treatments for a second breast cancer diagnosis since 2015.Once on stage, Heard delivered a passionate speech that was based, in part, on her experiences as an\u00a0American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) ambassador for woman's rights with a focus on gender-based violence since December 2018.She has also worked as a\u00a0Human Right Champion for the Stand Up For Human Rights campaign by the Office Of The United Nations High Commissioner For Human Rights.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Not wanting to sit on the sidelines, actress and social media influencer Bella Thorne, 22, also took to the podium as one of the celebrity speakers.She wore an eye-catching blue suit that consisted of pants that slightly flared at the bottoms and a double-breasted blazer.The Midnight Sun star rounded out her fashionable ensemble with tan pointed boots and her long tresses dyed dark with a part in the middle.  Caitlyn Jenner, 70, looked classy in a navy skirt that was paired with a white top and a matching cropped cover-up.The Keeping Up With The Kardashians star has been a proponent for humanitarian issues that includes being a visible transgender activist.Hustlers star Constance Wu, 37, went with black pants with a black jacket and pink turtleneck in the fashion department.She also opted to keep a low profile by wearing a black baseball cap over her long tresses and donning dark sunglasses.   Academy Award-winner Mira Sorvino, 52, made the event a family affair of sorts by attending with daughter Mattea, 15.\u00a0The Mighty Aphrodite star bun",
