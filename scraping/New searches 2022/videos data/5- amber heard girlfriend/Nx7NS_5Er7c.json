Amber Heard and\u00a0Bianca Butti\u00a0stepped out\u00a0in Los Angeles again on Friday and looked cozy at a star-studded pre-2020 Oscars party.  The Aquaman actress and ex-wife of\u00a0Johnny Depp was photographed holding hands with her new girlfriend, a cinematographer, outside\u00a0Vanity Fair and Saint Laurent's bash celebrating the nominated film\u00a0Parasite. They were also\u00a0pictured laughing together inside.  Heard, 33, and Butti held hands throughout the evening, even while chatting with other guests, E! News has learned. The actress introduced her to\u00a0a friend, saying, \"This is Bianca, my new girlfriend.\"  The two had sparked romance rumors last month when they were photographed kissing in Palm Springs. Days later, they\u00a0stepped out together\u00a0again, hand-in-hand,\u00a0at the 2020 Women's Day March in Los Angeles.  They have not commented on the nature of their relationship nor shared photos of one another on Instagram, where Butti has been documenting her battle with breast cancer. Heard does, however, follow her on the social network.  Also spotted at the pre-Oscars party:\u00a0Miley Cyrus\u00a0and ex Liam Hemsworth,\u00a0Leonardo DiCaprio,\u00a0Rami Malek,\u00a0Joaquin Phoenix and fianc\u00e9e\u00a0Rooney Mara and\u00a0Adam Sandler.",
