Amber bundled up in a wrinkled tan coat that reached down to her knees.The 5ft7in actress also had on a brilliant white blouse, a black skirt and a knee-high pair of black leather boots. She carried along a striped black leather Yves Saint Laurent bag and let her wavy blonde tresses rest messily over her shoulders.\u00a0Bianca rocked a more androgynous look with a gray Cordovan hat, a black leather bomber jacket and dark jeans.  The loved-up couple beamed as she strolled through the airport, and Amber seemed to crack up at something her girlfriend said.The couple were first linked in January after they were spotted kissing in January in Palm Springs, California.Bianca, an LA-based cinematographer, has a diverse set of credits ranging from lensing multiple episodes of Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta to shooting the upcoming indie revenge thriller Leave Not One Alive, starring Bella Thorne and Oscar winner Melissa Leo.She's been open about her struggles with cancer on social media. She was previously diagnosed at age 34 in 2015, then went into remission at after an aggressive regimen of surgery, chemotherapy and radiation.She confirmed that the disease had returned in March last year, and she's currently eschewing Western medical treatments in favor of alternative medicine and experimental treatments.The filmmaker started an online fundraiser to cover $60,000 worth of treatments that aren't covered by her insurance.\u00a0  Earlier on Saturday, Amber shared some behind-the-scenes photos from a shoot for Wonderland Magazine.She flashed an infections smile and in one shot while covering her chest, which was draped with sheer white ruffles.'All the ruffles and frills,' she wrote.Another photo showed her in the studio wearing a black suit-style dress with puffy sleeves and a white ruff around her neck, which she captioned 'Frills...'She sat on the floor in a third shot, though she changed into a lacy white collar.\u00a0   Amber has been leaning on her new girlfriend for support amid her\u00a0ongoing legal brawl with ex Johnny Depp.\u00a0Johnny, who she was married to from 2015\u20132017, is suing her for defamation based on a 2018 Washington Post essay in which she implied he had abused her, though she didn't use his name.\u00a0\u00a0The Pirates Of The Caribbean star has turned the tables by arguing that Amber was the true abuser, though text messages and recordings suggest that both may have been engaged in a mutual campaign of physical and emotional abuse.In November 2013, Depp allegedly sent text messages to his friend Paul Bettany that seemed to admit to abusing alcohol and drugs and behaving abusively toward Heard.'I\u2019m gonna properly stop the booze thing, darling \u2026 Drank all night before I picked Amber u",
