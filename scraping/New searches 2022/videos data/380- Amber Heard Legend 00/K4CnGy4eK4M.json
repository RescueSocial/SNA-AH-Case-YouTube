            "description": "Starring Amber Heard, Eddie Cibrian, Leah Renee, Jenna Dewan, Laura Benanti, David Krumholtz, Naturi Naughton and Wes Ramsey, the period drama is officially described as follows.\r\nIt's the early '60s, and the legendary Playboy Club in Chicago is the door to all your fantasies... and the key is the most sought-after status symbol of its time.\r\n\r\nStep inside the seductive world of the Bunny, the epitome of beauty and service, and rub shoulders with the decade's biggest mobsters, politicos and entertainers (like Tina Turner and Sammy Davis, Jr.) With all these larger than life ambitions, there are even greater secrets. Like when innocent new Bunny Maureen - who wants to take the world by storm - accidentally kills one of the Windy City's most powerful mafia bosses... and the only person capable of covering it up and protecting her is Nick Dalton, a man who once worked for the mob but is about to run for district attorney. Bunny Alice is married but hiding an explosive personal life while Bunny Janie is running from a past that threatens to catch up with her. It seems everyone has a secret - none more so than Maureen, who may not even be the innocent orphan she appears to be. Thank goodness Hef's Playboy Mansion is open after hours for a little R&R... and burying your past.\r\n\r\nFrom Academy Award-winning Executive Producer Brian Grazer, Executive Producer Chad Hodge (Tru Calling), and Director Alan Taylor (Mad Men) comes a provocative new series about a time and place that challenged the social mores, where a visionary created an empire, and an icon changed American culture.\r\n\r\nFor More Visit :\r\nMediaDB - Home of Movie Trailers and Poster images\r\nhttp://mediadb.blogspot.com/\r\n\r\nFor More Latest Trailer\r\n\r\nhttp://mediadb.blogspot.com/p/movie-trailers.html",
