            "description": "Watch as New Yorkers react with their opinion on Amber Rose's recent SlutWalk in L.A.\n\nOver the weekend, Amber Rose hosted her first SlutWalk out in Los Angeles, where she marched along with hundreds of other women in protest of slut-shaming and the double standards that plague our society. It seemed to be a successful turn-out, and Amber made headlines when she issued (an emotional) speech forgiving two of her previous lovers, Kanye West and Wiz Khalifa, for slut-shaming comments they made about her in the past.\n\nAlthough the event took place in LA, we decided to ask New Yorkers how they feel about Amber Rose's movement for our latest episode of Word on the Street. From their take on the SlutWalk to whether or not Wiz and Amber should get back together, see what the responses are up top. \n\nFollow & Subscribe to HotNewHipHop to stay updated on exclusive behind the scenes, interviews, music videos & more from your favorite artists:\nhttp://hotnewhiphop.com\nhttp://hnhh.co/yosub (Subscribe)\nhttps://fb.com/realhotnewhiphop (Like)\nhttps://twitter.com/hotnewhiphop (Follow)\nhttps://instagram.com/hotnewhiphop (Photos)",
