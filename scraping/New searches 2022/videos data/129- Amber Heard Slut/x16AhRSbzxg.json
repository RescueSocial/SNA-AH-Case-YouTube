            "description": "LONDON (Reuters) - Hollywood star Johnny Depp kicked and slapped his ex-wife Amber Heard on a private flight in a drunken rage brought on because he believed she was having an affair with her co-star James Franco, London\u2019s High Court heard on Wednesday. \u00a0Depp, giving evidence in his libel trial against Britain\u2019s Sun newspaper over an article describing him as a \u201cwife beater\u201d, denied he had attacked Heard, accusing her of being the aggressor whom he tried to placate. \u00a0During the first two days of what is expected to be a three-week case, the court has heard evidence about Depp\u2019s heavy drinking and drug use and about his relationship with Heard whom he married in 2015. She filed for divorce 15 months later. \u00a0On Wednesday, the \u201cPirates of the Caribbean\u201d actor was accused of abusing Heard on a flight from Boston to Los Angeles following a row over Franco, who appeared with her in the film \u201cThe Adderall Diaries\u201d. \u00a0Depp told the court that he was surprised she agreed to make the film with Franco, having previously described him as \u201ccreepy\u201d for making aggressive ual advances towards her. \u00a0On the flight, Depp screamed obscenities at Heard, said she liked having  on film sets and called her a \u201cgo-getter slut and a whore\u201d, said Sasha Wass, lawyer for the Sun. \u00a0In a \u201cblind rage\u201d, he kicked her in the back as she tried to walk away from him and slapped her across the face, Wass said. \u00a0Depp denied the accusations. \u00a0\u201cI am not a violent person, especially with women,\u201d he told the court. \u00a0He later added that he might have passed out on the flight. \u00a0Wass said that on the day after the flight, Depp sent Heard a text message which said: \u201cI don\u2019t know why or what happened but I will never do it again.\u201d \u00a0Asked why he had apologised, Depp said he had perhaps done so because he had said something \u201cugly\u201d or to placate her. Actor Johnny Depp leaves the High Court in London, Britain, July 8, 2020. REUTERS/Peter Nicholls\u00a0Asked if someone who kicked a woman should be called a wife beater, Depp, 57, said he would call them a savage or an animal. \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s one of the most disgusting things someone has ever said about me or accused me of.\u201d TATTOO TANTRUM \u00a0Earlier Depp said Heard\u2019s allegations were a hoax built up over years during their relationship as an \u201cinsurance policy\u201d. \u00a0In an unsent email composed by Heard in June 2013, three years before she publicly accused him of abuse, she said Depp had hurt her physically and that she did not know if she was dealing with him or \u201cthe monster\u201d - his alter ego brought on by anger, jealousy and fuelled by alcohol and drugs. \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s like Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde,\u201d the email, read to the court by Wass, said. It added that friends and assistants had to deal with the actor after he passed out in his own vomit and soiled himself with no recollection later of his actions. \u00a0Asked if the email meant Heard had been plotting the allegations for three years, Depp said: \u201cBy the evidence that I have seen. \u00a0\u201cIt appears to me that Miss Heard was build",
