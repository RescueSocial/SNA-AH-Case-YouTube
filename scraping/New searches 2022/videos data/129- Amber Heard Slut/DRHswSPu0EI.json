I decided to name my channel Just_Anne because it's just me being me. I don't edit my videos.  I want you to feel that you are sitting with me drinking a cup of coffee ( or whatever you like to drink) and sharing our love for makeup together. I am in my 40's and I believe full heartedly that we can inspire people at any age. I LOVE makeup and want to share my passion with you. My channel is based on subscription unboxings, hauls, reviews, GRWM's, occasional car vlogs and anything to do with beauty.
