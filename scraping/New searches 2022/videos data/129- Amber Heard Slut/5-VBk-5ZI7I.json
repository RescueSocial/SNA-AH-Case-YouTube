            "description": "Amber Rose and 21 Savage were a fan-favorite couple back when they were together. She had been a popular hip hop model and he was a fast-rising rapper from Atlanta. The pair shared the kind of vibe that seemed like it could last forever. But as we know, that\u2019s not how things panned out. Here\u2019s why it didn\u2019t work out, according to Amber Rose herself.\n\nAmber Rose and 21 Savage went public with their relationship in July 2017 after weeks of speculation. The announcement was met with pushback from fans who naturally questioned their relationship. But over time, lots of people grew to like them as a couple.\n\n21 Savage started opening up more and letting his softer side show while Amber Rose inherited a certain swagger and street credibility. They let their love shine at events such as the 2017 MTV Video Music Awards and Amber Rose\u2019s third SlutWalk in Los Angeles, where 21 Savage famously showed his support with a sign reading, \u201cI\u2019m a h*e too.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty amazing waking up every morning feeling love like this,\u201d Amber Rose captioned a now-deleted Instagram post of them (via People). \u201cI\u2019m so thankful that God brought this amazing person in my life who genuinely has my back and is ready to \u2018pull up\u2019 to defend my honor by any means.\u201d\n\n\neir relationship continued for about a year before reports emerged in March 2018 that Amber Rose and 21 Savage had called it quits. At the time, Amber Rose implied in an interview on Big Boy\u2019s Neighborhood that the \u201cBank Account\u201d rapper had been the one to break things off, adding: \u201cI really love him. I miss him. I think about him every day.\u201d\n\n\nAmber Rose has since ceased all communication with 21 Savage\nAfter their split, Amber Rose began dating music executive Alexander \u201cAE\u201d Edwards. They began dating in late 2018 and have since welcomed their first child, son Slash Electric, who was born in October 2019.\n\nWhen asked if she still speaks to her ex-boyfriend, Amber Rose replied, \u201cI\u2019m not friends with anyone. I don\u2019t believe in that.\u201d But she also implied there are no hard feelings towards 21 Savage, who said in an October interview on Big Facts that he\u2019s also \u201chappily in love\u201d with someone else.\n\n\n\n\nAmber Rose reveals exactly why she and 21 Savage broke up\nAmber Rose said in an October appearance on Adam22\u2019s No Jumper podcast that things started to go downhill after the SlutWalk in October 2017. According to her, he had received a lot of backlash for his appearance and ultimately became affected by it.\n\n\u201cActually that\u2019s what he wanted to do and I think that was ultimately the demise of our relationship. I think that he was being very supportive and he was like, \u2018Man I should hold a sign that says, \u2018I\u2019m a h*e too!'\u201d she explained.\n\n\u201cI was like, \u2018That would be really great for feminism! SlutWalk, you know you\u2019re a rapper and Black men are always looked at to be very hyper-masculine and I think this would be a great moment.\u2019 He was like, \u2018Yo, I\u2019m down!\u2019 I got the sign made and everything and he held it up and then after that, I think the internet just went in on him too much and it just wasn\u2019t good after that.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/amber-rose-reveals-why-she-and-21-savage-broke-up.html/",
