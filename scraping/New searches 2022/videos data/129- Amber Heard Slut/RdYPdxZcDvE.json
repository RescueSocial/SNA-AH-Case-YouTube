            "description": "And Amber Rose was surrounded by pals as she stepped out for a brisk walk at Miami Beach on Friday. The 34-year-old looked fit and fresh as she stormed along in black swats and a fitted grey top that highlighted her jaw-dropping assets. She finished the look in black high-tops and a black baseball cap, with a matching jacket tied around her waist. Her burly bodyguard followed closely behind, towering above her, despite the model being no pixie at 5'9\". He proudly rocked a shirt reading 'Rosebud' \u2014 the term Amber uses to describe her followers. The day before the slut-walker had a much more high-octane trip as she jet-skied with boyfriend\u00a021 Savage. Amber was spotted clinging on to her man, 24 - real name Shayaa Bin Abraham-Joseph - as he powered through the Florida waters. Amber and Savage went public with their romance in July, with the rapper confirming the news in an interview with\u00a0Real 92.3, saying: 'That\u2019s my girl, for sure. She\u2019s a real cool woman, she treats me like a king, so it is what it is. 'He also admitted the mother-of-one has been\u00a0a positive influence on his life. He added: 'She make me do s**t that I don\u2019t normally do, like take vitamins and drink water. 'We sit at the pool, we talk, we watch documentaries, we go out, we eat. I give her massages, chocolate, flowers, new purses, diamonds. 'Amber was previously married to rapper Wiz Kalifa, 30, real name Cameron Thomaz, from July 2013 to September 2014. They share a four-year-old son, Sebastian.",
