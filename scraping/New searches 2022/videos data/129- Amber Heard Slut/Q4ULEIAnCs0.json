            "description": "In this video I do a Tarot Reading (psychic reading) on Amber Rose. Amber Rose (real name Amber Levonchuck) is a model, actress, and a fashion designer. She is best known for her relationships with rappers Kanye West and Wiz Khalifa, among alleged others. She is also known for her SlutWalk movement meant to empower women and her short film \"Walk of No Shame\" with Funny or Die. She has a book titled \"How to Be A Bad Bitch\", an emoji app called 'MuvaMoji', and it was announced in May of 2016 that she will have her own talk show, The Amber Rose Show, on VH1. What will the cards reveal about Amber?\n\nYou can purchase your own personal reading from me by simply visiting the 'Store' section on my Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/lamarrtownsendtarot\n\nEvery Friday I do a new Tarot Reading on a celebrity, so be sure to like and subscribe and check back next week to see who I read next!\n\nIn this video I use the 3-card spread which, from left to right, each card represents the Past position, the Present position, and the Future position. Keep in mind that at this time I am only a beginner Tarot Card reader. I am using the Archangel Power Tarot Card deck by Doreen Virtue & Radleigh Valentine.\n\nThank you for watching and listening!
