As it is known, Amber stars as Effie White, the lead singer of a fame-hungry trio from Chicago who finds herself edged out by their smooth-talking manager Curtis (and the guy she loves) just as the group, the Dreamettes, are hitting the big-time. Amber has received unanimous praise from both audience and critics alike.",
