            "description": "With the worst box office opening in a decade, Amber Heards crime mystery  London Fields had audiences staying home. The film, based on a 1989 novel written by Martin Amis, premiered this past Friday after several delays due to a heated legal dispute within the production team. Production on  London Fields  began in London in 2013 after the project had been shuffled between several directors for a decade. With Billy Bob Thornton ( Fargo ), Amber Heard ( Justice League ), and Cara Delevingne ( Suicide Squad ) attached, the projectappeared to be finally taking shape. The story focuses on Heards character,a femme fatale named Nicola Six, who preconceives her own death - a murderat the hands ofone of her three lovers. Related: 15 Movies Coming Out This Year (And 15 Coming Out In 2019) Unfortunately,  London Fields  continued its downward trajectory at the box office. THR is reporting thatthecrime mystery had the second worst opening for a wide release since 1980, following closely behind the 2008 biographical drama,  Proud American . According to initial estimates, the film raked in a meager $160K from 613 theaters. Its weekend earnings wont be finalized until Monday; however, with its 0% rating on Rotten Tomatoes its unlikely London Fields will recover. This post-release disaster is not the first of the films setbacks, as botha legal battle and a restraining ordermarred London Fields  journey to the box office. Heard married  Johnny Depp -whos featured in a cameo in  London Fields  -atthestart of shooting, but eventually filed a temporary restraining order against him due to abusive behavior in May 2016. That previous September, London Fields was headed for the 2015  Toronto Film Festival  until director, Matthew Cullen, and a producer became embroiled in a legal dispute. This was followed by another legal battlewhena producer sued Heard andshe countersued on behalf of several issues including violations to her nudity agreement. Every film faces an often long and winding road to the box office; unfortunately, London Fields  has faced a few more challenges than the average release and has not escaped unscathed. Perhaps the writing of Martin Amis was notsuitedfor a film adaptation or perhaps those who adapted it failed to grasp themeaning behind the source materialsapparent convolution. Either way, this adaptation has made box office history, just not the kind of history one hopes to make.Suffice it to say, though, things shouldgo much,  much  better for Heards next film,  Aquaman .
