It was not what I wanted and I am doing what I can to force the media to take it off the internet,\" she said in a statement to E! News. \"I underestimated the toll that this difficult few months have taken on me, emotionally and physically, and the efforts made by the media to intimidate and discredit me.\"\n\nShe continued, \"It is for that reason, and my desire to make the healthiest choice for myself, and hopefully for Johnny, that I am attempting to resolve this matter in the most private way possible.\"\n\nAfter a brief trip to London last week, Amber returned to Los Angeles Friday night. She was later photographed entering an office building Saturday morning, which is believed to be where she will be deposed by Johnny's legal team.\n-johnny depp video,\nvideo of johnny depp and amber heard,\njohnny depp and amber heard video,\nsofia richie,\njohnny depp et amber heard video,\namber heard video,\nworldstar,\nyesjulz,\nwshh,\njohnny depp amber heard tmz,\namber heard cheating,\ntmz johnny depp and amber heard,\nblack manta,\namber heard tmz,\ntmz,\namber heard deposition,",
