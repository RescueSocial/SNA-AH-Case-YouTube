It's just not right.\n\nShe had a fantastic time, never stopped laughing with all of us together.\"\n\nMrs Peat said \"nothing else happened\" that would lead to Amber leaving, apart from a disagreement over chores.\n'No confirmed sightings'\n\nShe added: \"I was upstairs and I heard a door bang.\n\n\"I went downstairs and she wasn't around, so I looked outside and she was nowhere.\"\n\nThey confirmed Amber had left without her mobile phone or any money.\n\nSupt McFarlane said: \"We've been involved in searching the area, and friends and family have also assisted with that.\n\n\"We've been speaking to all of her friends, all the inquiries through the school, through family, through anybody who may possibly know or have heard from her over the last three days.\n\n\"Unfortunately, we're here today because we have not had any confirmed sightings of her.\"",
