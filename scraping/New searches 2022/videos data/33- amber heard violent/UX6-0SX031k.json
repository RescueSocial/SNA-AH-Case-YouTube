            "description": "Do you know the truth about Amber Heard & Johnny Depp and the accusations of physical & psychological abuse? \nThe saga of the domestic violence accusations against Johnny Depp by wife Amber Heard reveals just how bias we all are and how our bias affects the way we interpret reality and even deny the facts before our very eyes. In psychology, this is referred to as bias confirmation which simply infers ignoring some of the facts and looking for confirmation of our preconceived ideas.\n\nActress Amber Heard was married to Johnny Depp for 15 months before filing for divorce. She then filed, and was granted by a judge, a temporary restraining order against Depp alleging repeated physical and verbal abuse.\n\nHeard claims that Depp has been physically and psychologically abusive to her for years, and she claims that he hit her with a cell phone and had not reported prior abuse to protect him and his career.\n\nAmber Heard is 23 years younger than Johnny Depp.\n\nAmber Heard is viewed as a gold digger, someone who is making up these stories as a way to get a better divorce settlement including monthly payments of around $50,000.00\n\nDepp is viewed as a loveable, affable, charming all-round good guy who entertains us and makes us laugh with his on-screen characters such as the endearing, Captain Jack Sparrow. We have known, loved and admired Depp for decades. We also conduct parasocial relationships with celebrities such as Depp \u2013 we falsely believe we actually know him, who he is and how he thinks and behaves. We also feel a sense of ownership and identify with the celebrity, particularly if he/she is our idol and we associate good memories & emotions with them. Remember, many people did the same thing with Bill Cosby believing that every woman who accused him was just a lying gold digger until so many women came out with accusations and stories that it was impossible to discount every single claim as a lie and now Cosby stands trial for sexual assault criminal charges.\nhttp://www.patrickwanis.com/johnny-depp-violence-bias-confirmation/",
