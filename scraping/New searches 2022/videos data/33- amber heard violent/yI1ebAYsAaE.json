            "description": "Johnny Depp denied in court that he ever assaulted ex-wife Amber Heard when she reportedly mocked his famous \u2018wino forever\u2019 tattoo. He claimed he doesn\u2019t even remember her making fun of it. \u00a0 \u00a0Johnny Depp vehemently denied during the second day of his trial in London that he \u201cslapped\u201d ex-wife Amber Heard, 34, when she was allegedly mocking his tattoo. A lawyer for The Sun, the British paper Depp is suing for libel, told the court that the Pirates of the Caribbean star, 57, allegedly assaulted his then-girlfriend in 2013 after she joked about him having \u201cwino forever\u201d ink while falling off the wagon. \u00a0Sasha Wass, The Sun\u2018s lawyer, claimed that \u201cMs. Heard laughed at that tattoo. You were in fact acting like a wino and an alcoholic and felt very sensitive.\u201d Depp said he did not recall Heard joking about his tattoo, and did not slap her. Depp admitted that he had a problem with alcohol and drugs. \u201cI was dispirited, after 160 days or so I had broken my sobriety,\u201d the actor told the court. \u00a0   \u00a0Wass pressed forward, saying to the Edward Scissorhands star, according to The Guardian, \u201cYou then slapped Ms. Heard across the face and that was the first time it happened.\u201d Depp allegedly slapped heard a total of three times, Wass argued, because the actress had stared at him with no reaction. Depp responded with, \u201cIt\u2019s not true. It didn\u2019t happen\u2026 I didn\u2019t hit her.\u201d \u00a0Depp famously had a tattoo altered on his right shoulder when he and fianc\u00e9e, fellow Tim Burton darling Winona Ryder, split in 1993. What used to be \u201cwinona forever\u201d is now \u201cwino forever.\u201d The actor also had a tattoo for Heard. After his wife of two years accused him of domestic violence, he got it redone. What used to be \u201cSlim\u201d across his fingers now reads \u201cScum.\u201d \u00a0Ryder will appear virtually during the three-week trial, along with Depp\u2019s ex-partner Vanessa Paradis. Both women have denied that Depp was ever violent during their relationships. Ryder wrote in a previous statement that \u201cI obviously was not there during his marriage to Amber\u2026 The idea that he is an incredibly violent person is the farthest thing from the Johnny I knew and loved. I cannot wrap my head around these accusations.\u201d  \u00a0This wasn\u2019t the only shocking claim to come out of the first two days of the trial. Depp claimed that Heard, or \u201cpossibly one of her friends,\u201d defecated in their bed during an unspecified night. The alleged incident was the final straw that led to him wanting a divorce. Heard is expected to speak to the court at a later date in the coming weeks. \u00a0Depp is suing The Sun\u2018s parent company News Group Newspapers (NGN) and the paper\u2019s executive editor Dan Wootton over an April 2018 article. Wootton called Depp a \u201cwife beater\u201d and claimed that there was \u201coverwhelming evidence\u201d that he abused Heard during their relationship. He also asked how JK Rowling could be \u201cgenuinely happy\u201d with Depp being cast in the Harry Potter spinoff film Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald, considering the allegations.",
