Amber\u2019s accusations came at the height of the #MeToo movement, and the actress was hailed as a \u201chero\u201d for speaking up about the alleged violence she endured during her relationship with Johnny. But it\u2019s 2021, and the narrative has completely changed. The fans are now convinced Amber was the violent one in the relationships and that she tried to frame Johnny by co-opting the #MeToo movement. So why do fans think Johnny is the real #MeToo victim? \n\n#amberheard #johnnydepp",
