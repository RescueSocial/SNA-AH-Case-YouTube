            "description": "Amber Heard, 34, told London's High Court that she was \"smothered\", \"slapped\" and \"suffocated\" on the \"most violent night\" of her relationship with Johnny Depp, 57.  \u00a0The actress was today questioned about a heated argument with Johnny on the night of November 26, 2015 at their Los Angeles home. \u00a0She said it was \"one of the worst and most violent nights of our relationship\". \u00a0Amber claimed that Johnny was on drugs at the time, saying: \"We were in our place in LA. Johnny was using a lot of drugs at the time, especially cocaine and weed, which he was pretty much constantly smoking.   \u00a0\"We got into a fight on Thanksgiving, where Johnny ripped my shirt and threw me across the room. He threw a wine glass and a heavy glass decanter at me, which thankfully both missed me.\" \u00a0She made allegations that the Fantastic Beasts star slapped her, grabbed her by the hair and dragged her between the rooms in their apartment. \u00a0Amber continued to claim that Johnny head-butted her, grabbed her by the throat, pushed her face down into a mattress, smothered her, pulled out some of her hair and put his knee on her back with such a force that the bed broke.   \u00a0The court was shown a clip in which Amber's father ran around whipping people with a scarf while one party-goer, believed to be Marilyn Manson, joked: \"He's a monster, he's a savage.\" \u00a0Amber said the alleged attack happened after everyone had gone to bed. \u00a0She claimed: \"Our fights never happened in front of the whole family. They happened behind closed doors after everyone had gone home or gone to bed.\"  \u00a0Johnny denied any violence towards Amber during the argument. \u00a0In another incident on December 15, 2015, Johnny admitted to head-butting Amber but said it was an accident, and was not violent during the argument. \u00a0Amber claimed she was left with oozing scalp wounds after she was \"head-butted\" during the incident. \u00a0She also claimed that Johnny threw 30 bottles at her during a row in Australia which allegedly happened in 2015.  \u00a0Johnny has denied ever being violent towards Amber, but has accused her of being abusive towards him during their marriage. \u00a0The Hollywood stars are in court as part of Johnny's libel case against News Group Newspapers, who published Amber's allegations against Johnny and referred to him as a \"wife beater\" in a Sun column in 2018. \u00a0The trial will conclude next week, though no ruling is expected immediately.",
