            "description": "-The troubled actor reportedly filed court documents accusing Heard of assaulting him after an April 2016 dinner party as part of a libel lawsuit against British tabloid The Sun.Depp  55  claimed in the documents that the Aquaman actress violently punched him twice in the face after he showed up two hours late to her 30th birthday dinner  according to People.The Pirates of the Caribbean star reportedly said he was held up by his business manager and accountants prior to the dinner  but that hed let Heard know hed be late  only to find her acting cold when he finally arrived.Depp claimed an allegedly intoxicated Heard became aggressive and violent later in the night as he read in bed  and that he was forced to grab her arms and push her onto the bed in order to stop her from punching him.An attorney for Heard dismissed the allegations as totally false and noted the multiple other assault lawsuits in which Depp is currently embroiled.Mr. Depp is currently being sued in multiple venues  including for assaulting a location manager on the set of City of Lies  the attorney told People. On many occasions  eyewitnesses observed the extent of the abuse Mr. Depp inflicted on Ms. Heard.Heard  32  accused the actor of domestic violence around the same time she filed for divorce in May 2016.She claimed Depp threw an iPhone at her face  and offered up photographic evidence of her bruises when she requested a temporary domestic violence restraining order  which was granted.Depp reportedly disputed her recollection of the nights events in the documents  claiming instead that he tossed the phone onto the couch  and that it never hit Heard.She also alleged that a drunk and high Depp grabbed her hair and shoved her to the floor the night of her 30th birthday dinner.The documents were filed as part of an ongoing libel lawsuit against The Sun  which labeled him a wife-beater in an April article questioning why he still had a role in Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald.Heard and Depp were officially divorced in January 2017 after 15 months of marriage  and she received a $7 million settlement  which she claimed would be donated to charity.",
