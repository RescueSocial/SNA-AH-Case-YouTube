            "description": "Hollywood star Johnny Depp kicked and slapped his ex-wife Amber Heard on a private flight in a drunken rage brought on because he believed she was having an affair with her co-star James Franco, London's High Court heard on Wednesday (July 8).\n\nDepp, giving evidence in his libel trial against Britain's Sun newspaper over an article describing him as a \"wife beater\", denied he had attacked Heard, accusing her of being the aggressor whom he tried to placate.\n\nDuring the first two days of what is expected to be a three-week case, the court has heard evidence about Depp's heavy drinking and drug use and about his relationship with Heard whom he married in 2015. She filed for divorce 15 months later.\n\nOn Wednesday, the \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" actor was accused of abusing Heard on a flight from Boston to Los Angeles following a row over Franco, who appeared with her in the film \"The Adderall Diaries\".\n\nThe court heard an 18 second audio clip of a person groaning, which Sasha Wass, lawyer for the Sun put to Depp was him in the recording during the flight from Boston to Los Angeles.\n\nDepp told the court he was \"drawing art sketches\" in a notebook during the flight.\n\nDepp said he was surprised Heard had agreed to make the film with Franco, having previously described him as \"creepy\" for making aggressive sexual advances towards her.\n\nOn the flight, Depp screamed obscenities at Heard, said she liked having sex on film sets and called her a \"go-getter slut and a whore\", said Wass.\n\nIn a \"blind rage\", he kicked her in the back as she tried to walk away from him and slapped her across the face, Wass said.\n\nDepp denied the accusations.\n\nThe court also heard the first alleged incident of violence took place at Heard's home in March 2013 when Depp had \"fallen off the wagon\" and started drinking again after months of sobriety.\n\nWass said Depp had become angry when Heard mocked one of his tattoos which he had changed from \"Winona forever\" - a reference to his former girlfriend Winona Ryder - to \"Wino forever\" and slapped her three times.\n\n\"That's not the case, that's untrue. It didn't happen,\" Depp said. \"I don't recall any argument about any of my tattoos.\"\n\nThe court was shown a photograph of Heard with what appears to be a bruise on her upper arm, which the court was told was during an in incident in March 2013.\n\n(Production: Parniyan Zemaryalai)",
