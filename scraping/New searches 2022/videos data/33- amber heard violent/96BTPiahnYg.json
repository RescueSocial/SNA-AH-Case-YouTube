            "description": "(23 Jul 2020) AMBER HEARD ARRIVES FOR FINAL DAY OF HER TESTIMONY IN DEPP'S HIGH COURT LIBEL CASE\r\nAmber Heard arrived at the High Court in London Thursday (23 JULY 2020) for the fourth and final day of her testimony in Johnny Depp's High Court libel case against The Sun over allegations of domestic violence.\r\nDepp, 57, is suing The Sun\u2019s publisher, News Group Newspapers, and the paper\u2019s executive editor, Dan Wootton, over the article. The Hollywood star strongly denies abusing Heard, and claimed in court that she had been violent to him.\r\nOn Wednesday, Heard alleged that ex-husband Depp threw \"30 or so bottles\" at her as if they were \u201cgrenades or bombs\u201d during a drunken and frenzied assault in Australia in March 2015 that also saw him accidentally sever part of his finger.\r\nTaking the witness box, the actress refuted his allegation that it was she who lost her temper and that she had injured him.\r\nHeard has described her stay in Australia with Depp as akin to a \u201cthree-day hostage situation,\" during which Depp was \u201ccompletely out of his mind and out of control\u201d following a binge on drugs and alcohol. Heard has said that she feared for her life while at the rented property on Australia's Gold Coast during a visit while Depp was filming the latest \u201cPirates of the Caribbean\u201d film. \r\nThe incident is central to The Sun\u2019s labeling of Depp in an April 2018 article as a \u201cwife-beater.\u201d The Sun\u2019s defense relies on 14 allegations made by Heard of violence by Depp between 2013 and 2016, in settings as varied as the rented house in Australia, his private island in the Bahamas and a private jet. \r\nDepp, 57, denies abusing Heard and claims she was the aggressor during their tempestuous relationship. He was present once again to hear Heard\u2019s testimony. He is suing The Sun\u2019s publisher, News Group Newspapers, and its executive editor, Dan Wootton, over the article. \r\nDepp and Heard met on the set of the film \u201cThe Rum Diary,\u201d released in 2011. They married in Los Angeles in February 2015. Heard filed for divorce the following year, and it was finalized in 2017.\r\n\r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives \u200b\u200b\r\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/497e41efcb4e40c89ba2caebf282b518",
