He ended an intermittent relationship with Elon Musk in February 2018. Prior to his relationship with Musk, Heard was married to actor Johnny Depp from 2015-2017.\n\nVariety reported that in May 2016, Tillet Wright, a mutual friend of the couple, called 911 at the actress' request.\n\nSince separating from Depp, Heard has thrown herself into her film career and her charitable work. He is currently defending the cause of a 12-year-old Syrian refugee named Weam.\n\nAmber explained to her millions of followers that the girl \"needs a blood transfusion\" and that her medical care was expensive. She has partnered with Crowdrise to help pay the girl's medical bills.",
