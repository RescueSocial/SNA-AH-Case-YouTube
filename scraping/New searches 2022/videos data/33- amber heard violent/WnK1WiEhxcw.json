            "description": "Amber Heard and girlfriend Bianca Butti couldn't hide their affection for one another while out getting groceries in LA on Wednesday.The actress, 33, and cinematographer, 38, looked very much in love as they stocked up on food and beverages at the upscale Gelson's market.Inside the shop the pair shared a tender moment, when Bianca was seen holding Amber's face sweetly.   The couple only had eyes for each other, sharing a love gaze.Amber continued the PDA by whispering something into Bianca's ear and kissing her on the side of the face. The Aquaman beauty was clad in her signature casual cool style, pairing a loose sweater with a black midi skirt and shiny loafers. Her effortless look was completed with a messy braid.Bianca was also dressed for comfort, rocking a denim jacket, skinny jeans and hip ankle boots.\u00a0  The couple, who have been dating since January, already seem quite attached - with sources calling Amber 'happier than ever.''Amber is fine and happier than ever,' an insider told Us Weekly back in February.'Bianca has been very supportive of her, and Amber feels like she can trust her and be comfortable around her, especially since they were friends first.'That source added that Heard is 'enjoying spending time' with Butti, and has even gone as far as to say she 'really loves her.'  And Amber's been lucky to have Bianca to support her while her ongoing legal brawl with ex Johnny Depp continues to get more and more contentious.The exes, who were wed from 2015 to 2017, have been waging a he-said, she-said war against each other.Johnny is suing Amber for defamation, claiming a 2018 Washington Post\u00a0essay written by Heard falsely branded him an abuser.In his legal filings, the Pirates Of The Caribbean actor accused Heard of abusing him throughout the duration of their relationship, claiming she was prone to violent tantrums.The defamation case is set to begin in August this year, after being pushed back from its February start date when Deep failed to meet a deadline to submit records of his drug and alcohol use.",
