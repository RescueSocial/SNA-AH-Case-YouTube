Yes, it in fact was so awful, that the future of Aquaman to be released the following year, seemed quite bleak too. \n\nBut Aquaman hit the theatres with a bang and brought in a whopping 1.148 billion US Dollars. That was quite a comeback for DC!\n\nBut why was the movie so successful?\n\nThe DC comics of Aquaman, are considered by many not to be quite exciting as the rest of the DC world. Due to this, most of the credit was given to the actors who brought the movie to life. The two leads, Jason Momoa and Amber Heard were given high praise for their performance, leading to the success of the movie. \n\nDue to its victory in the first weekend, an official report was released by Warner Bros. that there will be an Aquaman 2 in 2022. This was great news for the fans but what we weren't aware of was that Amber Heard\u2019s personal life would blow up and affect the fate of the sequel. \n\nWhat did Amber do that caused a holistic rut?\n\nAmber Heard is known for her gorgeous looks, which many people may substitute for innocence. This perception played to be false ever since she filed for divorce in 2016. She was married to Johnny Depp and had filed a divorce from him stating he was a threat to her life and was constantly involved in physically abusing her.\n\nThe evidence was quite nasty indeed. It involved audiotape leaks proving her violent side, of her physically assaulting Johnny Depp by severing his finger with a broken Vodka bottle and even at one time, faking bruises and scars which even her neighbors claimed not to be true.\n\nWhat did poor broken Johnny do about this?\n\nHe kept on the low and silent for a while, all for her good. But when she crossed her limits he brought out the 50 million dollar lawsuit against her which had solid evidence that he was in the right and she was clearly in the wrong. injustice\n\nJohnny, a notable actor who has been a blessing to the film industry for decades together was getting fired from some of the major roles he was cast in, such as Pirates of the Caribbean and even Warner Bros, Fantastic Beasts, due to Amber Heard\u2019s claims. He had hit rock bottom. All this was thanks to Amber Heard.\n\nThe public was seeing this injustice and wasn\u2019t liking it at all. Just like many of today\u2019s problems are solved, a petition to safeguard Johnny\u2019s innocence was started by the fans getting almost enormous 1.8 million! That\u2019s almost reaching up to the 2 million mark.\n\nWhat will happen to Amber Heard now?\n\nMera, the role she played in Aquaman suited her quite well but fans are very keen on her being entirely replaced by another actress who pretty much fits just right in. Any guesses on who that actress could be? Yes, indeed. It is Emilia Clarke. \n\nEmilia Clarke has acted with Jason Momoa in the past and the performance they did was nothing less than magnificent. Due to their performance on Game of Thrones, fans are keen on seeing this duo working together again. \n\nWhat happens to Amber Heard\u2019s now?\n\nOnly in 2020 when some dirty secrets of their marriage and her personality were out, did the concerns of her being a part of Aquaman 2 arise. Everyone wanted her to face the same fate Johnny did. They didn\u2019t want her cast and she surely did not like that! The opportunities are just opening up in big movies such as Star Wars: Rogue Squadron, Rangers of the Republic, and Ashoka Tano to name a few.  \n\nAll the mentioned openings that were mentioned were from Disney. \n\nBut would Disney sanction her appearance in these movies?\n\nDisney quite blatantly denied Johnny Depp when the allegations against him were out in the open due to the Me Too movement. This caused him to lose his famous role of Jack Sparrow which he has been playing for nearly 2 decades. If he can lose a movie with that history, Amber Heard being kicked out from Aquaman 2 is nothing!\n\nDisney is known for taking its stance on justice and has also been known to cast out various of their showstoppers for matters even smaller than the situation between Depp and Amber. The famous American film director, James Gunn, was fired by Disney too. The Guardians of the Galaxy 3 Director was fired for some of the tweets he had posted during his amateur directing days which cost him his career quite a bitclevver news  johnny depp amber heard amber heard aquaman 2\n\n#AmberHeard #Aquaman2 #JohnnyDepp",
