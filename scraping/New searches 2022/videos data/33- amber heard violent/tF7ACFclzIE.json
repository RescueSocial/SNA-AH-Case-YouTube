            "description": "Amber Heard reveals the two charities to which she'll donate FULL $7m Johnny Depp settlement \n\nOne of the charities has a particular focus to help stop violence against women \n Amber Heard is donating the full $7million Johnny Depp divorce settlement to charity.\n\nEarlier this week, Johnny Depp agreed to pay his estranged wife the huge sum of money just one day before they were due to battle it out in court.\n\nOn Thursday, a statement from the actress said the money \"played no role\" to her and she will be donating the entire sum equally between two charities.\n\nOne of the charities is the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which she says has a particular focus to stop violence against women, and the other is Children\u2019s Hospital of Los Angeles where she worked as a volunteer for the past 10 years.\n\nThe statement said: \"As described in the restraining order and divorce settlement, money played no role for me personally and never has, except to the extent that I could donate it to charity and, in doing so, hopefully help those less able to defend themselves.\nAs reported in the media, the amount received in the divorce was $7 million and $7 million is being donated. This is over and above any funds that I have given away in the past and will continue to give away in the future.\"\n\nThe statement finished: \"I know these organizations will put the funds to good use and look forward to continuing to support them in the future. Hopefully, this experience results in a positive change in the lives of people who need it the most.\nLegal documents were filed on Tuesday in which the Rum Dairy actress withdrew her request for a restraining order.\n\nJohnny and Amber split in May and the actress was granted a restraining order after accusing him of domestic abuse.\n\nAmber alleged Johnny threw a phone at her during an argument and insisted there were other instances where he had been violent towards her but she filed court papers to dismiss her domestic violence case against the actor once they agreed on the settlement.\nThe insider added: \"Initially, being the stubborn people they are, they both didn't want to give in to each other's requests. For a long time, Amber lived with a lot of hurt and had been deeply affected by Johnny's behaviour, but chose not to say anything. Whenever something would happen, he'd apologise, and they'd move on. Johnny never wanted the world to know any of this.\"\n\nAmber, 30 and Johnny, 53, said in a joint statement: \"Our relationship was intensely passionate and at times volatile, but always bound by love. Neither party has made false accusations for financial gain.\n\n\"There was never any intent of physical or emotional harm. Amber wishes the best for Johnny in the future. Amber will be donating financial proceeds from the divorce to a charity.\"",
