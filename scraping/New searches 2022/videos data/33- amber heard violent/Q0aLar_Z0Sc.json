            "description": "Actress Amber Heard has submitted a graphic new court filing that details horrifying allegations of abuse she says she endured during her relationship to actor Johnny Depp. \nThe Associated Press reports that on Thursday, the 32-year-old \u201cAquaman\u201d actress asked a Virginia judge to dismiss a $50 million defamation lawsuit her 55-year-old ex-husband filed over an op-ed she wrote about domestic violence for The Washington Post in December 2018. \nIn the motion filed in the Circuit Court of Fairfax, Virginia, Heard goes into harrowing detail about more than a dozen alleged incidents before and during their rocky one-year marriage in which she claims the actor was high on drugs or alcohol, became \u201cthe Monster\u201d and punched, slapped, kicked, spat on and choked her. There are also details about Depp allegedly head-butting Heard and pulling her hair so hard that chunks of her scalp came out. \nDepp has denied the abuse, and the allegations have appeared in the couple\u2019s divorce and other court documents. HuffPost has reached out to Depp\u2019s publicist for comment. \nJohn Shearer via Getty Images \nJohnny Depp and Amber Heard attend at the Grammy Awards in 2016. \nIn the court papers obtained by the New York Post\u2019s Page Six, Heard claims that Depp\u2019s substance abuse issues would trigger a personality they both referred to as \u201cthe Monster,\u201d like on a morning in May 2014 in which the couple, who were dating at the time, traveled from Boston to Los Angeles on a private jet: \nOn the flight, Johnny ordered the flight attendants to give him an oxygen tank, and drank heavily. Johnny\u2019s handlers told me that he was upset that I was filming a movie with a romantic scene with James Franco the day before. Soon, Johnny began to throw objects at me. Instead of reacting to his behavior, I simply moved seats. That didn\u2019t stop him. He provocatively pushed a chair at me as I walked by, yelled at me, and taunted me by yelling out the name \u201cJames Franco.\u201d \nHeard states that at one point during the flight, she stood up and Depp kicked her in the back. She says she fell to the floor, Depp threw a boot at her and continued to insult her until he went to the bathroom and passed out inside. \nHeard also elaborated on an incident she said occurred a month after their February 2015 marriage, in which Depp, who was supposed to be clean, went on a sleepless, three-day ecstasy bender in Australia: \nJohnny told me that I had not explicitly forbidden him from taking ecstasy. The argument heated up, and Johnny pushed me, slapped me, and shoved me to the ground before I retreated to a locked bedroom. \nHeard then goes into explicit detail about the abuse she said she endured during those three days, alleging she was hit, shoved and choked numerous more times. During their fights, Heard said Depp \u201cshoved me into a ping pong table that collapsed underneath me,\u201d threw bottles of alcohol at her and through the window, breaking panels, and at one point pulled off her nightgown. \u201cI was naked and b",
