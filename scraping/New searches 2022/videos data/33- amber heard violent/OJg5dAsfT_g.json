            "description": "Johnny Depp has admitted he wanted wife Amber Heard dropped from the Aquaman move after he was \"characterised globally as a wife beater\". \u00a0The US actor, 57, attended the fourth day of his libel case against News Group Newspapers (NGN), the publisher of The Sun, over a 2018 piece which described him as a \"wife beater\". \u00a0Depp strenuously denies his ex-partner Amber Heard's claims that he was violent to her during their brief union. \u00a0Speaking in court, Sasha Wass QC, barrister for News Group Newspapers, accused Depp of \"orchestrating'\" a petition to have her axed by film company Warner Brothers.   \u00a0Depp replied: \"I didn't orchestrate the petition but I wanted her released from Aquaman. \u00a0Discussing the claims made against him, he added: \"I had been characterised globally as a wife beater. \u00a0\"I went from Cinderella to Quasimodo in 0.6 seconds. I was without a voice at that point. \u00a0\"Miss Heard had made sure the news media had it. It was a very unpleasant place to be.''   \u00a0Depp\u2019s libel case relates to a 2018 The Sun column, in which Executive Editor Dan Wootton said Depp shouldn't be allowed to appear in the upcoming film adaptation of JK Rowling's Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them because he was a \"wife beater\". \u00a0The Pirates of the Caribbean star is claiming to have suffered a substantial loss in earnings as a result of the coverage the piece received.  \u00a0Depp and Ms Heard married in a private civil ceremony at their LA home, four years after they met as co-stars on the set of The Rum Diaries.  \u00a0They wed in 2015, but Heard filed for divorce in May 2016 accusing Depp of beating her during their toxic 18-month marriage. \u00a0Two years after the divorce, Heard portrayed Mera in Aquaman \u2013 a film that garnered $1.148billion at the box office.",
