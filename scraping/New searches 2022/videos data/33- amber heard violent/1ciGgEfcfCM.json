            "description": "Johnny Depp may have been \"unaware of violence\" against his ex wife Amber Heard as he was a \"hopeless addict\", the High Court has heard. \u00a0The 57-year-old Hollywood actor is suing for libel over an article published in The Sun in 2018 which called him a \"wife-beater\", a claim he denies. \u00a0News Group Newspapers\u2019 (NGN) defence relies on 14 allegations of domestic violence, each of which Depp has denied. \u00a0Sasha Wass QC, for The Sun's publisher NGN, argued 14 incidents of violence by Depp had been proved over the course of a three-week trial, saying his drink and drug issues may have affected his memory and ability to control \"the monster\" within.   \u00a0She said the court has been presented with \"a wealth\" of evidence that the actor is a \"hopeless addict, who repeatedly lost his self-control and all ability to restrain his anger\". \u00a0Wass said: \"The article complained of in this defamation action referred to Mr Depp as a wife beater. \u00a0\"The defence is one of truth, namely Mr Depp did indeed beat his wife. \u00a0\"For the defence of truth to be substantiated, the defendants needs to prove on the balance of probabilities, Mr Depp assaulted Ms Heard on at least one occasion.   \u00a0\"During the last two weeks, the defendant has established many more than one occasion of wife-beating taking place over the course of the relationship between the claimant and Amber Heard. \u00a0\"The evidence of the claimant\u2019s drug and alcohol-fuelled lifestyle provided the background to the events in question. The relevance of substance abuse by Mr Depp is two-fold \u2013 firstly it demonstrates the claimant is subject to irrational mood swings and abnormal behavioural patterns which would not have been present when Mr Depp was clean and sober. \u00a0\"Mr Depp has a name for the metamorphosed entity, namely the monster.  \u00a0\"Mr Depp's recollection of his own disgraceful conduct was so severely impaired by drug misuse that he may not even have been aware of the violence and terrifying behaviour which on more than one pleaded incident put Ms Heard in fear of her life.\" \u00a0Wass argued that the judge, Mr Justice Nicol, should find Heard was a truthful witness.  \u00a0She added that her testimony alone would be enough to find that Depp was violent. \u00a0Wass added that a \"wealth of supporting evidence\" has also been presented, including Depp's own alleged admissions of losing control while on drugs. \u00a0Depp's lawyer will give his closing speech on Tuesday.",
