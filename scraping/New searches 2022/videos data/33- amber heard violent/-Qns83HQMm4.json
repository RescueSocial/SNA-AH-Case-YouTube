We were together as a couple for four years, and I counted him as my best friend, and as close to me as family. I count our relationship as one of the more significant relationships of my life. I understand that it is very important that I speak from my own experience.   \u00a0\u2018I obviously was not there during his marriage to Amber, but, from my experience, which was so wildly different, I was absolutely shocked, confused and upset when I heard the accusations against him. The idea that he is an incredibly violent person is the farthest thing from the Johnny I knew and loved. I cannot wrap my head around these accusations. \u00a0\u2018He was never, never violent towards me. He was never, never abusive at all towards me. He has never been violent or abusive towards anybody I have seen. I truly and honestly only know him as a really good man- an incredibly loving, extremely caring guy who was so very protective of me and the people that he loves, and I felt so very, very safe with him.\u2019 \u00a0The Heathers star continued: \u2018I do not want to call anyone a liar but from my experience of Johnny, it is impossible to believe that such horrific allegations are true. I find it extremely upsetting knowing him as I do.\u2019 \u00a0Winona and Johnny met in 1989 at the premiere of Great Balls of Fire! premiere, and got engaged in July 1990, also going on to star together in Edward Scissorhands.\u00a0 \u00a0Depp famously got a tattoo reading \u2018Winona Forever\u2019, but after their split in 1993, he had it changed to \u2018Wino Forever\u2019. \u00a0The Pirates of the Caribbean actor is suing his ex-wife Amber for $50 million (\u00a340m) for defamation, after the Aquaman actress claimed she was a victim of domestic abuse in an op-ed for The Washington Post in 2018. \u00a0While Heard did not name her alleged abuser, Depp filed a defamation suit, claiming that her \u2018fabricated domestic violence allegations are categorically and demonstrably false\u2019.   \u00a0In filings, Depp has accused Heard of abuse, including allegations she severed his finger with a glass bottle and stubbed out a cigarette on his face. \u00a0Amber\u2019s lawyer said: \u2018This allegation is absurd, offensive and categorically untrue.\u00a0 \u00a0\u2018This photograph proves nothing \u2013 apart from",
