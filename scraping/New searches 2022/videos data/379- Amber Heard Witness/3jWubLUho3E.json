            "description": "Botham Jean's neighbor Joshua Brown, a key witness in the murder trial of Dallas police officer Amber Guyger, was shot and killed last night. Get the latest details in our LIVE COVERAGE.\n\nThere are no suspects yet and no known motive in Joshua Brown's murder. The shooting may have been a drive-by shooting -- a car was seen speeding away from where Brown was shot. Brown lived in the same apartment complex as Botham Jean and Amber Guyger, and was in the hallway and heard the gunshots last September when Amber Guyger shot and killed her neighbor Botham Jean. Guyger testified that she accidentally entered the wrong apartment and thought Jean was an intruder. A Dallas County jury convicted Guyger of murder this week, and Joshua Brown's testimony is seen as playing a key role in the trial.
