In what has become one of the largest fundraising walks and runs in town, the event brings together people from our community \u2013 surviving victims of crashes, families and friends of injured and deceased victims, law enforcement, prosecutors, first responders, advocates, and community leaders and members \u2013 to march, rally and run for the cause.\n\nOur community has seen at least 4,000 DUI arrests made each year, according to the Kern County District Attorney\u2019s Office \u2013 nearly 12 DUI arrests per day. Kern County ranks worst in the state for DUI crashes resulting in injuries, and second most in the United States. And during this pandemic, fatal crash rates have spiked, with speeding, lower seatbelt use, and impaired driving to blame.\n\n\u201cImpaired driving continues to be one of the leading causes of fatalities and injuries on our roadways, with devastating consequences for all involved, especially innocent bystanders,\u201d said Carla Pearson, MADD Kern County\u2019s victim services specialist. \u201cLet\u2019s all remember and remind our loved ones that these crashes are 100% preventable.\u201d\n\nWalk Like MADD & MADD Dash has three main components:\n1) Remember: We walk for those who no longer can and alongside those who are learning to walk again.\n2) Inspire: We walk empowered even when we feel powerless, as survivors when we have been victimized, and with purpose when we have lost our way.\n3) Commit: We walk with supporters who share our vision of No More Victims.\n\nAt the state level, the MADD Campaign to Eliminate Drunk Driving calls for high-visibility law enforcement, ignition interlocks or \u201cin-car breathalyzers\u201d for all convicted drunk drivers, and support for the development of advanced technology.\n\nFunds raised in Kern County\u2019s event funds local educational programs and prevention services, raises awareness of the DUI problem in our local communities, and provides support to local victims and survivors of impaired driving crashes.\n\nPresented by the local law firm Chain | Cohn | Stiles, it\u2019s also supported this year by Chevron, Valley Strong Credit Union, Kern County Prosecutors Association, Sally Herald Accountancy Inc., and others. Since the first Bakersfield Walk Like MADD in 2014, thousands of local residents have made their voices heard while raising more than $400,000 for MADD Kern County.\n\n- When: 7-10am on Saturday, Sept. 25, 2021\n- Where: Park at River Walk in Bakersfield\n- Packet Pick-Up: 3-7pm on Thursday, Sept. 23, at Action Sports (9500 Brimhall Road, #400)\n- Register / Information: walklikemadd.org/bakersfield",
