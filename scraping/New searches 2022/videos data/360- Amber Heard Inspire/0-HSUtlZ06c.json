            "description": "Jason Momoas Arthur and Amber Heards Mera search for clues in Atlantis in a new image from James Wans upcomingDC movie Aquaman . Fans recently got their first real look at the highly anticipated  Aquaman  movie when the first trailer  (finally) saw the light of day at last months San Diego Comic-Con. Among the other importanttidbits released about the movie from SDCC was Momoas revelation that Arthur Curry  wears denim pants in the poster , not leather as was originally thought. The trailer itself was of course filled with revelations of its own, includinga first look at the movies sprawling version of Atlantis, as well as hints about the  origins of Black Mantis . One other recent reveal from  Aquaman  director James Wan , that there will be no  Justice League  team  cameos in the movie, may come as something of a disappointment to some fans. Clearly, many DC fans are very excited about the movie as evidenced by all the  tweets about  Aquaman  during Comic-Con , not to mention  the cleverfan trailers  that have come out since the real trailer first dropped. Related: Aquaman Trailer Breakdown: 25 Secrets You Missed For Aquaman fans who just cant get enough glimpses of what the movie has in store,  EW  has exclusively released a new photo from the film that helps build the intrigue. In the image, Amber Heards Mera and Jason Momoas casually dressed Arthur Curry are seen in a chamber apparently inside a ruin within one of the Seven Kingdoms of Atlantis having a look at a very mysterious piece of technology. By the looks on their faces, theyre very happy to have stumbled across this particular object. See the photo below: Theres a definite Indiana Jones - specifically  Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull  - feel to the scene, with its stone walls, ancient-looking sculptures and the piece of technology itself, which Wan has revealed is actually a device used to play back an ancient recording. Mera and Arthur are here seeking clues as part of their quest to find the Trident of Neptune so they can use it in their battle against Aquamans half-brother King Orm (Patrick Wilson). It should be no surprise that theres a distinct Indiana Jones vibeto not only the plot but the above still, as Wan has revealed the Indiana Jones movies helped inspire his take on Aquaman. As the particular setting featured above is in fact located in Africa, the scene shown likely happens not long after the famous moment from the  Aquaman  trailer where Mera and Arthur both leap from a plane into the desert without parachutes (theyre also wearing the same costumes as in that scene from the trailer). Among the many mysteries the movie will have to clear up is how they both manage to survive their plane leap, sincetheres nothing but sand dunes underneath them.
