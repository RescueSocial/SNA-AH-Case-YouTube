Since my plan to go Live got messed up thanks to YouTube requiring content creators to have 1k subs to go Live on their mobile device, I went ahead and recorded the reading that had been requested \ud83d\ude48.  I hope you enjoy this and if you have any requests for a reading or other Fun Friday subjects, feel free to leave them in the comments below! \ud83e\udd17\n\nHello and welcome to my channel!  I\u2019m Beauty Heathen and this is where we explore Paganism through the medium of cosmetics!  Not gunna lie, I\u2019m more than a bit nervous doing this, but I felt it was time to end the misinformation and help inform and educate anyone who may be interested in this subject!  There will be beginner instruction on rituals and spellwork on this channel. For more advanced or adult themed instruction, be sure to follow my social media below and stay tuned for updates regarding my upcoming Patreon!  If you have any requests for a subject you may be interested in, please be sure to comment below and I will try to cover it in a future video!  With all of this said, welcome and let\u2019s have fun learning together \ud83d\ude0a\n\n*Disclaimer*\nNo two pagans are alike and it will not always be feasible to verify information with practitioners of certain paths. I will do my best to cover information as well as I can. If anything is ever incorrect, please feel free to leave corrected/alternate information below. Respect is paramount on my channel. I have my own views and beliefs and respect those of others, but please remember that if yours differ, they are yours and please be respectful that mine are my own. If there is hate or derogatory comments, they will be deleted and users banned.\n\nSocial media platforms:\nTwitter: @BeautyHeathen\nFacebook: @BeautyHeathen\nTwitter: @BeautyHeathen",
