            "description": "#Spirituality #FireScience #MakeItMentionable\nMy friend Dr. Amber Ortega joins me to talk about science and spirituality. As a scientist, firefighter, and priestess, Amber brings a unique lens to exploring these two worlds that often seem at odds. \n\nWe talk about the science of fire and why it\u2019s been such a powerful symbol for humans throughout history. We also discuss what fire teaches us about boundaries, how agreement fields set us up for success, and the importance of trusting our bodies. \n\nAnd in a world that\u2019s obsessed with the brightest flame and flashiest lights, Amber and I talk about the science of smoldering and what it means for us on a day-to-day basis.\n\nABOUT AMBER\nDr. Amber Ortega is a weaver of science and spirit, here to co-create planetary healing. She earned her PhD in Atmospheric Chemistry and is an Elemental Priestess of the Sacred Arts. She\u2019s a lover of deep conversations and comfortable with most things taboo (which makes her a fantastic guest in this episode)! She\u2019s also a Wildland Firefighter and lives a vegan, sober lifestyle.\n\nThe show notes and transcript for the episode are available here: https://alyssapatmos.com/how-do-science-spirituality-co-exist-what-fire-teaches-us-with-dr-amber-ortega\n\nSubscribe to Make it Mentionable: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJFtl9fbklbVSoIJg0Bny0A \nSign up for my free newsletter, The Peel, and get my tips for navigating whatever life dishes: https://alyssapatmos.com/thepeel \nJoin my free community, The Convey Collective, to master authentic communication: https://alyssapatmos.com/community\n\nFor even more deep-dive conversations: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB6EN4QhOalLkYHWNWzYD6vJmVFp3psMN\n\nCONNECT WITH ALYSSA ON SOCIAL:\nFollow on Facebook: https://www.Facebook.com/alyssapatmos \nSay hi on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/alyssapatmos \nSubscribe to my YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/alyssapatmos",
