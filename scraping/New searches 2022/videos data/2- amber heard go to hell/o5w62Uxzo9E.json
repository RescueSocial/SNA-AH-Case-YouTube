Depp addressed the breakup in a July 2013 interview in Rolling Stone, where the actor said that \u201crelationships are very difficult.\u201d\nDepp didn\u2019t mention Heard in the Rolling Stone piece, which was pretty standard for him and Heard as they continued to stay private about their relationship until they made their first appearance as a couple at the 7th Annual Heaven Gala in January 2014.\n\nIf you liked this video guys, please consider leaving a like and give us your thoughts in the comments! \n\nIf you are into the latest Hollywood news and the celebrity latest gossip, then you should consider subscribing to the channel!
