So today I will be discussing the 1hr leaked audio from Johnny Depp and Amber Heard. What can *you* learn from Amber's arguing style? How can you argue more fair. What are red flags of a toxic relationship that show during a fight? \n\nhttps://youtu.be/XiuUzvZMyro --- The leaked audio link\n\nFollow me on IG @popculturecommentary\nSubscribe for more new content\nTell me your thoughts below about this video or if there is something else you want me to give commentary on\n\nSo if I were to describe my channel; it's kind of self help with a good bit of celebrity analysis. Really looking at their mentality, their relationships, and really thinking how can we use this information to better understand ourselves, analyzing toxic relationships, red flags, celeb relationships, seeing how astrology plays into it all and really trying to be our best selves out of what we can learn from them.\n\nBODY CONFIDENCE, BODY POSITIVITY, ADVICE, GUIDANCE, SELF HELP, CELEB GOSSIP, ASTROLOGY, TOXIC RELATIONSHIPS\n\n\ud83c\udf1fBODY CONFIDENCE PLAYLIST\ud83c\udf1f https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsTJ0WH1TZzGOoGR-eiL63V9C0QT57Hrj\n\ud83c\udf1fWANT MORE POPCULTURECOMMENTARY?\ud83c\udf1f\n\ud83c\udf1fSUBSCRIBE TO POPCULTURECOMMENTARY\ud83c\udf1fhttps://www.youtube.com/c/popculturecommentary?sub_confirmation=1\n\nSubscribe to stay up to date on my content! :)#justiceforjohnny #johnnydepp #abusiverelationships\nFor business inquiries doris.popculture@gmail.com\n\nDisclaimer: All advice given in this video is merely for entertainment purposes only",
