After Amber Heard was spotted trying to hide some suspiciously flashy bling on her left ring finger earlier this week, fans wondered whether the actress had secretly gotten engaged to her Rum Diary costar. The famously private couple have yet to confirm or deny either way, but sources tell Us Weekly they're indeed planning to marry.\n\"The proposal happened a while ago,\" one insider tells Us. \"She just didn't wear the ring.\" (Celebuzz reported news of an engagement on Thursday.)\n\n\n\nJohnny Depp never tied the knot in his past 14-year relationship with Vanessa Paradis, but now -- after less than two years together -- he's ready to walk down the aisle with new love Amber Heard. \n\n2.Back in 2010, Depp explained to Extra why he hadn't wed French actress and singer Paradis, now 41, the mother of his children Lily-Rose, 14, and Jack, 11. \"I never found myself needing that piece of paper,\" he shared. \"Marriage is really from soul to soul, heart to heart. You don't need somebody to say, okay you're married.\"\n\n3.That being said, however, the Pirates of the Caribbean star clarified that he wasn't opposed to marriage. \"If Vanessa wanted to get hitched, why not,\" he said. \"But the thing is, I'd be so scared of ruining her last name. She's got such a good last name.\"\n\n4.The Lone Ranger star has been married once before to Lori Anne Allison from 1983 to 1985. He's previously been engaged to actresses Jennifer Grey, Sherilyn Fenn and Winona Ryder, and had a talked-about four-year relationship with supermodel Kate Moss.\n\n5.Depp and Paradis announced their breakup in June 2012 after 14 years together. A year later, Depp broke his silence about their split.\n\n6.\"Relationships are very difficult. Especially in the racket that I'm in because you're constantly away or they're away and so it's hard. It wasn't easy on her. It wasn't easy on me. It wasn't easy on the kids,\" he told Rolling Stone in July 2013. \"So, yeah. The trajectory of that relationship -- you play it out until it goes, one thing leads to another. So for whatever reason that \u00adceases, it doesn't stop the fact that you care for that person, and they're the mother of your kids, and you'll always know each other, and you're always gonna be in each other's lives because of those kids. You might as well make the best of it.\"\n\n\n7.Shortly after his breakup from Paradis, Depp began dating Heard, whom he met on the set of The Rum Diary. Earlier this week, Heard was spotted wearing huge sparkler on her ring finger. The resolutely private couple has to confirm their engagement, but an insider told Us: \"The proposal happened a while ago.
