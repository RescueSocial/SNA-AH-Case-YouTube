He claimed all hell would break loose if he failed to follow Miss Heard's rules and she would fly off the handle if he did not feed her need for attention. Depp, 57, accused Miss Heard of undermining his effort to get sober by keeping a bottle of Bulleit bourbon in the freezer and chopping up lines of cocaine - all for his use.\u00a0\u00a0Miss Heard, 34, would also take the drug by putting her finger in it and rubbing the drug on her gums.\u00a0Questioned by his barrister David Sherborne on the third day of the libel case, Depp told how small issues would quickly escalate.\u00a0Mr Sherborne asked what would happen if Mr Depp broke his ex-wife's \"rules\". Depp replied: \"An argument would ensue and all hell would break loose.\"\u00a0The court heard how Depp's behaviour turned from being \"a Southern gentleman\" to what Miss Heard dubbed \"the monster\" when he binged on drink and drugs.\u00a0Depp said: \"Any time I didn't comply or agree with her position, then she would call it the monster.\u00a0\"The monster grew from there into this whole whatever she wanted it to be, and she used it quite a lot.\" Mr Sherborne read medical notes relating to Miss Heard which referred to her \"history of substance abuse, including addiction to cocaine and liquor\".\u00a0It said she had a history of \"anxiety, eating disorder, bipolar disorder, insomnia\" as well as the actress having had \"severe outbursts of anger and rage\". It noted \"insecurity and jealousy when not in the presence of her husband\". Asked by Mr Sherborne: \"Does this accord with how you experienced Ms Heard or not?\" Mr Depp replied: \"Yes.\" Depp was asked if he had ever hit a woman. Depp replied: \"No sir. Never.\"\u00a0  \u00a0\u00a0Mr Sherborne said: \"Other than Miss Heard's allegations has any woman ever accused you of hitting them?\" Mr Depp replied: \"No, sir.\"\u00a0Earlier the court heard how Depp branded Miss Heard a \"50 cent stripper\" and pledged to subject her to \"global humiliation\" as the two-year marriage fell apart.\u00a0He launched into an extraordinary hate-filled rant in a text to his agent in which he accused the actress of having an affair with SpaceX billionaire Elon Musk, 49. Furious Depp spoke of his hopes that \"karma kicks in and takes the gift of breath\" from the actress after the bitter break up.\u00a0The shocking message - which was sent on the date of the couple's divorce settlement in August 2016 - was read out in court as Depp gave evidence for a fourth day.
