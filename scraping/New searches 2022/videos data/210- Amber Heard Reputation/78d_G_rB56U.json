            "description": "NOTE: Typo.  I meant to say if Amber DID know what was bothering Johnny, why would she ask  \"What happened?\"  \nOne very important thing to observe here: Johnny Depp DID NOT hit Amber Heard in this video, nor did he throw anything at her.  He did everything he could to avoid going near her. When he realized she was filiming him, which obviously she'd done before by the conversation?  He had finally had enough and lost his temper but STILL didn't hit her.  She had what looked like a small black remote control in her hand(first look 1:00), and seemed to use it to control a camera either buried in a wall or hidden behind something.  Johnny reached for the remote in her hand but instead of grabbing her hand and wrestling with her for the remote, he went right to the camera and yanked it out of wherever it was and slammed it to the floor. The only casualties in this video were the camera, some unfortunate cabinets, a door, and several wine glasses. Maybe even a bottle.  However, no human beings were struck physically during the making of this video.  You'll see when you watch it broken down.\n It's clear that Amber has started conversations like this one with Johnny before, when he's at his angriest and clearly wants to be left alone.  No abuse victim would seek to engage their abuser in a fight, to see if they get hit, just so they can get it on tape.  It doesn't make sense.\nJohnny Depp and Amber Heard were officially divorced January of 2017.  In May of 2016 after filing for divorce, she accused him of domestic violence which caused many to do battle with words on social media and otherwise.  When they settled out of court, they had a document that stated, and I will paraphrase correctly.  Their relationship, passionate and sometimes volatile was still always bound by love.  Neither party lied for financial gain and there was no intention of physical or emotional harm.  Amber wished Johnny the best and pledged to donate her spousal support to charity.\nHowever, she also dropped the charges against Johnny with prejudice, a legal term for swearing in a court of law that she'd never refile those charges against Depp.  Also \"neither lied for financial gain\"(paraphrased) doesn't mean neither lied to protect a reputation!  Based on her Instagram post repeating the joint statement after JK Rowling spoke out to assure her fans that she feels comfortable with Johnny Depp in the Fantastic Beasts franchise?   Amber Heard's jumping in and responding like that shows how very concerned she is about her reputation.  Narcissists always are, but for now, I will let my breakdown of her original video speak for itself.\n\nMany would like to be done with this chapter but unfortunately domestic violence is everyone's business.  It will never end.  Because these people are famous and no one truly was \"there\" except others not talking about it anymore?  We may never know or have \"solid proof.\"  What I did was look very hard at both sides last year, as this issue is close to my heart thanks to my own experiences with abuse.  If  I saw any indication that Johnny Depp even remotely abused Amber Heard, I would not be defending him to this day.  Women, please remember that some of our fellow women are not all good.  Many are abusers, just like those men that abuse women.  Many women use feminism to their advantage, playing the victim to make a man look horrible or ruin his life.  It's sick and pathological but it happens all the time.  I am still getting many views and comments on this video, and while many can say with ease, \"Let them get on with their lives!\"  unfortunately once narcissists put out smear campaigns on their discarded human supply, it never stops.  Those speaking up for Amber won't stop until Johnny is boycotted.  He will never be boycotted but they are so fired up because of REAL abusers like Weinstein that they can't cool down.  Why respond, say some of you?  Well, I'm not feeding narcs, I am just continuing to put out the other side of things for the sake of discernment.  Let Truth continue to be Spoken and never Silenced!!!  Namaste to all.\n\nCreated using http://studio.stupeflix.com/",
