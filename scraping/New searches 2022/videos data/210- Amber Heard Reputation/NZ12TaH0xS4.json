Depp is suing the newspaper over articles he claims are libellous and damaged his reputation and ability to work in the film industry.\n\nHe claims the articles, from April 2018, mean he was guilty of serious domestic violence against his former wife, leaving her fearing for her life.\n\nThe case is due to start on March 23 and is expected to last ten days.\n\nPS: Don't forget to Subscribe to Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt for more latest videos that will take you to Love the music/knowledge/news once again and hit the bell icon for the latest updates...Thank U!",
