            "description": "When Amber Digby sings, people listen.  \u201cAmber is a great traditional singer,\u201d says Vince Gill, who knows whereof he speaks, and like his following observation\u2014\u201cwhich is so hard to find these days\u201d\u2014it\u2019s just the simple truth.\n\nYet it also doesn\u2019t do his subject real justice, because Amber Digby\u2019s singing touches the heart, not just of anyone who appreciatse a traditional country song, but of anyone who\u2019s ever known heartbreak, happiness, regret, loneliness\u2014or just the compelling desire to get out on the dance floor for a night of fun.  And the fact is, with each passing month and year, as she enjoys growing airplay and tours farther and farther from her home in Texas, Amber Digby and her music are reaching out to more and more and more of those hearts.\n\nTo an outside observer, Digby\u2019s career has an appearance of inevitability\u2014after all, her father, mother, stepfather and uncles have all been in the ranks of professional musicians, notable for their own careers or for their contributions to the music of Loretta Lynn, Connie Smith, Faron Young, Ronnie Milsap, Hank Williams, Jr., the Osborne Brothers and many more.  But though she frequented the wings of the Grand Ole Opry House and the sets of Hee Haw and Nashville Now as a child watching her parents at work, singing \u201cwas just something I did,\u201d she says with a laugh.  \u201cMy mom and my dad and my stepdad encouraged me to find my path and to be creative\u2014not necessarily to sing.\u201d  \n\nIndeed, it wasn\u2019t until she was in her mid-teens and living in Oklahoma that Amber even began to sit in with her stepfather\u2019s band, much less think about music as a career\u2014and even then, it wasn\u2019t an easy road.  \u201cI actually graduated from high school in Missouri, and then I got sidetracked, detoured,\u201d she says with the frankness of someone who\u2019s been through what she calls rough times.  \u201cI made some bad choices, and really, the only good thing that came out of that five year block was my son.\u201d\n\nThat, though, turns out not to be quite true, because in the midst of that turmoil, Digby began visiting her mother and stepfather in their new home in the Texas hill country\u2014and before long, she\u2019d made her first album.  \u201cI started sitting in with artists like Jake Hooker and Justin Trevino,\u201d she recalls, and once I heard what all these guys were doing down there, I thought yeah, this is really different\u2014and it\u2019s really good!\u201d   \n\nWith Trevino producing and playing on the album, her stepfather on pedal steel and Bobby Flores on fiddle, Music From The Honky Tonks served notice of a major new talent\u2014and though it took a while to reach more than a few ears, it began to make the young singer a reputation.  As country music historian John Morthland wrote in No Depression in early 2005, not long after she finally made the move to Texas, \u201cif there\u2019s a more promising hard-country singer on the horizon than Amber Digby, I\u2019ve been kept in the dark.\u201d  By that summer, the album had garnered enough attention in Europe that she got called to go with Trevino and Flores to Sweden\u2014the first of many overseas visits she\u2019d make.  \n\nReuniting in the studio with Trevino, Amber released Here Come The Teardrops for Heart Of Texas Records in 2006, and traveled to Europe again\u2014this time headlining her own tour\u2014and by early 2007, she\u2019d quit her day job, moved to the Houston area and, with the help of future husband Randy Lindley, had put together her own band to play the dance hall and club circuits that have nurtured so many Texas country artists.",
