I bet! So, make sure you stay till the end of the video.\nThey say nothing lasts forever and Amber Heard and Johnny Depp\u2019s court case seems to be finalized soon. And not in Amber Heard\u2019s favor. Recently, a Virginia judge ruled Johnny Depp\u2019s legal team can have an expert look at Amber Heard\u2019s phone records and other devices to examine if the photos with bruises were fabricated.\nAccording to Johnny Depp and his legal team, Amber Heard faked the photos of herself having a black eye and claimed it was Johnny Depp who did that to her back in 2015 to ruin his life and career. Johnny Depp\u2019s lawyer, Benjamin Chew, alleged to the Circuit Court of Fairfax Country in a court filing that \u201cMs. Heard\u2019s counsel has repeatedly used these phony photographs at deposition\u201d.\nAlso, JD is convinced that it would be possible to prove that Amber faked photos because even the police officers who responded to the 2015 incident between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard, \u201cfound no injury upon Ms. Heard and no disruption to the penthouses.&quot; This information was published by Page Six as well. Page Six also published the information that JD&#39;s attorney, Benjamin Chew,\nalleged in his court filing. The statement said: &quot;Ms. Heard and her friends then fabricated photos that she used to obtain an ex parte TRO [temporary restraining order] and a $7 million divorce settlement&quot;.\nBut not only the police officers and Johnny Depp can confirm that Amber Heard actually was safe and sound and had no injuries. Amber\u2019s former friend Laura Divenere, who furnished the ex-couple&#39;s Los Angeles penthouse, said in her witness statement she never saw Amber Heard with any injuries. She even claimed\nin her written statement that Amber Heard never spoke about being the victim of domestic abuse in her relationship with Johnny Depp. Moreover, Laura was there with Amber after the alleged fight and she officially confirmed that Amber was\nalright. In her testimony to the US court, Laura said: \u201cOn those days, I worked with Amber, retrieved packages for her, rode elevators with her, and saw her up close in person.\u201d\n\u201cOn none of those days immediately following the abuse claims did I observe any signs of physical abuse or injury, including redness, swelling, cuts, bruising, or damage of any kind. I never saw Amber injured in any way, although I am now aware that she has had many abuse claims\u201d.\nAnother person, who clearly confirmed that Amber\u2019s face didn\u2019t have any injuries, was her makeup artist and stylist, Samantha McMillan. She said: \u201cThroughout the day of December 16, 2015, I could see clearly that Amber Heard did not have any visible marks, bruises, cuts, or injuries to her face or any other part of her body\u201d. Moreover, Amber Heard appeared on James Corden&#39;s US TV show the day after the alleged attack and said none of her injuries were visible because they were covered with make-up. Well, hardly the makeup can cover the injuries Amber\nHeard allegedly had. She told the court she had &quot;two black eyes, a broken nose and\nbroken lip, bruises all over my body, bruises on my forearm&quot;. &quot;I think I had bruises\non my chin, chunks of my hair were missing, pus was in the wounds on my\nhairline,&quot; she alleged. What kind of makeup can help with that?\nA tape of her appearance on the show was played in court and Eleanor Laws QC, for Depp, asked Heard: &quot;That&#39;s what you looked like on the show. There is no sign of you having any injuries.&quot; Amber Heard replied: &quot;I have tons of injuries.&quot; Ms Laws then said, &quot;You don&#39;t have a split lip&quot;, and Heard replied, &quot;Of course I do,&quot; adding she &quot;caked on red lipstick&quot; and &quot;caked on makeup&quot; to cover her injuries.\n\n\n\nBinge Watch - Binge Watch is the best source of the latest celebrity news.
