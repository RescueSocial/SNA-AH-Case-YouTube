Last year\u2019s event was a celebration of technology in education, and this year the film festival event will showcase 15 students\u2019 visions on the theme, \u201cThe Impact of Giving Back.\u201d The film festival will highlight the promise of mentorship in the arts and be a call for the entertainment industry to build upon their mentoring programs and engagement nationwide.\n\nIn keeping with the President\u2019s vision of giving every child the chance to reach their full potential, in the East Room of the White House, President Obama will discuss the ongoing progress towards the goals of his My Brother\u2019s Keeper initiative which aims to close opportunity gaps still faced by too many young people, often boys and young men of color in particular.\n\nThis year, fifteen student videos from around the country were chosen as \u201cOfficial Selections\u201d and will be screened at the White House. Selections were made in collaboration with the American Film Institute. The student filmmakers selected, and their guests, will attend the screening and a reception in their honor afterwards, made possible by the American Film Institute and Participant Media. The audience will be comprised of students, parents, teachers, Hollywood leaders, and education advocates.\n\nThis year\u2019s Student Film Festival, in collaboration with the American Film Institute and Participant Media, will feature a second day of programming at the Newseum in Washington, D.C.
