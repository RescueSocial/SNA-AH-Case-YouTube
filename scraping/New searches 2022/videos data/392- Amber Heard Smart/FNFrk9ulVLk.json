His interest leads him to meet Lana Edmond (Amber Heard), a smart, sexy reporter who gives him unique access to the case. As their relationship takes off, Stephen is suddenly thrust back into the past when his father (Ed Harris), a cruel and vindictive man, shows up to challenge the veracity of the memoir Stephen is writing. As Stephen simultaneously delves into the details of the murder case (which turns out to have some unexpected parallels to his own troubled upbringing) and reunites with his estranged father, he is forced to separate truth from lies and fact from fiction\u2014ultimately leading him to finally reconcile his past and confront his future.\n\nI DO NOT OWN THIS VIDEO.\n\u00a9 Rabbit Bandini Productions & Windowseat Films\n\nSUBSCRIBE\nhttps://bit.ly/stagnansi\n\nFOLLOW\nhttps://instagram.com/stagnansi\nhttps://twitter.com/stagnansi\nhttps://facebook.com/stagnansi\nhttps://pinterest.com/stagnansi",
