            "description": "Amber Heard speaks about her character Mera in Aquaman, how she liked the character cause she is a warrior, independent and leads Aquaman. She also talks about her activism and collaboration with the UN fighting for women.\n\nShe devotes her time off-screen to organizations like Amnesty International and Art of Elysium, and most recently returned from a humanitarian trip to Jordan to visit Syrian refugees with the Syrian American Medical Society (SAMS). Amber is our Human Rights Champion, lending her voice and support to promote the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted 70 years ago.\n\nTom Hiddlestone https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5glR...\n\nI am a journalist from Madrid, Spain, based in Los Angeles. My Celebrity interviews are different from the rest, I try to ask deeper and more fun questions. I hope that the actors feel comfortable with me and open up.\n\n If you are into movies and celebrities and cannot wait to hear good stuff about people like Keanu Reeves, Ben Affleck, Ryan Reynolds, Jeff Bridges, Blake Lively or any other big celebrity stay tuned. \n\nThanks for watching my channel.
