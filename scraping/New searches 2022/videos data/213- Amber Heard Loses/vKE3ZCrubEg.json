I'm Amber Smith. My husband Granger and I live on a little farm in central Texas with lots of animals and our beautiful, super funny kiddos. We have London, Lincoln, River (who is now with Jesus) and Maverick. This channel is a spin off of our family vlog The Smiths. \n\nI started Arise, when we lost our son, to share my feelings of loss, grief, love, hope, parenting and my faith journey along the way. We comb through scripture, I share what the Lord puts on my heart, I answer questions and more. My hope through Arise is that something I say makes you want to seek Jesus. He changed my life and my heart when I was in my 30s and I've been sharing the good news ever since. \n\nLife is hard but God is so good. I pray you are encouraged each week.
