The CSW is an important space to evaluate what has been achieved and to make new commitments in the fight for gender equality. However, for these commitments to be effective it is important that they reflect the real needs of all women and girls. That's why our advocates travel to New York to negotiate for progressive language in the CSW outcome document. In this vlog they tell you all about their experiences.\n\nLearn more about the CSW:\n- CSW Factsheet: http://bit.ly/2Ia7D26\n- So you\u2019re going to the UN \u2013 guide: http://bit.ly/2v0axmj\n- UN Language tool: http://bit.ly/2yvcsAG\n\nWebsite: http://www.choiceforyouth.org\nYou(th)DoIt: https://www.youthdoit.org/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/choiceforyouth/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/CHOICEforYouth",
