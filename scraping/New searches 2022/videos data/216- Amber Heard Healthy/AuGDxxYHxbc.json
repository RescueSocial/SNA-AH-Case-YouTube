            "description": "Listen to Amber O'Hearn, carnivore diet proponent, explain ketosis and the importance of micronutrients for brain development + long-term brain health.\n\n#ketosis #carnivorediet #biohackerslab\n\nIn today's interview, we get a chance to talk about nutritional ketosis from an evolutionary perspective, and we break down all the essential micronutrients needed for a healthy brain. Amber also explains how the bioavailability of these micronutrients is a crucial factor to consider.\n\nIf you know someone who is interested in learning more about ketosis and the key role that micronutrients play in the development of a healthy brain in children, as well as in the long-term maintenance of brain health in adults, this interview is for them.\n\nI enjoyed this interview with Amber as, once again, she shared some of her valuable knowledge. She really got me thinking about the way our brains have evolved and why they thrive on ketones as well as why we need to rethink RDA's given the vastly different types of diets people consume.\n\n\u2705 Check out the episode including all the extra show note links here:\nhttps://www.biohackerslab.com/ep70-amber-o-hearn/\n\n\u2705 Listen to the interview on Apple Podcasts here:\nhttps://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/is-ketosis-good-for-brain-development-long-term-health/id1228136261?i=1000421348925\n\n\u2705 Link to this Youtube Video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuGDxxYHxbc\n\n\u2705 Follow us on Twitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/biohackerslab\n\n\u2705 Follow us on Facebook:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/BiohackersLab\n\n\u2705 Follow us on Instagram:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/biohackers.lab/",
