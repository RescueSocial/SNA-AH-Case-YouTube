Now he has to get the laser out again after things with Amber Heard are no longer blissful. Depp changed the tatoo he has on his knuckles form SLIM to SCUM. SLIM was a refrence to Heard and we're not sure who the SCUM moniker applies to in this particular instance. Heard filed for a divorce from the 53 year old actor in May and she claims that Depp hit her in the face with an iphone.",
