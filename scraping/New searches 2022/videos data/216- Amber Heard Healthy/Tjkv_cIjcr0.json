            "description": "#amberromaniuk, #TheNoSugarcoatingPodcast, #emotionaleating\nAwesome Health podcast - Episode 094\n\nIs there a link between emotional eating and healing yourself? Our guest says yes and has invested years of her life and thousands of dollars uncovering it. \n\nAmber Romaniuk is an emotional eating, digestive and hormone expert who helps professional women achieve optimal health through mindful eating and self-care. Her podcast \u201cThe No Sugarcoating Podcast\u201d has over half a million downloads, over 200 episodes and is listened to in over 82 countries.\n\nAmber overcame her own emotional eating after gaining and losing more than 1000 lbs and spending over $50,000 on binge foods and 5 years balancing her hormones and digestion. She cycled her way through countless fad diets, skipped meals, caloric restrictions and endless workouts in an endless attempt to achieve her ideal weight. Even when she reached the body size she wanted, she couldn't sustain it. And in the process she hurt her body, blowing out her adrenal glands and messing up her hormones.\n\nNow that she overcome those challenges, Amber helps other women avoid the same pitfalls and mistakes she made like self-sabotage through emotional eating.\n\nOn this episode of Awesome Health Podcast, Amber first explains what emotional eating is. She says it is eating for any reason other than physical/nutritional nourishment. This can look like everything from eating a few bites of chocolate because you had a bad day to a full-on eating binge as a way to numb yourself from everyday life. \n\nAmber goes on to share her personal story of this as well as how a difficult breakup led her to understand she needed better ways of coping with stress and had to learn how to fulfill her own emotional needs rather than look for love outside of herself.\n\nShe tells us the breaking point for her and why her cravings were so severe she removed all gluten and sugar from her life (something she doesn't necessarily recommend for everyone). And  once she stopped using food to deal with stress, she took up journaling, meditation, yoga and breath work to take care of herself. She also read more self-help books, especially those on the subject of the connection between our bodies and our mindset.\n\nWe dive deep into those topics, plus some of the more common challenges she sees that hold women back. You'll also hear Amber's suggested first steps you can take if you think you're an emotional eater. Be sure to listen in and hear her answers on episode 94 of Awesome Health Podcast.\n\nInterview Time Stamps:\n0:00 - Intro\n3:23 - What is emotional eating?\n7:47 - Amber's background and how she discovered that she was an emotional eater\n13:45 - What holds a woman back from being transparent about talking about relationships\n16:56 - The Breaking point that caused Amber to change\n21:45 - How Amber figured out how to get out of her emotional eating cycle\n25:32 - How long it took Amber to get out of her binge eating\n27:21 - Break - Shake10\n28:33 - What Amber started to see in other once she figured out how to get out of her own emotional eating cycle\n31:30 - About Amber's Podcast/business\n35:54 - Challenges that women have when trying to get help in this area\n37:25 - Common elements that people have that indicate if you are an emotional eater\n40:30 - First steps that you should take if you struggle with emotional eating\n46:40 - Where to go to learn more about Amber\n\n\nResources\nAmber Romaniuk\u2019s web site https://www.amberapproved.ca\nThe No Sugarcoating Podcast https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-no-sugarcoating-podcast/id1158699464\nAmber Romaniuk on Instagram: https://instagram.com/amberromaniuk\nBIO10 - discount code for her products\nThe Obstacle Is The Way, by Ryan Holiday https://www.amazon.com/Obstacle-Way-Timeless-Turning-Triumph/dp/1591846358\nMasszymes: https://bioptimizers.com/product/masszymes-250-caps/\nP3-OM: https://bioptimizers.com/product/p3om-120-caps/\nAwesome Health Course: https://bioptimizers.com/awesome-health-course/\n\n\nThis video is about Emotional Eating and Healing Yourself with Amber Romaniuk / Awesome Health Podcast",
