            "description": "Supplementing naturally occurring peptides and nutrients helps support your body\u2019s mitochondria. I\u2019m joined by naturopathic doctor, Amber Krogsrud, to talk about how she uses peptides to improve both her and her patient\u2019s overall health.\n\nWhat You Need to Know About the Mitochondria\n\nDr. Amber joins me today to talk about peptides, but before we can talk about them, we need to go back to basics. First, we\u2019re talking about mitochondria: what it is and what role it plays in our bodies.\n\nShe explains how we can support our mitochondria from a cellular level, by supplementing our diets, physical level with diet and exercise, and an external level with outside assistance. Amber shares some tips for how you can improve your diet for optimal health. She says that fasting, or intermittent fasting, is one of the most beneficial ways you can eat.\n\nAmber uses a red light to improve her mitochondria function. The additional benefits of the red light she uses are hair growth and collagen repair.\n\nThe final bit of the mitochondria puzzle is the supplements you can take to support it. Amber loves NAD (Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide), a coenzyme that your body naturally produces. She explains the different ways you can supplement NAD in your wellness routine.\n\nHow to Use Peptides to Support Your Health\n\nPeptides are naturally occurring biological molecules that are found in all living organisms and have a key function in all biological activity. They\u2019re chains of amino acids that form the basis of almost everything our body does, including producing collagen in the skin.\n\nAmber explains the different types of peptides our bodies use to keep them running in good condition. Some peptides are more commonly found in animal products, so vegans and vegetarians may need to supplement these.\n\nAn interesting study about CoQ10, a peptide that helps your cells generate energy, found that women with breast cancer have lower levels of this peptide. Amber explains what these findings show and how these results have shown up in her own medical practice.\n\nOverall, peptides are a fantastic addition to your health. They can promote weight loss, improve collagen production, and benefit your skin and hair health. As Amber says, there really is a peptide for everything!\n\nThe average person will want to use peptides to help encourage their body to produce more themselves. You can expect a monthly investment between $300-400, depending on the peptide combination you use.\n\n\nIn This Episode\n\nWhat the role of mitochondria is in our bodies [3:15]\nWhat lifestyle changes you can make to support your mitochondria [5:30]\nThe benefits of red light therapy [7:20]\nWhy breast cancer patients tend to have lower levels of CoQ10 [11:41]\nDr. Krogsrud\u2019s top peptide recommendations [29:27]\n\n\nLinks & Resources\n\nJoin PeptideRX: Recreate Your Health, Dr. Amber's Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/514496559385295/\n\nFind Dr. Amber Krogsrud Online: https://www.drambernd.com/\n\nFollow Dr. Amber Krogsrud on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/doctorambernd/\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-W8bUg4xyYgRYN-S0EvFvA/featured\n\nIntegrative Health and Hormone Clinic: https://ihhclinic.com/\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drstephaniegray/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/stephaniegraydnp/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/drsbgray\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanie-gray-b4912aa5/\n\nPodcast Production by the team at Counterweight Creative: https://counterweightcreative.co\n\n___________________________________________\n\r\nDISCLAIMER | YOURLONGEVITYBLUEPRINT.COM | DR.
