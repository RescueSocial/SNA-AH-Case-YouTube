            "description": "Podcast Episode 24 with Amber O'Hearn:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpmhlcBY0p8\n\nToday I had the privilege of recording podcast episode number 24 with my guest Amber O\u2019Hearn better known as the ketocarnivore.  She will join me today to talk a little about how the carnivore diet has helped her deal with mental illness \n\nAmber studied Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Toronto. She has published papers in theoretical math, computer science and computational linguistics, cognitive psychology, evolution and ketogenic diets.  After experiencing significant dietary related health issues, Amber got relief through an \u201call meat\u201d or \u201ccarnivore\u201d diet. With many years of experience with this way of eating, she is one of the key figures leading the carnivore movement. \n\nDuring the podcast which will be released December 11th, we talked about the many reasons why the carnivore diet is not to be feared and for many of you may be exactly what you need to heal from many health conditions including that ones that impact our minds.",
