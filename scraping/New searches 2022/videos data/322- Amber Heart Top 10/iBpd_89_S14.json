            "description": "Heartland is a fan\u2019s favorite show that has an immense popularity. It needs a lot of hard work and creativity to create magic on the screen. When we watch the series on the screen it's just a few characters with their dialogues, playing their role. But it's different behind the scenes. To make a certain series or a movie, it requires a big production. There should be talented artists, dedicated crew members, super creative writers to collect the fans globally, and many more. So in today\u2019s video, we will be talking about how the series Heartland is filmed, its production process, and  many more. So if you want to know these behind-the-scenes facts, stay with us till the end.\n\nHeartland has a culture of starting the shoot in early June so the new season premieres in mid-October. The production of season 15 has begun exactly on June 7 so the filming is half completed. Heartland\u2019s production is broken down into periods that are about 15 days long, called blocks, where two episodes are filmed during each block. This is done for the ease of the director. Two different directors shoot in two blocks. #CBCSeries #HeartlandSeason15 #Heartland",
