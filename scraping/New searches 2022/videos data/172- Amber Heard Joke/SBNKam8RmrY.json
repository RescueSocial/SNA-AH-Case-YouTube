They are fine with this, as I helped substantially with the creation of this piece.\n\nBasically, my cats have a tendency to walk across the keyboard of my laptop when I am composing, creating unwanted occurrences that didn't make sense in the piece I was writing. An illogical solution to this problem was to give my cats a piece of their own to write as a collaboration between the three of them. However, whenever I would give them the opportunity to do so, that is when they would stop walking on my keyboard. The piece was eventually finished after 6 weeks or so, but they didn't give it a title as far as I know.\n\nHere are a few impressive things they did while composing this piece: disable the touchpad on my laptop, taught me the keyboard shortcut for system breaks, open the windows calculator, and start some random windows program I've never heard of.\n\nFor more information about this piece, visit my musescore profile at https://musescore.com/user/26797245/sheetmusic",
