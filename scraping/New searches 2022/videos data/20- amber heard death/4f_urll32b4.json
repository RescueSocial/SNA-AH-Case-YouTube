Amber Heard makes her return to the ring after a what has been deemed the greatest title match in Celebrity Women's Wrestling League history.  It was a crushing defeat for Heard when Scarlett Johansson continued her unprecedented run and retained the title.  Amber was on the verge of victory but Scarlett somehow found another gear to finish her off and deliver this celebrity her first loss.  Now it's time to get back and finish what she set out to do.  Amber's opponent will be the imposing and vigorous Debby Ryan.  Ryan is coming off a Tag Team title loss herself and looks to avenge that with a victory against one of the best the league has to offer.\n#wwe 2k celebrity #cwwl rivals #women wrestling #celebrity wwe #women's wrestling match #amber heard #debby ryan #debby ryan wrestling #amber heard wwe2k #wrestling girls",
