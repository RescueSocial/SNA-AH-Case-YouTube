            "description": "Ahead of its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival on Friday, September 18, the first clip from London Fields has been revealed.\n\nLondon Fields unfolds as a pulpy, stylistic, noir mystery set in the not so distant future where the world is in turmoil. Clairvoyant femme fatale Nicola Six (Amber Heard) lives with a dark premonition of her impending murder. She spins a tangled web of deceit and passion, drawing in three uniquely different men played by Billy Bob Thornton, Theo James and Jim Sturgess, one of which she believes to be her killer. Jason Isaacs, Cara Delevingne, and Jaimie Alexander also star. \n\nGrammy and MTV Video Music Award-winning director Mathew Cullen channels the best of Terry Gilliam, Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller in his feature film debut that invites audiences to enter a visually stunning, dystopian world. The film features a pumping soundtrack with music by Toydrum, Grinderman and London Grammar.\n\nReminiscent of films such as Sin City and Pulp Fiction, London Fields explores the themes of love and control in this deadly psycho sexual tale where infatuation has consequences and, in a world dominated by men, Nicola Six holds all the power. Chris Hanley (Spring Breakers, American Psycho), Jordan Gertner and Geyer Kosinski produced the film.\n\nThe film was written by Roberta Hanley and Martin Amis, based on Martin Amis\u2019 best-selling novel.",
