In the previous two seasons, the series has taken some unbelievable twist in its plotline. Like in season 14 we saw ty leaving us and later we saw lou breaking up with mitch.\nSo in today\u2019s video we are going to Talk about amber marshall aka amy\u2019s thought and her reaction when she heard the plot of ty,s death.\nAccording to UPS article in an interview with maclean\u2019s author aaron hutchins, marshall said that she has been asked questions about ty\u2019s death and some fans have even expressed their condolence to ty and texted her to stay strong. So she has a message for all the heartland fans. She wants to make everybody clear and inform that ty is just a fictional character and the actor graham wardle who portrays ty borden is still alive. So there is nothing to worry about. She also explained that she is not wife of wardle in real life, but she admits to be a good friend of wardle. Then hutchin asked her, how was her reaction when she got to know graham had decided to quit the show. She said that she was surprised by his decision and initially thought graham was messing up his own career. But later she realized that Graham was born and raised in a place like Vancouver. Alberta\u2019s heartland lifestyle would have been difficult for him to adapt and also he used to live far from the shooting location, so it was difficult for him to shoot the entire day and then travel back to his home. Also, he had various in his personal life so giving himself more time to explore, she thinks graham did what was best for him. She also said that had she been in graham\u2019s boot, she would have quit the show years ago. From her words, it seems she has empathized with graham\u2019s situation and has respected his decision to quit acting.\n#amyfleming #ambermarshall #heartlandseason15\n\nRelated Searches\nheartland 15 episode 10\nheartland season 15 episode 10\nheartland season 15 behind the scenes\nheartland 15 tim and jessica\nheartland season 15\nheartland amy and ty\nheartland\nheartland george strait\nheartland season 15 episode 1\nheartland i loved her first\nheartland bloopers\nheartland trailer\nheartland 15\nheartland season 1\namy and ty\namy ty heartland\namy ty and horse spartan\namy winehouse\namy winehouse live\namy winehouse back to black\namys bake shop kitchen nightmares\namy winehouse valerie lyrics\namy winehouse you know i'm no good\namy's baking company\namy schumer\namy winehouse rehab\namy park\nty borden in heartland\nty borden\nt borden and peter\nty borden horse riding\nty borden death\nty borden is back\nty borden returning to heartland\nty borden died\nty borden returning to heartland\nty borden and amy fleming\nty borden dies in heartland\nty borden tribute\nty borden returns\nty borden funeral\nty borden edits\namber marshall\namber marshall wedding\namber marshall interview\namber marshall cooking\namber marshall horse riding\namber marshall singing\namber marshall and graham wardle\namber marshall songs\namber marshall house tour\namber marshall ramblin rides\namber marshall movies\namber marshall farm\namber marshall weather report\namber marshall husband\ngraham wardle\ngraham wardle social life\ngraham wardle personal life\ngraham wardle podcast\ngraham wardle interview\ngraham wardle leaving heartland\ngraham wardle and amber marshall\ngraham wardle singing\ngraham wardle wedding\ngraham wardle divorce\ngraham wardle instagram live\ngraham wardle bloopers\ngraham wardle 2021\ngraham wardle podcast youtube",
