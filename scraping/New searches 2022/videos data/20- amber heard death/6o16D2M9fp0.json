            "description": "Things have not gone according to plan for our little chava, Becky G.  The road has been quite bumpy to say the least, but Gomez's perseverance keeps her level headed.  Once again she's faced with a difficult card, facing off against Amber Heard.  Heard is primed for another run to the top, and this time her rival Scarlett Johansson doesn't stand in her way.  Amber was on the verge of ousting Johansson in their CWWL Title Match a few months ago before Scar Jo found another gear.  A lost opportunity for the belt means you need to start again from the bottom.  \"The chance comes at a significant cost\", spoke a somber Amber shortly after losing that night.  Heard's climbed that mountain once before and looks to reach the pinnacle this time around.  A don't know anyone that dismiss that thought.\n#amberheard #beckyg #wwe2k",
