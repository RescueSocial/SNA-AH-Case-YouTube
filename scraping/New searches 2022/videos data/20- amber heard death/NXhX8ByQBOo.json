            "description": "Actors Johnny Depp and Amber Heard are ending their brief marriage of 14 months and it's all gotten very ugly. They met while filming 2011 film The Rum Diary, married in February 2015 and Ms Heard filed for divorce last Monday.\n\nMr Depp, 52, has been accused of domestic violence by Ms Heard, 30, who has been granted a temporary restraining order against him.\n\nThis is Mr Depp's second marriage and Ms Heard's first. Johnny Depp, star of films like Edward Scissorhands and the Pirates of the Caribbean films, was married to make up artist Lori Anne Ellison from 1983 to 1985.\n\nHere is the controversy in 10 points:\n\n1. Johnny Depp and Amber Heard married in a secret civil ceremony at their Los Angeles home on February 4, 2015. They had been engaged since 2012. They met on the sets of The Rum Diary, in which Mr Depp played the lead role of Hunter S Thompson.\n\n2. On May 23, Ms Heard filed for divorce citing 'irreconcilable differences,' days after the death of Mr Depp's mother. A statement on behalf of the Public Enemies star read: \"Given the brevity of this marriage and the most recent and tragic loss of his mother, Johnny will not respond to any of the salacious false stories, gossip, misinformation and lies about his personal life. Hopefully the dissolution of this short marriage will be resolved quickly.\"\n\n3. Later that week, Ms Heard petitioned for - and was granted - a restraining order against her estranged husband, presenting pictures of a bruised face as evidence of alleged domestic abuse on his part. She has accused Mr Depp of throwing a phone at her and pulling her hair. A judge ordered Johnny Depp to stay 100 yards away from Amber Heard, who said she \"lives in fear\" that Mr Depp will return to \"terrorize\" her.\n\n4. Mr Depp's lawyer dismissed Ms Heard's allegations as \"in response to the negative media attention she received earlier this week.\" She also responded to Ms Heard's request for financial support saying that as a \"successful model and actress,\" Amber Heard is capable of earning her own living. There is reportedly no prenuptial agreement in place.\n\n5. Johnny Depp's former partner Vanessa Paradis and their daughter Lily-Rose have both defended him publicly. In a letter accessed by TMZ, Ms Paradis described Ms Heard's allegations as \"outrageous,\" and said that Mr Depp had never been abusive towards her in the 14 years they spent together. Lily-Rose, an actor like her father, posted this on Instagram:\n6. In an op-ed for The Wrap, comedian Doug Stanhope has alleged that Mr Depp was being blackmailed by Ms Heard who allegedly threatened to \"lie about him publicly\" if Mr Depp didn't agree to her terms for separation. \"Johnny got used, manipulated, set up and made to look bad,\" wrote Mr Stanhope.\n\n7. Mr Stanhope's column has been denounced by Ms Heard's lawyer as \"unequivocally false.\"\n\n8. A source close to the couple told People magazine that they should never have married, had always been incompatible and described the relationship as \"non-stop drama.\"\n\n9. The Depp-Heard marriage made headlines last year when the couple illegally took their pet dogs into Australia - where Mr Depp was filming - and were threatened with a 10-year prison sentence. They eventually made a video apology earlier this year.\n\n10. Johnny Depp is currently on tour with his band The Hollywood Vampires. His new film Alice Through The Looking Glass opened last Friday to dismal box office receipts. On Twitter, Amber Heard's supporters have called for a boycott of the film.",
