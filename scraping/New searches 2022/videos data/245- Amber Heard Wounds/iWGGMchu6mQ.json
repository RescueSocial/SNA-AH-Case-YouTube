            "description": "In this video I put my arm and my stomach in a vacuum chamber! This comes after many requests to put myself in the vacuum chamber. First I come up with a way to out my right arm in the vacuum chamber. I could feel the blood being sucked out of my skin. The best way to describe the feeling is if you swing your arm around very quickly around for long time, but much more extreme than that. The atmospheric pressure pushes my arm into the chamber so that I felt like I was having to support a huge amount of weight. Then after my arm, I try it on my stomach. This hurt too, but in a different way. It really stretched out my skin. Then I talk about what would happen to your body if it were exposed to the vacuum of space!\n\nVisit my facebook page at:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/HydraulicPressFunToday/\n\nSend me things to crush at:\nPO Box 482\nNorth Plains OR 97133\n*If you do send me something message me so I know it's coming!\n\nCheckout my science channel: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCA19mAJURyYHbJzhfpqhpCA\n\nFor more awesome videos checkout:\nWhat Happens When You Turn On A Broken Light Bulb In A Vacuum Chamber?
