Martinez\nP-Nut\nTim Mahoney\nChad Sexton\n\nLYRICS:\n\nBrainstorm, take me away from the norm \nI got to tell you something \nThis phenomenon, I had to put it in a song \nAnd it goes like \n\nChorus: \nWhoa, amber is the color of your energy \nWhoa, shades of gold displayed naturally \n\nYou ought to know what brings me here \nYou glide through my head blind to fear \nAnd I know why \n\n(Chorus 2x) \n\nYou live too far away \nYour voice rings like a bell anyway \nDon't give up your independence \nUnless it feels so right \nNothing good comes easily \nSometimes you gotta fight \n\n(Chorus) \n\nLaunched a thousand ships in my heart \nSo easy, still it's fine from afar \nAnd you know that \nWhoa, brainstorm take me away from the norm \nWhoa, I got to tell you something",
