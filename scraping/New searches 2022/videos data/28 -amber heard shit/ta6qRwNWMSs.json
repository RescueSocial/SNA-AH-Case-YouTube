Amber was granted a domestic violence restraining order against Johnny today claiming that the actor has repeatedly abused her throughout their marriage. The last straw was Saturday night when he allegedly smashed his iPhone on her face. Not helping his case is the giant bruise Amber was sporting on the side of her face as she left court today (she looks solemn in the pic above, but she broke down like a baby once she reached her car). From USA Today:\nHeard's filing Friday alleged a history of abuse throughout her relationship with Depp, according to The Associated Press.\n\n\"During the entirety of our relationship, Johnny has been verbally and physically abusive to me,\" Heard wrote. \"I endured excessive emotional, verbal and physical abuse from Johnny, which has included angry, hostile, humiliating and threatening assaults to me whenever I questioned his authority or disagreed with him.\"\n\nHeard said the actor was high and drunk when Saturday's alleged abuse occurred. \"I live in fear that Johnny will return to (our house) unannounced to terrorize me, physically and emotionally,\" Heard wrote in a sworn declaration.\nIn case you're wondering, Amber will be represented by attorney Samantha Spector, while Johnny . . . who was Chris Brown's lawyer again? Seriously, that guy was good. With all the shit he's done, Chris Brown should be panhandling right now to make ends meet. Instead he spits at panhandlers from one of his eight Lamborghinis. Or is it nine?",
