            "description": "The story of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp's relationship is very much a saga. A saga of two people who fell madly in love with one another on the set of a movie, and then became so and towards one another (allegedly...) that a massive divorce happened. End of story? Not so much. Because Amber Heard accused Johnny Depp of, he fought back against that claim, and the next nearly 5 years have been wrapped up in court cases and events that seemingly won't end. It's something that the movies would perfectly break down...and we're going to get that, kind of. We'll break it down for you.\n\nClick HERE To Enter The GIVEAWAY! \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC76r9K-_Knc7d38c9uKRwaw?sub_confirmation=1 \n\nAnd there you have it, everyone!
