At the time he filed a lawsuit that read, \u201cMr. Depp never abused Ms. Heard. Her allegations against him were false when they were made in 2016. They were part of an elaborate hoax to generate positive publicity for Ms. Heard and advance her career.\u201d\n\nIn response to it, Heard\u2019s legal team filed a rebuttal three months after the initial filing and claimed, \u201cThis frivolous action is just the latest of Johnny Depp's repeated efforts to silence Amber Heard. She will not be silenced.\"\n\n\"Mr. Depp's actions prove he is unable to accept the truth of his ongoing abusive behavior. But while he appears hell-bent on achieving self-destruction, we will prevail in defeating this groundless lawsuit and ending the continued vile harassment of my client by Mr. Depp and his legal team.\u201d\n\n\n\n#Short #AhmedShameelNews #AhmedShameel #AShameelK #AhmedShameelK #ASNews #ASEnglishNews #ShameelKhokhar #ShameelKhokharNews #SKNews #SKEnglishNews #ASUrduNews #SKUrduNews #PakistanNews #IslamNews #WorldNews #SportsNews #ASSports #ASSportsNews #LIVE #BreakingNews #Breaking #Latest #LatestNews #Viral #ViralNews \n\nFacebook:\nhttp://fb.com/ahmedshameelk\nTwitter:\nhttp://twitter.com/shameel_khokhar",
