Whether they believe in it or not is a different problem but they do so for some simple reasons. First, the working class doesn\u2019t like it. Second, it hampers the system. And finally, because it\u2019s unlawful. However, have you ever heard of a Prime Ministerial candidate who promises to promote corruption if he wins?\nIt\u2019s a general rule among politicians that whenever they campaign for an election, they promise to weed out corruption. Whether they believe in it or not is a different problem but they do so for some simple reasons. First, the working class doesn\u2019t like it. Second, it hampers the system. And finally, because it\u2019s unlawful. However, have you ever heard of a Prime Ministerial candidate who promises to promote corruption if he wins?\n\nHis party has different agenda from all other parties which believes in slashing defence budget, improving tax system, making judiciary, police and Election Commission of Pakistan free from political influence and interference, fair accountability with special focus on eradication of corruption. Mega projects in health and education sectors are also his party agenda, the chairman says.\nAmber Shahzada is the candidate who knows the art of contesting election with \u2018small amount of money\u2019 which he says is sponsored by his friends and fans on every election, and strongly condemns the purchased-victory and votes. However, he does not know how much expenses incur on his election every year.\nI think that politicians could be corrupt, but only as required and not as they wish. If my government comes into power, I will minimise corruption and legalise it. If someone less corrupt comes into power, the country will progress.\u201d\nShahzada always wears a Turkish-style hat, and sports a handlebar moustache, and is very active on his twitter account. He has announced his plans to contest for NA-125, a constituency for the National Assembly of Pakistan in Lahore. He is up against the major political parties in Pakistan and Maryam Nawaz, former prime minister Nawaz Sharif\u2019s daughter, who will contest as an independent candidate.\n\n\u201cIt is my firm belief that I\u2019ll be victorious when Election Commission will be completely impartial, when the census will be held truly on real grounds, and police will stop interference into political system,\u201d Shehzada speaks, making specific gesture with both his hands\n\nBy: Faisal Anjum Satti",
