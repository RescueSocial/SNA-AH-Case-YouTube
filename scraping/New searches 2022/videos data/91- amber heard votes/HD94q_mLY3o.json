            "description": "This is a sound test of a Durock T1 recolour called the Dark Amber T1 lubed with 204g0 on a OLKB Planck. The other switch compared to the T1 is the Sp-Star Polaris Grey lubed with 204g0. My thoughts on the switch is it is great lubed only. It has a very nice rounded bump, and is noticeable throughout typing. The only reason why it is good lubed only is they have a very large amount of ping in the leaf and spring stock. The stem is very scratchy without lube. The feel is overall great and the sound is wonderful. If you want to hear a full sound test of the Sp-Star Polaris Grey check out my other vid. The spring makes the most noise overall. I swapped the bottom housing and still heard subtle ping.",
