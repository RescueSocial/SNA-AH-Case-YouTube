            "description": "This is a first look only at a new Waterman Car\u00e8ne fountain pen. I do NOT do a writing sample because I am sending the pen back to France to have the nib exchanged to a medium under Waterman's free nib exchange program. However, I do unbox it, talk about the parts and features of the pen, provide some size comparisons and measurements and then talk about what I like about the pen. I also need some feedback on what ink to pair with this pen. I make some suggestions from my ink supplies but feel free to comment and let me know what ink you think I should use. \n\nPlease feel free to use the chapters provided below to skip to various parts of the review.\n\nIf you like this video, don't forget to like and subscribe and hit that bell to be notified when I post new videos!
