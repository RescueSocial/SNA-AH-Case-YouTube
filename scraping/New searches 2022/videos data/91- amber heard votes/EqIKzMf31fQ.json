They've been on the run, but now they're being dragged back to St Vladimir's where the girls must survive a world of forbidden romances, a ruthless social scene and terrifying night time rituals.\n\nCLIPS USED: \nKick-Ass, And Soon The Darkness, All the Boys love Mandy Lane, One Tree Hill, Nikita, Dorian Gray, the Hitcher, the Covenant, Tristan and Isolde, Sky High, The Vampire Diaries (1x01) and a video I found on youtube.\n\nSONGS: \nDoves - There goes the fear\nHammock - Like starlight into day\nThe Glitch Mob - Between two points\n\nVOICEOVERS:\n\"Hey Gorgeous.\" (Rose)\n\"Hoes over Bros.\" (Rose)\n\"Buds over studs.\" (Lissa)\n\"What?\" (Lissa)\n--\n\nhi! \nthank you all very much for voting and helping me to find the perfect dimtri.\nthe votes say this:\nHenry: 11\nLyndsy: 23\nOdette: 13\nBen: 16\nSophia: 6\n\nnow you're probably wondering why I used henry then. it's because he definitely got the looks of dimitri and I wanted the trailer to fit as much as possible. he only has that long hair in tristan and isolde, so there aren't many clips to use for videos. but for the trailer is was enough at least :)\nnext videos will probably change cast everytime.\nfirst one with ben, next one with henry. :P\nthanks again \u2665\n\n#54 - Top Favourited (Today) - Germany\n#21 - Top Favourited (Today) - Entertainment - Germany\n#47 - Top Rated (Today) - Entertainment - Germany\n#54 - Top Favourited (This Week) - Entertainment - Germany",
