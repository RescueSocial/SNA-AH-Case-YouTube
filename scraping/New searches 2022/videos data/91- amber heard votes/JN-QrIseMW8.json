            "description": "It came as a surprise to many that foreign governments may be influencing U.S. elections by manipulating social media. Yet, cypherpunks and national security experts alike have long warned of the increasing use of cyberspace as an extension of nation-state politics. In parallel, tech startups that that moved fast, broke things, and pledged to \"do no evil\" have turned into systemically important parts of social, political, and commercial infrastructure that cross global jurisdictions. \n\nIn this frank discussion, Clovyr Co-founder & CEO Amber Baldet looks at how new technologies at the intersection of cryptography and distributed systems are helping us push back against the ongoing aggregation of data in the hands of a few, dissect why prior efforts to check such power accumulation failed, and see how this all intersects with the next generation of enterprise infrastructure.\n\nAbout SXSW:\nSXSW dedicates itself to helping creative people achieve their goals. Founded in 1987, SXSW is best known for its conference and festivals that celebrate the convergence of the interactive, film, and music industries. An essential destination for global professionals, the event features sessions, showcases, screenings, exhibitions, and a variety of networking opportunities. SXSW proves that the most unexpected discoveries happen when diverse topics and people come together. SXSW 2019 takes place every March in Austin, Texas.\n\nSubscribe: http://www.youtube.com/user/sxsw?sub_confirmation=1\n\nConnect with SXSW:\nWebsite: https://www.sxsw.com\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/SXSWFestival/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/sxsw\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/sxsw/\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/sxsw",
