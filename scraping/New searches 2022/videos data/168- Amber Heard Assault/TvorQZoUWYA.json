            "description": "In court documents, where she details the alleged violence during their 15-month marriage, Heard said she 'lived in fear' of the Pirates of the Caribbean star and the idea he could return to the L.A. condominium they shared to 'terrorize me physically and emotionally.' In the papers she said she was attacked by Depp last Saturday, when he allegedly threw an iPhone off her face. She took a selfie of the bruises she claims were as a result of the attack (left), which shows inflammation and redness on her right cheek around her eye. Heard looked stoic as she left the courthouse on Friday, dressed down in a black dress and wearing no make-up. The bruise that she alleges was the result of Depp's attack could still be seen on her face (right), but the mark appears to be much lower down on her cheek than one she filed as evidence of abuse. It is not clear whether the bruise seen on her face on Friday was a result of last Saturday's attack.",
