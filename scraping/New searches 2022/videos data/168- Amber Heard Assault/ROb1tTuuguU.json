In the beginning of the game, players create their custom characters and choose from four classes, each of them has unique abilities that the players can utilize. The four classes include Trickster, which has the ability to manipulate time, the Pyromancer, which can manipulate fire, the Devastator, which can unleash seismic attacks, and the Technomancer.
