This is called a binaural beat.\n\nHere\u2019s an example:\n\nLet\u2019s say you\u2019re listening to a sound in your left ear that\u2019s at a frequency of 132 Hertz (Hz). And in your right ear, you\u2019re listening to a sound that\u2019s at a frequency of 121 Hz. Your brain, however, gradually falls into synchrony with the difference \u2014 or 11 Hz. Instead of hearing two different tones, you instead hear a tone at 11 Hz (in addition to the two tones given to each ear).\n\nBinaural beats are considered auditory illusions. For a binaural beat to work, the two tones have to have frequencies\u00a0less than 1000 HzTrusted Source, and the difference between the two tones can\u2019t be more than 30 Hz. The tones also have to be listened to separately, one through each ear. Binaural beats have been explored in music and are sometimes used to help tune instruments, such as pianos and organs. More recently, they have been connected to potential health benefits.\n\nWhat health benefits are binaural beats claimed to have?\n\nBinaural beats are claimed to induce the same mental state associated with a meditation practice, but much more quickly. In effect, binaural beats are said to:\n\nreduce anxiety\n\nincrease focus and concentration\n\nlower stress\n\nincrease relaxation\n\nfoster positive moods\n\npromote creativity\n\n\nBinaural beats in the\u00a0delta\u00a0(1 to 4 Hz) range\u00a0ve been associatedTrusted Source\u00a0with deep sleep and relaxation.\n\nBinaural beats in the\u00a0theta\u00a0(4 to 8 Hz) range are linked to REM sleep, reduced anxiety, relaxation, as well as meditative and creative states.\n\nBinaural beats in the\u00a0alpha\u00a0frequencies (8 to 13 Hz)\u00a0are thought to encourageTrusted Source\u00a0relaxation, promote positivity, and decrease anxiety.\n\nBinaural beats in the lower\u00a0beta\u00a0frequencies (14 to 30 Hz)\u00a0have been linkedTrusted Source\u00a0to increased concentration and alertness, problem solving, and improved memory.\n\nFind a comfortable place free of distractions. Simply listen to the binaural beat audio for at least 30 minutes each day in your headphones to make sure that the rhythm is entrained (has fallen into synchronization) throughout the brain.\n\nYou can experiment with the length of time you listen to the binaural beats to find out what works for you. For example, if you\u2019re experiencing high levels of anxiety or stress, you may want to listen to the audio for a full hour or longer. Remember, you must use headphones for binaural beats to work. You may also want to listen with your eyes closed",
