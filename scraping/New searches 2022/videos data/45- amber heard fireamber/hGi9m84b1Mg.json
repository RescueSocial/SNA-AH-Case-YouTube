            "description": "As you all remember, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard\u2019s divorce has not ended with its finalization back in 2017. As a matter of fact, it\u2019s continued on up until today, with all the court cases Johnny has filed against Amber\u2019s team, and even against news outlets, for putting his name on the bad side of the spotlight. When Amber Heard filed for divorce, it did not revolve around your usual divorce cases, it surpassed that and she accused his former husband of hurting her, which Johnny has denied countless times.   And you might think this lost case with a news publisher did not cost him much aside from his reputation, but you\u2019d be mistaken. When you are a public figure, you need to care A LOT about your image, and for Johnny, this lost case has somehow given other people, especially Amber\u2019s team, an advantage and a reason for people to believe Amber regarding her allegations. For decades now, Johnny has been considered one of the most versatile actors in the industry, and he seems to still be at the top of his game as he starred in high-grossing films such as Fantastic Beasts and Pirates of the Caribbean, but unfortunately, these roles were cut from him when he lost the libel case against The Sun, as a result of course due to his post-marriage dispute with Amber Heard. \n\nFollowing his lost libel case, Johnny Depp was fired from reprising his iconic role as Grindelwald in the critically acclaimed film series Fantastic Beasts. It is no question that the movie series has gained a lot of commercial attention after its initial release. Many fans take a look at Johnny Depp and immediately recognize him as Jack Sparrow, probably his most iconic role yet. People loved Pirates of the Caribbean, specifically, Jack Sparrow, and fans, Disney followers or not, have followed the series from its first movie up until its fifth. And admit it, you just couldn\u2019t imagine Pirates of the Caribbean without Johnny Depp to play as Jack Sparrow in it. It\u2019s just absurd to not see him in the franchise. However, sadly enough for fans, the sixth movie of the said series will not be including our favorite Jack Sparrow, much to fans\u2019 dismay. But how did it end up this way? Why won\u2019t Disney recast Johnny Depp despite Warner Brothers sticking with Amber Heard? Let\u2019s find out in this video, but before that, make sure to subscribe and hit that notification bell first for more updates. Let\u2019s dig in!\n\nPirates of the Caribbean is unarguably one of Disney's most popular, and profitable, live-action franchises that did not stem from a classic animated film, with a multi-billion dollar gross. While the fifth movie in the series, Dead Men Tell No Tales, didn't light up the domestic box office the way previous films did, the movie still made nearly $800 million globally, and that's not the sort of money you would ever expect Disney to just forget about. Now, there have been rumors that there will be a sixth Pirates of the Caribbean movie, however, there are no clear details yet about what this movie will be about. But, despite the vagueness of the details on the next Pirates movie, one thing\u2019s already for sure\u2026 we won\u2019t be seeing Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow. We know what you're thinking, absurd, right? What\u2019s the point of Pirates of the Caribbean without Johnny Depp? Since he introduced Captain Jack Sparrow to the world, the character and the film series have been one and the same. \n\nThen there was evidence of her having affairs with an actor and a multi-billionaire, James Franco and Elon Musk. And there was also a phone record where Amber admitted that she hurt him. But what made most people very upset was the fact that Johnny Depp was forced to step down from his roles in Fantastic Beasts, and probably a sixth Pirates movie, while Amber happily and freely trains for her role as Queen Mera in Aquaman 2. \n\nIn 2018, Disney production chief Sean Bailey confirmed that Depp was no longer a part of the Pirates franchise.\n\nIt is indeed evident that this saga between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard has caused some riff-raff in his career, as just a few years ago, Johnny was one of the highest-paid actors in the industry, but now, his cases have made him somehow seem less attractive at the box office. But sure enough, if this court case goes well for him and his team, then we hope for sure that he might be able to reprise his roles in Pirates of the Caribbean and even in Fantastic Beasts, if there will be future sequels to come. That\u2019s all for today, we hope you enjoyed that video and we will see you in the next one.
