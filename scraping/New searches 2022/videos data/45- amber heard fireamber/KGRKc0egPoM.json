Now don't judge her to harshly, after all \"no matter how flat a pancake is, it still has two sides.\" Maybe, just maybe there is some good in her. Stick around to the very end to hear what that \"good\" could possibly be. \n\nA big shoutout goes to Savvy? on Twitter who created the posts about Johnny and allowed me to share them here. Please visit her Twitter page to see more.\n\n(Post note: This channel is more about self-help/self-growth then Johnny Depp and I just wanted to let my loyal followers know that I haven't forgotten my roots and I am returning to that format soon and will be doing weekly videos called \"Morning Motivation\" starting soon.)",
