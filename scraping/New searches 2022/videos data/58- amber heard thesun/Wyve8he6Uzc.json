            "description": "JOHNNY DEPP's Former Bodyguard Revealed Shocking Things About AMBER HEARD\n______________________________________________\nFor more videos subscribe : https://bit.ly/2zoPgqj\n______________________________________________\nJohnny Depp and Amber Heard's bodyguard has revealed what really happened during the former couple's ill-fated trip to Australia, claiming the Hollywood heavyweight was never aggressive towards his ex-wife.\n \nRick Wood was head of security at the Gold Coast mansion where the couple stayed in 2015 while the actor was filming Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales. Mr Wood claims he never thought 57-year-old Depp was capable of the abuse he has been accused of.\n\n'I couldn't see it in him. In my industry, you know who's a wife beater and who's not.' the security guard told 9News. \n \nIn fact, Mr Wood said Depp displayed great patience with his wife, who he described as a 'button pusher'. 'I hate to say it, but she stirs the pot,' Mr Wood revealed.\n\nHe recalled Heard pretending to pack her bags and insisting that she would leave the property when the couple got into arguments.\n\n'She made up this big drama that she was leaving... Taxis would turn up and we'd have to turn them away,' Mr Wood said. 'And then we'd pick up the suitcases and they were empty. Nothing in them at all. It was all for drama.'\n\nDepp would stay calm during these encounters, Mr Wood said, and would eventually coax Heard back into the home. Mr Wood said he never saw Depp taking drugs or drinking copious amounts of alcohol during his time in Australia.\n\nTheir stay in Australia has been rehashed during court proceedings in London, where Depp is suing The Sun newspaper over a 2018 story labelling him a 'wife beater' during his five-year relationship with Heard.\n\nJohnny Depp\u2019s security officer Sean Bett had also alleged that actress Amber Heard physically abused Depp during their marriage. in his witness statement, which was presented to the court, Bett said he headed to the couple's home in Los Angeles on the night of Heard's 30th birthday party on April 21 2016. He said Depp was \"sober, lucid\" and added the actor had \"expressed his concern to us about how Ms Heard might behave, the situation before it escalated further,\u201d he said.\n\nHe stated: \"She did not call me or fellow security guard Mr Judge and the only reason why we entered the Penthouse 3 was because we had heard these screams.\n\n\"When we entered, we saw Mr Depp standing approximately 20 feet away from Ms Heard, who was standing by the couch.\n\n\"As soon as Ms Heard noticed that we had entered the room, she looked very surprised; her demeanour then changed and she pointed at Mr Depp and screamed to us words to the effect of: 'If he hits me one more time, I am calling the police.'\n\nMr Bett went on to say: \u201cI have quite good eyesight. I was able to see that Ms Heard was wearing little or no make-up, her skin was quite pale and she had no red marks or evidence of any bruises or abrasions to her face or body.\n\n\u201cI could see Mr Depp was visibly upset at having been accused of hitting Ms Heard. However, he never came closer than 20 feet to her during the time I was able to observe them.\n\n\u201cI did not notice any smashed glass or broken bottles in the apartment at the time.\u201d\n\nMr Bett claimed he, Mr Depp and Mr Judge agreed that the actor should leave the building \u201cdue to the fact that the situation had escalated and Ms Heard was hysterically shouting at Mr Depp and making allegations about his behaviour\u201d.\n\nIt pretty surprising Judge couldn\u2019t see these things, which clearly shows that Amber Heard was the abuser.
