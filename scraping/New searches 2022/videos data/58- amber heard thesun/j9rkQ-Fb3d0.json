            "description": "Johnny Depp and Amber Heard were pictured arriving at the High Court today as his libel case against The Sun begins. \u00a0Depp, 57, is suing The Sun\u2019s publisher News Group Newspapers and executive editor Dan Wootton over an April 2018 column that called him a \"wife beater\". \u00a0News Group Newspapers attempted to have the case thrown out, but Mr Justice Nichol ruled last week that the High Court case would go ahead. \u00a0Depp has vehemently denied the allegations. \u00a0The Sun's April 2018 article related to claims made by Depp's former wife Amber Heard, 34, who was married to the Pirates of the Caribbean actor from 2015 to 2017.  Read More Related Articles  Read More Related Articles  \u00a0Depp's former girlfriends Vanessa Paradis and Winona Ryder, who have both strenuously defended Depp's character, are expected to give evidence via video link. \u00a0The trial is expected to last three weeks. \u00a0Depp's lawyers will seek to prove the Sun's allegations are not true and amount to \"serious harm\" as defined in the Defamation Act 2013.  \u00a0In an April 2018 column, The Sun's executive editor Dan Wootton asked how Harry Potter author JK Rowling could be \"genuinely happy\" Depp had been cast in the latest film in the Fantastic Beasts spin-off franchise in light of the allegations by Heard. \u00a0The Hollywood actor denies ever having been violent to Heard, and claims the article included quotes from alleged victims of disgraced film producer Harvey Weinstein in order to \"finish his career\" by linking the allegations against him to the #MeToo and Time's Up movements.  \u00a0NGN is defending the article as true and says Depp was \"controlling and verbally and physically abusive towards Heard, particularly when he was under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs\" between early 2013 and May 2016, when the couple split. \u00a0The publisher relies on 14 alleged incidents of domestic violence, including what Heard describes as a \"three-day hostage situation\" in Australia in March 2015 when Depp lost the tip of his middle finger in disputed circumstances.",
