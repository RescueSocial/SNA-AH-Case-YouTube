            "description": "Amber Heard and Johnny Depp have been the apple of the eye for news for years as a result of their messy split. The couple who just stayed married for 15 months had a tumultuous relationship battle with many legal ups and downs. In this battle, Depp recently lost a request to appeal the decision of his libel case against The Sun, and now Heard's legal team has responded to the latest turn of events. What ist with Johnny Depp appeal?\nSo guys, our favourite Pirate of the Caribbean Jack Sparrow, and Amber Heard are under a public legal battle for a long time. This all started when a U.K Publication The Sun, who covered the couple\u2019s split referred to the Oscar nominated hero as \u2018wife beater\u2019. This caused a great loss to Depp and he had to step down as our favourite character of Captain Jack Sparrow and now is also being replaced in Fantastic Beast 3. He tried to appeal his loss in court but sadly in a recent court hearing, Jack lost.\nAfter winning the court, the legal team of Princess of Atlantis spoke in response to the latest Victory, reading \n\u2018We are pleased \u2014 but by no means surprised \u2014 by the Court's denial of Mr. Depp\u2019s application for appeal. The evidence presented in the UK case was overwhelming and undeniable. \n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\nAbout MOVIE KING:\nHey everyone, welcome to our MOVIE KING YouTube channel.\nOn this channel we show exciting insights about the Tea Spill with all the Celebrity News and their Drama.\n\nYou also will find stunning entertainment about the the Hollywood Life and the Showbiz.\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\nPlease do like this video to help me keep growing and subscribe to my channel that helps me in ways I can't even explain.
