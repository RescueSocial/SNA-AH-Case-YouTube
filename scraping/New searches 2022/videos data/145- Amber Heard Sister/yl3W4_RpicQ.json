            "description": "Johnny Depp has shocked Sasha Wass QC, the legal repressive for The Sun by serving new evidence on her overnight in the three-week long libel High Court case.  Depp, is determined to clear his name after The Sun branded him a 'wife beater' following accusations by his ex Amber Heard that he was violent towards her 14 times during their relationship.  He categorically denies the allegations.  Speaking in court on day nine of the trial, Wass said that the new evidence served by Depp's lawyers includes videos and screenshots.  She has asked the judge for time to evaluate it before it should be allowed in the hearing.  Over the past week and a half, the world has been shocked as the full details of Depp and Heard's turbulent relationship have been laid bare.

On day eight of the trial Depp confirmed the multi-million divorce deal he had reached with the actress after their marriage broke down.  The Pirates of the Caribbean actor paid Heard $7million (\u00a35.5million) as well as her $525,000 (\u00a3418,000) legal costs.  Depp also wrote of \"liabilities\" incurred during their marriage.

The court was also shown an image of Depp sporting a red mark around his eye - which his team claim was caused by Heard.  The image had been dated and time stamped by the device that took it as March 23, 2015, 11:37am.  The location reads \"West Hollywood - Sunset Strip\".  Depp's Head of Security guard Sean Bett, who has worked for the Pirates of the Caribbean actor for nine years, claimed in his witness statement that the injury was caused by Heard in April 2016 following her 30th birthday party.   \u00a0 However, Sasha Wass QC acting on behalf of The Sun has claimed to the courts the image was in March 2015.  She added that the date in question is when Heard has already admitted she attacked Depp in defence of her sister Whitney.  Heard has previously admitted to hitting Depp in the face - claiming she did it in defence of Whitney during a row on the landing between two staircases in their LA home.  Heard said she feared Depp might push her sister to strike out.   \u00a0 Cross-examining Bett in court on day eight of the trial, Wass said: \"This is a picture from March 2015 in which she (Heard) admits she punched Mr Depp in defence of her sister.  \"This is the only photo of Mr Depp with a visible injury.  \"You are suggesting that this injury is in relation to an incident that took place more than a year later.\"  Bett went on to claim he had 'become confused' because it was \"similar to one he took on his own phone following a fight in April 2016\".",
