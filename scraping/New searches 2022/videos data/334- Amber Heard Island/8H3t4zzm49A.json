            "description": "Amber Gill playfully lamented her life as a singleton on Wednesday, when she complained about not having anybody to chat with on FaceTime.The Love Island winner, 22, is currently soaking up the sunshine on the Caribbean island of Tobago with her sister Lauren, but took to her Instagram Stories to suggest she'd have been happier if she had a man at home waiting for her.As bikini-clad Amber enjoyed a quiet boat ride, she shared footage of her sister enjoying a video call, before panning back to her own face in a clip captioned: 'When everyone's FaceTiming and you have nobody to FaceTime.'   Wearing a flattering turquoise bikini, the Geordie beauty \u2013 whose father's side of her family hails from Trinidad and Tobago \u2013 pulled a series of comedic facial expressions as she stood in complete silence. Amber rose to prominence when she was crowned the winner of Love Island last year alongside Greg O' Shea, but the couple split just weeks after leaving the villa.\u00a0Last week, it was claimed that she was dating\u00a0Chelsea and England footballer\u00a0 Fikayo Tomori, after she was seen leaving flirty comments on his Instagram.  The former beauty therapist is said to have been on a string of dates with\u00a0Fikayo in London and he has already reportedly met some of her close friends.The pair set tongues wagging last Thursday, after Amber left a suggestive comment on one of his social media snaps after her 'liked' one of her bikini photos.A friend of Amber's told the Sun: 'They've been on two dates in as many weeks in London... They've been chatting for quite a while now but only recently met properly.\u00a0'The fact she has posted a public display of affection, by flirting on Instagram, is a good sign too. She's not usually one to show her feelings so quickly.'  This comes after cheeky Amber commented 'drip drip,' to which the footballer replied 'don't drown'\u00a0under a photo Fikayo shared of himself sitting in a flash car.'Surely you guys should couple up,' commented one excited fan.\u00a0However, Amber has since insisted that the pair are just friends.Amber has been unlucky in love since winning the 2019 series of Love Island with her then beau Greg O'Shea, only for the couple to split weeks after they left the villa.\u00a0Greg entered the villa as a late arrival and immediately caught Amber's eye, as she ultimately decided to couple up with him rather than Michael Griffiths.  However it was a short lived romance for the pair, as Greg ditched Amber via text citing the distance between them as the reason behind their split.Elsewhere, Michael recently sparked dating rumours with her close friend Ellie Brown.During an appearance on Under the Duvet with VOXI, Amber chatted with her pal Anna Vakili about romances after the show, but remained tight-lipped about Michael and Ellie.During the chat - which also included Amy Hart - Anna asked if Michael, 28, was 'with' Ellie, 21, saying that she was confused.  Amy then said she thought they had split and Anna added: 'Well I heard otherwise. Ellie used t",
