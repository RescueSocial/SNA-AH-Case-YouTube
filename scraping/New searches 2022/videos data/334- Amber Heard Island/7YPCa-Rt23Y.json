Now you\u2019ve been in it, it\u2019s different, you see it all.'\u00a0During their appearance, the girls also spoke about the advice they would give to any islanders.\u00a0\u00a0  Amber said: 'What I would do differently if I could turn back time, don\u2019t take everything to heart or too seriously.\u00a0'Take it more lighthearted and fun. I kept it real, I am not sure if that is a good or bad thing.'Yewande added: 'Just enjoy it, everyone said to me, enjoy it, I didn\u2019t understand. When you come out, you realise I\u2019ve had the most amazing experience not everyone gets to have. Enjoy each day, be happy and just enjoy.'   Amber, who shortly split from Greg O'Shea after winning the show, concluded: 'Just keep it real, always be yourself. Stay true to yourself, don\u2019t be hung up on winning, just stick to what feels right.'\u00a0The trio's appearance comes after Caroline pleaded not guilty to assaulting her boyfriend, 27, at Highbury Magistrates' Court on Monday.\u00a0Caroline and her partner were both allegedly covered in blood when police arrived at their flat in Islington, North London, on December 12 - with one officer describing the chaotic scene as 'like a horror movie'.   On Monday she pleaded not guilty to common assault and was released on bail until her trial in March but is not allowed to contact Lewis.\u00a0The presenter was accused of 'going mad' and smashing a glass after looking at texts which made her think Lewis was cheating - with him saying in a 999 call that she 'tried to kill me, mate', Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court heard.Lewis was said to have been 'almost begging the operator to send help' with his face 'covered in blood', while Caroline - who has now been replaced as Love Island host by Laura Whitmore - allegedly had two cuts to her wrist.\u00a0\u00a0After being taken into custody, ITV host Caroline - whom the court heard was 'manipulative' towards Lewis and accused him of ruining her life - allegedly flipped over a table and had to be restrained on the ground by police.\u00a0\u00a0In the wake of the drama, Caroline stepped down from her hosting duties and Laura Whitmore was announced as her replacement.",
