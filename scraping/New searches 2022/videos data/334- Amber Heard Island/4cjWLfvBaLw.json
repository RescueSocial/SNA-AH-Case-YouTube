            "description": "Q&A with director Robert Edwards\n\nAfter one too many big city problems, Jude (Amber Heard) heads to the Hamptons home of her father (Christopher Walken), an over-the-hill crooner desperately charting his musical comeback. She soon recalls that spending time at home with her father presents its own particular set of challenges. Writer-director Robert Edwards (Land of the Blind) perfectly captures the inner turmoil of an aspiring artist through his characterization of Jude and Robert, demonstrating that ambition isn\u2019t enough to get what you want. Amber Heard commands the screen as a charming singer-songwriter who temporarily retires her rose-colored glasses for rose-colored hair. \u2014Ashley Havey, Tribeca Film Festival",
