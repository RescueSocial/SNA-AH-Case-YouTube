If I don't, well my home can no long move.\n\nProject Amber Merch:\nhttps://projectamber.creator-spring.com\n\nFind most parts, items & accesories I've used in videos on my\nAmazon Store:\nhttps://www.amazon.co.uk/shop/projectamber\nYou can also follow on:\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/project.amber/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/ProjectAmber25.Vanlife/\n\nWant to help support the channel?:\nPatreon: Project.Amber\nhttps://www.patreon.com/Projectamber\n\n\n#engineswap #willitrun #vanlife",
