We started this project in June 2019, with the intention of providing ourselves a reference for American English pronunciation. American pronunciation is one of the world\u2019s most widely used. Our mission is one of confidence; to give our subscribers of all backgrounds the ability to be confident communicators on demand. At the moment, our pronunciation practice style involves us saying the word, then giving subscribers time to repeat the word aloud. This repetitive approach is believed to shorten the learning curve of subscribers whose goal is to speak English like a native. We aim to provide clear and accurate pronunciation of words that new English speakers commonly struggle with. We also strive to remain abreast of words that appear in the latest trending issues.\n\n******************************************\n\nWatch popular videos from School of Pronunciation:\nCovid-19 words https://bit.ly/34aR7u7\nBusiness words https://bit.ly/2UC4RuU\nFood words https://bit.ly/2UEM2Ho\n\n******************************************\n\nThank You For Watching\n\n How to pronounce Amber Heard  \nC\u00f3mo pronunciar Amber Heard \nComo pronunciar Amber Heard \nCara mengucapkan Amber Heard \n\u041a\u0430\u043a \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0437\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f Amber Heard \nComment prononcer Amber Heard \nWie man Amber Heard ausspricht\n  Amber Heard \u5982\u4f55\u767c\u97f3\n  Amber Heard \u0643\u064a\u0641 \u062a\u0646\u0637\u0642\n  Amber Heard \u306e\u767a\u97f3\u306e\u4ed5\u65b9\n  Amber Heard \uc744 \ubc1c\uc74c\ud558\ub294 \ubc95\n\n#AmericanEnglishPronunciation #Vocabulary #SchoolOfPronunciation",
