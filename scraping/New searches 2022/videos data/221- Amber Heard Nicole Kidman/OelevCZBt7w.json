            "description": "\u2018Aquaman\u2019 directed by James Wan and starring Jason Momoa, Amber Heard, Nicole Kidman, Patrick Wilson, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Willem Dafoe, Dolph Lundgren and Randall Park. Entertainment Weekly released new images from the set of the film and two Aquaman specific covers. The first cover has Momoa looking into camera in a close up dripping wet and the other cover has Amber Heard as Mera, Momoa, and the first look of Nicole Kidman as Queen Atlanna. The magazine also released 7 new images from the movie and from the set. They range from Abdul-Mateen II as Black Manta looking at his helmet to Momoa and Heard on land looking at ruins to a shot of Kidman holding a young version of Arthur Curry as the sun shines behind her to the first look at Patrick Wilson as King Orm about to do battle possibly with Momoa. A trailer was supposedly screened earlier this week at CineEurope that received some raves.\n\nJohn Rocha and Perri Nemiroff are here to give you their thoughts about these images and if they think the look of them previews an Aquaman film that is more practical effects rather than CGI. They also reveal which of the images stands out the most to them and why. Let us know what you thought about these images in the COMMENTS section below.
