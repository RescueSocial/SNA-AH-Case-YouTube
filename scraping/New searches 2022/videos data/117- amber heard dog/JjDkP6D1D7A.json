            "description": "The dog days aren't over \u2013 yet. Johnny Depp's wife Amber Heard's Australian court hearing over charges that she illegally brought the couple's two dogs into the country has been adjourned until November, the Associated Press reports.\n\nThe actress was summoned to the Southport Magistrates Court in Queensland on Monday to answer for the charges that she illegally imported the dogs \u2013 terriers Boo and Pistol \u2013 and produced a false document in May.\n\nHeard did not appear on Monday, and the case was adjourned until Nov. 2, according to the BBC.\n\nThe star, 29, faces a possible 10-year jail term or large fine come November. Depp, however, has not been charged in the case. Australia's strict quarantine laws have been set to prevent diseases from entering the island nation, according to the BBC.\n\nThe legal debacle began back in April, when it was discovered that the couple allegedly failed to declare the animals to customs authorities when they arrived for Depp to film the new Pirates of the Caribbean film. The dogs' presence was discovered by Australian authorities after a dog groomer posted photos of the pups on Facebook.\n\nAustralia's Agriculture Minister Barnaby Joyce gave the pair 72 hours to return the dogs to the U.S., and threatened to euthanize the animals if Depp and Heard didn't comply with the orders.",
