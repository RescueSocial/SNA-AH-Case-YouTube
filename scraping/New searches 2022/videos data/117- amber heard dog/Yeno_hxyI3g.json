No,\u201d he said. \u201cEven I could have done it a little bit better than that. Do it again, Johnny. Do it with gusto, mate! A little gusto, come on.\u201d\n\nJoyce infamously threatened to euthanize Depp and Heard\u2019s dogs,Yorkshire terriers Pistol and Boo, when he learned that the couple brought them Down Under without authorization.\n\nIn the bizarre 42-second snippet, Heard, 29, and her husband speak to the camera, touting the importance of declaring all animals upon entering the country. In addition to urging others to respect Australia's biosecurity laws, Depp dryly described Australians as \u201cboth warm and direct,\u201d adding: \u201cIf you disrespect Australian law, they will tell you firmly.\"",
