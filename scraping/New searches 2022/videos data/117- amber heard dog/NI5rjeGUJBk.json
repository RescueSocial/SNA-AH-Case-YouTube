            "description": "Hollywood actor Johnny Depp has joked about leaving a poo outside his ex-wife Amber Heard's bedroom door.  \u00a0The 57-year-old celebrity is at court for the second day giving evidence as part of his libel case against News Group Newspapers. \u00a0Depp is suing NGN after a story The Sun article branded him a \"wife beater\" in 2018 - a claim which he denies. \u00a0During his testimony at London's High Court today, Sasha Wass QC, for NGN read out an array of Depp's texts. \u00a0She referred to a message he sent his former assistant Stephen Deuters in 2013, which joked about him leaving a poo outside of Heard's door.   \u00a0She asked the actor: \"Can I ask you about another joke you cracked with Mr Deuters on October 11. \u00a0\"It's you saying will you squat in front of the door to the master bedroom and leave a master coil of dookie so Amber steps in it thinking one of the dogs has a major problem. It will be funny.'' \u00a0Depp claimed his message was an example of his \"lavatorial, childish\" sense of humour. \u00a0At court yesterday Depp claimed he decided to end his marriage after he found a poo in his bed.   \u00a0Depp's legal team told the court: \"Depp who in the end was forced to finally call time on this relationship, largely after behaviour by her and her friends following her birthday party in their flat in April 2016... \u00a0\"(Including he says, one of them defecating on his bed, something which Ms Heard blames on their tiny dog).\" \u00a0Depp's witness statement claimed that Heard told their building manager the poo incident was a \"harmless prank\".  \u00a0He said in his own words: \"I understand that the following morning [after the party] Ms Heard (or possibly one of her friends) defecated in our shared bed. \u00a0\"On 12 May 2016, Ms Heard confessed to our estate manager, Kevin Murphy, that leaving the faeces in the bed had been ''just a harmless prank\" thereby effectively acknowledging that she had been responsible, whereas she had previously sought to blame our dogs.\"",
