            "description": "Actress Amber Heard has avoided a conviction for illegally taking her dogs into Australia.\n\nMs Heard, married to actor Johnny Depp, had pleaded guilty in court to making a false statement on her immigration card about the couple's Yorkshire terriers.\n\nBut the Queensland judge gave her a one-month good behaviour bond with no conviction recorded. If she breaks the bond she must pay A$1,000 ($770; \u00a3540).\n\nThe authorities also released an unusual video apology from the couple.\n\nIn the video, which was shown in court and made public by the Department of Agriculture, the couple expressed remorse and advised travellers to respect Australian quarantine laws.\n\n\nMs Heard and Mr Depp both attended Southport Magistrate's Court in Queensland state, amid a media scrum.\n\nHer guilty plea meant Mr Depp was excused from giving evidence to the court.\n\nTwo illegal importation charges against her were dropped earlier.\n\nThey had carried a maximum penalty of 10 years in jail or fines of up to A$265,000.\nMs Heard brought the dogs, Pistol and Boo, to Queensland in a private jet in May 2015 to visit Mr Depp, who was filming Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales.\nThe dogs' presence in the country was noticed after a local dog groomer posted a photo of them on social media.\n\nMs Heard, 29, had pleaded guilty to declaring \"No\" on her immigration card under the section asking if she was bringing anything, including animals, into the country.\n\nHer lawyer argued that the actress had done so because she thought Mr Depp's assistants had already sorted out the dogs' travel documents.\n\nThe dogs were quickly taken out of the country and Ms Heard vowed never to return to Australia.",
