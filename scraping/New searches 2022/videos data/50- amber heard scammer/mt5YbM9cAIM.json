Sometimes things are so heinous and nightmarish, that coping mechanisms have been known to include dark humor. Hence, this video.\nI make no money doing these videos, it's a labor of love and to help others.\nI have followed Amber Heard and Johnny Depp's abuse allegation scandal, which I've affectionately dubbed the Song that Never Ends.  There is a plethora of information about  this dating back to 2016 until now.   I encourage all of you to read it and form your own views, but my strong stance has always been that Johnny Depp was falsely accused and is still being Gaslighted by Media and other supporters of Amber Heard, merely because she is a woman.  Being a woman doesn't make you perfect, it makes you human.  The same is true for being a man.\nWith things like this, as hard as they are to deal with, it's necessary for me to find the humor...otherwise it's all downhill.  On February 22nd, I pray that the Truth will fully come out.  Until Then?
