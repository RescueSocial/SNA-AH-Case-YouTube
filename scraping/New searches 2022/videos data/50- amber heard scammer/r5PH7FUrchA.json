            "description": "Johnny Depp Thanks His Fans For HUGE Win Over Amber Heard\nJohnny Depp has been a man on a mission for quite some time now. But in regards to the last 9 months or so, he has been in a desperate fervor to go and expose the lies that have been said about him by his ex-wife Amber Heard. She has constantly said that he abused her and that she has done everything she could to be a \"good person\" both to him and to others. And yet, Depp keeps finding chinks in the armor if you will, and now, another vulnerability might come via a charity that Heard was said to have donated to. We'll break this down for you. Be sure to like the video and subscribe to the channel!\n\n\n\nAnd there you have it, everyone! A look at the court decision which might just go and prove that Amber Heard might be lying about multiple things in order to manipulate the courts to see her side of the story and not Johnny Depp's. If this is indeed proven true, how do you feel this will go and change the case for Depp and Heard? Do you think this will swing things Johnny's way at last?
