(Heard has since filed a defamation lawsuit against Stanhope for his allegations.)\n\nBut sources close to Heard say money is the farthest thing from her mind, according to a new report by TMZ.\n\nAccording to the site, Heard's top concern is protection from Depp, and that a cash grab is \"the lowest priority\" in this entire debacle.\n\nThe estranged couple's legal teams have been negotiating a settlement, with the last offer coming from Depp's camp.\n\nHe has offered spousal support of about $50,000 per month for eight months.\n\nHeard has not yet responded to the offer, which some assume means she's holding out for more money.\n\nHowever, sources say the reason she has yet to react to the offer is because it comes with a rider that Heard takes issue with.\n\nThe offer reportedly includes a mutual restraining order, which Heard will not allow since she was the one subjected to the abuse.\n\nHeard has supplied photos of her bruises to the court as well as text messages to Depp's assistant Stephen Deuters that appear to confirm past instances of abuse.\n\nDeuters rushed to his employer's defense, claiming that he never sent the texts and the screenshots were doctored.\n\nUnfortunately for Depp, an expert has authenticated the text messages as real.",
