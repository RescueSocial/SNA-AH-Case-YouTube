            "description": "Johnny Depp begged his assistant to get him \"whitey stuff\" and \"happy pills\" days before he is alleged to have attacked his ex-wife Amber Heard, a court heard.  \u00a0 The 57-year-old Pirates of the Caribbean star is currently in court suing the publishers of The Sun, News Group Newspaper for libel over an article that alleged he was violent towards his former lover Amber.  \u00a0 The article was published in April 2018 and dubbed Johnny a \"wife-beater\", which the actor has heavily denied.  \u00a0It's headline read: \"Gone Potty \u2013 How can JK Rowling be \u2018genuinely happy\u2019 casting wife-beater Johnny Depp in the new Fantastic Beasts film?\" \u00a0It related to allegations made against Depp by Amber, 34, who is also an actor, after she accused that him of being was violent towards her during their marriage.   \u00a0At a hearing in court yesterday, the newspaper's lawyers asked the High Court judge to throw out Depp's claims, which was alleged because they claim that he failed to disclose texts which allegedly show him trying to buy drugs in Australia. \u00a0Adam Wolanski QC, the News Group Newspaper barrister, told the court how his client had obtained texts between Depp and his assistant Nathan Holmes. \u00a0Mr Wolanski told the court how the texts came from Ms Heard's lawyers. \u00a0It is alleged that on March 7 Depp texted Mr Homes: \"May I be ecstatic again?\" \u00a0The barrister said that was \"a reference to ecstasy\" and that the use of the word \"again\" meant it was \"a request for further ecstasy\". \u00a0The court also heard how on the same day, Mr Depp texted Mr Holmes again to say \"need more whitey stuff ASAP\", which Mr Wolanski said, \"must be a reference to cocaine\". \u00a0Mr Wolanski said subsequent texts showed Mr Depp\u2019s \"increasing exasperation about the fact that he doesn\u2019t have any drugs there and then\". \u00a0Mr Depp texted Mr Holmes to say: \"F*****g give me the goddamn numbers, I will take care of this s**t, don\u2019t bother.\" \u00a0Mr Holmes explained: \"If they don\u2019t have it, I can\u2019t get it. It\u2019s someone that works on the film, not a professional dealer. I will bring it to you.\"   \u00a0Later, Mr Depp texted Mr Holmes again to say he did not want anyone to \"lecture\" him about drugs. \u00a0The Sun's lawyer told the court that it was Ms Heard\u2019s case that it was her \"lecturing him (Mr Depp) about drugs that set him off\". \u00a0He added that Mr Depp was \"getting enraged with Mr Holmes on the topic of the supply of drugs just a day before the Australia drug incidents are alleged to have taken place\". \u00a0Explaining why the messages were relevant to the case Mr Wolanski claimed: \"It is the defendants' case that drugs and alcohol had an influence on the claimant's behaviour towards Ms Heard.\" \u00a0The barrister told the court how Ms Heard alleges she was subjected to assaults after she challenged Mr Depp for taking a number of pills and washing them down with red wine. \u00a0Mr Wolanski said Mr Depp\u2019s version of events is that he \"expressly denies\" that he took the drugs, that Ms Heard found a bag of pills or that the pair had any conver",
