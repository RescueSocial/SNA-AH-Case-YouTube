            "description": "Canadian born Amber O\u2019Hearn, M.Sc., is a data scientist by profession with a background in mathematics, computer science, linguistics, and psychology. After moving to the U.S., she began experimenting with different forms of diet, in order to retain her health and balance her mental state.\n\nShe has been studying and experimenting with ketogenic diets since 1997. More recently she has begun writing and speaking about her findings. Her review on the evolutionary appropriateness and benefit of weaning babies onto a meat-based, high fat, low carb diet, was included as testimony defending Prof. Tim Noakes in his trial. Amber has been eating a carnivorous diet for over 11 years and is the founder of CarnivoryCon, an annual conference dedicated to the carnivore lifestyle.\n\nPlease consider supporting Low Carb Down Under via Patreon.
