He also gave Channing Tatum the nickname of a 'potato-head' and 'Jim Turd Sturgess'.\nIn a witness statement filed as part of Johnny Depp's High Court libel case against the actor over allegations of domestic violence, Amber Heard said that Johnny Depp demanded to know about all the romantic scenes in her movies and complained about how people can watch her 'get f***ed on camera'. \nShe said that he would insist on every male actor that she was working with was trying to sleep with her or she has had an affair with him. \nAmber Heard also revealed that Johnny Depp would try to catch her out by taking her phone or telling her someone had told him that she was having an affair and act as if he had information proving it when she really had not done anything.\n\nAmber Heard said that without even asking her Johnny Depp would even get himself copies of the scripts that she would be looking at, in order to review the scripts for himself. \nNow no one knows the right or wrong and what is true in all this, but calling Leonardo DiCaprio 'pumpkin-head\u2019 is not fair, either he said it or she just made it up.",
