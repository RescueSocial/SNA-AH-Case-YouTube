After a time on the diet, her mood problem had vanished.  \n15:50 Plants have defenses like shells or thorns, as well as chemical pesticides. Even those versions bred to be less toxic, still contain toxins. \n18:30 Hormesis: It is unrealistic to get a therapeutic antioxidant dose from the amount of food you eat naturally. \n20:14 The NRF2 pathway is stimulated by being on a ketogenic diet. \n20:55 With hormesis, the dose gets better and better and then it gets toxic. You don\u2019t know what dose you need to get better. \n21:25 At the beginning of a ketogenic diet, you increase oxidative stress. With adaptation, the cell begins creating its own antioxidants in the same way it would to a phytochemical. \n25:53 Inflammation is your body\u2019s way of healing damage. Eliminating the damage reduces the need for inflammation. \n26:35 Does an inflammatory or anti-inflammatory food reduce the need for inflammation or does it fight your body and prevent a response?\n30:20 The carnivore diet has helped Amber be more emotionally resilient. \n34:20 Amber never needed her thyroid or psych meds again. \n37:45 Responses from Amber\u2019s followers who do the carnivore diet report mood improvement, and reductions in autoimmune symptoms, reduction in arthritis, asthma, skin conditions and GI issues. \n38:20 GI issues can be exacerbated with fiber intake. \n43:32 Perhaps the biome has evolved to deal with a particular diet. \n44:34 When you remove plants from your diet, shifts occur in your gut biome which look unhealthy if you were eating plants, but may be appropriate to the carnivore diet.\n54:00 Amber\u2019s elevator pitch to a vegan/vegetarian: Your physiology requires meat and is averse to plants. Think about the ethics of taking care of you. \n58:10 Amber\u2019s elevator pitch to a politician: Had they considered the history and pre-history that humans have with meat and its impact upon our evolution? \n58:55 Amber\u2019s desert island animal product: Ribeye because it is a ruminant with lots of fat.",
