            "description": "http://twitter.com/carsnstars - Follow Us!\nThe Rum Diaries actress, Amber Heard, was recently spotted in Hollywood taking her 1968 Ford Mustang for a spin. The star is famous of making news as a self-confessed muscle car lover and is frequently seen on the Los Angeles streets sporting her classic 68. Amber, like many celebrities, has admitted that she has a collection of cars but this particular Mustang is her favorite. The Ford Mustang has been hugely prominent in pop culture, having been a focal point of over 500 films such as the James Bond films and Apollo 13. In addition, the muscle cars have been cast along side some of Hollywood's most coveted actors and was the inspiration for Sir Mack Rice and Wilson Pickett's 1965 smash hit, Mustang Sally.",
