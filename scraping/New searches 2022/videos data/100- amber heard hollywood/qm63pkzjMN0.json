Well, we\u2019ve seen a lot of his humor in the movies but is he as happy in real life as he portrays to the world? What truly happened in his relationship with Amber Hear. Well, that\u2019s what we\u2019ll find out today.\n\nJohnny Christopher Depp II is an American actor, musician, and producer. Yes, you read it right, This award-winning actor, has won over 25 awards and 55 nominations. And in Johnny\u2019s 58 years of existence, well, of course, he would have already met someone, married them, and had kids with them. His first spouse was Lori Allison, from 1983-1985, even before he became an actor. Soon, there was Sherilyn Fenn, Winona Ryder, Kate Moss, Vanessa Paradis (with which he had 2 kids), and lastly, his ex-wife, Amber Heard, whom he divorced in 2017, and the main topic of today\u2019s tea. \n\nBut why was Amber and Johnny\u2019s divorce quite a mess? Well, it was a complete and total sham actually, and we all know that, considering the divorce was highly publicized. It\u2019s better to start from the beginning of the story, isn\u2019t it? Johnny and Amber met back in 2011 on the set of \u201cThe Rum Diary\u201d and started living together in 2012. In early 2013, Johnny allegedly have been physically violent to his partner when Amber claimed that Johnny has slapped her three times already after she joked about a tattoo that Johnny got on his arm during his relationship with Winona Ryder, and Johnny obviously denied the allegations. In early 2015, specifically on February 3, 2015, the couple married each other in a private and intimate ceremony in their home in Los Angeles. Here\u2019s where fans got a little suspicious with Amber\u2019s story, if Depp has already been abusive, why push with the wedding?\n\n In around March 3-5 of the same year, the couple went on a three-day trip to Australia, presumable to wind down and enjoy the married life. But according to the actress, it wasn\u2019t as magical as we thought. Amber describes the three-day trip to Australia as a \u201c3-day hostage situation,\u201d in which Johnny was accused by his wife of physically and verbally abusing her while drinking heavily and taking drugs. Johnny, once again, denies the allegations, saying that Amber had lost her temper while they were both talking about a post-nuptial agreement, with very different stories, it\u2019s not wonder the court was confused. On April 21, a few months after the \u201c3-day hostage situation,\u201d the couple arrived in Australia, smuggling their Yorkshire Terrier pets, Boo and Pistol, which they did not declare to customs officials in Queensland. Amber was charged for bringing her dogs into the country illegally and was soon dropped after the couple made an apology video. And suddenly on May 22 of the following year, 2016, the couple separates which was considered to be unsurprising news, but when the reason of the divorce came out, the media and fans wanted to know all about it.",
