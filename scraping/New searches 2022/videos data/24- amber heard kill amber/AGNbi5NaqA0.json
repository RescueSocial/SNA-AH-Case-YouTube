            "description": "Amber Heard's friend Raquel 'Rocky' Pennington has claimed she warned the actress Johnny Depp might \"kill her by accident\" when he was drunk or \"delusional\". \u00a0The American actor, 57, is suing News Group Newspapers and its Executive Editor Dan Wootton over a story published in The Sun in 2018 which branded him a \"wife beater\" - an allegation he strenuously denies. \u00a0The case, which entered its third week, continued at London's High Court on Friday and Pennington gave evidence via a video link from Los Angeles, California. \u00a0She resided in Depp's penthouse block in LA between 2014 and 2016, and alleged to have been Heard's \"best friend\" at the time.   \u00a0In her lengthy witness statement, Pennington claimed things took a turn for the worst while the couple were in Australia. \u00a0She explained that she \"voiced\" concerns to Heard and said she told her that Depp might \"kill her by accident\". \u00a0She stated: \"The first time I became really scared for Amber's life was the Australia incident... \u00a0\"As soon as she returned from Australia, Amber came straight to my apartment... and told me about the biggest argument they had had to date...   \u00a0\"I voiced my concerns to Amber that Johnny might accidentally kill her while he was intoxicated or delusional like he was in Australia. \u00a0\"But Amber continued to think she could help him and that things would get better, and I felt an obligation to stay close for her safety.\" \u00a0Elsewhere in her statement, Pennington echoed Heard's allegations that Depp threw a number of glass bottles at the Aquaman star during the heated row. \u00a0Pennington stated: \"She [Heard] said that he was throwing glass bottles at her, and there was broken glass all over the ground which cut her feet.  \u00a0\"She said he backed her up against a bar and she was trying to support herself but her arms were sliding down and getting cut by broken glass. \u00a0\"Amber told me that at this point Johnny ripped off her nightgown and she was naked on the ground, all wet with alcohol, and bleeding.\" \u00a0She also claimed Heard told Depp had smashed the television and urinated on furniture. \u00a0Deff refuted the claims he was violent towards his wife during the row in Australia, and denied he was ever violent towards his former wife and has accused her of abusing him during their 15-month marriage. \u00a0The pair married in 2015 after meeting on the set of the Rum Diaries.",
