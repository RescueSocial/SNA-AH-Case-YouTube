            "description": "Georgina Wahed hits the red carpet for the European Premiere of the Johnny Depp starring The Rum Diary where she spoke to the gorgeous Amber Heard and director Bruce Robinson.\n\nThe Rum Diary. Based on the debut novel by Hunter S. Thompson which initiated his long, distinguished and brilliantly unpredictable career, THE RUM DIARY tells the increasingly unhinged story of itinerant journalist Paul Kemp (Depp). Tiring of the noise and madness of New York and the crushing conventions of late Eisenhower-era America, Kemp travels to the pristine island of Puerto Rica to write for a local newspaper, The San Juan Star, run by downtrodden editor Lotterman (Jenkins).\n\nAdopting the rum-soaked life of the late 50's version of Hemmingway's lost generation, Paul soon becomes increasingly obsessed with Chenault (Heard), the wildly attractive Connecticut-born fianc\u00e9e of Sanderson (Eckhart), a businessman involved in shady property development deals.\n\nTHE RUM DIARY is a GK Films, Infinitum Nihil and Film Engine production.",
