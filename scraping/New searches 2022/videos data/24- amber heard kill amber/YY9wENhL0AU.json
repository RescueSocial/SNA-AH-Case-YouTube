Amber Heard is the elusive Zoe, a photographer who catches Mike\u2019s eye; Andie MacDowell is Nancy, an uninhibited Southern Belle who might have something BDR had given up hope of ever finding; Elizabeth Banks is Paris, who must be convinced to allow them a place on the convention bill; and Jada Pinkett Smith is Rome, a woman from Mike\u2019s past.\n\nAs the festivities spill over into a beach party, illuminated mainly by car headlights, Mike has his first of several chance meetings with Amber Heard\u2019s Zoe. An intriguing young woman with a flair for candid photography, Zoe is someone he\u2019d like to learn more about, but, for the moment, she gives him only a smile and something to think about. \u201cWhat I like about the way these two interact is that they don\u2019t follow a traditional trajectory of \u2018boy meets girl, boy chases girl,\u2019\u201d Heard observes of their keep-\u2018em-guessing interplay. \u201cIt\u2019s not about that. We get the impression that they have something to impart to each other which is not possible in their first meeting, though they\u2019re drawn to each other.\u201d",
