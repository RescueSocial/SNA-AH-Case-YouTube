            "description": "Happy Thirsty Thursday! Hope you guys are enjoying the summer cuz we're here to keep you entertained! First we do a another breakdown of Loki with episode 2. We hope you're enjoying it as much as we are!  We go frame by frams (as many as the House of Mouse will let us) and try to pick a part our favorite moments.\n\nThen we have the Trial of Amber Heard! Last week after the title drop for AquaMan 2, fans again clamored that Amber's allegations are reason to drop her from the DCEU! may James Wan will kill her off! But is she worthy of a defense? Well Judge Jack will  hear arguments from Austin as they dissect the timeline  and figure out whether she should be cancelled. Hopefully Judge Jack will be fair. I mean it's not like he made a rant about cancel culture :P\n\nIn our third segment Jack and Austin tiptoe around Jon Stewart's epic rant about the contagion that can't be named stemming from a research facility from a city which can't be named from a country that can't be named. This will be a mess, but hey we wanna get monetized. The media is lambasting Stewart's appearance on Colbert. But Is his hypothesis really so far flung? Well if we ruffle any feathers, Jack will send out a deep hearted apology in manadarin while eating dumplings and rocking a fu manchu.\n\nSeason 3 trailer for Titans dropped. Good thing Jack  watched some of it and is partially qualified to speak about it...But he'll act like he is 100% qualified. TY and Austin have a new segment that's worth checking out!\n\nPlus any breaking news, we got you covered with bias reporting and scathing remarks. The Talk Don't Stop!\n#AmberHeard #Aquaman2 #TheLostKingDom #Loki #Episode2 #LadyLoki #TVA #Titans #JohnnyDepp #JonStewart #Colbert #Classified \n#JivinWithJack",
