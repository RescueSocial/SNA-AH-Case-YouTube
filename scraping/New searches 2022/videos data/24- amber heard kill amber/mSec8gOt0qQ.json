            "description": "It seems like justice is suspended in amber these days, unable to move one way or the other. If we look at some of the timeframes we've been waiting for justice - 15 days, 53 days, 244 days - it's pretty apparent that the law presently has a perception problem. This video discusses how long the American people have been made to wait for justice and how the wait impacts the perception of the law. \n\nFor our Team Justice and Justice Matters merchandise shop, please visit: \n\nhttps://shop.spreadshirt.com/glennkirschner/\n\nPlease consider becoming a #TeamJustice patron at:  https://www.patreon.com/glennkirschner\n\nMy podcast, \"Justice Matters with Glenn Kirschner\" can be downloaded where you get your podcasts.
