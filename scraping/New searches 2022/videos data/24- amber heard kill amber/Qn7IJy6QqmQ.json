This deck has been heavily requested for a long time, so I finally decided to play it over on Cardmarket and managed to get a 9-0 with it. It far exceeded my expectations because I honestly thought this deck was not good, but I was proven wrong. So let's see if we can get a similar record here today.\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f ManaTraders (Code MERYNMOON_VZK to save 15%) \u27a4 https://www.manatraders.com/?medium=MerynMoon\n\n\ud83e\udde1 Patreon \u27a4 https://www.patreon.com/MerynMoon\n\n\ud83d\udcfa Twitch \u27a4 https://www.twitch.tv/mavendragon\n\n\ud83d\udcf1 Tiktok \u27a4 https://www.tiktok.com/@merynmtg\n\n\ud83d\udc24 MTG Twitter \u27a4 https://twitter.com/MerynMTG\n\ud83d\udc25 Personal Twitter \u27a4 https://twitter.com/Maven_Dragon\n\n\ud83c\udfae Discord \u27a4 https://discord.gg/K7juWXGzhf\n\n\ud83d\udd25 Previous Decks We Played \u27a4 http://bit.ly/MerynDecks\n\n\u2709\ufe0f For Business Inquiries \u27a4 merynmtg@gmail.com\n\n#MTG #MagicTheGathering #Modern",
