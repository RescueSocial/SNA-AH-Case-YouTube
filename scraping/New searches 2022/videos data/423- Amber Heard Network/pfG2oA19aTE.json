You can tell my dislike for the Amber Tone because of the way I speak at the beginning of the video. This does include the EAS Header, the Amber Tone, and the EOM. The following station heard was KSCS 96.3 FM in Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas. They're a LP-2 station. They got their message from WBAP 820 AM/96.7 FM. They're the designated LP-1 station due to their 50,000 watt AM signal.",
