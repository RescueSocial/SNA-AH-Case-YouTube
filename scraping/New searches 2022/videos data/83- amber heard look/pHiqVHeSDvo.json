            "description": "Here's what an Amber Alert looks and sounds like on an iPhone. An Amber Alert is a child abduction alert system. Expand the description below to read how I was able to be ready to record this alert and what exactly an AMBER alert is.\n\nThese alerts are also seen and heard when there's a Winter Storm Warning, such as a Tornado is near, during Flash Floods, and also when there's a Dust Storm like when the Phoenix area of Arizona is sometimes hit with those huge sand storms called Haboobs.\n\nHow was I ready to capture the alert on video?\nWell, I have two iPhones (one for work) and so when my personal one started going off and alerting, I quickly silenced the alarm and then started recording the second iPhone that I had which started it's alert very soon after the first one and I was able to capture it in time, as you can see in the video!\n\nWhy is it called an Amber Alert?\nThe Amber Alert originated in the United States in 1996. AMBER is officially a backronym for America's Missing: Broadcast Emergency Response, but was named for Amber Hagerman, a 9-year-old abducted and murdered in Arlington, Texas, in 1996.
