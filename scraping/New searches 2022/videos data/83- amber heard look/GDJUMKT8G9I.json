It has laid bare a world in which the jets and the islands are private, but where the excess and indulgence have been made horribly public.\n\nThe actress - as always - looks incredible in an understated, business-like suit, a figure-hugging skirt, and a crisp white shirt\n\nIt\u2019s a serious look. She\u2019s power dressing - she wants to be seen as strong and not fussy. A trustworthy figure. It\u2019s an outfit that says, \"I mean business\".\nVideo credits :instagram account\ncredits :Instagram \nThis video is for entertainment purpose what based of net articles.
