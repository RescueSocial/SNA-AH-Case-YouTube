            "description": "Interview starts at 4:33 if you don't want to watch the introduction\n\nSeptember 6, 2018, off-duty Dallas Police Department patrol officer Amber Guyger entered the Dallas, Texas, apartment of 26-year-old accountant Botham Jean and fatally shot him. Guyger said that she had entered the \napartment believing it was her own and that she shot Jean believing he was a burglar. Guyger was not arrested for several days, and then was initially charged with manslaughter, creating mistrust in the process and outrage \nover the killing of an unarmed African American citizen. It resulted in protests and accusations of racial bias and she was later charged with \nmurder. On October 1, 2019, Guyger was found guilty of murder. The next day, she received a sentence of ten years in prison.\n\nGuyger's apartment was on the third floor, directly below Jean's apartment on the fourth, in an apartment building with mostly identical floor \nplans on each level. Guyger testified that she thought the apartment was her own, and that she found the door slightly ajar, and she testified that she thought Jean was an intruder in the darkened living room where he was \nsitting eating ice cream, in an apartment she thought was hers. She claimed she feared Jean would kill her. Jean was unarmed.\n\nAfter Guyger shot Jean, she called 9-1-1. Jean was taken to a nearby hospital, where he died from his wound. The Texas Rangers investigated the shooting, which led to Guyger's arrest three days later.\n\nGuyger was initially charged with manslaughter, but was later charged with murder. The initial charge of manslaughter and the racial aspect of the shooting resulted in protests in the following days.\n\nThe Dallas Police Department placed Guyger on administrative leave after the shooting. The department fired her on September 24, 2018.\n\nBotham Shem Jean, a 26-year-old black man, was a Harding University alumnus and an accountant for PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC). \nJean was born in Saint Lucia.\n\nFollowing the shooting, an attorney representing Jean's family accused the Dallas police department of attempting to smear Jean's reputation by publicizing a police affidavit showing that police seized 10.4 grams of marijuana from Jean's apartment. The lawyers also disputed the account of the incident that Guyger told officials, which was recorded in the arrest warrant affidavit, and asserted that two independent witnesses had come forward to give recollections that conflicted with Guyger's account. An attorney for Jean asserted that witnesses claimed they heard knocking on the door to Jean's apartment and that a witness claimed they heard a \nwoman's voice saying \"Let me in, let me in.\"\n\nOn November 30, 2018, Guyger was indicted on murder charges by a Dallas County grand jury. On September 22, 2019, the day before the trial began, Dallas County District Attorney John Creuzot took part in an interview \nregarding the trial in spite of a gag order issued by Judge Tammy Kemp in January of that year. After questioning jurors, who reported that they \nhad not seen the interview or other media coverage of the trial, Kemp denied the defense's motion for a mistrial, and sequestered the jury.\n\nManslaughter charges would have required proof of recklessness, while murder charges require proof that the defendant killed with intent. The prosecutors alleged criminal intent for two reasons: firstly, they said her arrival at the wrong apartment (on the wrong floor) was not caused by tiredness, but rather caused by the conversation she had immediately prior with her lover trying to arrange a meeting that night, and secondly that she did not follow standard police protocol of not entering a building with a \npotential burglar inside and instead calling for backup from the police station, which was two blocks away.\n\nOn October 1, 2019, Guyger was found guilty of murder. The jury deliberated for six hours to reach the verdict of murder. The jurors also considered the lesser charge of manslaughter. She was the first Dallas police officer to be \nconvicted of murder since the 1973 murder of Santos Rodriguez.\n\nOn October 2, 2019, Guyger was sentenced to 10 years in prison after the jury deliberated for an hour. During the sentencing hearing, Jean's \nmother Allison provided emotional testimony and some of Guyger's text messages and social media posts that were \"racist and offensive\" were shared. Jean's younger brother Brandt forgave and hugged Guyger during her sentencing. Jean's father Bertrum also stated that he forgave Guyger but had wanted a stiffer sentence. Trial judge Tammy Kemp, who is \nalso African-American, drew controversy when she embraced Guyger and handed her a Bible, with the Freedom from Religion Foundation \ncriticizing her for alleged proselytizing.",
