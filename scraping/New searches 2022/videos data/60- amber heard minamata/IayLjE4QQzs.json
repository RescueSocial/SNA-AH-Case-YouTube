            "description": "#justiceforjohnnydepp #justiceforjohnny #johnnydepp #Amberheard #narcissist  #npd   #narcshield \n\nMy channel is my opinion on things and experiences I have had. I am here to help support those who have been in toxic relationships. I do believe in therapy and doing the work we need to do to heal and do work to help ourselves. We can't change other people. People can change if they want to even a narcissist as they learn to have cognitive empathy.  You have to want to heal and do the work. If the ego gets in the way it can keep you stuck no matter who you are in the relationship. There are steps we can make to make healthy changes for ourselves. It may not be easy but it is worth it.  I believe in good therapy and working with someone who is well educated in personality disorders, trauma, cptsd, behavioral therapy. \nI also believe in surrounding yourself with a good support system. There are many people bringing awareness in their own ways using their own experiences or expertise.  I think therapy combined with support is a great way to start in recovering. Learning to hold boundaries is key and you have the power to make your own changes and grow. I am happy to be here to support you with love from my heart. I understand as I have been through it. It is hard for those who have never been through this abuse to understand and why finding the right support is important. You can heal. Thanks for being here! :)",
