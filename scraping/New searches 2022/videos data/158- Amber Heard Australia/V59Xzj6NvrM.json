That is why Australia has to have such strong biosecurity laws.\u201d\n\n\u201cAustralians are just as unique, both warm and direct. When you disrespect Australian law, they will tell your firmly,\u201d Johnny adds. \u201cDeclare everything when you enter Australia.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am truly sorry that Pistol and Boo were not declared.
