            "description": "Amber Heard and Johnny Depp got into a little bit of trouble after they tried to smuggle their dogs into Australia, falsifying travel documents. Charges were dropped, and some are now wondering if their new apology video was part of their deal to avoid punishment. Cenk Uygur and Ana Kasparian, hosts of The Young Turks, break it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.\n\n\"Amber Heard pleaded guilty on Monday to falsifying travel documents to sneak her two pet dogs into Australia.\n\nThe 29-year-old actress had been charged with illegally smuggling her dogs, Pistol and Boo, into the country last May, but managed to avoid jail time after prosecutors dropped the charge.
