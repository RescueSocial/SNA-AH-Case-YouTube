            "description": "Check It Out Johnny Depp Chops Off Finger & Accuses Amber Heard Of Cheating Johnny Depp pulled a Van Gogh and disturbingly cut off his own finger in a fit of rage, all to accuse estranged wife Amber Heard of cheating. \nJohnny Depp cut off the tip off his finger in March 2015, according to estranged wife Amber Heard, then dipped the stump in blue paint and wrote a violent message on his mirror in a fit of rage while staying at a villa in Australia.\nJohnny and Amber were allegedly in a brutal fight at the time, when he accused her of cheating on him with someone named \u201cBilly Bob\u201d; he wrote the man\u2019s name on the wall and mirror in a mixture of blood and paint, as well as the words \u201ceasy Amber.\u201d\n\n\nThe graphic photos are more evidence for Amber\u2019s domestic violence case against her soon-to-be ex-husband. She claims that during their stay at the villa, Johnny became extremely drunk and high on cocaine. Johnny allegedly cut off the tip of his finger after smashing bottles and windows, slicing himself on one of the glass shards.\nThe \u201cBilly Bob\u201d message is interesting. In 2015, Amber starred in a film with Billy Bob Thornton, and she claims that Johnny accuses her of sleeping with the actor during filming. She denies this, as well as his other alleged claims that she cheated on him with other men.\nAs for the fact that Johnny noticeably isn\u2019t missing any fingers, that\u2019s because the digit was able to be saved. Johnny allegedly waited over 24 hours to get medical help, so his fingertip couldn\u2019t be saved, but doctors used skin from his hand to sew a new one. Clever!\n\nThis is just another shocking, scary twist in Johnny and Amber\u2019s divorce case. Amber has repeatedly stated that Johnny abused her, and now she\u2019s coming out with alleged evidence, including these videos, and that frightening video of Johnny smashing bottles.\n\nPlease Subscribe To Our Channel For More Hollywood Updates.",
