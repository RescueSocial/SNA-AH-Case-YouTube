Heard pleaded guilty to smuggling dogs Pistol and Boo in May 2015 as Depp was filming Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales. Unforunately for the couple doggie salon staff do tell tales on social media and so authorities got whiff of the dogs. Australia's then-agriculture minister Barnaby Joyce's threat of having the dogs put down accompanied by strong words that they should \"bugger off back to the US\" provoked Depp to call him \"sweaty, big-gutted man from Australia\". The false documents charge carries a maximum penalty of a year in jail but Heard got off with a one-month good behaviour probation.\n\nLike what you see?
