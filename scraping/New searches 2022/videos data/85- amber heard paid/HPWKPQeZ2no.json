            "description": "GAL GADOT Wants To Work With AMBER HEARD In The DCEU\n______________________________________________\nFor more videos subscribe : https://bit.ly/2zoPgqj\n______________________________________________\nRumours have been going around that Gal Gadot Wants to Work with Amber Heard in the DCEU. In today\u2019s video, we\u2019re going to discuss all we know about this rumour. \n\nGal Gadot\u2019s Wonder Woman shined particularly brightly, with the scene in which she dispatches terrorists being one of the best fights in the movie. But we also got to see more of Amber Heard\u2018s Atlantean princess Mera, who squared off with Steppenwolf in defence of a Mother Box and came close to stopping him early by sucking the water out of his body with her hydrokinesis.\n\nDespite this, the two heroines still haven\u2019t shared a scene with one another. However, according to leaker Daniel Richtman, Gadot is eager to work with Heard in the DCEU. Of course, Aquaman 2 is currently in pre-production and expected to shoot soon, but the most likely potential place for a team-up is Wonder Woman 3.\n\nThis is being fast-tracked by Warner Bros. and it\u2019d be fun to see Mera and Diana interact in it. After all, both characters are royalty (specifically princesses), have expert control of their powers, are fierce warriors and hail from isolated, insular societies. On top of that, there\u2019s a long history of conflict between the Amazonians and the Atlanteans, so sparks could fly in the form of a mutual rivalry.\n\nAt this stage, Amber Heard knows exactly what certain sections of the public think of her, and she now appears to be going out of her way to actively troll them. Over 1.5 million people signed a petition to have her removed as Aquaman 2\u2018s Mera, but she dismissed it by claiming that the numbers had been artificially inflated by paid campaigns and she couldn\u2019t wait to head back to Atlantis.\n\nThe actress will also be fully aware that ex-husband Johnny Depp\u2019s army of loyal supporters will continue to defend him to the hilt, so she\u2019d have known exactly what the reaction would have been when it was announced that she was being paid $33,000 to give talks on domestic abuse, while she may as well have smiled and winked at the camera like Jim in The Office after revealing that she\u2019s got a talent for playing the villain.\n\nAll that being said, the 34-year-old\u2019s increased role in Zack Snyder\u2019s Justice League has so far been relatively safe from any backlash, presumably because the fanbase who spent over two and a half years trying to will it into existence in the first place have used up all their energy and don\u2019t want to draw any sort of negative attention towards the long-awaited redux.\n\nThat hasn\u2019t stopped rumors from making the rounds that Amber Heard\u2018s involvement in the DCEU is only set to increase in the future, though, and we\u2019ve now heard from our sources \u2013 the same ones who told us Ben Affleck would be back as Batman in The Flash long before it was confirmed that she\u2019s talking with Warner Bros. about a Mera series on HBO Max, and she also wants Gal Gadot\u2019s Wonder Woman involved in it.\n\nOf course, based on the online discourse there\u2019s always the chance that such an announcement would cause a lot of people to cancel their subscriptions instantly, but the DCEU is set to be a major part of the streaming service\u2019s future, so they\u2019re well within their rights to develop as many shows as possible.\n\nAnd that\u2019s all we know for now.
