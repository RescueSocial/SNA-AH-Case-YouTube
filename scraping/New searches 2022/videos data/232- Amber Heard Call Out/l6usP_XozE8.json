            "description": "Heard had a visible bruise on her right cheek when she appeared in court on May 27 to secure a temporary restraining order against Depp, her filing having included allegations that he smacked her in the face with her cell phone during a fight at their downtown L.A. penthouse six days beforehand. Police did respond to a call about a domestic incident but left after the reported victim chose not to file a report.\n\nMeanwhile, a source told E! News that Heard was seen both two days and five days after the alleged phone incident with no visible injury to her face. A photo of Heard with her hair covering her right eye and most of her cheek had been posted by Amanda de Cadenet the weekend of the purported fight, but it had been taken down by the time Heard went to court.\n\nAfter she secured the TRO, paparazzi pics taken of Heard smiling over Memorial Day weekend made the rounds, presented not so subtly that Heard at least looked fine. Also that weekend, Depp's latest movie, the Alice in Wonderland sequel Through the Looking Glass, was busy tanking at the box office while he was in Europe for a string of shows with his band Hollywood Vampires. He too was spotted looking at ease and perfectly \"fine\" while chatting with a woman at a bar in Stockholm until 2 a.m. after a performance",
