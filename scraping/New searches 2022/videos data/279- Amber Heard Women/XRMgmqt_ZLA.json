            "description": "(10 Oct 2018) THERON, HEARD, KENDRICK AMONG THOSE CELEBRATING 'INCREDIBLE WOMEN' IN LOS ANGELES\r\nBig names were multi-tasking Tuesday night (9 OCT. 2018) in downtown Los Angeles.\u00a0\u00a0\r\nCharlize Theron, Amber Heard and Kate Beckinsale were among those attending the Porter's Third Annual Incredible Women Gala, paying tribute to the fashion magazine's celebration of women who have changed the global conversation over the past year.\r\nIronically, most attendees were not there to speak - at least with the press - as they simply showed off their haute couture to photographers, and zipped into the venue without a word.\r\nThe event took place the night of the American Music Awards, which many had attended, so some likely were talked out.\r\nBut others were happy to discuss this year's \"Incredible\" theme: \"One Year Stronger,\" referring to successes achieved in the year since the #MeToo and Time's Up movements emerged after allegations of sexual abuse by film exec Harvey Weinstein, and opened discussion of not only abuse but also pay disparity, glass ceilings and lack of job opportunities for women in Hollywood. \r\nIt wasn't long after that the movements moved out of Hollywood and began to address those matters facing women in all businesses, all over the world.\r\nActress Ellen Pompeo, star of creator Shonda Rhimes \"Grey's Anatomy\" observed, \"I think that Shondaland has always sort of operated in the same way.\u00a0\u00a0But I think with respect to the rest of the entertainment community, we've certainly seen film and television, outside of Shondaland, cast differently.\u00a0\u00a0And I think now we have started the conversation about behind the scenes and below the line, and the crews that staff these shows and staff these movies.\u00a0\u00a0We still have a long way to go.\u00a0\u00a0But I think at least the conversation has been started - that now below the line and behind the scenes, the crews have to start looking more like the real world.\" \r\nRecording artist Annie Lennox said she was lucky never to have to deal with the pay disparity issues, as she and Eurythmics' bandmate Dave Stewart split proceeds evenly.\u00a0\u00a0But she acknowledged she's among the few women who have been in that scenario, and called the #MeToo movement \"incredible.\"\r\n\"I think what's happened is one of the positives we can take from it is open dialogue, when we just didn't have any dialogue.\u00a0\u00a0This, this, these things have been going on forever.\u00a0\u00a0And now, it's out; it's out of the bag.\u00a0\u00a0The genie is out of the bottle.\u00a0\u00a0And so the dialogue has begun.\u00a0\u00a0And my focus of interest is in global feminism.\u00a0\u00a0I'm interested in young girls and women living in absolutely intolerable, oppressive circumstances, who don't have a hope, you know, for their future, who don't get access to the things we take for granted.\u00a0\u00a0So my focus has been on the world, you know.\u00a0\u00a0So I call myself a global feminist.\u00a0\u00a0And the #MeToo movement is incredible . And all of this is supportive, in terms of my activism and my advocacy as a global feminist.\" \r\nDirector Catherine Hardwicke couldn't find a job after directing the first, blockbusting \"Twilight\" film entry, and it's taken her a decade to regular land big movies again.\r\nBut while she's regularly complained about that situation, she's also done her best to share her continued \"Twilight\" fame with other female filmmakers.\r\nActress Minnie Driver, who is the top-billed star of an acclaimed network sitcom, \"Speechless,\" said women have a long way to go.\r\n\r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives \u200b\u200b\r\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/1324592e05aaa2d3420c4c6743983edb",
