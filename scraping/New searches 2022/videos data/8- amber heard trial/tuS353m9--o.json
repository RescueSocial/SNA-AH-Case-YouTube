            "description": "The fallout from the Johnny Depp and Amber Heard libel trial could cost the stars hundreds of millions of pounds, showbiz experts claim. \u00a0Depp was dropped from his \u00a3500million role as Captain Jack Sparrow in the sixth Pirates Of The Caribbean movie before the court battle began. \u00a0One entertainment industry expert said: \"The fallout will spread far and wide and deep \u2013 right into these stars' wallets. \u00a0\"It could cost them hundreds of millions.\" \u00a0Insiders say Depp would lose even more if he is cut adrift from Harry Potter author JK Rowling\u2019s Fantastic Beasts franchise.   \u00a0Meanwhile, Heard, 34, could lose her role in the planned sequel to the 2018 Aquaman movie. \u00a0The film franchise\u2019s producers were said to have a representative in court. \u00a0She could also lose her position as a United Nations human rights champion and the face of cosmetic giant L\u2019Oreal. \u00a0But the fallout extends beyond the two main protagonists. Depp\u2019s Brit actor pal Paul Bettany, 49, could wave goodbye to his role as the star of the Disney+ mini-series WandaVision after Depp admitted the pair had dabbled in drugs. \u00a0Depp, 57, is suing News Group Newspapers Ltd and journalist Dan Wootton over an April 2018 article which branded him a wife beater. \u00a0The judge's ruling is expected in September.  \u00a0Heard gave an impassioned speech on the High Court steps yesterday as the trial drew to a close. \u00a0She said: \"I travelled here to the UK to testify as a witness to assist the court. \u00a0\"After getting a restraining order in 2016 and finalising my divorce I just wanted to move on with my life. \u00a0\"I did not file this lawsuit and despite its significance I would have preferred not to be here in court.\"  \u00a0Heard continued: \"It has been incredibly painful to relive the break-up of my relationship. \u00a0\"To have my motives and my truth questioned and the most traumatic and intimate parts of my life with Johnny shared in court and broadcast to the world. \u00a0\"I stand by my testimony and I now place my faith in British legal system.\"",
