            "description": "The Hollywood star smiled and waved at fans as she arrived at London's Royal Courts of Justice this morning for the culmination of a court battle that has revealed lurid details about her relationship with former husband Johnny Depp. Depp is suing News Group Newspapers (NGN), publisher of The Sun, and its executive editor Dan Wootton over a 2018 article which labelled him a 'wife beater'. Lawyers for the tabloid's publisher will be making closing submissions today, before Mr Depp's lawyers make their closing submissions on Tuesday. Summing up for The Sun, lawyer Sasha Wass said the newspaper's defence 'is one of truth - namely that Mr. Depp did indeed beat his wife.' Wass said there was 'overwhelming evidence of domestic violence or wife-beating behavior, cataloged over a three-year period.'\n\nOriginal Article: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8564077/Amber-Heard-arrives-court-closing-stages-bombshell-libel-trial.html\nOriginal Video: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/video/newsalerts/video-2217936/Video-Day-15-Johnny-Depp-Amber-Heard-arrive-High-Court.html\n\nDaily Mail Facebook: http://facebook.com/dailymail\nDaily Mail IG: http://instagram.com/dailymail\nDaily Mail Snap: https://www.snapchat.com/discover/Daily-Mail/8392137033\nDaily Mail Twitter: http://twitter.com/MailOnline\nDaily Mail Pinterest: http://pinterest.co.uk/dailymail\nDaily Mail Google+: https://plus.google.com/+DailyMail\n\nGet the free Daily Mail mobile app: http://dailymail.co.uk/mobile",
