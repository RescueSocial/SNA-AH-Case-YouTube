            "description": "Johnny Depp has accused Amber Heard of withholding his rehab medicine in 2014 during a trip to his private island. \u00a0During the third day of his libel trial in London, the actor told the court how he \"sobbed like a child\" during the alleged incident. \u00a0In a witness statement, the Pirates of the Caribbean actor claimed Heard \"often intervened and withheld medicine from me\" during a trip to his Bahamas island. \u00a0Depp added it was \"one of the cruellest things that she has ever done\". \u00a0The star went to claim he was left \"sobbing like a child on the floor\" and would suffer the \"heebie-jeebies\" and have stomach cramps.   \u00a0Speaking in court, Sasha Wass QC, barrister for News Group Newspapers, said Depp and Heard stayed on one side of his island while his nurse had accommodation on the other side. \u00a0Using text messages as evidence, the QC said: \"All the way through this document it is clear that Ms Heard is the one maintaining contact with Debbie Lloyd and is effectively looking after you. \u00a0\"She was effectively dedicating herself to your wellbeing during this detoxification, wasn't she?\"   \u00a0After Depp confirmed \"Yes, she was trying to help me,\" the QC continued suggesting that Ms Heard was \"effectively acting as your nurse\". \u00a0Depp replied: \"She was in control of the meds, she was in control of when I was taking the meds, she would give me the time to take the meds.\" \u00a0Wass continued: \"I am going to suggest you lied about the extent of her drugs use and alcohol consumption in order to discredit her in this court hearing.\"   \u00a0After the actor said: \"No.\" the QC continued: \"She was doing what she was being told to do by the experts.\" \u00a0Depp went on to state be 'didn't know that she explicitly followed the orders of the registered nurse to the letter.\" \u00a0The trial is expected to last for three weeks",
