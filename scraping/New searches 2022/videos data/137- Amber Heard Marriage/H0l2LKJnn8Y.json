            "description": "When Johnny Depp and Amber Heard got divorced, they both signed a non-disclosure agreement that prevented them from speaking about their relationship publicly. Thanks to a lawsuit Depp recently filed against a British tabloid, however, their short and tumultuous marriage is currently being reexamined in a UK\u00a0courtroom. Depps lawsuit is in response to the newspapers claim that he was abusive to Heard during their brief time together. In court documents obtained by Radar Online, the actor goes so far as to accuse Heard of pretending that she had been abused in order to damage his reputation. \"The claimant was not drunk or high when he arrived. He came with two of his security \u2013 Mr. Bett (Sean Bett \u2013 a former detective with the LA Sherriff\u2019s Department) and Jerry Judge to collect some of his belongings from Penthouse 3,\" reads one such document. \u201cThe claimant brought his security guards with him precisely because he was concerned about what Ms. Heard might do. \"The phone did not hit Ms..Heard on the face or elsewhere. Nor did the claimant pull Ms. Heard\u2019s hair or strike her, or grab her face, or touch her. \" The filing goes on to allege that Heard pretended to have been assaulted by Depp, seemingly for the benefit of the person she was on the phone with. \u201cUpon hearing Ms. Heard shouting, the security guards immediately, i. within one or two seconds, opened the doors and rushed into penthouse 3 via the kitchen where the claimant was standing,\" it reads. \"Immediately upon opening the door, the security guards observed the claimant standing in the kitchen area, far away from Ms. Heard. \"At that moment, Ms. Heard yelled \u2018Stop hitting me Johnny\u2019 into the phone. \"The claimant was not hitting Ms. Heard, who was standing about 25 feet away from the claimant. ,\" the document continues. \u201cMs. Heard was visibly shocked to see the security guards enters, and attempted to feign crying. \"Ms..Heard changed from the present tense to the past tense and said, \u2018He hit me with a phone\u2019, and, \u2018That\u2019s the last time you hit me,\u00a0Johnny. \u2019 Obviously, the explicit allegations here are quite serious, but the implications might be even more disturbing. Heard was photographed with a black eye in the wake of the incident, which took place just days after Depps mother passed away. So is Depps legal team suggesting that Heard gave herself a black eye in order to frame the actor the same week that his mother died? Clearly, this situation has devolved into a sort of he said-she said tangle that makes it virtually impossible to litigate -- except, of course, the court of public opinion. Perhaps at this point, theres nothing more to do but be relieved that no one was injured more seriously -- and that these two are no longer together..",
