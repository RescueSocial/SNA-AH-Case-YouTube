Its up to him and Mera to find out what happened. Hey guys I would like to make it clear that this trailer is fan made. That means it contains clips from other movies, put together with special effects using Wondershare Filmora video editor and Photopea (Photopea.com) photo editor. \u25baWhat is fan made movie trailer? In a nutshell fan made trailers are created for extreme movie fans. That's why its not for everybody because just like Pro-Wrestling, some hate it some love it.

Danielle Moore Nazzaria Grendanin Jazmyn Lynn Queen James Johnson ---------------------------------- Editing Details: Creating Aquaman 2 was challenging because I was not into this franchsie. But my DC lover side made me appreciate this film more. I watched this film once and I thought it was decent. The fresh clips are not too hard to find since there are plenty of cosplay to chose from. To avoid making this dream trailer feel low budget I chose clips from the Aquaman movie it self. Such as the Atlantic City. The music was great, despite the lack of humor the soundtrack by THE EQUALIZER 2 trailer #2 was great because it had lots of trailer fling to it. The main actor himself had lots of movies to chose from since this is the first time I made a project about him. Not the first Aquaman project though, I did one back in 2020 for one of the trailer style of the infinity saga. The line \"is only a myth\" is great connection to how Aquaman is a mystical character. The film SEE had great lines talking about \"gods\" that perfectly fits this dream trailer. Speaking of perfectly fits, the clip with Aquaman attacks the bad guy we get a transition to a guy getting attacked in the water.
