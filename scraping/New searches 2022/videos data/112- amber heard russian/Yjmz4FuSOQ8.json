But they can be upheld through various means and our proposal is that the state should reserve the right to own minerals separated from rock mass.\r\nSUPER CAPTION:  Aleksei Khan, director amber factory\r\n\r\nHundreds of people, left unemployed by cutbacks in military spending after the end of the Cold War, now survive by digging for the material.  \r\n\r\nThey earn around 20 to 30 U-S dollars per day. \r\n\r\nThat's a small fortune compared with the average Russian monthly salary of 100 USD. \r\n\r\nBut the job is hazardous. \r\n\r\nThe local Interior Ministry department makes regular raids on the amber fields, confiscating equipment and forcing the diggers to fill in the deep holes they have dug. \r\n\r\nSOUNDBITE: (Russian)\r\nThere are fences who will pay good money for the amber, but the majority of the diggers just do it to get some money to buy vodka. But with all this digging people can die in mud slides. Last summer we found the body of a fourteen-year old.\r\nSUPER CAPTION: Lt Pyotr Ivankov, Kaliningrad police\r\n\r\nBut local crime officials say the punishments are ineffective. \r\n\r\nThe most these men will receive is a heavy fine. They'll probably be back again tomorrow -- searching for amber to pay the fine.\r\n\r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives \u200b\u200b\r\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/7f5be12529ea09f897be513a83a603d6",
