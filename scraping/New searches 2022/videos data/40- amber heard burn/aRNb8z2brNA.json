HOLLYWOOD heart-throb Johnny Depp vowed to \u201cdrown, burn and f***\u201d his ex Amber Heard, a court heard on Wednesday. \u00a0The threat was disclosed at a hearing in London, ahead of a High Court showdown between the warring couple next month.   \u00a0Other ranting texts from the star detailing his wild booze and drugs benders were also read out at the pre-trial hearing, which Depp attended all day. \u00a0It heard that the Pirates of the Caribbean star, 56, refuted claims from Heard that he beat her and he now wanted his name cleared. \u00a0The Aquaman actress, 33, had publicly alleged she feared for her life after he choked her and ripped out her hair in more than a dozen violent rows. \u00a0Depp is taking libel action against The Sun over a 2018 article questioning the actor\u2019s casting in the Fantastic Beasts movie. \u00a0Executive editor Dan Wootton had challenged its creator JK Rowling to answer five key points in the face of Heard\u2019s claims. \u00a0Depp\u2019s barrister David Sherborne said on Wednesday: \u201cThese are extremely serious criminal allegations made against Mr Depp by Ms Heard and he has a right to have himself publicly vindicated.\u201d \u00a0He went on: \u201cIt is black and white.

Let\u2019s drown her before we burn her!!! I will f*** her burnt corpse afterwards to make sure she\u2019s dead.\u201d \u00a0Another rambling text to Bettany the next year detailed a wild drink and drugs bender. \u00a0The court heard Depp wrote: \u201cI\u2019m gonna properly stop the booze thing darling.
