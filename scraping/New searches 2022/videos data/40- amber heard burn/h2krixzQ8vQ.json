            "description": "The extremely volatile nature of former spouses' Amber Heard and Johnny Depp's relationship was further examined at the High Court today, as the Pirates of the Caribbean star\u2019s libel case against News Group Newspapers (NGN) heats up. \u00a0Natasha Wass QC, who is representing NGN, read out a text written by Depp in which he branded her a \"gold-digging c*m guzzler\". \u00a0He also called her a \"50 Cent stripper\" and said he would not touch her with a \"glove\". \u00a0Depp, 57, who was married to Heard, 34, from 2017-2017, said he met a Russian who had shown him what the Aquaman actress was \"really like\".   \u00a0The string of text messages then saw Depp go on to rant about Tesla boss Elon Musk, 49, whom Heard went on to have a relationship with following her split from Depp. \u00a0Other shocking text messages, which have been aired at court, saw an exchange between Depp and friend and former co-star Paul Bettany, 49, in which Depp said he wanted to \"drown and burn Amber then f*** corpse\". \u00a0Bethany claimed Amber was a \"witch\" in the messages and said they should burn her.   \u00a0Depp responded: \"Let's drown her before burning her. I will f*** her burnt corpse afterwards to make sure she is dead.\" \u00a0Ms Wass suggested the aggressive nature of the messages were due to Depp resenting Heard for trying to stop him taking drugs. \u00a0Depp said Bettany knew about the rows he and Heard had been having, and told the court it was a \"disrespectful\" way of talking about Heard.  \u00a0\"It was not the most respectful way to speak about Ms Heard.\u201d Depp said, adding, \"Bettany and Heard had their differences and did not like each other very much.\"  \u00a0Depp\u2019s libel case relates to a 2018 The Sun column, in which Executive Editor Dan Wootton said Depp shouldn't be allowed to appear in the upcoming film adaptation of JK Rowling's Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them because he was a \"wife beater\".",
