            "description": "Johnny Depp's libel case kicked off at London's High Court yesterday as the actor faces allegations that he abused his ex-wife Amber Heard. \u00a0On the second day of the trial, attended by both Johnny Depp and Amber Heard, the court heard how Depp messaged Paul Bettany discussing his former spouse. \u00a0Depp is suing The Sun's publisher, News Group Newspapers (NGN), and its executive editor Dan Wootton over an article which called him a \"wife beater\". \u00a0The Sun's lawyers Sasha Wass QC read out texts Depp exchanged with Avengers actor pal Paul Bettany, with whom he admitted taking drugs. \u00a0Bettany suggested they should buy Amber Heard \"a beaver\" so they could launch a website under the title: \"Johnny Depp shaves Amber Heard's beaver.''  Read More Related Articles  Read More Related Articles  \u00a0The actor said \"they would make a lot of money\". \u00a0In further messages, Bettany later claimed Amber \"was a witch\" and suggested they should burn her. \u00a0Depp replied: \"Let's drown her before burning her. I will f*** her burnt corpse afterwards to make sure she is dead.''  Read More Related Articles  Read More Related Articles  \u00a0Ms Wass suggested the messages were because Depp resented Ms Heard for trying to stop him taking drugs. \u00a0Depp said Bettany knew about the rows he and Ms Heard had been having \u2013 and Depp told the court it was a \"disrespectful\" way of talking about Heard.  \u00a0\"It was not the most respectful way to speak about Ms Heard,'' Depp said, adding, \"Bettany and Heard had their differences and did not like each other very much.\" \u00a0Depp's libel case relates to a 2018 column by Sun journalist Dan Wootton which said Depp shouldn't be allowed to appear in the upcoming film adaptation of JK Rowling's Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them because he was a \"wife beater\".  \u00a0The article referred to \"overwhelming evidence\" that he attacked his ex-wife Heard, 34, during their relationship - claims he strenuously denies.",
