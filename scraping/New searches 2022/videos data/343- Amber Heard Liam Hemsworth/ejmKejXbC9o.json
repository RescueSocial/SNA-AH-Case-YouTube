And you guys -- Paranoia hits theaters on August 16th. \nNow, back to Miley and Liam since I know that's what you're curious about.  They posed for several photos together and we spotted Miley hanging out with Liam's family at the end of the carpet while he worked the press line.  She glanced over at him several times, and while we did try to get a few questions with her -- it was pretty evident she wanted Liam to be the one to shine.\nAfter he was done with press, they talked with his family some more -- and he was seen with his hands on her lower back.   Also you guys -- Miley's former Hannah Montana co-star, Emily Osment showed up -- and the two ladies spent 15 minutes or so catching up.  How cute!\nAnd if you're wondering -- Miley was sporting her gorgeous engagement ring, so if you ask me -- all is well in the world of Miley and Liam right now. \nOne thing is for sure -- don't expect Liam to open up about Miley to the public.  When asked about his social media preferences -- he said he'd be staying hush hush when it comes to his personal life... oh and, unlike Nick Jonas and Justin Bieber... he won't be posting any selfies -- take a look at what he told some other reports on the carpet last night:\n(CLIP)\nAnd, there you have it. \nSo -- what do you guys think -- are Miley and Liam still going strong, or was this just an effort to stand united in public -- and will you be checking out Paranoia?  ( I hope the answer is yes!)\nLet me know in the comment section below or send me over a tweet and then make sure you hit that SUBSCRIBE button for more exclusive interviews and details about your favorite celebs.
