And ya, that\u2019s the end of it.\nOn May 23, 2016, Heard filed for divorce from Depp and obtained a temporary restraining order against the Oscar-nominated actor. She alleged that Depp had physically abused her during their relationship and said it was usually under the influence of drugs or alcohol.\n\nIf you liked this video guys, please consider leaving a like and give us your thoughts in the comments! \n\nIf you are into the latest Hollywood news and the celebrity latest gossip, then you should consider subscribing to the channel!
