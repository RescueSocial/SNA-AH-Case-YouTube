The Pirates of the Caribbean actor, 56, shared his first post on the social networking site on Thursday as he teased some filming he\u2019s been doing.  Sharing a photo of him surrounded by candles (slight fire hazard, but we\u2019ll overlook it), Johnny told his followers: \u2018Hello everyone\u2026 filming something for you now\u2026 gimme a minute\u2019.  It might have been his first post on Instagram but fans had already suspected he was about to join up, as they spotted that the \u2018@johnnydepp\u2019 handle had just been created.  Fans had been keeping an eye on the account, waiting for the actor to finally post his first photo, and he finally proved they\u2019d been right in thinking the account belonged to him all along.  The actor hasn\u2019t had his own profile until now, though several fan accounts dedicated to him were created \u2013 including some with over a million followers.\n\nFans had also speculated what Johnny might be posting on his Insta, hoping to see some of his artwork or more of his music showcased on there. We\u2019ll have to wait and see what his other posts will include, but we\u2019ll take Johnny surrounded by candles as a pretty great first post.\n\nAccording to the Daily Mail, a judge \u2018rejected her motion to dismiss on the grounds that three of the four sentences the Pirates of the Caribbean star complained about could \u201cconvey the alleged defamatory meaning that Mr Depp abused Ms Heard.\u201d\u2019 The couple had been together since 2011 after meeting on the set of The Rum Diary, and married four years later.",
