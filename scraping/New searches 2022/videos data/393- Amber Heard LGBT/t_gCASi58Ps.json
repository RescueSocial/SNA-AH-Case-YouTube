            "description": "A self-identified feminist mom tells her story of coming to recognize her son for who he is rather than who she assumed he was based on his sex assigned at birth. Gender non-conformity is something often championed by feminists, but trans identity is something else entirely.\n\nAmber Briggle is a small business owner, a community volunteer, a political junkie, and the mother of two incredible children -- Lulu (age 3) and MG (age 8), who have brought many surprises along the way -- including MG's revelation at the age of 2 that he was mislabeled at birth and identified not as a girl, but as a boy. Through trial by fire, Amber has quickly and earnestly become an advocate for transgender rights, helping her son navigate the world of boy/girl while simultaneously challenging society's gender stereotypes. She is also a board member of the League of Women Voters of Texas, a proud member of Rotary International, and she has a rescue dog named Bluebell who still hasn't figured out how to fetch Amber a glass of wine, but they're working on it.\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
