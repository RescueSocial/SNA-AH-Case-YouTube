Credit: PA\u00a0The paper reports that Heard's reps say that the poo belonged to their dog - a Yorkshire terrier named Boo who was known to have bowel problems - while he alleges that there exists 'strong, photographic evidence that connected Amber to the faeces'.\u00a0These are sentences that, I'm honest, I wasn't expecting to have to write when I started my journalistic career.\u00a0Johnny is said to have flounced out of their Los Angeles home, leaving a housekeeper to discover the mystery shite the next day. Depp later said that it was a \"prank\".\u00a0\"Boo has some serious bowel control issues,\" said a spokesperson for Amber Heard told the Mirror. \"There was never a joke, it wasn't something done to be disrespectful.\u00a0\"It was an innocent thing, it's what pets will do. We don't have anything else to say. Ms Heard is moving on and we do not want to engage in this nonsense.\"\u00a0The claims, if untrue, shed light on comments made by Heard when he filed for divorce from Depp, in which his 'paranoid and irrational accusations about some delusional idea' were cited in an incident in which Depp is alleged to have thrown his mobile phone at her. \u00a0\"He began obsessing about something untrue and his demeanour changed dramatically. He became angry,\" she said in the process of getting a restraining order against her former husband.

One of the crew of the film has filed a lawsuit against Depp claiming that he was assaulted by the actor on set. \u00a0Depp is yet to comment on the lawsuit.
