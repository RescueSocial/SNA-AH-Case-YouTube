            "title": "Johnny Depp 'accuses Amber Heard of defecating in their marital bed'",
            "description": "Amber Heard is accused of intentionally defecating in the marital bed she shared with Johnny Depp after a blazing row in the months leading up to their acrimonious separation and subsequent divorce.\n\nHeard allegedly soiled the bed as a malicious prank after the Hollywood star arrived two-hours late for her 30th birthday party in April 2016, according to The Mirror.\n\nSources claim the warring couple\u2019s housekeeper discovered excrement on the sheets after Depp, 55, stormed out of their Los Angeles penthouse following a heated row.\n\nIt\u2019s understood that \u2018strong photographic evidence\u2019 links Heard to the reported incident, while the actress has since claimed the fecal matter was left by their dog, Boo.\n\nA source told The Mirror: 'Boo has some serious bowel control issues. There was never a joke, it wasn\u2019t something done to be disrespectful.\n\n'It was an innocent thing, it\u2019s what pets will do. We don\u2019t have anything else to say. Ms. Heard is moving on and we do not want to engage in this nonsense.'\n\nThe dogs, Pistol and Boo, were last in the news when Heard flew them into Australia on a private jet without putting them through quarantine in 2015.\n\nDepp's ex-wife avoided jail time when she pleaded guilty to\u00a0falsifying border protection documents when when she imported the teacup Yorkshire terriers into Australia. Heard was handed a one-month good behavior bond and fined $1,000.\n\nThe couple also produced an apology video that was played in court, and later went viral. 'When you disrespect Australian law,' Depp deadpans in the video, 'they will tell you firmly'.\n\nThe incident sparked global headlines when Agriculture Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce said the dogs had better 'bugger off' back to the US or he'd arrange to have them put down.\n\nIt was alleged the pooches were not declared to customs officials on arrival.\n\nThe presence of the A-list canines was only discovered when their visit to a Gold Coast dog grooming salon was made public.\u00a0The dogs were quickly whisked out of the country before a 72-hour deadline lapsed when the canines would have to be seized.\n\nUnder strict Australian laws designed to keep disease at bay, dogs entering from the United States must be declared and have to spend 10 days in quarantine. Penalties for contravening the Quarantine Act range from fines to a maximum of 10 years in prison for the worst cases.\n\nDepp was never charged over the incident.\n\nPistol was said to be a gift to Heard from her former girlfriend, artist Tasya van Ree, while Boo originally belonged to Depp.\n\nHe is believed to have wanted to keep custody of the pair, saying the dogs should not be split up but it was\u00a0Heard who was given custody of their beloved terriers.\n\nHeard and Depp were married in 2015 but their relationship quickly unraveled.\n\nA month after the bed defection incident, Heard that Depp \u00a0grabbed her cellphone during an argument, 'wound up his arm like a baseball pitcher and threw the cell phone at me striking my cheek and eye with great force,' according to court filings.\n\nBut police officers found 'no evidence of any crime\u2019, despite Heard appearing bruised in a picture she claims was taken after the alleged attack.\n\nHeard later claimed in court papers : 'Johnny has a long-held and widely acknowledged public and private history of drug and alcohol abuse. He has a short fuse.'\n\nIn legal papers submitted during the couple's divorce in 2017, Heard claimed he made \u201cparanoid and irrational accusations about some delusional idea\u201d.\n\n'He began obsessing about something untrue and his demeanour changed dramatically. He became angry,' she wrote.\n\nThe actor is attempting to clear his name with a High Court case in London against a British newspaper that reported Heard's allegations earlier this year.\n\nIn court papers seen by the Mail On Sunday, Depp's legal team denies absolutely that the star assaulted his former wife.\n\n'The phone did not hit Ms Heard on the face or elsewhere,' say his lawyers. 'Nor did [Depp] pull Ms Heard's hair or strike her, or grab her face or touch her.'\n\nThe High Court papers cite depositions from two Los Angeles police officers, who appear to contradict Ms Heard's version of events.\n\nThey say they arrived at the couple's home 25 minutes after the alleged attack, yet saw no damage to the property, adding that a crying Heard told them she wasn't hurt and did not need medical attention. Nor did they see injuries or swellings on her face.\n\nHis lawyers claim he brought two of his security team along with him because he 'was concerned' about what Ms Heard would do.\n\nThey too appear to contradict her version of events, claiming that Depp was not in fact physically close to his wife during the incident.\n\nMailOnline has contacted a representative for further comment.",
