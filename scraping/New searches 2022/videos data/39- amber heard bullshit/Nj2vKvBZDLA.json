It doesn\u2019t matter!\n\nFrom whatever realm you hail, here ALL are welcome\n\nFor you have stumbled into the Tavern of Tales, friend, our very own inter-dimensional watering hole. Either by fate, or by choice, you are in for a spectacular evening.\n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard of Baxter, the esteemed patron of this establishment. He\u2019s a spell caster of some renown after all. Just don\u2019t stare too long when you see him.\n\nTonight we have a very special treat for all those gathered here. A tale from a place spoken only in hushed tones. Barovia. Or is it?\n \nFor in the Barovia we\u2019re going Strahd is not king and five powerful vampire houses preside over the land. This place removed from time can only be entered via death, as our heroes discovered first hand.\n\nSo sit back, and grab a drink as tonight we join friends old and new, as alliances shift and friendships form, and perhaps if we're lucky find those thought lost along the way.\n\nThe Tavern of Tales presents Houses of Barovia, with political intrigue, dangerous monsters, seductive vampires, and honestly some inane nonsense along the way.\n\nI'll turn this one over to The Teller of Tales. Well met, friend. Enjoy.\" \n\n- Byrus, overworked barkeep of the Taven of Tales\n\n\nHouses of Barovia is live streamed on Twitch Sundays at 4pm PST (7pm EST) on Twitch.tv/thetavernoftales \n\nAll VODs will be uploaded following the stream.
