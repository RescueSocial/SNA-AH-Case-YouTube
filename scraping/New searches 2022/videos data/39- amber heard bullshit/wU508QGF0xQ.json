Amber Heard and Evan Rachel Wood are close friends, Johnny Depp and Marilyn Manson are close friends. Johnny Depp and Amber Heard's defamation trial is set to start soon. What does this all mean? Well there is a lot of theories all over the internet and we are going to analyze them all!\n\nRecommended videos - \n\nMy Weekend With Marilyn Manson - https://youtu.be/wbvEGU-S4B0\n\nMy Analysis of Marilyn Manson abuse allegations part 2 - https://youtu.be/dQJt3DTrhIE\n\nLet me know what you guys all think. I am in no way shape or form saying that these women are lying. I completely agree with the metoo movement and I stand in support of all survivors. I just do not want the metoo movement to get to the point where people are looked at as bad if they question something. I dont want people to be shamed into thinking a certain way. If you want all information before you make your own decision, then that does not make you a bad person.",
