She emphasizes that you have to make sure there\u2019s space for both in your relationship. Then you create routines where you can separate the two. You also need to make time to intentionally connect as a couple.\u00a0\nYou have to create a dedicated time to talk about your relationship. If you\u2019re in conflict all the time you know it needs to be addressed. The flipside is also true\u2014if there\u2019s no open communication, you need to connect. If you\u2019re having a good day, you don\u2019t want to ruin it by bringing up something you\u2019ve been struggling with. And when you\u2019re already enmeshed in conflict, that isn\u2019t a good time either. That\u2019s why creating a ritual where you come together and talk about your relationship is key.\nWhat\u2019s going well? Where are you struggling? If everything is going great, you\u2019ve simply carved out time to have a conversation. But if you\u2019re not talking at all, that dedicated time once a week or monthly is imperative.\u00a0\nMitigating burnout as a business owner\nAs a business owner, you have a lot of demands on your time and energy. The hustle culture makes it hard to set boundaries (but you need to). What are the signs of burnout?\nYou start to notice that you\u2019re easily irritated and quick to anger.\nYou aren\u2019t enjoying things that you normally do.\nYou feel exhausted no matter how much sleep you get (and other physical symptoms).\nYou struggle with compassion fatigue, especially for those in the helping professions.\nYou may dread going to work or don\u2019t look forward to seeing your clients.\nYou procrastinate on the simplest of tasks.\u00a0\nThe first time Amber experienced burnout, she didn\u2019t recognize it because she loves seeing her clients. But everything else in her business overwhelmed her. Simple administrative tasks stole her energy. She thought she was just struggling with her ADHD. But when you put off important things in your business\u2014like billing clients\u2014it becomes a problem.\u00a0\nStrategies to avoid reaching the point of burnout\nAmber\u2019s favorite strategy is to\u00a0hire and delegate\u00a0(sound familiar?). Some things need to be done in your business and you may not be the best person to do them. That fact can be hard to swallow but it\u2019s true. Amber also believes that you need to assess what\u2019s important and see what you can delete off of your list immediately. If you struggle to let go, you can put a pin in it and return to it another time.\u00a0\nSetting boundaries around how much you\u2014and team members\u2014work is key. You can experiment to see what works. Business owners are chronically over-scheduled and need to create more space in your day than you think you need. You must be diligent about not adding more to your plate.\u00a0\nWhat else does Ambera recommend to avoid burnout? How can entrepreneurial couples strengthen their marriages?
