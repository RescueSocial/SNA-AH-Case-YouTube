            "description": "The Amber Ruffin Show. Streaming on Peacock https://pck.tv/3pOiao8\nReserve your spot in the live studio audience for The Amber Ruffin Show at https://1iota.com/show/1210/the-amber-ruffin-show\n\nLast week at a Trump rally, Republican Senator David Perdue mispronounced Kamala Harris\u2019 name, and worse, he did it on purpose. That really made Amber Ruffin mad! Senator Perdue has worked with Kamala Harris in the senate for three years. He knows her name. And he definitely knows how to pronounce it. Amber is sick of white people acting like \u201cKamala\u201d is just a name you can\u2019t say. Guess what, if you refuse to learn someone\u2019s name because it belongs to a person of color, you are a racist! \n\nPlus: coronavirus vaccine trials, Trump on 60 Minutes, and gossip about Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett.\n\nEach week THE AMBER RUFFIN SHOW will showcase Amber\u2019s signature smart and silly take on the week's news. No matter what's happening in the world, Amber will respond to it with a charming mix of seriousness, nonsense, and evening gowns. THE AMBER RUFFIN SHOW is a topical late-night show with just the good parts \u2013 the comedy. Amber Ruffin, Jenny Hagel, Seth Meyers, and Mike Shoemaker serve as executive producers. The series is produced by Universal Television, a division of Universal Studio Group, and Sethmaker Shoemeyers Productions.",
