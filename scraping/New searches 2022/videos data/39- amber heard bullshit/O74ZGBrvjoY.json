There was never a joke, it wasn\u2019t something done to be disrespectful,\u201d the rep told the Mirror.\n\u201cIt was an innocent thing, it\u2019s what pets will do. We don\u2019t have anything else to say. Ms. Heard is moving on and we do not want to engage in this nonsense.\u201d\nIn May 2016, a month later, the couple had another argument about the poo which turned violent and culminated in Depp allegedly hurling Heard\u2019s mobile phone, hitting her in the face.",
