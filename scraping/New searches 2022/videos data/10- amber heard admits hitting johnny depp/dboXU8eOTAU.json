A lawsuit in the U.S. is still ongoing, though a lawsuit in the U.K. has wrapped. Interest has been high from fans of both actors throughout this process, leading to a new documentary on Discovery+ that aims to weigh in on both sides. Subsequently, an old pal of Depp\u2019s and a lawyer involved in one of the suits have revealed some thoughts that will be a part of the upcoming doc.\n\nThe new look into Amber Heard and Johnny Depp\u2019s personal lives will be called Johnny vs. Amber. The two-part documentary has a somewhat unique format in that one part looks into what happened between the former couple from the Depp POV and the other part looks at what happened through a Heard-oriented lens. Now, we\u2019ve heard from people with different points of view on this same matter.\n\nJohnny Depp\u2019s Old Buddy Speaks Out\n\nIn a clip obtained by LAD Bible , Johnny Depp\u2019s ex-bandmate \u2013 from the 1980s \u2013 spoke out about the actor\u2019s former relationship with Vanessa Paredis (with whom he shares two children, Lily-Rose and Jack), as well as his perceptions of Depp\u2019s relationship with Heard. To note, he says he\u2019s never met the Aquaman actress, but has built his perception through his years of knowing Depp.\n\nIn a video recording for Johnny vs. Amber, Bill 'Beano' Hanti alleged that Amber Heard drove Depp to \u201cinsanity,\u201d including \u201cdrinking and drugging.\u201d He also said in the clip from the streaming service:\n\nHe had something special with Vanessa. He fucked it up. [Amber Heard] just saw him coming. She saw the opportunity to be a part of that film, and she worked it. Never met the woman... She got inside John's head and made him absolutely crazy to the point where he was drinking and drugging, to the point of insanity.\n\nPreviously, Bill 'Beano' Hanti was in the band The Kids with Depp and made his opinion about Amber Heard clear, though he did also say they do not have a personal relationship.\n\nWhat The Libel Case In The U.K. Argued\n\nIn the same report about the documentary, a lawyer involved with representing NGN, the company that owns The Sun, talked about what it was her job to prove when the libel case was brought by Johnny Depp himself to the U.K. courts. If you can remember, The Sun had alleged in an article that Depp was a \u201cwife beater.\u201d Depp did not agree the characterization was factual and sued for libel. He ultimately lost the case in court and subsequently exited the Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them franchise .\n\nThe lawyer, Sasha Wass, also spoke for the documentary and said that her job was to \u201cprove a pattern of abusive behavior.\u201d Per Johnny vs. Amber, the lawyer noted:\n\nThe story the texts tell is that drugs, alcohol, regret and apologies played a very large part in their relationship.\n\nDiscovery+ only announced the upcoming documentary last month, though it comes as Amber Heard and Johnny Depp are still involved in a defamation lawsuit in the U.S. The actress has made attempts to get the suit from Depp dismissed over the course of this year, but the latest reports indicate the suit and countersuit Heard filed are continuing to move forward. Even the likes of Elon Musk -- who previously challenged Depp to a \"cage fight\" -- and others could eventually become a part of this legal matter.",
