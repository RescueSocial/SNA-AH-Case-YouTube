We got the whole transcript over here in regards to the Johnny Depp lawsuit. We are going to go the most relevant and important parts where she talks about the Johnny Depp and the evidence against her. \n\nWe will start to see how Amber Heard is going lose this court case. This clearly shows that Amber Heard is lying. You will hear what the judge had to say to Amber Heard. It is the newest piece of celebrity news.\n\nWith the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. \n\nEver since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.\n\n#AmberHeard #AmberApology #AmberHeardExposed #johnnydepp\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWelcome to The Gossipy.
