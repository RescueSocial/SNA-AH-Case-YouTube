            "description": "Following the allegations of Amber Heard where he was accused of physically and verbally abusing her, Johnny Depp was fired from his beloved role in Pirates of the Caribbeans.  This video contains footage of Amber heard accusing Johnny Depp of abusing her, her photos with injuries that were leaked to the media despite a police report stating that there was no visible sign of fights that day. Johny has been struggling a lot through this period and despite having done a lot of good things in the past people seem to forget things rapidly and side with Amber. Johnny Depp has given a lot to people around him including charities and sick children, he is a good human being and one day suddenly his world fell apart. This video shows a bit of who is Johnny Depp, his side of the story and why it was unfair of Disney to fire him. A phone conversation between Amber Heard and Johnny Depp was recently leaked showing that Amber was the one starting physical altercations/fights and Johnny was accused of it and she also said that no one would believe him because he is a man.\nSome people are making it a man vs woman situation instead of looking at the facts and have started the #westandwithAmber movement.\n\n #JusticeforJohnny #JusticeforJohnnyDepp #JohnnyDepp #PiratesOfTheCaraibeans \n\nReferences\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg9SvQSMnoE\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh0kQpmz0ww\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyX0twnnyHA&t=64s\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wUcC2QhqTg",
