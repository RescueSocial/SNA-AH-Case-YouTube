Heard HAS to be WORRIED!\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WydSxPJxkQ\n\nThis time Amber Heard is in a really salty situation as recently a court has given Johnny Depp access to her phone and other gadgets! This is such a major step for JD and his legal team because it gives a chance to prove that Amber Heard faked injuries he allegedly gave her.\nRecently, a Virginia judge, Penny Oscar, stated that Amber Heard must hand over all her gadgets to the court for a forensic examination. Johnny Depp is waging a $68 million libel suit against Amber Heard and JD\u2019s biggest aim right now is to prove that Amber Heard has faked photos purporting to show her with two black eyes, which she says Johnny Depp gave her in 2015. Johnny's lawyer, Benjamin Chew alleged to the Circuit Court of Fairfax County in Virginia in a court filing stated, \u201cMs Heard\u2019s counsel has repeatedly used these phony photographs at deposition\u201d.\nJD\u2019s lawyer also mentioned the situation when the LAPD responded to the alleged beating \u201cthey found no injury upon Ms Heard and no disruption to the penthouses\u201d. \u201cMs Heard and her friends then fabricated photos that she used to obtain an ex parte TRO [temporary restraining order] and a $7 million divorce settlement which Ms Heard falsely testified in London she gave to the ACLU and, more scandalously, to the Children\u2019s Hospital of Los Angeles; sick children with cancer,\u201d Chew alleged in his filing. He added that the LAPD \u201cdisavowed the photographs\u201d and \u201csaid they did not depict what they saw\u201d.\nAfter those statements, the Virginia court ruled that Johnny Depp\u2019s team can have an expert look at the phone and other Amber's gadgets to see if they can find evidence of any photo tampering. The order says: \u201cUpon consideration of Plaintiff and Counterclaim-Defendant John C. Depp, II\u2019s motion to compel Defendant and Counterclaim-Plaintiff Amber Laura Heard\u2019s production of original devices and operating system drives and Cloud backups of these original devices as requested in Plaintiff\u2019s seventh set of requests for production and Ms Heard\u2019s Cross-Motion to compel Mr. Depp\u2019s production of forensic evidence and for sanctions, the oppositions thereto, arguments of counsel, and being fully advised, it is, this 8 day of November 2021, hereby ORDERED as follows:\u201d.\nAccording to the order, Amber Heard has nothing to do but handle all her gadgets to for a forensic examination. It says that JD\u2019s motion to have Amber Heard compelled to produce all the gadgets she was using during the time of their relationship. This is a huge step in this court case because her gadgets may contain some evidence showing that Amber really faked the photos. Johnny\u2019s lawyer had argued that earlier images given to Johnny Depp\u2019s legal team came without any metadata, so their expert, Brian Neumeister, could not verify the details. \u201cMr Neumeister\u2019s preliminary investigation shows that a number of the photographs have been run through a photo \u2013 a photo editing application called Photo 3 that can easily manipulate images such as showing bruises where none actually existed,\u201d said Mr Chew. The lawyer also said the expert found that photos from an iPad Pro 10.5 were created on or after October 6, 2018, adding: \u201cAs such, any editing of the trial bundle versions would have been on or after October 6, 2018.\n\u201cSo Ms. Heard or someone on her behalf doctored those photographs three years later. When that came up in her testimony in London, Ms. Heard falsely denied it. In short, Your Honor, without forensic imaging Mr. Neumeister cannot properly assess or verify Ms. Heard\u2019s data,\u201d he claimed.\n\nBut what\u2019s your opinion? Do you think Amber Heard will hand over her devices or you think that she will definitely state that she doesn\u2019t have any of them? Let me know your opinion in the comments section down below.
