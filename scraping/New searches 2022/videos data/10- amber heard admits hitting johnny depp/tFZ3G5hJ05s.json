            "description": "The saddest thing is that Amber Heard was straight up believed based on her word but Johnny Depp for a whole year had to make public hundreds of court documents packed with evidence and private videos in order for y'all to finally realize and accept he was the victim.\n Amber Heard admitted to \"hitting\" ex-husband Johnny Depp in a recording made in 2015, while the two were still married. The recording, obtained and published by The Daily Mail Friday, was allegedly made when the two tried to talk through their marriage issues. Heard and Depp married in 2015, and finalized their divorce in 2017.\n\n\"I'm sorry that I didn't, uh, uh, hit you across the face in a proper slap, but I was hitting you, it was not punching you. Babe, you're not punched,\" Heard tells Depp in the recording, referencing an incident the night before. \"I don't know what the motion of my actual hand was, but you're fine, I did not hurt you, I did not punch you, I was hitting you.\"\nHeard appears to taunt Depp for fleeing the scene of the argument, telling him, \"You are such a baby. Grow the f\u2014 up Johnny.\"\n\n\"You poke an animal enough, it is eventually, it doesn't matter how friendly it is, it's not cool,\" Heard also told Depp.\n\n\"I left last night,\" Depp said in the tape. \"Honestly, I swear to you because I just couldn't take the idea of more physicality, more physical abuse on each other. Because had we continued it, it would have gotten f\u2014 bad. And baby, I told you this once. I'm scared to death we are a f\u2014 crime scene right now.\"\n\n\"I can't promise you I won't get physical again,\" Heard warned. \"God I f\u2014 sometimes get so mad I lose it.\"",
