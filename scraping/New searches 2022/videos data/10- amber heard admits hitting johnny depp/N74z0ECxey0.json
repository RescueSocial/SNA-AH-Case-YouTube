            "description": "Actor James Franco will testify in court in the case of Amber Heard's defamation of Johnny Depp. The hearing will take place in April next year, PageSix exclusively reports.\n\nThe reason why Franco will be a witness is his alleged affair with Heard in 2016 (she and Depp were still married at that time). Depp's defense insists on questioning the actor: it is known from the materials of the surveillance cameras that in May 2016, Franco and Heard were in the same elevator, immediately after a domestic fight with Depp. The lawyers intend to ask Franco if he saw bruises on Amber's face, or if she lied in court.\n\nIn 2019, Depp filed a $50 million libel lawsuit against Heard. In it, he stated that the actress lied under oath and intentionally accused him of domestic violence in a December 2018 column for The Washington Post. Depp lost a similar case against the tabloid The Sun, which called the actor a \"rapist husband\" (wife-beater).\n\nFranco and Heard played together in the films \"Pineapple Express: Sitting, Smoking\" and \"Adderall Diaries\". This week, Franco spoke about his sexual addiction and for the first time admitted to having sexual relations with his female students. The actor was accused of \"inappropriate behavior\" during his acting course.",
