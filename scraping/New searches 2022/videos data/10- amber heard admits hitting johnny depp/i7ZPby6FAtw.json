No way!\n\nWatching how the Johnny Depp vs The Sun case plays out across the newspapers makes me certain I have made the right decision. Every day we are provided with a new watercooler moment for everyone to salivate over. What worries me deeply about this drama is that Amber Heard\u2019s character seems to be on trial, when she had absolutely no part in bringing this case or any other case forward. She is merely a witness in the trial and has no control over what the fallout might be, her life laid bare because of a fight between two other parties. She never got the chance to decide if she would prefer to hobble around on a knackered ankle and just crack on with her life.A british MP says everyone should leave Amber Heard alone in the Johnny Depp case.\n\n\nI WANT YOU!!
