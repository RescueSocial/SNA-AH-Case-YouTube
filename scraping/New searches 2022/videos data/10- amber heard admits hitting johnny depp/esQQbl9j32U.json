            "description": "\u201cSHE LIED\u201d- James Franco CONFIRMS Affair With Amber Heard!!!\n\nThe ongoing legal battle between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard seems to be one that is never ending. As the battle has continued on, only more and more others have been called forward whether to act as a witness or to present evidence that has not yet been revealed. At this point in the case, any evidence can be useful in order to prove which side of the case is in the right or wrong. With Johnny Depp and his legal team appearing to be ahead in this battle, those following the case are not sure as to what may happen now, considering the fact that James Franco is set to be deposed.
