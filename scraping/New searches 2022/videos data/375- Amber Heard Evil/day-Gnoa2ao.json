Evil Amber tried to refuse and go watch TV, but her good imposter forced her to go to her room and go to bed. When Evil Amber got to her room, she decided to disobey Amber by staying up late and play Grand Theft Auto 5 on her Xbox 360. Meanwhile, Amber went to go to her room and go on the computer to watch Wooden Pig Gets Grounded Series by Disney Jack 95, David Gets In Trouble Series from Sarah West\u2019s first channel and 1 or 2 episodes of Supernanny on YouTube. 3 and the half hours later, Amber was about to get ready to go to bed, but she heard her evil clone got angry and started screaming when she lost the game. Amber started to get mad, she went to go to Evil Amber\u2019s room and caught her by staying up late. Evil Amber got grounded by her good imposter and told her to go turn off her Xbox 360 and went to bed.\n\nHope you enjoy the show?! \ud83c\udfac\ud83c\udfa5",
