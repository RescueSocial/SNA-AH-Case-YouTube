            "description": "Plot:\nEvil Amber is sick and tired of school about taking the math test at school, but she made a plan about faking sick and skip school. Amber was about to take her evil clone to school and drop her off with her Smart car, but she found out Evil Amber was sick with a bad cough and a high fever. Amber went to go check her temperature and the temperature says 105 degrees, Amber decided to keep Evil Amber home and called her in sick from school. When Evil Amber got to her bedroom, she snuck out of bed and go play Fortnite on her computer. Evil Amber heard her good imposter coming to her room, she ran back to bed before she gets caught by Amber, Amber checked on her evil clone what she\u2019s doing, Evil Amber told her she is not feeling well and Amber is starting to worry. Amber asked her evil clone if she can cook her some Campbell\u2019s Chicken Noodle Soup, but Evil Amber said no and Amber left the room. Evil Amber went back on the computer and play Fortnite. After 30 minutes, Amber caught Evil Amber faking sick and skipping school to go play Fortnite on her computer. Amber went to check her real temperature, the temperature says 97 degrees. Amber got super angry at her evil clone and gave her some consequences, Evil Amber got grounded by her good imposter and got strict punishments.\n\nHope you enjoy the show?! \ud83c\udfac\ud83c\udfa5",
