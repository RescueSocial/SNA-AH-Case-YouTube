            "description": "This week, we get up close and personal with Henry VIII\u2019s sister, and deep dive into a very trashy listener request! Alicia has the three marriages of Margaret Tudor: daughter of Henry VII, one-time Queen of Scotland, legitimate Catholic divorcee, and mother of Scotland\u2019s James V. Margaret\u2019s story scandalized Christendom, at least until her brother lost his freaking mind.\r\n\r\n Speaking of dudes losing their minds, Stacie has the very not-funny story of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp. Their brief marriage ended in 2016 in a flurry of monstrous abuse allegations against Johnny Depp, and their continuing legal feud has only made the story uglier. Honestly, we\u2019re a little worried about everyone in this story.\r\n\r\n Promo this week: BetterHelp.com\r\n\r\n Need some extra distraction? Each week, we\u2019re opening up a few hours of bonus content on Patreon for your listening enjoyment. Down with paywalls! Check out bit.ly/trashcandyquarantine for this week\u2019s story selection.\r\n\r\n Can we ask a favor? Filling out this quick listener survey helps great sponsors find us, so you can find out about cool products and services you can enjoy. Probably at home, without your bra on. We\u2019re guessing.
