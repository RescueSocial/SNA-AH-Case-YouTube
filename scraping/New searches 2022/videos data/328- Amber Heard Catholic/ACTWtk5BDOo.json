            "description": "In this week\u2019s #NEWSYOUCANUSE we have an exclusive story where we speak to 13-year-old Amiya and her mother, Amber about a verbal racial attack at Amiya\u2019s school in London, Ontario. Amiya was in her grade eight English class when her teacher said the N-word while discussing a novel the class would be reading. Students were then told not to tell their families what the teacher had said, and weeks later Amiya says the teacher still has not apologized. What do you think should happen to the teacher? Let us know in the comments. \n\nWEBSITE: https://brandongonezshow.com\nINSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/brandongone...\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/brandongonez\nTIKTOK: https://www.tiktok.com/@brandongonez",
