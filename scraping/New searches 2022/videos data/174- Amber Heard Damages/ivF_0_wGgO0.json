            "description": "How would you react if you discovered your identity was stolen? Teen artist Amber Liu  talks about the experience of finding her work copied and posted in social media and how that experience taught her resilience, courage, and humor in the face of adversity. \n\nOriginating from the Philippines and a student of UWCSEA East, Amber is an 11th Grade amateur artist who nurtures her love for art online and features them on various social media platforms, where she has accumulated nearly thirty thousand followers. She sells her artwork online, has collaborated with companies such as Warner Brothers, and has interned in different fashion and media companies. Her work revolves mostly around graphic design and typography, however she loves experimenting with various art styles. In the past three years, she has grown accustomed to the conventions and workings of social media and is slowly but surely learning how to juggle her online presence and the IB life, with her drive to pursue a career as an artist motivating her to do so.\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
