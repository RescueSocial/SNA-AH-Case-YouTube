            "description": "Ex-Dallas police officer Amber Guyger cried two times while she was being questioned during her murder trial on Friday.\n\nShe had testified for less than an hour the first time she broke down in tears. Guyger, who had previously showed little emotion and talked in very subdued tones while on the witness stand, suddenly began to cry and weep loudly.\n\nState District Judge Tammy Kemp sent the jury out of the courtroom to allow Guyger to take a 10-minute break.\n\nAbout an hour later, Guyger began crying again and telling people that she was sorry and that she will have to live with her decision to shoot an innocent man for the rest of her life.\n\n\u201cNo police officer would ever want to hurt an innocent person,\u201d Guyger said.\n\nGuyger, 31, is charged with murder in the Sept. 6, 2018, death of her neighbor Botham Shem Jean, 26. She has said that she mistook Jean\u2019s apartment for her own and thought he was an intruder.\n\nGuyger, who was in uniform but off duty at the time of the shooting, was fired from the Dallas police force.\n\nGuyger approached the door with her key in hand and stopped, she said.\n\n\u201cI saw it [the door] was cracked open,\u201d Guyger testified. \u201cI heard someone moving around in my apartment. There was a loud shuffling around. But me putting the key in the lock is pushing the door open.\u201d\n\nGuyger said she was scared to death and her heart rate sky-rocketed.\n\n\u201cI compare it to being in a car wreck,\u201d Guyger said. \u201cRight before you are going to hit, everything freezes up inside your body. It\u2019s just fear, fear, fear.\u201d\n\nGuyger said she saw a shadow of a figure in the back of the dark room and yelled at him.\n\n\u201cLet me see your hands! Let me see your hands! And I drew my service revolver,\u201d Guyger said. \u201cThen I saw him coming toward me. I thought he was going to kill me. He was yelling, \u2018Hey, hey, hey!\u2019 in an aggressive voice.\u201d\n\nShe said the figure was pacing back and forth near the back wall. Only a matter of seconds passed. Guyger fired two rounds.\n\nGuyger said she shot because she believed the man was going to kill her. He was coming toward her at a \u201cfast-paced\u201d walk, she said, and she couldn\u2019t see his hands and didn\u2019t know if he had a weapon. Police later found Jean was unarmed, and prosecutors say he was never a threat to Guyger.\n\nAfter shooting Jean, Guyger testified, she then walked to the kitchen counter area and that\u2019s when she started to realize that she was in the wrong apartment and she had shot someone innocent.\n\n\u201cBefore that I was only focused on the threat,\u201d Guyger said.\n\nGuyger testified that as she walked toward Jean\u2019s fallen body she realized that she had no idea who he was.\n\n\u201cI was kneeling down next to him and I called 911,\u201d Guyger said. \u201cI knew I had shot him. I didn\u2019t know where he was shot on his body.\u201d\n\nGuyger testified that she was calling 911 with one hand and doing chest compressions on Jean with her other hand. When questioned by a prosecutor, she said she stopped her attempts at first aid several times. Guyger told the jury that she walked outside so she could see where she was and give the location to the 911 dispatcher.",
