Now that she's filming Aquaman 2, we'll see if her workout routine works for her like the first time. Amber Heard workout video I found on Instagram from back in June. Amber Heard is in this year's Aquaman, I think we can all agree she looks great. \n\nAmber Heard Workout Routine/Diet Plan - Aquaman (2018) Amber Heard is ready to go deep in this year's Aquaman, and apparently, she did the same in her workouts. In preparation for the role of Mera in James Wan's adaption of the long-running DC Comic, she had to get strong enough to swim with the fishes\u2026and a whole lot of water hand-to-hand fighting. In fact, Amber says that much of the shots filmed were...\n\nAmber Heard's workout routine, diet plan, and exercise routine. Amber Heard, a famous actress has been able to maintain her weight despite being in her 30s and a successful film star. She looks beautiful in this video, as she's at the slim side of her body (even when pregnant). Her diet and exercise routine are likely very healthy. Enjoy!\n\nWith all the backlash Amber Heard is getting for being too skinny, it's made me wonder why we even care? Of course, I shouldn't be surprised that everyone just wants her to put some damn weight back on because \"she's gross\". But why is that what society has accepted as beauty? Is that really what a female celebrity should aspire to? It's no secret that I've struggled with my own body image and acceptance of my body over the last couple of years.\n\nAmber Heard was born and raised in Austin, Texas. Since her parents were both in the acting business in Hollywood, She soon became drawn to this field of work. As a teenager, Amber spent most of her time under her father's care learning from him all he knew about the business. This exposed her to acting as she began modeling and appearing in commercials. It wasn't long before Amber's popularity begun to rise after she appeared on an episode of Fox's hit show \"Party of Five\".\n#shorts #youtubeshorts #trending #viral  #CelebrityShorts #amberheardworkout #amberheard #amberheardaquamanworkout #aquaman2\n\n\nMy Recommendations\ud83d\udc47\n\n1.
