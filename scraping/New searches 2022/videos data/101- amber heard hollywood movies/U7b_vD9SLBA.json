            "description": "Amber Heard got herself into some trouble. The actress, known for movies such as Magic Mike and 3 Days to Kill, is facing charges of illegally sneaking her dogs into Australia. Amber is pleading not guilty in hopes that she won't be convicted. The actress, who is married to Johnny Depp, is being accused of transporting the animals via private jet and falsifying documents which violates Australia's security law. Amber released a statement through her lawyer. It sounds like Johnny Depp's wife knows she wasn't supposed to bring dogs into the country the way she did. But there was a misunderstanding at the time. It's not a little issue though. If Amber is found guilty, she faces up to 10 years in prison and a $75,000 fine.\n\nSubscribe to the New You channel: http://bit.ly/1MceRAl\nFor the latest trends and videos, visit: Newyou.com\nLike New You on Facebook: New You Media\nFollow New You on Twitter: @newyoumedia\nLike New You on Instagram: @newyoumedia\n\nCredit: Splash News",
