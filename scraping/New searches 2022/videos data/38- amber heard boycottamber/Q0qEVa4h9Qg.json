            "description": "\"BOYCOTT AMBER!\" Disney Considering Amber Heard For An MCU Role | Celebrity Craze\n\nDisney is seriously considering Amber Heard for a role in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Are they unaware there is a petition with thousands of signatures that want to remove her from Aquaman 2? Seems like a terrible decision to even throw Amber Heard's name in the pot. Especially with everything she has going on in court with Johnny Depp.\n\nWith the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. \n\nEver since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.\n\nNow it turns out that Amber Heard may have not written the statement or OP ED in accusations against Johnny Depp. This could another case of defamation or fraud.
