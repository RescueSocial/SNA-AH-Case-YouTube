            "description": "It was a red massacre!  The world is talking about Amber Heard's relentless pounding she delivered on Nina Dobrev in her inaugural CWWL match.  I've not seen someone hit opponents with as much force and stamina, with the exception of current champion, Scarlett Johansson.  She's already drawing comparisons to the unshakable, Johansson.  Heard has some more business to take care of before she's considered the upper echelon of wrestlers, but many are impressed with her introduction.  She'll look to continue her onslaught against another recent newbie, Adriana Lima.  Although Lima is still looking for her 1st victory, she has had several moments that impress.  The towering model just needs to put it all together and user her colossal frame to her advantage.  This match should be a grind. #WWE 2K20 #wwe 2k20 gameplay #wwe 2k celebrity",
