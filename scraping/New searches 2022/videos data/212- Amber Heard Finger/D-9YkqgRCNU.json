Johnny was spotted wearing a new gold band on his left ring finger when he attended the premiere of his new flick \"Mortdecai\" in Los Angeles on Wednesday, January 21. \n\nJohnny and Amber were recently rocked by split rumors. However earlier this month, the couple shot the rumors down by sharing an affectionate kiss at the 8th Annual Heaven Gala presented by The Art of Elysium and Samsung in Los Angeles. \n\nBack in April, Johnny confirmed his engagement to Amber when promoting his movie \"Transcendence\" in Beijing. He said he was wearing a woman's engagement ring on his left ring finger. \"The fact that I'm wearing a chick's ring on my finger is probably a dead giveaway,\" he shared, \"Not very subtle.\"",
