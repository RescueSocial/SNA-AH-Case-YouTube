According to spokespeople for the actress, the injury occurred when the newlyweds were staying at a villa in Australia. Depp, allegedly drunk and high on ecstasy, raged around, breaking bottles and windows, and then ruined a plastic phone. In the process, he cut off a chunk of his forefinger. This new report and the published photos come only days after a video was released in which Depp is seen smashing bottles, slamming around a kitchen and criticizing Heard.\n\n\u25baCircle us on Google + http://goo.gl/TXeBfX\n\u25baSubscribe Channel http://goo.gl/mqt0wI\n\u25baDon't forget to Like * Comment * Share this video.\n----------------------------------------\u00ad--------------------------------\nStay tuned, Stay connected",
