            "description": "My name is Brandon Thron. As you may know, I am the father of two\nbeautiful twin daughters, Amber and Jade. Unfortunately, my little\ngirls were born both with a very rare defect called Goldenhar\nSyndrome. This condition causes numerous birth defects including\nincomplete development of the ear and unfortunate cranial and facial\ndefects.\n\nThroughout their young lives they've had to undergo through an\nabundance of surgeries to help with these defects. However, they are\nboth missing one ear on opposite sides of their faces. Several years\nago, on Oprah and the Discovery Channel, I saw a man named Robert R.\nBarron, a former Senior CIA Disguise Specialist, committed to\nrestoring identities through prosthetic devices. I searched for his\nemail, sent him my daughter's story, and within 2 hours he called me.\nWe had an enlightening conversation, that gave their mother and I\nhope. Together, we decided that instead of our daughters going through\nnumerous failed surgeries, trying to reconstruct and ear, that Dr.\nBarron's prosthetic ears would be the best for them.\n\nUnfortunately insurance doesn't cover this, and each ear is over\n$5,000. I'm sure you understand, we've had many medical expenses and\nan additional $10,000 is hard to save. My daughters have reached the\nideal age for Dr. Barron's surgery, so I decided to start a fundraiser\nto possibly raise the funds needed to help my daughters get ears so\nthey can walk around with 2 ears just like all the other little girls.\n\nAmber and Jade are two of the happiest little girls you'll see, but as\nthey get older, and start to be more aware of their condition, they\nwill come across many hurtful comments and questions about their\ncondition and defects. We just want our daughters to live as\nnormal as a life as possible with the least amount of hurt feelings,\npain, and worry. \n\nThank you all for your time and support. WE DID IT!\nBrandon Thron AKA Sugarfoot, Amber Leigh Thron, and Jade Lynn Thron",
