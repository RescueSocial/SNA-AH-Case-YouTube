            "description": "Last week, when Amber Heard filed for divorce from Johnny Depp, the story initially seemed like just another dissolution of a celebrity misalliance. But the news quickly became uglier: Heard alleged that Depp had abused her during their brief marriage and filed for a restraining order against him as Depp's latest family-friendly movie, Alice Through the Looking Glass, opened over the Memorial Day weekend.\n\nAnd Tuesday, Heard's divorce lawyers said that she had gone to the Los Angeles police department to give a formal statement, even though previously \"Amber did not provide (an initial) statement to the LAPD in an attempt to protect her privacy and Johnny's career.\"\n\nIn recent years, we have become inured to stories about famous men accused of domestic or sexual violence. But Heard's decision first to not go to the police and then to give a statement is one of the best illustrations of why actually getting these men to trial would be good not only for the larger causes of justice and gender equity, but also for an industry that has flailed and failed in response to serious allegations against famous men.\n\nFirst, it's important to acknowledge that Heard is in a complicated position: Because she and Depp didn't sign a prenuptial agreement, his future earnings could have an impact on any spousal support she might receive. And given Depp's position as one of Disney's most reliable box office anchors, the amount of money at stake is significant.\n\nBut looking at the issue more broadly, the fact that so few famous men accused of grave misdeeds even go to trial makes it much harder to set a bright line for what the entertainment industry shouldn't tolerate.\n\nI understand the arguments many advocates make that Hollywood shouldn't give enormous sums and great prestige to people accused of grave misdeeds. And in certain circumstances, I think companies should certainly move immediately when such allegations become public. Even setting aside the liability issues, no child actor should have to work with a co-star, director or crew member who has been accused of child abuse until it can be sure that the child actor is absolutely safe on set.",
