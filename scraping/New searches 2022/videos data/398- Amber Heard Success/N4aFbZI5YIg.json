            "description": "The ILR-33 \u201cAmber\u201d (\u201cBursztyn\u201d) rocket of the Institute of Aviation which utilises innovative green propulsion, underwent a demonstration flight at the firing range in Drawsko Pomorskie, Poland in October 2017. The test was a success, reaching the 15 km ceiling. The maximum possible reach of the rocket, however, is several times higher, and the maximum speed is over 1200 m/s. The Polish rocket is the world\u2019s first that uses 98% hydrogen peroxide.\n\nThe official presentation of the project results was held on November 27, 2017 at the Institute of Aviation in Warsaw. The ILR-33 \u201cAmber\u201d rocket is the flagship project of the Center of Space Technologies of the Institute of Aviation, implemented under the statutory program.",
