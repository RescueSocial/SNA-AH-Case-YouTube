            "description": "The official music video for HUGEL's new single \"Mamma Mia\" feat. Amber van Day! \nGet the track here: http://wmg.click/Hugel_MammaMiaAY \n\nHUGEL - Warner Music\nFrench DJ Producer Songwriter \n\nSocial Media: Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/hugelthug/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hugelmusic/\nSnapchat: HugelThug\nSoundcloud: https://soundcloud.com/hugelmusic \n\nBooking World: Creative Artists Agency\nMaria.may@caa.com\n\nManagement: Stefan Dabruck\nstefan@s-d-management.com\nmaurice@s-d-management.com\nshelsea@s-d-management.com\n\nPicture a hot night in the club, the party machinery is running at full speed and with every progressing hour, people are letting their hair down a little more. Let\u2019s briefly sum up tonight\u2019s impressions so far, shall we: \u201cAss, titties, shots, ass, titties, drink\u201d. And now this: a monster drop, hitting you right in the face and obliterating the dancefloor for a brief moment of eternity. \n\nWelcome to \u201cMamma Mia\u201d, the new single by HUGEL. Said lyrics can actually be heard in the song, delivered by Amber Van Day, who already featured in his last smasher \u201cWTF\u201d. Once again, her sexy, self-assured doesn\u2019t fail to impress. Which is also owed to the song\u2019s explicit lyrics, of course. In \u201cMamma Mia\u201d, HUGEL takes a dig at the shallow consumer- and party culture he witnesses every day playing the world\u2019s top clubs. The world, he seems to tell us, is material and shallow. So let\u2019s at least have a good party!\n\nAn outrageously good funk sample by James Brown, Prince-esque guitar licks and a wind section make for the foundation of this song, soon culminating in a foghorn drop you won\u2019t get out of your head. Just like that Gucci bag you saw in that boutique earlier. Or was it Balenciaga? Doesn\u2019t matter: \u201cGucci Gang (Na na na) / Diamonds on me (Na na na) / More champagne papi\u201d, Amber Van Day reminds us that our glass is empty yet again. Refill and proceed!",
