            "description": "Amber Gott, Online Community Manager for LastPass.com joins Jim and Rich to talk about online password management and security. Online security has always been a hot topic, and it's only going to be more so as time goes on. With that in mind, there's never been a better time to look at how you're handling your online presence, specifically the passwords you use for site logins, be it a gaming site or commerce such as  Amazon.com.\n\nTo start with, people are known to use the same password across multiple sites because it's hard remembering all the site/password combinations. Or there's a similar reason.  Quite often, they use very simple passwords that are easily guessable. Passwords such as '123456' and 'password' are just plain horrible choices.  Dictionary-based passwords such as 'smellycat' are not much better.  They're way too obvious and lack any level of complexity that would prevent someone from cracking them. So this presents a huge security hole, one that could cause a lot of heartache, not to mention significant financial loss. And yes, this stuff really happens. Every single day!\n\nThis is where LastPass comes in. LastPass is a secure password manager that integrates with your favorite browser for the purpose of managing online sites and passwords. It stores those sites and passwords in an encrypted vault which you alone can access. All that's required of you is to remember one master password. And while you're at it, you really ought to make it a complex password, one with at least 8-characters, though longer is better. \n\n...because this password is the key to your online kingdom.  Oh, and you'd best not forget it because LastPass keeps no record of your password whatsoever. That's right.  There is no 'answer a secret question for a password reset' workaround.  And this is by design.  Your master password stays with you. When type it in, it works with the encryption algorithm to encrypt or decrypt your vault locally, i.e., the process takes place  right there on your computer.  Not online.   That means you never have to worry about someone at LastPass accessing your vault.  They wouldn't, of course, but more that that, they can't.  You alone hold that master password.\n\nAnd what about credit card numbers and shipping information? Don't you dislike typing out all that stuff when making an online purchase?  LastPass has that covered there. Create a new Form Fill Profile to hold such personal information as name, address, gender, birthday, SSN, credit card number, bank account routing number, and any related notes you'd like, and LastPass safely stores this alongside your passwords in the vault.\n\nLastPass offers free and paid subscription versions.  The subscription is dirt cheap at $12/year.  What do you gain?  Take a look at this comparison page, and you'll see that phone/mobile apps are one additional feature.  Yubikey support is another. Yubikey provides one a number of ways to implement multi-factor authentication which provides an extra layer of security for logging into LastPass when you're at less than ideal location such as a hotel, public library, or any open wi-fi.\n\nIs it time to secure your online life?  You bet it is.  So head over to https://lastpass.com and get started by hitting the Download LastPass button and grabbing the installer.  Once you're done with installation and setup, take the LastPass Security Challenge.  That'll show you just where you stand with your own online password security, and what you can do to improve it.\n\nYou're going to love the \"...password manager that makes browsing easier and more secure.\"\n\nhttp://theAverageGuy.tv",
