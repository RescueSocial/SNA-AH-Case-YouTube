Her parents had passed away, and she had no children, save for her beloved two small dogs. Amber grew up in Fairfax, California, but her love of exploring and visiting new places brought her to paradise in 2000, when she packed up her life and moved to Hawaii\u2019s fourth largest island, Kauai, where there were plenty of beaches to wander, and rainforests to explore. There she lived happily for a decade, but on July 3rd, 2010, Amber\u2019s decomposing remains were found in a remote ravine, and responding law enforcement officials knew that Amber\u2019s life had ended due to foul play, more specifically, a great deal of blunt force trauma to her head and face.\n\nWebsite: CrimeWeeklyPodcast.com\nInstagram: @CrimeWeeklyPod\nTwitter: @CrimeWeeklyPod\nFacebook: @CrimeWeeklyPod\n\nStephanie's Social Media\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/stephanieharlowe/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/steph_harlowe\n\nDerrick's Social Media:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/derricklevasseur/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/derrickl\n\nJohn's (Editor) Social Media:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/johnnynezz/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/johnnynezz",
