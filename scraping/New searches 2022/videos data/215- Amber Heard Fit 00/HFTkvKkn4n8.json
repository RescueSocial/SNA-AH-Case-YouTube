I am excited to share my journey of living a healthier life style with you.  I hope that by sharing my story, I can encourage you to become healthy with the ultimate goal of improving your quality of life. For years I struggled with defining Gods purpose for my life.  I knew that I enjoyed helping people, however I realized that I needed to narrow my focus, so I did a little soul searching to figure out the best way I could serve others.  My answer didn\u2019t come quick, and needless to say I had no idea that I was about to embark on a journey that would shake me at my core. \n\n More about that later\u2026.. \n\n \n\nI started juicing and creating smoothie recipes in 2013. Just for fun. I did this almost every day in my kitchen.  After about a year, I slowly got pulled away from my juicing ritual due to increasing demands from my job and a hectic work schedule.  I stopped juicing for almost a year.  I just could never find the time- \n\n \n\nIn 2015, I starting having joint pains throughout my body, but I thought that it was due to me being tired, and that I just needed to stretch.  I also noticed that I was sleepy ALL THE TIME\u2026even after getting 8 hours of sleep.  My pain increased and became so severe that it hurt for me to walk, sit, get up, flush the toilet, bathe, drive, open doors and get dressed.  Basically\u2026every joint in my body hurt. \n\n \n\nAfter a year of going to several specialist including 3 different Rheumatologist, I finally got my diagnosis\u2026rheumatoid arthritis. As you can imagine, to get this diagnosis at 26 years old, I was devastated.  I couldn\u2019t understand how and why I developed this disease when there was no known history of it in my family.  \n\n \n\nI was literally unhappy for months\u2026 but I didn\u2019t stay there.  It was time to put ME first. I decided that I would fight. \n\n \n\n I was determined to beat this disease, even though I was told that there was not a cure.  I started doing my research, and was amazed to learn about the link between diet and certain diseases. \n\nThen it suddenly came to me\u2026..JUICING!!! So the BEAST reminded me of the BEAUTY of juicing. \n\n \n\nI am excited to report that my health has made a dramatic turnaround since I started back juicing and modifying my diet.   I am well on the way to putting my RA into remission\u2014I no longer have joint pain. I am also proud to say that I found a passion\u2026so let me help you discover your \u201chealthier self\u201d by trying out my delicious juices and smoothies. I am so thankful for all of your support and positive feedback.",
