We'll tell you right off the bat it's probably something you didn't expect. Over a upbeat, piano driven instrumental, Wiz's boo sings about her life in the public eye. Instead of firing back at the critics, the bald beauty explains her journey to  the limelight. I'm sure folks will focus on the fact they can keep up with the beat so, by industry standards, that makes this an okay song.  As for her vocal ability, we can't really tell when there's auto-tune and production masking it. \n\nAmber said she's taking vocal lessons:\n\"I have my own unique sound, I make music that I love and I hope that my fans and the people that embrace me will love it also!  I've taken vocal lessons and I'm working on my album, but right now I'm in the beginning phases and I'm just taking my time.\"",
