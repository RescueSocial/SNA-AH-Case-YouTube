            "description": "Johnny Depp is innocent, and he deserves justice from Amber Heard and her lies & false allegations!! There has been no evidence to prove Amber Heard has experience abuse from Johnny Depp. There has been more proof against her claims, showing she was the abuser and Johnny Depp has been the victim in this situation! Amber Heard has actually had a history of domestic abuse, while former lovers of Johnny Depp have spoke out in defense of him. There have been audio logs come out, showing evidence that Amber Heard was abusive towards Johnny Depp and not the other way around. As well as a petition on Change.org, requesting Heard to be removed from the upcoming Aquaman 2 film. \n\nSources: \nAmber Heard arrested in 2009 for abuse\nhttps://bit.ly/3kPrNk8\n\nFormer Johnny Depp partners Winona Ryder & Vanessa Paradis defend Depp\nhttps://bit.ly/3kQLw2N\n\nAmber Heard Arguing With Johnny Depp Full Audio\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiuUzvZMyro\n\nRemove Amber Heard from Aquaman 2 petition\nhttps://www.change.org/p/dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2\n\nOther Videos\nYouTube's new Terms of Service is doo doo (TOS changes)\nhttps://youtu.be/Uh8gKarTIyk\n\nWhy Was This Video Age Restricted?\nhttps://youtu.be/iwuvY47pj0E\n\nMy First Week with the PS5\nhttps://youtu.be/FY3Yx9BDB3c\n\nAmazon UK is stealing PS5's\nhttps://youtu.be/qZaPG_fCjQM\n\nPS5 & Xbox Scalpers Are Being Robbed\nhttps://youtu.be/GXtcZSfrA20\n\nSome AMAZING Minecraft Creations\nhttps://youtu.be/y3_bC4ftXXs\n\nFedex is Supposedly Stealing PlayStation 5's\nhttps://youtu.be/EDiuLg0M3WE\n\nThe Winter Edition Arctic Berry Red Bull Taste Test/Review!\nhttps://youtu.be/ClAEhf3ilgQ\n\nThe 50/50 Reddit Challenge!
