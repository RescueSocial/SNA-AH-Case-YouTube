            "description": "She was pictured keeping a low profile in a car with Heidi Klum's ex-boyfriend, art dealer, Vito Schnabel, on Tuesday.  And Amber Heard, 32, appeared in high spirits as she headed onto a boat in Cannes at the 71st annual Film Festival on Thursday.  She wore a knitted white vest top which was low-cut in design as she made her way down the promenade in 22 degree heat.  The number was tucked into a pair of high-waisted baggy trousers as she walked along with her hands tucked into her pockets.  Her blonde locks were styled into loose curls as she battled a little wind as she neared the water.  And she kindly posed for snaps with fans as she made the most of her day in the sunshine.  The night before, Amber wore a sensational gold knitted dress as she headed out in France, less than a day after being seen out with Vito, 31.  The Rum Diaries actress, who last dated entrepreneur Elon Musk and was married to Johnny Depp before that was seen in a car with Vito in New York on Tuesday.  The duo appeared deep in conversation while traveling somewhere in an SUV and ducked down out of sight after spotting onlookers.  Schnabel dated America's Got Talent star Klum, 44, off and on from 2014 until 2017.  Meanwhile, Amber's ex Elon Musk has a new lady in his life.  The Tesla founder made things official with musician Grimes as they graced Monday night's Met Gala in NYC.",
