Moor ruled Tuesday that the hearing will begin Aug. 17, two days later than planned. Moor ordered the delay after concluding the hearing may take up to five days.\r\nThe domestic violence allegations are one aspect of the actors' contentious divorce. Heard filed to divorce Depp on May 23, and a few days later obtained a temporary restraining order after accusing the actor of repeatedly hitting her during a fight in their Los Angeles apartment.\r\nDepp's lawyer has denied the allegations, and she said Tuesday he wants the hearing concluded as quickly as possible. \"This is weighing heavily on my client,\" attorney Laura Wasser said.\r\nIf Heard prevails, the restraining order against Depp could be extended for up to five years.\r\nHeard wants to call Depp as a hostile witness during the proceedings.\r\nMoor ordered Heard to sit for a deposition on Friday and Depp to give sworn testimony in advance of the hearing on Saturday.\r\nDepp will not be allowed to attend Heard's deposition, Moor ruled.\r\nHeard accused Depp of repeatedly hitting her and throwing a cellphone during a fight in their Los Angeles apartment in May. A judge ordered Depp to not contact Heard and stay 100 yards away from her.\r\nLos Angeles police responded to their apartment, but the person who made the call declined to file charges and officers determined no crime occurred.\r\nHeard has alleged in court filings that Depp abuse throughout their relationship, which started after they met on the set of the 2011 film \"The Rum Diary.\"\r\n\r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives \u200b\u200b\r\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/11a5adcb3af16ad83607e2ab7685287d",
