Akshat takes the credit as he had only gifted the guitar to Dhara. Sonia passes sarcastic comments to Akshat, Amber and Dhara.\n\nAbout The Amber Dhara :\n------------------------------------------\nAmber, Dhara are conjoined twins yet are as different as chalk and cheese. Amber Dhara is a bittersweet tale of survival, ambitions, music, and understanding, and most importantly: unconditional love. Abandoned by their father, since the two sisters are joint at the hips, Amber [Sky] and Dhara [Earth] are raised by their mother and grandfather in the idyllic hilly town of Panchgani. From birth, life for these girls has always been a challenge since people stare at them and jeer at their deformities. However, their mother is determined to make them independent and successful. Amber Dhara is a story of a courageous journey where the twins survive various challenges and meet people- good, bad, and ugly. The show emphasizes human values, compassion, and a persistent struggle against all odds.",
