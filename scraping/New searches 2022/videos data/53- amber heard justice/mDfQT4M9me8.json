            "description": "Justice League \u2013 First look at Amber Heard as Mera\n\nIt\u2019s all or nothing at this point for Warner Bros. and DC Comics with their cinematic superhero universe. It\u2019s not as if their films haven\u2019t been financially successful so far, but they\u2019ve taken a critical bludgeoning at the box office thanks to rampant studio inteference and an unclear direction. Justice League on the other hand, is looking to change all that. Zack Snyder\u2019s big team-up movie is going to feature all manner of heroes, from brutal billionaires who get confused for owls through to titanc tsunami crushers of the deep.\nAnd a few supporting characters added to the mix as well. IGN revealed the first look at Aquaman\u2019s greatest ally, as Amber Heard suited up in some regal armour for a smackdown:\n\nDamn, that looks utterly fantastic. Say what you like about Snyder, but his production usually includes some utterly fantastic costume design. In the DC Comics source material, Mera happens to be the wife of Aquaman and queen of Atlantis. She\u2019s also a formidable fighter, able to match blows with heavyweight foes thanks to her unique biology that allows her to survive the crushing pressure of the ocean depths.\nBut it\u2019s her skill with Hydrokinesis that really makes her dangerous. Mera can increase the density of water around her, essentially hardening it and reshaping it into various combat-effective shapes which she can smash into enemies. She\u2019s basically a waterbender then. Anyway, that\u2019s a fantastic first look at the Atlantean queen, although don\u2019t expect her to have too much of a role to play in Justice League.\n\nAmber Heard\u2019s Mera will however, be far more prominent in James Wan\u2019s Aquaman movie, which kicks off filming next year. As for Justice League, that\u2019s currently still on track for a November 2017 release. And hopefully it doesn\u2019t blow its reveal load before then with too much hype this time. Nothing wrong with keeping a few of those reveals secret, ya dig?\n\n#Justice League\n#First look at Amber Heard as Mera\n\n\nJustice League \u2013 First look at Amber Heard as Mera\nLazygamerJustice League \u2013 First look at Amber Heard as Mera\nJustice League: Exclusive First Look at Amber Heard as Mera\nJustice League: Exclusive First Look at Amber Heard as Mera\n'Justice League': First Look at Amber Heard as Mera, Queen of Atlantis",
