            "description": "Could Dolphin or Ya'Wara Replace Amber Heard's Mera in Aquaman 2?\n\nThe Johnny Depp / Amber Heard drama's got a lot of people wondering if WB will replace Amber Heard in Aquaman 2. (Or just hoping for it.) \n\nI don't know if that's going to happen, but if it does, Aquaman's going to need a new love interest in his sequel, or at least a new female lead anyway.\n\nIn the comics, two of his other flames have been Dolphin and Ya'Wara. Either of these two ladies could wind up in his sequel if Mera's MIA.\n\nI discuss in this video, so check it out. \n\nPlease subscribe to the channel and leave a comment below!\n\nFOLLOW ME ON TWITTER: https://twitter.com/HiltonCollins\nFOLLOW ME ON INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/hiltoncollins/\n\n#mera #aquaman2 #amberheard",
