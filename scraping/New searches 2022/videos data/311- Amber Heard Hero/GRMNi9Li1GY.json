As such, Heard decided to call it quits with the cinematographer.\n\n\u201cAmber isn\u2019t going to back down when it comes to Johnny. She\u2019s consumed with this battle. But between that and all her other responsibilities, it\u2019s really taking a toll,\u201d the source said.\n\nThe insider also claimed that Heard has been very busy filming for Aquaman 2 in England that\u2019s why she has not seen Butti for quite some time. This, plus the arrival of her new baby made it impossible for the couple to spend quality time together.\n\n\u201cAmber\u2019s been stretched to the limit with all the demands on her. She\u2019s working extremely long hours and doesn\u2019t like to rely on nannies if she can help it. But she\u2019s running on empty \u2013 especially since she\u2019s living out of a suitcase half the time,\u201d the source said.\n\nThe insider said that there\u2019s no doubt that Heard and Butti loved each other deeply. However, now is just not the right time for the actress to be in a committed relationship. After all, there are just too many things going on in her life right now.\n\n\u201cAmber is going through so much with the court battle. It was really hard for her to be totally available to Bianca. It\u2019s a sad and stressful time for Amber right now, especially with legal bills hitting her hard and knowing her ex has made it his life\u2019s mission to destroy her with everything he\u2019s got,\u201d the source said.\n\nEarlier this month, multiple publications revealed that Heard and Butti already called it quits. And most of them said that the exes\u2019 busy schedule and the fact that they were on different continents was one of the reasons why their love fizzled out, according to Daily Mail.\n\n**************************************************\nEmail \ud83d\udd3b\nFor general contact - three.thinker03@gmail.com\n**************************************************\n\ud83c\udfb8 Related Tags: \nupdated news,news 24,USA news,today news,all update news,lastest news,american news,update live news usa,today latest news,Hot news,news today,latest news,breakingnews,breaking news,Amber Heard,Bianca Butti,amber heard,johnny depp amber heard,amber heard johnny depp,johnny depp and amber heard,johnny depp,amber heard and girlfriend bianca butti,bianca butti,Amber Heard Allegedly Split From Girlfriend Bianca Butti\n*************************************************\n\ud83d\udc49Disclaimer : \nThis video was created with the aim to educate and inspire its audience.
