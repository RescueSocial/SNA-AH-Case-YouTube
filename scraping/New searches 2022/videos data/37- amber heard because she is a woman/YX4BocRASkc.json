            "description": "Subscribe to YouTube! \u25ba http://ow.ly/LC9yE\n\nTwitter \u25ba https://twitter.com/backstageol\nFacebook \u25bahttps://www.facebook.com/BackstageOL\n\nDave Morales sits down with director Tom Hooper, Matthias Schoenaerts and Amber Heard to take you backstage with THE DANISH GIRL.\n\nSynopsis:\n\nThe Danish Girl is the remarkable love story inspired by the lives of Lili Elbe and Gerda Wegener, portrayed in the film respectively by Academy Award winner Eddie Redmayne (The Theory of Everything) and Alicia Vikander (Ex Machina), directed by Academy Award winner Tom Hooper (The King\u2019s Speech, Les Mis\u00e9rables).\n\nIn 1926 in Copenhagen, artist Einar Wegener is married to Gerda Wegener and is revered for landscape paintings. Gerda is also an artist, less renowned but steadily working as a portraitist of prominent citizens. Theirs is a strong and loving marriage, yet personal and professional epiphanies have eluded them both.\n\nThat all begins to change one day when, on deadline for a portrait, Gerda asks her husband to fill in for a model by putting on a dress so that she can finish the painting. The experience is transformative, as Einar soon realizes that being Lili is an expression of her truest self, and she begins living her life as a woman. Gerda unexpectedly finds that she has a new muse, and renewed creative ferment. But the couple soon brush up against society\u2019s disapproval.\n\nThey leave their homeland for the more open-minded world of Paris. There, it is Gerda\u2019s career that continues to flourish. The couple\u2019s marriage evolves \u2013 and not without strain. But again and again Gerda supports Lili during her journey as a transgender woman. Through the other, each of them finds the courage to be who they are at heart.",
