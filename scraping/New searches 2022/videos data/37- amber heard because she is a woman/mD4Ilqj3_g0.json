            "description": "Once again there is another media mogul joining the ranks of the Celebrity Women's Wrestling League.  Amber Heard has been surrounded by some controversy during her acting career, and seems a suitable addition to a league pervasive with dissension.  Heard indicated she wanted to start her CWWL career with no biases and wants to focus on becoming the best wrestler she can be. Lets see what she brings to the table as she is formally introduced to the CWWL against a formidable veteran, Nina Dobrev. Nina has been involved in some controversy herself of late.  After a pin loss to Hailee Steinfeld, Becky G ambushed Hailee to show her displeasure with her victory.  What was the impetus behind that distressing event?  Did Nina have some involvement?  Answers are hard to come by in a league riddled lately with backstabbing.",
