We cannot interact with our everyday life in the same way we interact with a desktop computer.\n\nTechnology shouldn\u2019t require all of our attention, just some of it, and only when necessary. Calm technology describes a state of technological maturity where a user\u2019s primary task is not computing, but being human. The idea behind Calm Technology is to have smarter people, not things.\n\nThe terms calm computing and calm technology were coined in 1995 by PARC Researchers Mark Weiser and John Seely Brown in reaction to the increasing complexities that information technologies were creating. The aim of Calm Technology is to provide principles that follow the human lifestyle and environment in mind, allowing technology to amplify humanness instead of taking it away.\n\nThe difference between an annoying technology and one that is helpful is how it engages our attention.
