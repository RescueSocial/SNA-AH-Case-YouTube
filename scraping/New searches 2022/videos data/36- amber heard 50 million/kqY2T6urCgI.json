The 50 million dollar defamation trial of Johnny against his ex-wife, Amber has been postponed to 11th April 2022 which means that we have one more year of listening to this drama. Now, we all know that the case started in confusion and most of us didn\u2019t know who was telling the truth but as it continues to unfold, many people are slowly realizing who the actual victim is. In fact, most of the people who were team Amber have joined team Johnny. So, as we wait for the court to give its verdict, let us look at all the evidence pointing towards Amber not only lying, but also being the violent one towards Johnny.\n\nAmber asked her former employee to lie under oath\nMany people have come forward to accuse Amber Heard of being a pathological liar. Apart from Johnny Depp\u2019s lawyer, David Sherborne, who called Amber Heard an unreliable witness and a compulsive liar, Johnny and Amber\u2019s former employees have also come forward to expose just how far Amber\u2019s dishonesty can go. Kevin Murphy, Johnny Depp\u2019s former estate manager said that Amber Heard asked him to lie under oath after she was charged with bringing her two dogs to Australia illegally in May 2015. Murphy went on to say:\n\nShe wanted me to say essentially that it was my fault in one way or another that the paperwork wasn\u2019t completed so that I could take the blame for her.\n\nA lawyer then asked Murphy why he didn\u2019t go to Mr. Depp to ask him to intervene and this is what Murphy had to say:\n\nBecause Amber wielded a lot of power and would have made my life miserable.\n\nAmber pocketed her 7 million dollar divorce settlement\nIn 2016, Amber received a 7 million dollar divorce settlement from Johnny Depp. She then pledged to give the entire sum to charity. She in fact released a statement saying:\n\nAs described in the restraining order and divorce settlement, money played no role for me personally and never has, except to the extent that I could donate it to charity and, in doing so, hopefully, help those less able to defend themselves. As reported in the media, the amount received in the divorce was 7 million dollars, and 7 million dollars is being donated.\n\nAmber was supposed to donate half of that money to the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation and the other half to the children\u2019s hospital in Los Angeles. However, Johnny recently made claims that Amber kept the 7 million dollar settlement that she had promised to give to charity. The ACLU refused to comment on whether they received any money from Amber Heard but the L A\u2019s children\u2019s hospital has brought documents that show that the hospital has received one hundred thousand dollars which is a far cry from the promised 3.5 million dollars.\n\nAmber\u2019s legal team was also forced to admit that to this day, Amber hasn\u2019t given the 7 million dollars she pledged to give to charity in 2016 claiming that Amber has already been responsible for seven figures in donations to charitable causes and intends to continue to contribute and eventually fulfill her pledge.\n\nAmber faked her injuries.\nIn May 2016, Amber was photographed with visible bruising on her face while making a court appearance. She claimed at the time that the bruises were from an attack by Johnny. . She used this story to get a restraining order against Johnny Depp. However, according to the court documents filed by Johnny in 2019, not only had Amber lied about him physically hurting her, but she also went as far as to fake her bruises for her highly publicized court appearance. Johnny\u2019s statement read:\n\nI have denied Ms. Heard\u2019s allegations vehemently since she first made them in May 2016 when she walked into court to obtain a temporary restraining order with painted-on bruises that witnesses and surveillance footage showed she did not possess each day of the preceding week.\n\n#BluffCentral #AmberHeard #JohnnyDepp #JusticeForJohnnyDepp #AmberHeardAbuser #MeToo",
