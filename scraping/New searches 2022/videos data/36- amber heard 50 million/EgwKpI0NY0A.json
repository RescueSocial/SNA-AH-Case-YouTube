            "description": "\"Johnny Depp's AMAZING\" Keira Knightley DEFENDS Johnny Depp! TRASHES AMBER HEARD! | The Gossipy\n\nKeira Knightley has come out to defend Johnny Depp. Johnny Depp recently lost his libel case against The Sun magazine which labeled him a abuser. However, he is still not yet done in court. Not only has he appealed the verdict, but he is also pursuing a 50 million dollar defamation case in Virginia against Amber Heard, his ex-wife. This case has had some recent developments whereby Depp will be required to turn over communications with his ex-lovers who include Keira Knightley, Angelina Jolie and Marion Cottillard.\n\nWith the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. \n\nEver since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.\n\n#AmberHeard #JohnnyDepp #KeiraKnightley\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWelcome toThe Gossipy.
