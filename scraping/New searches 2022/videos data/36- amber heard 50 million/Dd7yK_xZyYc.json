Since her acrimonious split from Hollywood star Johnny Depp in 2016, she's been linked to several high profile male suitors.\u00a0\u00a0But on Sunday, Amber Heard engaged in some very public affection with a galpal in Palms Springs.The pair were seen kissing as they left a hotel in the upscale Southern California resort town before engaging in some heavy PDA in Heard's vintage Ford Mustang car.   The Aquaman star, who was in a four-year relationship with photographer Tasya van Ree before falling for Depp on the set of 2011's Rum Diary, laughed and joked with her friend as they waited for the hotel valet to bring round her car. The mystery woman is Bianca Butti, a cinematographer based in Los Angeles.\u00a0They appeared to be looking at something on a phone before Butti placed a hand tenderly on Heard's hip and moved in for a kiss.Heard, 33, reciprocated, closing her eyes and leaning towards her 38-year-old girlfriend.   Heard looked casually stylish in a baggy plaid shirt and blue skinny jeans ripped at the knees.The blonde, who left her long hair loose, wore a white lace-up ankle boot on her right foot and a medical boot on her left.It's not known how the actress suffered an injury but she has been wearing the boot since the beginning of the year.\u00a0Butti had on a cropped white sweater under a black knit cardigan and added turquoise pants and dark sneakers.She completed her look with a gray fedora over her long dark hair.  Heard is still dealing with the fall out from her breakup with Depp, whom she married in 2015. Their divorce was finalized in January 2017.She accused the Pirates Of The Caribbean star of domestic violence when they broke up and he filed a $50 million defamation suit against her after she wrote about her experience of being an abused spouse in an op-ed published in The Washington Post.\u00a0Heard has claimed that Depp threw a cell phone at her which hit her face. She then took out a restraining order against him.\u00a0Last month, it was reported that the judge in the defamation case had sided with Depp and will allow deposition testimony from two LAPD officers who responded to the couple's home on the night of the incident.\u00a0Officers testified under oath they did not see any injuries to Heard's face when they saw her on the night of May 21, 2016.\u00a0The defamation case is headed to trial sometime in 2020.\u00a0   Following the end of her marriage to Depp, Heard started dating tech entrepreneur and Tesla CEO Elon Musk.They were together for several months before calling it quits in early 2018.Musk is now dating Canadian singer Grimes who announced last week that she is expecting a baby..By March 2019, Schnabel was out and in was Argentinian director Andy Muschietti who helmed the 2013 h",
