We give you a closer look in the lives of celebrities like Kanye West, Ed Sheeran, The Rock, Jay Z, Selena Gomez, Kylie Jenner, Kim Kardashian, Rihanna and 100s more.\n\nFor 5 years now, Johnny Depp and his ex-wife Amber Heard have been jawing back and forth at each other to get an advantage in court on numerous cases that have been filed by them at each other. \n\nJohnny Depp filed a Defamation Suit against Heard for $50 million and she filed a countersuit worth $100 million. That case is still going on and has been delayed until 2022 due to the pandemic pushing back scheduling. \n\nBut even though that\u2019s going on, there are some things that aren\u2019t adding up in Heard\u2019s defense.
