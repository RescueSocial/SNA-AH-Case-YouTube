But of course, the Pirates off the Caribbean actor didn\u2019t win it alone the lawsuit but with the help of the mounting number of celebrities backing him up. So, what do they have to say?\n\nThe very long and tough divorce proceeding has finally reached new heights when the actor Johnny Depp and his legal team seized an opportunity when actress Amber Heard claims that she did truly donate all of the seven million dollars of Depp's settlement money to charity. The opportunity presented gave Depp a breakthrough in their persistent efforts to prove that the money is indeed not going any near to the charity she claimed. But his win only started to see the light of day when a New York court decision was in favor of the actor, effectively validating Johnny Depp's petition request. His appeal would mean mean that the ACLU will now have to submit documentation papers proving that Amber Heard gave the money she claimed to donate, to the charitorganization. Johnny Depp didn\u2019t celebrate this victory alone, fans were ecstatic hearing this news, and his lawyers finally breath a sigh of relief, all considering the court ruling a win for Depp. This was a breakthrough in the expensive divorce procedure in both the United States and England especially after his defeat in the United Kingdom against the lawsuit he filed against The Sun. As most of you may know, Dep suffered from a staggering loss against the tabloid company in a defamation suit in November, when the publishing company labeled him in their 2018 headlines as a \u201cwife-beater\u201d, undoubtedly angering Depp. The headlines caught eyes of thousands of people since it was because Heard accused Depp in Los Angeles in 2016 for abusing the actress. The famous tabloid and the editor of the news won the case in the end, considering that the \u201cvictim\u201d Amber Heard was their number one witness forcing the High court of London to give the win to the company. The judge also took into account that most, if not all, of Heard\u2019s sexual harassment claims said in the news published by the company, checked out. After losing the law suit, it was time to go back home to America for the divorcees.\n\n\nThe dispute was continued in Virginia where Depp made the claims in an interview that, \u201cShe was the perpetrator, and I was the victim\u201d, he continues saying \u201cWhile mixing prescription amphetamines and non-prescription drugs with alcohol, Heard hit, punched and kicked me. She also repeatedly and frequently threw objects into my body, head, including heavy bottles, soda cans, burning candles, television remote controls and paint thinner cans, which severely injured me\u201d. And the claims were not so easily shaken off by the public when a recording taken by Depp reveals the actress owning up to her mistake and apologizing, somehow, you be the judge of that. \u201cOkay I\u2019m sorry I hit you, I did mean to hit you but t was in response I just reacted in response to my foot. I just reacted and I\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s below me\u201d. Well, whether Amber meant it or not, it didn\u2019t matter to fans, and celebrities like Sia. The forty-five-year-old musician took her opinions on the matter to Twitter and defended Johnny tweeting \u201cJust showing my public support for Johnny Depp. I mean, I\u2019d just love him to get clean and stop with the jewelry, but he is clearly the victim after hearing those tapes\u201d.",
