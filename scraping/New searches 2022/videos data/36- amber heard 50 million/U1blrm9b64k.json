The actress also wore gloves, but skipped a face mask for the outing.Heard was atop of gorgeous reddish beige and white steed, with white mane and tail.   The sighting comes as a petition on the website Change.org calling for Amber's firing from Aquaman 2 has garnered over 1.5 million signatures.The starlet gained worldwide recognition as underwater princess Mera in 2018's DC hit film Aquaman, in which she starred opposite Jason Momoa.However, at the same time Amber's two-year marriage to Johnny Depp was falling apart in a spectacularly bad and highly publicized way, culminating in a libel court case in England earlier this year in which Depp sued publishers of The Sun for referring to him as a 'wife beater.'\u00a0   Depp, 57, lost that case this autumn, which partially resulted in him losing his role in Harry Potter spinoff film series Fantastic Beasts.The embattled pair have repeatedly accused each other of domestic abuse during their two-year marriage that ended in 2017.\u00a0However, supporters of the petition have pointed out that Amber is not without fault in the abusive end to their marriage, and have thus called for her to lose her lucrative role in the Aquaman film series.\u00a0  'Amber Heard has been exposed as a domestic abuser by Johnny Depp,' the petition reads, in part.\u00a0'In his $50 million lawsuit, Johnny Depp describes many incidents of domestic abuse that he suffered at the hands of his (then) wife Amber Heard,' the statement goes on.\u00a0It adds, 'Since Heard's divorce from Johnny Depp, she has systematically crusaded to ruin Depp in Hollywood,' before concluding with the following:\u00a0   'As Amber Heard is a known and proven domestic abuser, Warner Brothers and DC Entertainment should and must remove Heard from their Aquaman 2 film project. They must not ignore the suffering of Heard's victims, and must not glamorize a domestic abuser.Men are victims of domestic abuse, just like women. This must be recognized, and action must be taken to prevent a known abuser from being celebrated within the entertainment industry.Do the right thing. Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman 2.'\u00a0   Heard addressed rumors she wouldn't reprise the role this month with Entertainment Weekly, noting: 'Paid rumors and paid campaigns on social media don't dictate [casting decisions] because they have no basis in reality.'Only the fans actually made Aquaman and Aquaman 2 happen.
