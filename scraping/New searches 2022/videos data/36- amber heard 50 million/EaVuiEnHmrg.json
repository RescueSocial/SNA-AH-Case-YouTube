It isn't the first time he has had one changed - a previous tatt that read \"Winona Forever\", inked in honour of his ex Winona Rider, now reads 'Wino Forever'. Speaking to Rolling Stone, Depp opened up on how he felt during to protracted saga of his divorce from Amber Heard. \u00a0\"I was as low as I believe I could have gotten,\" he said. \"The next step was, 'You're going to arrive somewhere with your eyes open and you're going to leave there with your eyes closed'. I couldn't take the pain every day.\"I poured myself a vodka in the morning and started writing until the tears filled my eyes and I couldn't see the page anymore.\"\u00a0\"I kept trying to figure out what I'd done to deserve this. I'd tried being kind to everyone, helping everyone, being truthful to everyone. The truth is most important to me. And all this still happened.\"Credit: PA\u00a0Depp was accused of emotionally and physically abusing Heard throughout their relationship, something that he vehemently denies. \u00a0On top of that, he is in reportedly deep trouble financially, having had his fortune - which was thought to be more than $600 million - reduced by divorce, legal wrangling and excessive spending. \u00a0Depp has been cast in the new Fantastic Beasts movie, a move that has sparked outrage due to the allegations currently against him - allegations which, one suspects, it will take more than a tattoo artist to delete.
