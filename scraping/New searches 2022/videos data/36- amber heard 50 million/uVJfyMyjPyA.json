Given Winona\u2019s household name as the star of Stranger Things and Johnny and Amber\u2019s back-and-forth domestic violence allegations, this would be a big move for Winona. The Oscar-nominated actress allegedly filed a declaration in Virginia and went on record to provide her side of the story, and she made it clear that she\u2019s \u201cin support\u201d of Johnny, according to court documents that The Blast reviewed on March 12. HollywoodLife has not reviewed these documents, and therefore can only relay The Blast\u2019s report \u2014 we\u2019ve reached out to Winona\u2019s rep for comment.  \u00a0The \u201990s darling began the declaration by reflecting on her relationship with Johnny; they began dating in 1989, and were engaged between 1990-1993. They even starred in Tim Burton\u2019s 1990 classic, Edward Scissorhands, together. \u201cI am aware of the violence allegations that have been made publicly for the last few years by Johnny Depp\u2019s ex-wife Amber Heard,\u201d Amber wrote in the declaration. \u201cI knew Johnny very well years ago. We were together as a couple for four years, and I counted him as my best friend, and as close to me as family. I count our relationship as one of the more significant relationships of my life. I understand that it is very important that I speak from my own experience.\u201d  \u00a0Winona then confessed her stunned reaction to Amber\u2019s allegations, according to the court documents. \u201cI obviously was not there during his marriage to Amber, but, from my experience, which was so wildly different, I was absolutely shocked, confused and upset when I heard the accusations against him,\u201d the\u00a0Beetlejuice\u00a0star continued. \u201cThe idea that he is an incredibly violent person is the farthest thing from the Johnny I knew and loved. I cannot wrap my head around these accusations.\u201d  \u00a0Finally, Winona insisted that she has never witnessed an ounce of \u201cviolence\u201d in Johnny. \u201cHe was never, never violent towards me,\u201d she continued. \u201cHe was never, never abusive at all towards me. He has never been violent or abusive towards anybody I have seen. I truly and honestly only know him as a really good man- an incredibly loving, extremely caring guy who was so very protective of me and the people that he loves, and I felt so very, very safe with him. I do not want to call anyone a liar but from my experience of Johnny, it is impossible to believe that such horrific allegations are true. I find it extremely upsetting knowing him as I do.\u201d  \u00a0This isn\u2019t the first time Winona has publicly defended Johnny. In a 2016 interview with Time, she told the magazine, \u201cHe was never, never tha",
