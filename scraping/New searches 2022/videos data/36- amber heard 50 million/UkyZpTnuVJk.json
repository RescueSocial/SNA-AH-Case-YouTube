Amber Heard Johnny Depp Lawsuit Updates!\nhttps://youtu.be/95KTUVBtF7g\n\nJohnny Depp Gets BIG WIN Over Amber Heard\nhttps://youtu.be/ZHjvmlEkJT4\n\nJohnny Depp Finally Speaks On Defeating Amber Heard\nhttps://youtu.be/RTZB62_g3cE\n\nNumber 5: The Beginning\nDepp was 46-year-old with two children, and Heard was 22-year-old when they both met. Depp\u2019s children were for his longtime partner, Vanessa Paradis. Few years down the line, both of them got married, which finally led to a divorce in just 18 months. Before the divorce, Heard already filed a restraining order against Depp. While she was walking in and out of the Los Angele court, photographers waiting in the courtroom took pictures of her with a scar on her face. The restraining order was based on the allegations that Depp abused her physically and verbally due to the influence of alcohol and drugs, and soon enough, these allegations spread far and wide. Depp, on the other hand, denied all allegations. He also claimed that the reverse was the case as Heard abused him instead.\n \nNumber 4: Effects \nThings have been pretty hard for Johnny Depp and Amber Heard after their divorce. Who is getting the most hit from this problem they are facing? Well, at first, it was Johnny Depp as he lost every court session with Amber Heard. He also lost many other things. Amber Heard had her position in Aquaman 2, while Johnny Depp was fired from his position in Pirates of the Caribbean Series. He was later reinstated by Disney when things started going in his favor. Like I said before, it's been a harder hit on Johnny Depp because apart from being sacked by Disney, he also stepped down from his role in the Fantastic Beast series by Warner Bros. \n \nNumber 3: The Donation\nTo find out if Amber Heard actually donated her divorce settlement to the American Civil Liberties Union and hospital, Johnny Depp was granted a petition by a New York Judge. Given this petition, the ACLU is required to produce proof or document that Amber Heard went through with her pledge. Depp has lost a lot of lawsuits as regards allegations made against him by Amber Heard. Depp tried an appeal again in March that was turned down. The appeal by his lawyer was said to be on the basis that Heard\u2019s pledge to donate the divorce settlement was just one of her ways to manipulate the ruling in her favor. There were also allegations stating that Amber Heard claiming to donate the money to charity was a complete lie and this information was passed on in 2019 to Johnny\u2019s business adviser. \n \nNumber 2: Allegations and court cases\nIn July, the high court came to a decision when Johnny Depp and Amber Heard were caught in a heated court case, making allegations against each other, making claims about fighting, drug abuse, drinking, and scattering the room. After all, was said and done, the Judge finally made a ruling that Heard\u2019s claim of abuse by Depp was mostly true in favor of the publisher of the tabloid whom Depp filed a lawsuit against. The Virginia case followed shortly after when Amber Heard claimed that she was a victim of domestic abuse, accusing Johnny Depp as the person responsible. A while after, Johnny Depp filed a lawsuit, claiming that Amber Heard was lying against him and tarnishing his reputation. This lawsuit was worth about 50 million dollars.\nIn 2019, May to be exact, Johnny Depp decided to go on the offensive and claimed that Amber Heard had been molesting him. Not only that, but she also kicked and punched him. \n\nNumber 1: What happens next?\nSo why exactly do the amount of the donation matter? It matters because one of the major reasons the judge believed Heard over Depp was because of the donations. While Depp claimed that the only reason Heard married him was because of his money, the judge overruled that because Heard already donated all of her divorce money, a whopping sum of 7 million dollars to charity, to ALCU like she said she would. Therefore, now that the court has petitioned that evidence should be brought that Amber donated the money, this might be a big plus for Johnny Depp if it is discovered that Amber Heard never released the money like she said she would. This would discredit her in the favor of Johnny Depp.\n \nViral Film Talk is the #1 celebrity channel dedicated to bringing fans the latest celebrity news, best tv shows, movies, entertainment, and exclusive video commentaries & more.
