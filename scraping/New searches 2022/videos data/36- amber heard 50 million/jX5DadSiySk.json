            "description": "Being famous is a dream for many, but being a celebrity also has its downsides. This is definitely true any time a famous couple breaks up, especially when they go to court. Amber Heard and Johnny Depp know this all too well, as they\u2019ve been making headlines for years as a result of their battle in court. And now Heard\u2019s cast against Depp has involved the LAPD.\n\nFollowing the end of the libel case across the pond, Amber Heard and Johnny Depp\u2019s ongoing fight in court has remained stateside. Depp is suing his ex-wife for defamation to the cost of a whopping $50 million. And now Heard\u2019s team have subpoenaed the LAPD in hopes of getting any and all records of the 2016 domestic disturbance incident that made so many headlines.\n\nThis latest report comes to us from Deadline, after the outlet obtained official court documents regarding Amber Heard and Johnny Depp\u2019s infamous legal battle. This is reportedly not the first time the Aquaman star\u2019s team have called on the LAPD, as a subpoena first arrived back in January. Heard\u2019s representation are calling for the police department to:\n\n...produce the books, documents, records, electronically stored information and tangible things designated and described below.\n\ud83d\udd0eA HSHTAGS \ud83d\udd0e#Zamtrend#G25 ON TRENDIN\n\n\n........................................................................................\nMust watch for Youtubers:- \n(1)The Dark Truth About Daniel Radcliffe's(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVQIFnIWKdQ&ab_channel=ZamTrends)\n\n(2) Game Of Thrones(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10fkylFHe0A&ab_channel=ZamTrends)\n\n(3) Star Trek: Picard Season 2 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfLnXUW4o30&ab_channel=ZamTrends)\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n According to the same report, Amber Heard and company are specifically hoping to find bodycam footage from the two officers that responded to the domestic disturbance call those years ago.
