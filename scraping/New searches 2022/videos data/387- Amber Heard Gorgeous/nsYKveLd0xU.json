Follow us if you wanna feel the magic of Aquamagic Frequencies.\n\n1. You have to listen the video at least 4 times per day. Maximum 8 times in a day. If you listen too much, it will exhaust your brain. I recommend to space listening. You also can listen while you're sleeping.\nIf you have dark eyes (brown or hazel eyes), I recommend you to use this subliminal in combination with my Super Fast eye melanin remover. Also, use the Booster in first place.\n\n2. If you download it, it will still work but it will work a lot slower. I use frequencies so it's better to watch online. Having faster results is better for motivation!\n\n3. Drink at least 1,5 L of water in a day. It's important to stay hydrated.\n\n4. Try to have a good lifestyle. Don't make excess with bad food or sleepless nights. It will help you to see faster results.\n\n5. You can use earphones or headphones, it's like you want.\n\n6. Listen at a confortable volume.\n\n\u27a4 Some facts, true if you use Aquamagic Frequencies :\n\n1. You don't have to hardly believe to make it work. Frequencies work for you. \n\n2. No matter what's your native langage or ethnicity, it will work. It's completely universal.\n\n3. It's not possible to exactly say when you'll start to see a changes. Everyone is differents and results depend of many factor : original pigmentation, how your brain reacts, how consistent you are, respect of instructions... Some people will see results in few weeks, for others it will take months.\n\n\n\u263c Don't forget to subscribe to the channel, share and like videos.\n\nFollow us on Instragram and share your results https://www.instagram.com/aquamgicfrenquencies/?hl=fr\n\n\u263eGet Gorgeous Amber eyes!\u263d\u2660\u263d Subliminal Frequencies",
