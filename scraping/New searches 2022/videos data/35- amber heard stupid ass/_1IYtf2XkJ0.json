            "description": "Autumn Is Amber: Georgia Revisited with Gvantsa Abuladze & Noel Brockett\n\nGvantsa Abuladze and her sister Baia make some of Imereti's finest wines across all genres, white, orange, pink, red, and sparkling. Imereti is the historical heart of Western Georgia and worlds away from Kakheti, the hotter, drier province responsible for the vast majority of the country's wines. Wines are traditionally crafted in tear-dropped shaped clay vessels called qvevri across both regions, but the offerings couldn't be more differently stylistically. \n\nAs for food, think like a Georgian, which is not to say you have to find Georgian food, but adorn the table with a variety of options. I love Carla Capalbo's description of the traditional Georgian meal:\n\u201cAt a supra, the table is laden with food before anyone sits down. The centre of a long table hosting, say, twenty people will be set with at least seven or eight cold dishes . . . Once everyone is seated and has started eating, other dishes - including hot stews, stuffed breads, dumplings and barbecued meats - begin to arrive and are placed beside (and sometimes even on top of) the first set of foods. If a serving plate is emptied, the dish is not removed but replenished by the attentive hosts.\u201d \n\nBill Jensen, sommelier for Michelin-starred Washington DC restaurant Tail Up Goat, and her sister Reveler's Hour, is a breakout star of the Covid-19 Pandemic with his virtual wine school. In an effort to stay in touch with his regulars and soon-to-be regulars, he launched #StayHome Wine School on March 29th, and continued every Sunday at 4 pm EST for 40 straight weeks. To be added to the newsletter and gain access to the class each week, email your request to: wineschool@tailupgoat.com \n\nThis week's poem was January Flowers at Uplistsikhe by Ana Kalandadze \n \nIn Bill's weekly recap email, he said this:\n A heartful \"Didi madloba!\" to everyone who joined us for yesterday's class! Winemaker Gvantsa Abuladze charmed us all from eight time zones away with our old friend Noel Brockett offering additional commentary from our neck of the woods. Gvantsa (along with her sister Baia and brother Giorgi) makes some of the country's most stunning wines in a style more elegant and easy-drinking than many Westerners have come to expect. It has been inspiring to watch the label evolve since Baia founded it in 2015; to witness Gvantsa become a more prominent part of the brand; to see the range of offerings expand and the wines become more delicious vintage in and out.\n \nLike it's signature amber wines, Georgia is a place between - at the intersection of East and West with an economy poised between developing and fully industrialized. Over half the workforce remains employed in agriculture, and the wine sector, albeit ancient, is very much emerging:\n \u201cIn 2018, 245,000 tons of grape were processed by 292 winemaking companies; for a country with a tiny domestic consumption base, that is a lot of wineries. By comparison, La Rioja in Spain has 600 wineries drawing grape from 12,000 growers and 45,000 ha of vineyard, but it is at the heart of an enthusiastic wine-drinking country of 47 million people with huge loyalty to that appellation. [Georgia has a population of 3.7 million people.] The availability of various grants and subsidized loans over the past five years has enticed many urban professionals to mortgage their urban properties and engage in their dream of owning a small winery or vineyard with borrowed money.\u201d\n \nhttp://www.fao.org/georgia/fao-in-georgia/georgia-at-a-glance/en/ \n \nhttp://georgiatoday.ge/news/16302/Georgian-Wine-Industry%3A-Implications-of-a-Russian-Embargo \n \nIf you want to support Gvantsa directly, just drop her a line through the Baia's Wine website: http://www.baiawine.com/ \n \n- Baia talks about the EU grants that helped her launch the family's business: https://eu4business.eu/success-stories/baia-and-gvantsa-the-winemakers-turning-a-family-tradition-into-a-successful-business \n \n- Food & Wine asks her what it's like to be a woman in an industry historically dominated by men: https://www.foodandwine.com/wine/baia-abuladze-georgian-wine \n \n- Lisa Granik considers the causes and effects of the recent Georgian wine boom:  https://daily.sevenfifty.com/understanding-the-georgian-wine-boom/ \n \n- Wines of Georgia gives you a rundown of the major native grape varietals and geography. \n Varietals: https://winesgeorgia.com/grape-varieties/ \nGeography: https://winesgeorgia.com/geography/ \n \nIf you're looking for an even deeper dive, there are some wonderful resources in print.
