The answer is nothing, and Amber Rose is here to remind you of that, as she should- since a few too many people on the internet found an issue with an adorable video of Amber\u2019s son gushing over T-Swift concert tickets. The back story here is that Amber\u2019s 5 year old son really loves Taylor Swift, so when Taylor sent tickets to Amber, of course she had to get his reaction on camera. But she obviously didn\u2019t expect any backlash, including horrible comments about her son\u2019s sexuality, for posting the video online. She quickly took to her Instagram, and in a series of stories, she shut those haters right down. \nShe said QUOTE: \"Shout-out to all the hyper-masculine men and ignorant dumb-ass women that will call a 5-year-old gay for liking Taylor Swift. This is why young kids kill themselves. And this is also why our society is so f-cked up. Liking a certain type of music will not make you 'pick' your sexuality, you dumb f-cks.\"P.S. My son just got accepted into the most prestigious private school in Los Angeles because he's smart as f-ck and creative as f-ck like his parents. We allow him to be himself. He can listen to whatever music he likes, he can like whatever color he wants and we let him be passionate about whatever his little heart desires.\"\nAnd that wasn\u2019t powerful enough, Amber continued saying QUOTE \nLet's do better for the next generation, people. Grow the f-ck up and teach your kids to love and not hate. P.S.S. Regardless if he's gay or straight, when he gets older, he will be around the most amazing, loving people that will support him no matter what.\"\nAnd if THAT wasn\u2019t powerful enough, she ended her rant saying QUOTE \u201cHe also has more money in his bank account than any of you trolls could even imagine.\u201d\nThese are my favorite kind of rants, tbh, as a mother, and just as a human. \nBut now it\u2019s time for you to weigh in with your thoughts on Amber\u2019s clap back, so drop it down in the comments below, and then click right here to see the adorable moment Amber\u2019s son realized he was going to the Taylor Swift concert.
