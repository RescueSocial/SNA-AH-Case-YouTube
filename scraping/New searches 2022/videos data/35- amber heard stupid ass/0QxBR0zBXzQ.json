Here\u2019s what the magazine printed:\n\n\u201cAmber Rose wrote the book on it. No, seriously: Kanye\u2019s infamous ex, Wiz Khalifa\u2019s baby mama, America\u2019s toughest bald babe since Sigourney Weaver in Alien 3, is about to publish a book of life lessons called How to Be a Bad Bitch. Like Amber herself, it\u2019s all heart. Unlike Amber, it\u2019s not that thick! The teen stripper turned megalomaniac muse spoke to Carrie Battan about her beautiful dark twisted journey to the top.\u201d\n\nMs. Rose didn\u2019t find it so amusing. She screenshot the piece, posted on her IG, and gave her 2 cents.\n\n\u201cReally @gq??? I\u2019m so much more then Kanye\u2019s Ex or Wiz\u2019s baby\u2019s mama. Damn, why the (expletive) did u guys reach out to me for this article and photoshoot? To dumb me down? I talked about feminism and my Slutwalk\u2026 Wtf nice title smh I expected so much more from u guys and I\u2019m so disappointed. I was so excited to be featured in GQ not realizing I was shooting for a tabloid. My slutwalk was for ignorant (expletive) like this. Oh \u201cHer beautiful dark twisted journey to the top\u201d? Nice pun. Negative af. Thx for nothing.\u201d\n\nWhy did GQ choose to call her Wiz\u2019s \u201cbaby mama\u201d instead of \u201cex-wife?\u201d Well, we spoke to the writer of the story, Carrie Baton to get her thoughts.\n\n\u201cIf you notice, she cut out the title of the piece, which was \u2018How to Be a Bad Bitch,\u2019 which is the title of her book. Which is kind of the highest praise we could have given her.\u201d\n\nCarrie elaborates with her intention on the piece.\n\n\u201cMy goal was to find a way to explain to people the challenges that she\u2019s facing while she\u2019s sort of transitioning in these two fazes of her life. and sort of what her feminism stand point is and how it ties into what people know her as.\u201d\n\nhttp://ishootnyc.com\n\nSubscribe Here! http://bit.ly/SubscribeSU\nWatch the Best of Sway In The Morning! http://bit.ly/BestOfSITM\n\nCheck out More From Sway\u2019s Universe\nhttp://swaysuniverse.com\nhttp://twitter.com/swaysuniverse\nhttp://instagram.com/swaysuniverse\nhttp://facebook.com/swaysuniverse\n\n#SwaysUniverse\n\nAbout SWAY\u2019s UNIVERSE\nExclusive interviews from Sway Calloway and the Sway In The Morning/ SwaysUniverse.com team with some of today's biggest celebrities, like Kevin Hart, Kanye West, Eminem, Usher, Jessica Alba, Steve Aoki, Torey Lanez, Julia Stiles and so much more.\n\nGQ Magazine Writer Responds To Amber Rose's Strong Criticism | Sway's Universe\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QxBR0zBXzQ\n\nSway\u2019s Universe\nhttps://www.youtube.com/UCuS96jkLKpTaGB_OWnwZV_A",
