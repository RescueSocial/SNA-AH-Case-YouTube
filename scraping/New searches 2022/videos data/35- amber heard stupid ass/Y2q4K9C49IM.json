But if you call Plaidson New Jersey hell, you get where I'm coming from. You see in Plaidson you're either on 1 of the 2 sides.\r\n\r\nA. rich\r\nOr\r\nB. poor\r\n\r\nAnd you see Since I, Amber Rivera am a citizen of Plaidson... I guess ill give you some play by play or in others words advise. \r\n\r\nPoint A: watch out for rich people...yes I'm poor.\r\n\r\nPoint B: when a rich boy pulls you in a closet you might as well yell \"rape!!!\".\r\n\r\nPoint C: ... I've got nothing\r\n\r\nBut as we conclude today's lesson we can say you're ready for Plaidson new jersey. See you there.\r\n\r\nLove,\r\n\r\n         Amber Rivera\r\n  \r\n\r\nChapter 1\r\n\r\nNicole's POv\r\n\r\nLiving is something we only realize is beautiful until someone loses its possession. Last year my mother died. And I don't know my father. Don't get me wrong my life's not that out of the ordinary my mother wasn't brutally murdered, even thou that is terrible, she was sick with cancer.\r\n\r\nThat is why I'm here in Plaidson, New Jersey to live with my cousin Amber and her family. The funny thing is right now I don't know what to feel. I mean I feel grateful, because I had to sleep in an orphanage until now, but wow. You see dear friend I haven't heard the best things about Plaidson. And I'm guessing you got the whole point speech from Amber. Wow she gave it in letter form! Are you serious? Wow!\r\n\r\n\"Nicole time for school!\" \r\n\r\nThat must be amber. Later.\r\n\r\n\"Coming,\" I screeched running down the stairs.\r\n\r\n\"Whoa Buba!\" I was shocked to see Amber standing there in a pair of daisy dukes.\r\n\r\n\"Are those the pants I let you borrow?\" Amber began to pout as if she was trying to forget.\r\n\r\n\"I know they are hideous. But they are all I have left all your other clothes are packed away and mine are in the wash.\" She sighed while putting on a pair of dorky glasses and retainer. \r\n\r\n\"What are you doing?\" I asked concerned.\r\n\r\n\"Getting ready for school,\" I gave her a look. \"Ok look I don't want to get raped or anything so I dress like a dork.\"\r\n\r\nWhat the hell was wrong with this school? I would not let amber hide her beauty. I took off the glasses and broke them in half after that I took out her retainer and crushed it. She gasped.\r\n\r\n\"If they touch you ill kick their ass!\" I gave her a reassuring smile she nodded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the other side of town on the front stairs of school\r\n\r\nNick's pov\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Why are we here?\" Zac asked in his pathetic tone.\r\n\r\nI sighed\r\n\r\n\"To drink beer and think a little, stupid ass!\" I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"We all know you need time to think for once,\" Joey murmured loud enough for us all to hear.\r\n\r\nWe all laughed. That's why Joey is my best friend.\r\n\r\nAnd at that same time Ryan walked up with Jessie Joey's little brother, both of them with crazy sex hair.\r\n\r\n\"Sup guys.\" Jessie said lazily.\r\n\r\nJoey gave him a look that meant 'we are talking later'\r\nI opened my mouth to say something a little inappropriate when the screeching of wheels made all of our heads snap up.\r\n\r\nThe sight we took in was... life changing",
