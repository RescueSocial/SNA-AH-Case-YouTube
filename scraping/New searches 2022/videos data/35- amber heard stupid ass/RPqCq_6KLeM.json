She\u2019s French Canadian and how people sometimes talk differently. We discuss the Marvel Cinematic Universe and how excited we are for the films. We talk about what it means to be an \u201cInstagram Model\u201d and how to maintain relationships in the photo and modeling world. We talk about GWCs and how they\u2019re effecting the photography and modeling community. We also talk about how I drink a lot of coffee and not enough water. \n \nLinks for Amber: \nInstagram:\nHttps://instagram.com/beauvness\n@beauvness\n\nThank you to Tom Lavery for the music.
