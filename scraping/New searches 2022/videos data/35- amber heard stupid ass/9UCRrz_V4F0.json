Amber now 9 years sober, started drinking at 8 years old sneaking sips of beer from left over beer cans at family parties. For over 10 years, Amber alcoholism would gradually get worse and worse: drinking on the job, public intoxication, arrested for a DUI, and sleeping in her car. Amber finally hits rock bottom when she moves to New York and ends up in an alcoholic blackout throughout all of 9-11.\n\r\n\r-uploaded in HD at http://www.TunesToTube.com",
