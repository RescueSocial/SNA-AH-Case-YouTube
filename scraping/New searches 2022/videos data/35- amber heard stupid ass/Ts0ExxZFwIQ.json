            "description": "Amber, an investigative journalist, discusses the best ways to distinguish between truths and lies in everyday life. \n\nAs a journalist, Amber Hunt has spent much of her career fine-tuning her BS detector in hopes of figuring out the truth to tell readers. She's been known to sanctimoniously grill sources she's caught in a lie how they sleep at night. But she's a also a big believer in some truths being more subjective than others, which can make her job incredibly complicated at times. Hunt is a New York Times bestselling author and nationally award-winning journalist who works as an investigative reporter with the Cincinnati Enquirer. She previously covered crime for the Detroit Free Press and oversaw reporters in North and South Dakota as a news editor for The Associated Press. Hunt has written three true-crime books, as well as the bestselling biography The Kennedy Wives: Triumph and Tragedy in America's Most Public Family. Hunt is a past Knight-Wallace Fellow at the University of Michigan, and she teaches multimedia journalism at the University of Cincinnati. \n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
