            "description": "A witness in the murder trial of a white Dallas police officer who fatally shot her black neighbor has been killed in a shooting, the Dallas Morning News reported, citing authorities.\n\nThe newspaper reported that authorities said Joshua Brown, who lived in the same apartment complex as Amber Guyger and Botham Jean, was shot and killed Friday in Dallas. Guyger was still in her police uniform after a long shift when, according to her trial testimony, she mistook Jean\u2019s apartment for her own one floor below and shot him after pushing open his unlocked door and thinking he was a burglar.\n\nBrown, 28, testified in Guyger\u2019s trial about the September 2018 night that Jean was killed, saying he was in a hallway on the fourth floor, where he and Jean lived. He said he heard what sounded like \u201ctwo people meeting by surprise\u201d and then two gunshots.\n.\nWebsite: https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/06/witness-in-amber-guyger-case-found-shot-dead-in-dallas\n.\nPrison Talk LIVE is the best and easiest way to get your questions answered by Big Herc!
