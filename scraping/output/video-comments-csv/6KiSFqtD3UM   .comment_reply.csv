97,UgyW5twUTO8hh48HdTF4AaABAg,Aurora Uplinks,"Im not sure he could fully sue a paper for them reporting lies that they were told was truth... but he could sue them arguably on some level, maybe not for cash, but some other form of legal suit, for some purpose for acknowledging that they failed to use their ability to investigate, and only reported what they were told that they failed to do their duty.  As journalists, which is one of the most important professions PROTECTED, by the Constitution itself, and by failing to Investigate a serious alligation, they failed not only One innocent man, but every person who piled on assuming his guilt, they failed to find the truth, as we all failed to find.   But they also failed their constitutional priveleges.  That give them near endless rights to report any truth, or to search for any truth short of a military secret, and people have done endless things researching military secretes... but researching one man accused of abuse who never showed signs of hostility?

I would say the least is, the sun, should actually be required to fund, a full film, and give Johny Depp the starring role... irony of ironies... it could be a film... about a reporter looking for the truth and being piled on by the public and the media and being called all sorts of horrible things... and overcoming it.. .and give johny like 10 percent of the box office... seems fair enough.

Give him all he wanted, a good script, a good roll, and a chance to do what he does... earn everyones love.

And lots and lots of box office money and a oscar or two maybe... and if he doesnt earn a oscar its ok.   just give him a good script and a proper film budget of atleast 50 million dollars, they dont lose money, they may even come out slightly ahead, if not in cash, atleast in public opinion, everyone comes out better, and its not a film to besmirch or bring down anyone currently, it could be set in any era or historical setting.  About any serious case or historical, or fictional, reporter and story they are researching etc...

Maybe give him a producer role on the film alongside the 10 percent of the profits of the box office, and dont screw him over on the percentages, everyone will be happy, eeverything will work out, maybe get George Lucas to help write the script ideas and elements, to give the film a extra bit of love, maybe disney would even want to go in as a partner on producing it and filming it.  everyone wins",2020-07-09T08:55:39Z,0

-Personally, I don't know Johnny Depp all that well except for his role in PoTC franchise, his role as Count Olaf in A Series of Unfortunate Events, and as Grindelwald In Fantastic Beasts 2.-
Edit: Never mind, he stars in a lot more movies than I remembered just now. At any rate, outside of his movies I don't keep track of what he's been doing. 

With that said, if all I've been hearing on here is true then Depp has been done dirty by Heard. Assuming scenario 2 is off the table, he should go all in and destroy Heard for falsely accusing him of things he never did. At best Depp will get justice and wipe some of the smearing off of his reputation, but at worst he fails and still has the respect of fans who know the charges against him are bogus. 

There is a reason bearing false witness and simply lying are two separate commandments in the Bible. With the former you are destroying someone else's reputation, but with the latter you're just making yourself seem better than you really are (usually anyway). With cases like Depp's, we can see why these two commandments aren't simply rolled into one.",2020-07-09T00:36:52Z,0

282,UgwRYom_YqTx2TZYu6d4AaABAg,Skyfire The Goth,"@Gale Zephyr I used to be on the Trump hate train, I bought into it because independent news media I trusted was telling the same lies, I fell into the trap of blindly trusting them because they had been trustworthy when I first started watching them and I stopped fact checking them, and at some point they joined the MSM train, and I didn't see it, but then my brain kicked in and I was like ""Why are they only saying bad things about Trump? He can't be THAT bad can he?"" and looked into it myself and what I found was that the MSM is doing one of two things with Trump, 1) Exaggerating to the extreme something he said or did, or 2) flat out making stuff up. Russia collusion, never happened, even their hand picked guy they were so sure would find them the evidence they needed basically said ""No, I found nothing."" yet they still pushed the lie. MSM said Trump was profiteering and charging the U.S. for official stays at his hotels, again an investigation showed that never happened, but the MSM continued lying about it. They said Trump only got into politics for the huge amount of money he would make, nope, he is donating his presidential salary to charity, he is making zero money as president, They said he said ""Grab em by the pussy"" so he admits to groping women without consent, uhhh, kinda, he did say ""grab em by the pussy"" but that's only part of the quote, the whole quote was ""Yea, you know when you're rich, especially if you're rich and good looking, women will let you do anything to them, hug em, kiss em, grab em by the pussy, they just let you do it."" he was basically engaging in the rich persons version of locker room jock talk. Now, to address this ""...all I see trump doing is tweeting in twitter, but he seems like a good man, also I don't do good in politics"" Stop paying attention to twitter, and stop giving so much weight to what someone tweets, no matter who it is, it doesn't matter what he tweets, or who he insults, he's a human being he has flaws like all of us do, what is important is how well he is doing as president, and honestly he isn't doing too bad, before covid hit he had the economy at the highest point it's been for a long while, unemployment was at an all time low, strengthening the border with Mexico is a great idea, I know it won't stop all illegal border crossings but it will certainly slow them down, there are things I do not agree with that he's done, but more and more it seems I'm agreeing with him and his policies. If you don't do good with politics you shouldn't comment politically since you don't know what's going on, it just makes you look stupid, it'd be like me trying to say something bad about astrophysics when I only have a very limited knowledge of it, I'd look like a damned fool to people who are studying astrophysics. Also stop listening to MSM they lie, have been allowed to legally lie for about 15 years now, a bill Obama passed (as in signed an executive order IIRC) that was ostensibly to protect MSM companies from being sued for the opinions of their reporters, journalists, etc., but was worded so vaguely they can get away with flat out lies. I still trust independent news sources more than MSM because they typically have no stake in the fight and are more honest, especially the ones that show you their sources on screen while telling you what they found, but I learned from my past and if any of the independent sources I watch ever stop showing their sources I'll stop watching them because that shows they are becoming dishonest like the MSM.",2020-07-09T07:25:19Z,0

One reason he has limited his poltics is because he is only working now becsue of Mel Gibson..
Nobody would even give Downey a job as no insurance would cover a picture he was on..
Gibson is a friend of his and both are addicts so Gibson put up a huge amount of his personal cash as a guarantee that Downey would complete his movies, If Downey ended up taking drugs etc.. During the movie then all the losses of the movie would have come out of Gibson's bank account..
According to Downey Gibson put his trust and wealth in him staying clean and that allowed him to care for his family. 
He doesn't want to have people come after him for his drugged up past and he doesn't want to be associated with Gibson or cause him problems.
Gibson is a very religious and conservative person (he owns his own church which is old school religious) and Gibson votes on the right..

Personally I think Downey should talk about his addiction as he is a good role model with how he has turned his life around...
And he shows how somone who ignores every chance can change their life after  finally ending up in jail which leads to them deciding they don't want to go back..",2020-07-08T23:29:27Z,1
