139,UgjvtEulGIWvWXgCoAEC,On A Serious Note,"+Bryan ‚ÄúMadix‚Äù Megill Thanks.  When it first came up in the news, I was frankly concerned about embarrassment to Australia because of Barnaby Joyce but within days, it seemed to me, it had actually been quite successful as the dogs were removed very quickly and now it has turned out to be fantastic for the country really as to biosecurity matters.  But hey, we could have Zika virus problems before too long - and that is human borne into the country (it is already here and there are some women and men [not many yet] who are worried about their unborn babies): human borne disease is an issue that has been pointed out by a few people.  Diseases other than rabies (which I just put up as an easy and really eye-catching example) are an issue too.  Nothing is infallible.  Nothing is perfect.  We can just do our best.

I have to say I really appreciated that most people have argued their case very politely.  And I think a lot of good and valid points have been raised.  And in this regard, thank you too.  Have a great day!",2016-04-20T06:50:27Z,0

141,UgjvtEulGIWvWXgCoAEC,On A Serious Note,"+Bryan ‚ÄúMadix‚Äù Megill OK I know it is coming across like a joke but we (and I am not trying to be rude about this so don't read it the wrong way - it is always difficult when writing something because you cannot put across the tone) are not worried about it coming across like a joke.  The thing is it is highlighting the issue even if it becomes a butt of jokes.  In fact, if it didn't come across like that it wouldn't be getting so much airplay - so really it is good publicity for our biosecurity.  We may look like the petulant child and people will be irritated but as you say it will pass.  But the memory of what it was about just may be remembered by individuals coming to Australia - we shall see I suppose (though I doubt it is measurable).

As to the initial reporting - well, the particular politician who said the original comments is ""like that"".  As it turned out though, it resulted in the dogs being removed from the country as they should have been.  It is too late once you are here to go asking for special consideration.  We all know that applies in so many situations - even biosecurity at an international level.

As to Australia letting it go - it is actually done and dusted - but I think that everyone is having a good laugh (yes here too - see my next paragraph) over the video for the moment (probably won't last long as these things go).  But, I strongly suspect that Depp and Heard will be interviewed as soon as they get back home and there will be comments requested at this end etc etc etc - the media at both ends and around the world will milk it for all it is worth.

As to the way they filmed it (in their hotel room I believe), well, they (Depp and Heard) no doubt did that deliberately.  Trying to get sympathy I presume.  But it has backfired.  It has been ridiculed in Australia as to Depp and Heard and they are being treated like a joke here.  And even that politician I mentioned made a comment that they could have done a better acting job - the thing is, the Court accepted it and, as a matter of fact, the politicians kept out of everything once the Court case was afoot and it was judicial process that finalised the matter.  As an aside, the politician involved throughout was and is responsible for the ministry overseeing biosecurity - and the media asked him and he, in his usual manner, was rather straight forward and direct!

Thanks for your comments.",2016-04-20T04:50:21Z,0
142,UgjvtEulGIWvWXgCoAEC,On A Serious Note,"+katty kleo Mmmmm, I tend to agree with everything you said but even though a pampered pet may not have a particular disease - and an unlikely disease like rabies [it is just an easy example] (or any disease for that matter); you cannot make exceptions: that 'ol slippery slope argument.  And there are always new diseases, old-and-thought-extinct (for want of a better word) or unheard of diseases that can pop up from time to time: I remember we had never heard of parvo virus in Australia at one stage and then dogs were dying of it.  So, again, whilst I generally agree with you we all know exceptions cannot be made and it was a simple few protocols they could have easily followed - and the quarantine time was short I believe - only 10 days I think (less than a lot of holidays people take while they leave their pets in care).  I am sure the quarantine services would look after the dogs well too.

Hope you enjoyed ""Come to Australia"" - we find it funny especially because a lot of the critters are not seen most of the time - of course, not seeing them can be a problem: we had about six people in one weekend bitten by deadly brown snakes last month!

As to Koalas, they keep to themselves!  It is your car that is most likely to be damaged by them, not people themselves!  So glad you did not say ""Koala bear"".  We hate that!!!   Anyway, it is the drop bears you have to watch (sorry, Aussie humour coming out).

143,UgjvtEulGIWvWXgCoAEC,Bryan M,"@On A Serious Note I think most people agree with your viewpoint and why Australia has those policies but the way it was handled and reported is making Australia look like a joke. All you hear from our end (anyone outside of Australia) is that Australia issues some stern warnings concerning Johnny Depp's dogs and that the dogs will be killed if they aren't out of the country in a few days. A year later this scripted video pops up that features two people that look so apprehensive¬† that it's almost like they're being held hostage.

I don't think Australia is a joke and I honestly don't think anybody else really feels that way, but that's just how this particular story is unfolding. Nobody will care in a few weeks though so I wouldn't worry about it too much.

Australians are the best and India is second best in cricket. I just like johnny Depp and Australian Govt. is giving him a hard time. Mahatma Gandhi was doing peaceful protests from over 30 years in India (from 1918 - 1947) and he was a national hero, if Britishers would have killed Gandhi then it will lead to riots in the entire nation. In 1950, Nathuram Godse (a hindu) killed Gandhi (Because he was in favor of giving more money and land to pakistanis) and Mohammed Ali Jinnah(Creator of Muslim league and Pakistan) was killed by pakistanis because after creation of Pakistan citizens did not have enough resources.",2016-04-20T00:04:53Z,0

Then why did Britishers freed India in 1947? Your knowledge about Indian History is very limited. (Although your facts are true and i agree with all of your above mentioned points) It all happened after the ""divide and rule"" policy of Britishers. After revolt of 1857 Britishers implemented this policy, which leaded riots in the entire country(which were uncontrollable by them).  They were ready to left the country only if India is partitioned in to two countries, and then Pakistan was created. Such a nice solution to resolve the conflict. Now both the countries have nuclear weapons.
We are not in BC my friend, we live in 21st century. Australia is more stable than India. Many people go to US, UK, Canada, Australia and UAE for better future. 
We are not racist, pakistanis hate us because we did not give them enough resources(land, money) during partition and they suffered. Dravidians hate us because of the same issue. But we don't kill each other in 21st century.",2016-04-19T21:47:21Z,0
175,Ugh_Uh728BL2UHgCoAEC,Anton K,"@Ravi Vyas Dream on, Ravi. You're delusional. I know Indian people. They admit their people and nation is racist. They tell me the things their relatives say against Chinese, Africans and Europeans. Shocking. But one only has to look at Bollywood to see the incredible racism at work. Look at all the pale actors, when most Indians are brown. The caste system brought by the Aryans and adopted by all India was based on racism, in which the native Dravidians were discriminated against. If you think the various peoples and religions of India were 'united' when the British were there, duh! Of course they were - when people are ruled over by a stronger power they feel unity among themselves because they see a greater enemy that stands above their petty hatreds. The British kept the peace, for as soon as they left you all started killing each other. In other words, the hatred had been bottled up and exploded as soon as it could. The same thing happened in Iraq. As soon as America left, ISIS formed and people started killing each other again. If you think the numerous dynasties, kingdoms and empires of India ""didn't kill civilians"" - of course they did! Thousands upon thousands of civilians were slaughtered in the Mauryan Kalinga War c. 261 BCE in Odisha and Andhra Pradesh. Untold multitudes of innocent people were killed in the decades of war and conquest by Samudragupta between 335 & 380 CE. Enormous numbers of innocent people were killed in the Mughal-Maratha Wars between 1681 & 1707. Many more were killed in the wars between 1615 & 1682 in the Mughal-Ahom conflicts. So don't give me that peace rubbish. Indian kingdoms have always been at war. And race-based violence continues today. In 2012, 77 people were killed in a racial conflict in Assam between the Assamese and Bodo community against local Bengalis. In 2007 Hindu fundamentslists slaughtered 68 Pakistani nationals at Diwana station. So keep your false ideas about a harmonious India if you want, the facts say otherwise. ",2016-04-19T21:21:13Z,0

Those were small dynasties of India hundreds of years ago and they were fighting in battlefield. They did not slaughter civilians. Just look in to this:
https://www.quora.com/Which-countries-have-the-most-brutal-and-horrific-history

Later on Mughals won all these small dynasties and formed complete India and then promoted unity between Hindus and Muslims. Our unity was so strong that in 1857 all the hindus followed the fatwa of muslims and revolted against British. It is the biggest army revolt in world's history. Even during the Mughal period people were not that brutal. During partition of India almost 1 million people were killed.",2016-04-19T12:48:38Z,0

Well, again I say you are wrong.¬† Diseases, as everybody knows, are not always visible and it is not relevant that they do not have a disease in any case.¬† The point is that they COULD (think of this as italics not shouting) have a disease.¬† They could have fleas that carry a disease.¬† They could have a seed in their fur, etc etc etc.¬† That is why there are protocols to be followed so that any possibilities of disease being brought into the country are prevented.¬† And rabies is just the most obvious one that we all talk of, an example really.¬† Now, if your dog got a disease because of their dogs (and they took them to be groomed) that was spread because of those ""Yorkies"" (really they are ""dogs"" and so, does the breed matter?) I bet you would be telling a different story here now and Depp and Heard would come down off their pedestal in a flash.

As to your second comment about the dogs not being hid - again you are wrong.¬† The plane was searched.¬† The dogs were not there.¬† It is thought from footage that they were possibly sneaked out in a bag (so, maybe the breed is relevant becuase I doubt they could have done that with a Rottweiller for exampe).¬† So, tell me again the dogs were not sneaked in and not hidden!¬† They clearly were - and just because the charges were not pursued does not mean that it did not occur.¬†¬†¬† I am glad it seems ridiculous however because it means that it has been broadcast throughout the world and highlighted what people should not do.¬† I respectfully disagree with you and happily will support what has occurred.¬† I approve of what has occurred.",2016-04-19T03:34:49Z,0

Secondly, she brought them in her private plane so she didn't get ""lucky"" because she just loaded her dogs in her plane, she didn't ""hide"" them. She wanted to bring them to take care of them while they were in Australia to shoot a movie. Like the guy who posted this comment, it's not like it's a wild species, it's a freaking Yorky!

186,Ugj4nHQT3JKszXgCoAEC,On A Serious Note,"+Lisa Russell Totally disagree.  And I think it is not so bad that more has been made of it because of who they are (by the way, she is not ""Mrs Depp"" - you seriously ought to be up-to-date on the fact that women don't always want their husband's name).  I do not think it has made Australia look foolish at all and I do not feel ashamed as an Australian.  As to Barnaby Joyce, whilst I do not particularly like him, I am totally okay with how he handled this.  What they did was entirely wrong and they thought they could get away with it.  You do realise the dogs were hidden right?  Probably in a bag carried off the plane by an assistant.  So, she got off very lightly.  Now, if your dog got rabies (or some other disease brought in by them) I wonder how you would feel about it then?  No need to reply, but just have a think about how you would feel if they had actually brought a disease in.  And oh, as to your first comment - well, they could have legally brought their dogs to Australia by just following a few small protocols that keep our biosecurity safe.  They flouted the law and they really got away with it.  $1,000 to them is like 5 cents to most of us.",2016-04-19T00:00:41Z,0
