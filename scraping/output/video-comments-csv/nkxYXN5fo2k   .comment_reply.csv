The concept of divorce is also a very depressing reprocussion as well as inevitability of merging business with something intangible and spiritual like a marriage ceremony binding two sovriegn beings in a mergence that most people aren't emotionally or psychologically ready for due to childhood traumas and arrested developments making people either abandon relationships altogether or fight until the dynamic is so unbearable that there is some kind of separation.
