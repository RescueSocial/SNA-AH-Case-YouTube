It's disgusting, I find her repulsive...
I feel sorry fot JD, in my hearts of heart's I know he was going through a hard time in his life an she manipulated to the extreme, him circumstances, used him, and by a fine line black male, but she chose to preaume to be smart an trail for court.

9,Ugyi5bsRK_OvRPhoq9R4AaABAg,"""I had metadata."" If she's got the photos et c she still has it, it doesn't even have to be the original files, copies or clones are fine. You have to scrub files from metadata and it's pretty hard to get rid of all of it (it's more than dates and stuff). If she's got the files but NO metadata she either scrubbed them or can't find it. The only reason the files would be 100% clean is that she had an expert scrub them and if that's the case WELL SUIT YOURSELF, ASSHAT. Don't delete evidence you need. 

...unless you realise that the metadata will show the photos to be edited or the metadata to be manipulated. In that case, sure, scrub the files, I mean, it would be pretty inconvenient to hand over files with metadata showing the photos having been taken on Amber's mobile and edited on Amber's home computer. Also: you can restore deleted files, so if you've accidentally deleted them, they can still be found.

Makes me wonder if she lost the metadata before or after Depp requested an IT-expert as one of the expert witnesses.",Anechka,2,2021-05-28T14:49:09Z

She has obviously still not provided the drafts the judge wants to prove those edits occurred.
If this continues, I could see the judge sanctioning Amber‚Äôs attorney, or simply telling Johnny that he has prevailed in the case, and awarding Johnny damages from Amber.",lisa richards,4,2021-05-22T23:58:05Z
60,UgzjiImyXyP6pdOLFh54AaABAg,"I agree that it makes no sense that the ACLU is defending someone that stiffed them.
The ACLU provides free attorneys in civil rights cases. I have brought them no less than four cases that they have won. 
It is a nonprofit organization that makes money by winning cases and keeping the legal fees incurred, in addition to a percentage of damages and settlement moneys awarded to the plaintiffs that it defends.
The ACLU would never represent a divorce case like Johnny and Amber‚Äôs, so I have a hard time understanding what, if any involvement, that they actually have in Ms. Heard‚Äôs editorial.
I personally believe that Ms. Heard entirely fabricated their involvement.
Oppositionally, other YouTube channels claim that the ACLU is defending Ms. Heard, and that they are further doing so by not providing the receipt, or lack thereof.
I, however, I have never believed that since Day One.
I believe thar the ACLU is waiting for a motion to compel them to provide said documents regarding Ms. Hears‚Äôs donations, or actually, lack thereof.
I have always believed that the ACLU has been waiting for a judge to force them to hand them over said receipts for a couple reasons.
I believe thar Amber threatened to sue the ACLU and Children‚Äôs Hospital if they provide said receipts, or inform Depp‚Äôs legal counsel of the lack thereof, through her attorneys, citing the US financial privacy laws.
I have held all the same beliefs about the ACLU and the Children‚Äôs Hospital here in town.
Neither party have any reason to defend Amber Heard, who never donated the promised money to them, and simply used there‚Äôs non-profit organizations for her own publicity purposes, and for her sociopathic manipulation in court of Justice Nichols.
The two LA charitable entities are being cautious, not wanting to be sued by Heard for violating privacy laws. 
I believe they have both been waiting for Johnny to sue them for those financial documents for years, so they would be compelled by a judge to turn them over .
Johnny‚Äôs counsel has now sued the ACLU finally, as after all this time!!!!
So I believe the ACLU has been wanting the judge to rule on Johnny‚Äôs lawsuit, demanding that they comply.
The judge will eventually get around to that.
That is why the ACLU did not hand over financial papers previously, and still has not handed them over.
It has nothing to do with other YouTube channels‚Äô false and ridiculous claims that the ACLU and the hospital have been defending her.
Again, the ACLU does not deal with lawsuits like Amber‚Äôs against Johnny, nor would they defend against it, I don‚Äôt care who what Amber says, or who she blames for her failure to provide documentation in support of her (fake) claims.
I also find it literally impossible to believe that the ACLU would be helping her write an editorial.
