Even worse, in the case of Elon; He has shrewdly set himself up to be in connection with A LOT of powerful people and political movers and shakers. At this point, I don't think he could be cancelled or even properly penalized no matter how wrong or egregious his actions may be. 
I don't think the general public is aware of how corrupt he truly is and how deep those ""connections"" run. Even his criticizers in the business world who bring up valid complaints and questions say that they would not go against him.
Musk literally has card Blanche and considers the universe to merely be his plaything. ( His launching of a Tesla into space is the equivalent of broken down cars on a white trash lawn. He Seems to consider all of space to be his property)
And We have all seen how he is able to manipulate the stock market with a mere tweet ( and barely get a slap on the wrist for it.

The worst thing is, we ALLOWED him to do all of this, believing he was out to save the world and make it a better place.
The reality is far more sinister. He is only out for himself and improving the lives of his fellow 1% ( provided he sees value or has use for them.)
The way Musk has continued to pull strings and finance, manipulate The JD vs. AH case all while deftly avoiding sitting down for his deposition ( or to tell the truth/ come clean about Any of his involvement, Shows just how Sneaky, Dangerous and unhinged he really is.

Elon Knows that AH is in the wrong and that she has lied and manipulated everyone this whole time, yet he still funds and helps her, despite pretending to be happy in his relationship with Grimes and their new child.
( Though That ""relationship"" seems to be a shady business arrangement to help garner a more positive public image..... He literally made a child for good press; talk about inhuman!)
This is all likely just a pissing contest for him due to JD's derogatory text messages that he sent, venting to his friend about Elon and his adulterous behavior with JD's then Wife.
He knows that he has the finances and influence to draw this case out until JD ends up bankrupt.
Musk and Heard Really Deserve each other and should just stop bothering to hide their involvement. These people are disgusting and evil and very truly Dangerous.
Proof that if you have enough money and the right connections, you can do and get away with ANYTHING.
He and AH are Laughing at us all and making a mockery of society and the judicial system; playing dirty and using every loophole they can.
we should all be outraged and very scared :(",2021-07-09T08:59:39Z,1

He is attempting to use it as an excuse for his Terrible behavior, personality and for being so patently UNFUNNY; None of which are the sole cause of being on the spectrum.

284,Ugw9O4DZC2vD1RaqT9V4AaABAg,Mash Z,@Green Carrot Im pretty sure the SEC is more credible at deciding on what's manipulation or not than some random guy in the youtube comments. I'd rather take their words over yours,2021-07-02T19:14:01Z,3
285,Ugw9O4DZC2vD1RaqT9V4AaABAg,Mash Z,"@Green Carrot He did manipulate the market and got a $2M fine by the sec for it.(another $2m fine for Tesla). He was even forced to step down from being chairman of Tesla. Look it up. 
He ""jokingly"" made multiple tweets about taking tesla private at $420 at a point when the price was much lower. He even claimed he had funding secured to do it which turned out to be false.

Anyways. He learned the lesson and moved towards the crypto market as It's unregulated and he can pump and dump all he wants",2021-07-02T18:54:16Z,3
