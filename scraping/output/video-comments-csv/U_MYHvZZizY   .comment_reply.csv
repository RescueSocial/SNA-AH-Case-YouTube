112,Ugwzd8jF1PjyBHCfqYh4AaABAg,Julie Lea,"@Von Socks NOT beyond a shadow of a doubt, that's criminal. Burden of proof was on The Sun, 51% balance of probabilities. I'm very familiar with the case. NGN did not prove it's case. Nicol had little to do with any of it, except by virtue of being the threatened/bought off Judge. 
 And public sentiment changed when they heard the audio Nicol dismissed in his verdict "" NO ONE WILL BELIEVE YOU"". 
 Experts in UK law have explained this. JD knew, but he thought the Sun can't PROVE BEYOND 51% HE COMMITTED WIFE BEATING....because there is zero evidence to support that claim & quite a lot to support he never hit her. 
 So we will have to agree that it DID send people into a more of a uproar than had he won. I don't believe he waa softening the battlefield because this is his 7th Court Case!!! The UK is the first loss!!! 6 Cases CAUSED BY AH!! 
 Sheer legal probability in a SEMI-FAIR trial, would have been a win!!
 He didn't need to soften the battlefield with a loss.",2020-12-27T00:43:27Z,0
