25,UgwkE5N9NqsWmVGkjy54AaABAg,Danotaz Media,Most of my reasons for disliking dolphin are for the most part subjective. I've just personally never found her to be a very interesting character. I thought that dolphins introduction to the Aquaman comics prior to rebirth was super random and felt forced. Then when she was reintroduced to the Aquaman comics in rebirth despite having a fastest Superior design and power set to the original I still thought her personality was  boring and and her new backstory was awful.,2020-12-08T20:06:39Z,0

27,UgwxHAVTZfdLZIugVgJ4AaABAg,Golden Retriever33,"@Naquin Green Speaking of Batwoman i am hoping Ryan Wilder character will be better written. I am interested with that new character.

But then:

So Paragons are irrelevant now ? Anti-Monitor tried to kill all paragons ( aka universal safeguards ) so rather wanted to kill them to regain his power since they recreated multiverse with Oliver. 

Kate is gone then this Paragons meaning lost entire sense. Why couldn't they just recast Kate Kane. So Ryan gets title of paragon of courage or what ? I hope they will explain themselves.",2020-11-20T08:43:17Z,0
28,UgwxHAVTZfdLZIugVgJ4AaABAg,Golden Retriever33,"@Naquin Green Isn't riverdale part of Archieverse ?

By the way Riverdale is also CW Berlanti's show.

I loved riverdale for first 2 seasons, season 3 was passable but Season4 is WTF ?! Seriously ? Hermosa Lodge as another lost sister ?! Hiriam Lodge is already absurdal. Also Edgar lool. Cheryl keeping her brother's corpse, Archie's lost uncle, Kevin's gay problems, long lost brother of Betty, Jughead's faked murder.... Jesus so what else in Season 5 ?! ALiens ?! Maybe just crossover with Sabrina to make it much more absurdal",2020-11-20T08:34:32Z,0

45,Ugzmi7ZiC6_NdMPwMWJ4AaABAg,John Schollian,"@Cytron1515 will you be watching the Snyder Cut? Amber Heard's Mera was in the theatrical cut of Justice League and I think she might be in the Snyder Cut too. Also boycotting the entire DCEU is easy for me because most of them aren't that great to me. Man of Steel was meh, Batman V Superman and Suicide Squad were bad but watchable, Wonder Woman was the only good one I've seen, Justice League was terrible, I didn't watch Aquaman, Shazam, or Birds of Prey, and I have mixed feelings about Wonder Woman 1984 and the Flash movie since neither is out yet, and I have no intention of ever watching Aquaman 2. DC only seems to do a good job with thier standalone movies like Joker which I did watch and loved. I do plan on seeing Matt Reeve's Batman trilogy since that is technically it's own thing and not connected to the DCEU and it looks good",2020-12-02T12:55:40Z,0
