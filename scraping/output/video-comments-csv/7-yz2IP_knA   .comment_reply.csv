Does her comment comes as natural from a person that gets slapped often? No it comes out from soneone that hasn't been hurt before. And yes it was calculated to a point. All those pics of JD sleeping covered in ice cream? Or sleeping on the floor. What was her motive taking them? You see your partner getting soiled in his sleep and you take a pic?

I guess. All vulnerable and oblivious....funny cuz no one really had to do shit to reveal her true intentions.  She hung herself...as her kind eventually do! The longer it goes on the more of an ass they make of themselves. She's a hoot! Thinking she's clever enough to weasel money out of none other than Johnny Deep! Guess it's go big or go home....and HOME she will go....where they already are hip to who she really is... the bunch of folk she can't hide from, those who aren't surprised or saw this coming....Either way, it's a total loss for Amber....Probably is making her blood boil! Thats the sweet revenge in it...Think about it,  it's gotta be PURE TORTURE to be a narcissist that couldn't find anyone to be a narcissist to! And like her family puts up with her crap! She probably mad and scared to death....She is certainly entering a ""world if pain""...alienating herself from the hand that feeds her in terms of reputation....cuz before all this, I had no idea who this bimbo was....Now, I  know more than I ever wanted to know! However, I am satisfied that she has been exposed.  It was only a matter of time. I mean who REALLY believed sweet 'lil 'cry baby' Depp was ever violent? He isn't big enough to be violent  (No offense JD....) She probably wishing right now that she could go back and heed JD's warning that this was gonna end bad for her....and him (but we know he was just saving face...he knew it was just gonna end bad for Amber from the get go and tried reasoning with her. Then being the snowflake (no offense) that he is, he repeatedly tried to reason with her....almost begging her,  just short of pleading.....gave her that olive branch, she so desperately wanted...a branch I bet he extended to her many, many, many times before.  Finally, she left him no choice but to DEFEND HIMSELF! She is the bully and needs to be the poster child for that movenent! JD had to call her bluff ....in public. And, c'mon people! Its a commandment for Christ sake! It will set you free. It's the only thing that is real. Its the truth...and just like the other cheesy cliché's, it finds its way out! Every gosh darn time! But when revenge sweet as what's starting to go down, goes down...it's SO WORTH WAITING FOR! Like a public execution, or something!!

Hint! Hint! Warner Brothers! Fire this She-Devil or suffer the consequences""

89,UgycJP1ZxUryvSn2Tbd4AaABAg,Stefanie Nasalski,"She will do it again. She bullied her sister, and ruined Johnny. Amber ruins people! She sucks the life out of people and targets individuals who don’t fight back. These individuals are open, honest, and empathetic. Therefore, creating an emotional power dynamic that sucks the life out of the victim. Power dynamics should be recognized as the biggest red flag. *** (Just reconstructing the original statement in a cohesive manner) 😇",2021-03-21T06:48:53Z,2

You gotta wonder how many of them are smarter than that [narcissists vs straight psychopaths, have different success rates]. The real shame of it is that they are not only hurting men, but women as well... but it's not like someone who would destroy another person's life for spite or personal gain, cares if the collateral victims are actual victims of abuse or not [female or otherwise]... because they have no f's given for their direct victims at all.",2021-03-11T06:35:57Z,4

He and Heard believe their own press, so they refuse to accept help or change their ways.  They think they are always right and they are above everyone else.  Toxic narcissism and a freaking God complex.  The only way to deal with them is ignore them...while they're in prison for all the crimes they commit against everyone around them.",2021-03-04T09:22:27Z,0

125,Ugz5L65fSxJSslH6OKp4AaABAg,Burnbrae,"No, I don't believe it is legally binding but she used the ruse of the 100% donation to remove her 'gold digger' label and to say she is only doing it for no other gain than to protect other women who suffer the same abuse. That was the picture given to the jury and it worked perfectly. Reality is, she has kept most of the money and thus revealing the more likely motive was greed. The evidence of the recordings clearly show she was lying about her abuse claim and that will be her downfall either in or out of court. The law may spin facts and dismiss or withhold evidence but the real jury is the public's eyes & ears.  

Did she plan to ruin him / take his money from the beginning? I don't believe that she did. Did she really love him? I don't believe that she did. I however feel she loved being with him for who he was and what he had. She is clearly highly strung and has lived a life fuelled on aggression where as JD is a very laid back and reserved individual. Not a good combination. Based on the evidence she also seems to be quite narcissistic and a control freak. Their relationship was never going to last. The final straw for her seems to be when JD wanted to be the one to end the relationship. That is something a narcissist cannot accept. The fallout we see before our eyes is testament to that.

The web of lies that seem to have been spun here is staggering. Staggering and shameful. May true justice be done in April next year.",2021-02-28T23:07:37Z,1
