They're done, in my opinion, and the possibility of their top brass actually implementing the plans necessary to turn things around are basically slim to none at this point. They really are the sjw playhouse you referred to them as and, so long as disney is in control of them, they will likely remain so considering how sjw that company is.

I think DC is still viable, though, and worth saving. There is a sjw presence there, but it's not nearly as bad as it is at marvel and it isn't spreading too rapidly. I really do think we can help turn things around there and, by doing so, guide the industry as a whole in the right direction.

The way to having a productive argument is by being able to understand where the opposing party is coming from but just because you understand their perspective DOES NOT mean you have to agree with it. I do feel she should be removed, I feel there is just evidence of, at the very least mutual abuse and at most abuse perpetrated by her, to have her removed. The media was ready to burn him for one testimony from her friend and a picture a magical bruise that appeared then disappeared. Yet she is on recording admitting to multiple acts of violence against him for ""running away from the fight"" how can someone be abusing you if they are running away from you?? Yeah I call that just evidence. HOWEVER as I stated WB did not pull Johnny from the Fantastic Beasts movies when everyone was so convinced he was in the wrong and was demanding he be pulled so why would they pull her based on (although very damaging) unsubstantiated evidence.

The situations aren't ""1 to 1"", but I'm curious if someone of influence came to Heards defense. And if so, who?

155,UgxpqWP8khO4NhZP5Rl4AaABAg,Beau Scott,@Customer Service Accusations do not equal evidence of wrongdoing. Settlements do not equal acts of wrongdoing. Admitting to wrongdoing is evidence of wrongdoing. Amber admitted to abuse. She has a track record of abuse. Johnny does not. He had to have producers fight to have keep him in Fantastic Beasts based off of accusations. No such thing for Amber. That's the double standard.,2020-03-30T21:39:04Z,0

They were already in talks to replace him before he and Amber made any of this public.  He‚Äôs settled lawsuits for attacking crew members and been accused numerous times by producers/directors that he was difficult to work with.  Amber, conversely, had a standing contract for Aquaman 2 and 3.  She‚Äôs been accused of wrongdoing well after the statute of limitations has passed.

186,UgycbeUTZiEE4IJvYuJ4AaABAg,Customer Service,"surfitlive I guess you don‚Äôt realize that when a victim fights back it‚Äôs considered a defensive action and NOT abuse?  I guess submitting a dozen or more photos documenting injuries sustained and permanent physical scars incurred from those injuries isn‚Äôt credible evidence of her abuse? How about witness testimony that supports when and how those injuries occurred? And you believe Johnnys finger was cut off somehow by Amber even though his own text messages with his doctor prove that he injured it himself? 

I couldn‚Äôt stop myself from lashing out violently at my abuser either... does that mean I wasn‚Äôt the victim?  Well I‚Äôm sorry but the court disagreed with you and I hope you‚Äôre prepared for them to disagree with Johnny too bc he‚Äôs a liar and he‚Äôs only pursuing this case to drag his victims reputation through the mud after everything else he tried failed.

Do your homework... you do not appear to be very well educated on IPV.  Instead of watching a dozen more Johnny Depp videos on YT, why don‚Äôt you go read a dozen articles on intimate partner violence and known risk factors leading to IPV?",2020-03-20T19:45:05Z,0
