7,UgxaR1201Y4jH98lAyF4AaABAg,"Why is it so hard for people to believe that a woman can be abusive????!!! 
- after everything I've read, seen, heard and investigated about this DV-case between Amber and Johnny... I gotta say... I don't believe Amber anymore... I was not on anyone's side when it started. Now I feel bad for Johnny and his career. The truth should come out. and Amber should be blacklisted aswell. she should be put on ICE until this gets seriously investigated. 

Also, I did not like her in Aquaman even before I heard all the allegations she spewed... So the petition to remove her from the franchise was an easy one to sign. 




Regardless of who is guilty in their relationship. The amount of lies that has come out of Amber's mouth since it came to light, has had me question every bit of her character.",ƒ´d√°,1,2020-05-16T12:27:01Z

97,UgzSbM1_mrzruuIak8d4AaABAg,"If Ms Heard is in jail, it will be difficult to make this film. Everyone seems to forget that serious laws have been broken. When Ms Heard accused Mr Depp, she produced ""evidence"" that she SOLD to the tabloids. When it came time for her to submit this ""evidence"" to the court for testing and verification, she dropped the case. The judge then dismissed the case WITH PREJUDICE (meaning Ms Heard can never charge Mr Depp with assault again), extraordinary circumstances indicating an intrinsic flaw in her case, usually with the evidence. Now that Ms Heard has presented an opportunity for Mr Depp to litigate she MUST present her ""evidence"" to the court. Tampering with evidence, fabricating evidence, and perjury are serious...but SELLING it for profit, and using it to destroy someone's career while promoting your own are offences punished with incarceration. The Judge is going to weigh the damage done to Mr Depp, his family, his career; and the damage done to the credibility of the Women's Organizations that gave her recognition, as well as the damage done to L'Oreal, who hired her as a spokesperson, and use that to determine punishment. This is much more serious than a fine. This will be uncovering evidence of a crime during the investigation of another crime (defamation). The defamation will be settled first, then the new crimes will be considered. It is difficult to imagine a scenario that would allow Ms Heard to blame this on anyone but herself, and her two witnesses/accomplices.",NIBS,10,2020-02-07T10:16:04Z

194,UgzpflwARIxs5opzZLF4AaABAg,"Take Mera out of the film and tie in his Justice League association. Replacing Amber would effect the entire franchise for me. 
It‚Äôs not something as simple as replacing Hulk or Rhody, hulks movie wasn‚Äôt even connected until the end (aside from Ross who pops up randomly to persecute) and rhody 1 wasn‚Äôt even war machine so he‚Äôs easily replaceable. Amber is literally the co-star and love interest in a film that grossed over a million $. That‚Äôs like replacing Gwyneth in Ironman",DawnaTroi,1,2020-02-05T18:15:25Z
195,UgzRf3PmEd2ad0RWWIR4AaABAg,If theres one thing I'll give disney is that they know to make sure to avoid stuff like this. Yes they reacted to quickly to James Gunn but when it comes to something like the Lassener Allegations they know what there doing. If WB keep on Amber Heard I will NOT be happy!! I think they should replace her with someone else like Lily James or Charlize Theron or (if they really wanted to be meta) Emilia Clarke.,Herb Coswell,1,2020-02-05T18:13:55Z
