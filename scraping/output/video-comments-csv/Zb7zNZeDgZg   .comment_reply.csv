Wouldn't it be okay in a cosplay type of way or would it somehow be different with him being the actual actor i wonder

A disgrace to the UK. I am so pleased that JD has got a judge who won’t allow for her  (ah) tactics of theatricality, tears and twisting of truth.

146,UgwIM-bKpGbuqZwUAtx4AaABAg,matt storey,"@Artsy Forest The $7M is spent, either to a charity (it appears not so) or otherwise. The crux is, they entered into a non-disclosure pact pre-divorce I won't talk smack about you or us, you don't do the same. As a precursor to whatever the settlement in the divorce may be, I'll give you X amount each month as spousal support. She countered with a need X (which became $7M over a few months and several checks) in addition to the monthly support to give to charity of my choice. He agreed, since it's going to charity. He still paid the monthly support on top of the amount intended for charity.

Then she went on the AH I'm a victim world tour and I'm AH the virtuous, I give money to charity, DV shelters and little children charity world tour! She demeaned him and ""alluded"" to him about what she claimed happened to her (which was her fiction, but really did happen to an assistant, her assistant quit in disgust). she got so full of her self getting away with tarnishing him that she eventually slipped up and penned a column in the Washington Post actually using his name, not just ""alluding"" to him. His lawyers pounced.

So the crux she is really hiding is, did she give the 7M to charity, pocket it or in some other way divert it. If it went to anywhere besides the two charities she named, she broke the deal right on the front, despite the spirit of it, alluding to JD as her abuser. She claimed sainthood and made him the devil with his own money. If he can show she was breaking the deal right up front....how can any divorce decree or spousal support be valid that was based on their original agreement? You do know that AH's and JD's divorce isn't final yet? She has her own money from her acting career, his pockets are deeper though, she want's 1/2 or more of HIS stuff not just hers. He was actually generous, he paid for quite some time ""living expenses"" to her even while pre-divorce. That's what this maneuvering is about, is she going to get nothing, some or lots of his loot. She is caught stealing or misdirecting the $7M explodes any pre-divorce agreements that they had an shows bad faith for the final settlement. If there was any justice, the harm she did to his life, his career, his reputation and any moneys she has siphoned off so far, she should be paying HIM for divorce.

Whether Amber Heard donated money as she claimed, or lied, has no bearing on the facts of the case. Amber Heard made the lie, because it made her look better in the eyes of the public, and Depps lawyers brought that up in court, even though they knew it had to fail, because they also knew it would rob her of that fake publicity.",2021-06-03T20:33:59Z,0

187,UgybNmTiikr5sHLKk2J4AaABAg,Ben Gibson,"@Wallart pops Your certain standard and level of journalistic integrity has nothing to do with what you suggested should be law. Again, you do not realise what you are saying, it does not result in what you say you want.",2021-06-01T15:53:37Z,0
188,UgybNmTiikr5sHLKk2J4AaABAg,Wallart pops,"@Ben Gibson No, what's truly absurd is your apparent belief that print media SHOULDN'T have to be held to a certain standard or maintain a respectable level of journalistic integrity. News outlets have a code of ethics they are supposed to abide by, which includes using reputable sources, checking facts and getting comments from people on BOTH SIDES of an issue. 
It's true that a defamation lawsuit can be brought against a news outlet that printed a story that they knew was false but it's not the only reason. People can also sue for defamation if it can be proven that a news outlet showed a ""reckless disregard"" for whether or not the article they were publishing was true. Considering what was written about Johnny Depp and what has since come out about Amber Heard and the many lies she has told, I'd say that criteria has easily been met.",2021-05-30T10:51:14Z,2
