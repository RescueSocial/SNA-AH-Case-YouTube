Now again we have no base line to be able to measure whether this is abnormal or deviates from her usual verbal patterns, but its a good indicator either way when the tense changes.

The one critique I would make is this: Please, don't pause as quickly and as often as you do. Some pauses are within mere seconds of each other, followed by long explanations, and it's hard for the untrained eye to see any of what you're talking about. What'll help is if you replay the moment you're analyzing while your audio plays over the muted clip so that we have a visual of what you're talking about and not just our memories to rely on.

I don't think the Judge or Jury would come to the same conclusion about her if she was just your average jane doe looking woman. I can't think of the word for it right now for that that's called, that that's an interesting topic how looks can, despite body language, or *evidence*, can sway a persons opinion about you. :) Video idea?

When you watch the uncut video, just before she says this she says something very quickly under her breath to her lawyer. Some say that she says ""My baby"" .

Too bad the UK judge couldn‚Äôt read her the same way. It is my understanding that her head was bobbling around all over the courtroom in that same ‚Äúavoidance‚Äù type move that she displays here, and I‚Äôm sure she did the script reading as well when she came up with her ever changing stories. She also is incapable of answering a yes or no question with a simple yes or no, it‚Äôs always a bowl of word salad.
