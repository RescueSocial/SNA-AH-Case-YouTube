0,UgwNUnfauoOMal-UxGt4AaABAg,Johnny Depp's career has suffered because he's old and a woman beater. I think it's sick that women would take the side of a woman beater over the victim. No different than women taking the side of John Bundy simply because they thought that a good looking man couldn't be a murderer,JJ All,0,2021-05-20T14:28:11Z

16,Ugy-M0SiL5VxMp39P8J4AaABAg,"He's not ""trying to get money out of Amber"" and yes it's completely worth his time to fight back. To get his reputation back, to get his career back. To not have people in the media speak of him the way you did. Everyone that knows Johnny is coming to his defense, not saying, he's needed help for awhile now. Ex partners of his are coming to his defense. Normally people jump at the chance to talk crap about their ex's. I am extremely disappointed of E Canada to be so blatantly bias. This was what? March. Yeah do your research now. You're just like the rest of the media so quick to judge. This is a man that spends 5 hours at children's hospitals dressed as Caption Jack Sparrow. Not what most celebrities do and if they do they pop in for maybe half an hour. He really gets to know the kids and their parents as he was once a parent of a sick child. He knows how incredibly difficult it is on the parents. I have so many stories of how wonderful he is but I'll part with one that came from a co-star of his. They had just worked a 12 hour day and on the way to his car he stopped and signed every single autograph of the people waiting for him. Hours in terms rain.

29,UgzPM8GDGYsl3eMVTtx4AaABAg,"I don't think Johnny is lo ok king for money. I think Johnny is finally standing up for himself and abused men. IF he is the victen, this would be huge for men and for all victems. If he wins this case, it will set a precedence regarding providing CONCRETE evidence to prove their accusations. When they divorced, it appears that Johnny just gave up the $7 mill....pretty easy for him...in Hope's that she would take her money and go away. She has not done that. She has continued to accuse Johnny of abusing her, advocate to victems and become a spokesperson for victems of abuse. IF Johnny is correct, Amber has been acting as a victen which, in reality she was the abuser. She has lied, manipulated and hoaxed courts as well as the general public that she was the victrm of devistating abuse while SHE was actually the horrible abuser. She has admitted to hitting Johnny, audio releases pretty much show that, not only was SHE the abuser, but she picked fights with Johnny on a regular basis. And her argument was that he left in the middle and did not finish the fight. Johnny was smart enough to remind himself from the violence. So far we know (if its true) that Amber threw a can if mineral spirits st Johnny and she threw a vodka bottle at him resulting in severing his finger. She admitted to those present that she threw the bottle at him. 
Amber got her divorce , Temp restraining order and 7 million dollars in court and ALL she hff adcyo fo was SAY bvb that he abused her. Johnny has finally had enough of her dragging his name through the mud etc. YES, this worth it! IF what we have learned online is true, he will be exonerated. Amber will also be exposed as the manipulator and abuser that she is. This is huge for  REAL victems and for men.  Johnny is handling this perfectly in my mind. He has hired an outstanding legal team while he ging on with his life. He has said nothing in public which would turn this whole thing into a he said/she said spat between them. He has allowed his legal team to do their job and stayed out of the public eye....which is his MO. Johnny has appeared in person when required. He has appeared dressed appropriately and withbt HF e proper respect and manners g ok r th hff e people who requested his presence. He has answered their questions with clear and easy to understand explanations. He has also never changed his story as far as I know. Johnny has let his friends and those who know him speak for him. I believe he will appear in court when needed and I believe Amber will appear. But, she will be angry, she will stumble over her stories and lies and cry. I truly pray that IF Johnny was indeed the victem of abuse by what appears to be a horrible, horrible person, he will be exonerated and she will be petrified. I hope she is convicted of lying and providing false evidence and that she goes to prison for th he maximum amount if time allowed. 
In the end...YES, it is worth it for Johnny and all victems out there that need to be believed and supported.",Tera Dactyl,0,2020-04-09T06:10:33Z

What we have here is called  Narcissistic abuse.
Usually generated by a person  who's more than likely someone with a severe mental/emotional disorder.
And you betcha that there's a bunch of Disorders out there!
So we'll just bring up the name one of them out'a that bunch Folks!
Narcissistic Personality Disorder!
That's NPD Folks!
And wouldn't you know it!
Nah, probably not.
But ya ought to!
Cause their out there!
And walking among us!
You betcha!
They really are!
And you really should educate yourself about them and on Narcissism too!
And why yes!
There are different ones!
Different types of Narcissists!
Their on this type of psychology comparison sorta scale.
I'm not kidding.
There really is!
So we'll just stick to the basic 3.
Yup! Your right! There are more! And if not careful?
You'll definitely get really really screwed!
Well.. either way,. Your gonna get screwed anyway.
Cause that's what they do.
So we're only going to quickly talk about 3 types of the Narc.
And tell em what the first one is Bob!
Well,. The first one is called a 1. Overt Narcissist,  
2. Covert Narcissist
3. Malignant Narcissist.
With the first one being the least destructive than the others and the third Narcissist  being the most dangerously destructive.
Where they all show commonly these under handing traits that all have one purpose of bringing you under total and complete common control!
Which one do you think Heather is?
My money is on that Heather is the Malignant Narcissist.
Ohhhh boy!
And that's the nastiest one out  of the whole bunch.

Also, just because somebody has problems with alcohol does it mean that they commit DV. Infind it very telling that you forgot to mention the fact that Amber  also has a history of domestic violence. Heard was actually arrested and spent a  night in jail for assaulting her then girlfriend, Tasya Van Ree, in an airport in 2009. When it comes out that she was in fact abusing him,(on audio tapes) you aren’t so quick to discredit Amber Heard, are you?

 40-plus EYEWITNESS TESTIMONIES & photos prove Heard abused Depp. I think that's worth going to court over. 
 These clowns in the media don't report the FACTS.
 What about the legions of people including Lori Ann (his 1st wife), Sherilyn Finn (x fiancee), Kate Moss, Vanessa Paradis (14 yrs together mother of his 2 kids) who INSIST he isn't capable of abuse?
 Doug Stanhope said he was being blackmailed (she asked for 5 Mill in spousal support) & many, many others?
 Depp sued his legal team because they stole 40 Mill from him, of course they said horrible things about him in their Counter-Suit.

And on his daughter's birthday.     She knew he would be way too weak to defend himself and she was hoping he would give in to all of her demands *read the letter that was delivered to him by her lawyers BEFORE this while he was at his movie's premiere.   It threatened him and she demanded over 50k a month in spousal support, 3 of his penthouses (because 2 of her lying friends were living in the other 2 for years), HIS DOG, HIS rangerover, millions of dollars as well as a shitload of other stuff.      HE Didn't GIVE IN.   He told her NO.     So she went to the court with that moving fake blemish of a bruise and started her relentless MEDIA assault on him (remember not ONCE did she ever file a police report, a medical report, hospital report, doctors report, NOTHING, not even AFTER the fact during the divorce) ---- All she ever did was give magazine interviews and that was all the proof she needed.   OH and she released a video she took of him while he is upset and NEVER COMES CLOSE TO HER AT ALL, he angrily shuts some cupboards and that's it.     HE HAS EVIDENCE TOO, mind you, of her LYING about all of this but he chose to keep it for COURT.     She kept fleeing and making excuses why she couldn't do her deposition, remember?    Finally they got her to sit down for it but she decided to SETTLE the next day and we never got to see any of the real evidence.       Now he finally gets to tell his side of the story as well as present the TRUTH.      Imagine being vilified for being an abuser and a wife beater when you are the opposite?   And in fact, SHE was the abusive person in all of this!   Remember, she was ARRESTED for domestic abuse with her previous partner.       Imagine that?    And then she gets famous for being a survivor or abuse, etc.         THAT is his motivation..     And let me tell you, I am not a die-hard Depp fan.    But I have liked his movies and the things he does behind the scenes to help other people out.     And he didn't deserve any of this.   No one does.
