29,Ugw7xsm9ii5D-AhJwP14AaABAg,Darkos Venicci,"It matters to a lot of people because she got away with abusing her partner and lying about it. This case sets a precedent of getting away with domestic violence based off of abusing the me too movement and the cultural reforms that are meant to help people. Like he has no public history of assault, battery, or abuse since 1989 while she was arrested in 2009 for domestic violence against her ex-wife in a public airport. On top of others speaking out about her repetitive abusive and lying behavior. Even though she has a direct pattern of lying and abuse, multiple around her spoke out against her, she was proven to be lying on the stand, and she more recently went as far as to fake legal documents to smuggle her dogs into australia. He was convicted based on mostly unbacked claims as well. He has a long history of drug and alcohol abuse yes but does that mean we should assume all people who have drug/alcohol addictions are criminals and any claims against them is true? That was the main argument for his claimed behavior as a drug/alcohol addict of course he would commit domestic violence. Though it is a common problem with drug/alcohol abuse, should we really assume they are all the same way?",2021-04-06T23:31:35Z,0

She still had the verdict against him and 9 other accounts to go back on. There wasn't enough to prove reasonable doubt against her claims. Because he proved she lied about the settlement and also hurt him. But never disproved hurting her, which was the claim.

96,UgzfwVHg_UuHsDwK6314AaABAg,Darkos Venicci,@Ghost King Gamer Well the UK case was a long run. Honestly can't say my decision as a judge would differ. But the original court case had a lot of problems. Amber is currently being investigated for multiple counts of purjury. Both for the Australia smuggling incident and being caught lying on the stand now. Plus it became quite apparent that with the backing of the metoo movement and large amounts of outside influence. A lot of freedom was given to amber that are completely abnormal. He never really had a fair trial due to the outside influence. But there is also a subpeona filed by Depp regarding evidence that was suppressed that ambers team was allowed to destroy before the end of the trial. Which is a big red flag.,2021-04-11T17:44:56Z,1
97,UgzfwVHg_UuHsDwK6314AaABAg,Darkos Venicci,"I do wanna state though, that I do agree with the UK judges verdict. Johnny shouldn't have filed the suit before he could get an overturned conviction on amber. Because he truly didn't have much to prove his innocence, rather that there were problems for them both. If he really wants to fight that stuff he needs better grounds to work off of. Also I was stating that he should have disclosed it as is normal procedure. Which is unfair and against normal protocol. But his reasoning was sound, even if his behavior seemed more biased.",2021-04-11T05:33:18Z,1
98,UgzfwVHg_UuHsDwK6314AaABAg,Darkos Venicci,"@Ghost King Gamer Well here is part of the problem, the UK judges wife is a political solicitor and legal consultant for women from domestic abuse to equality in the workplace. So the fact he didn't disclose such possible bias shows a lack of forthcomingness. Because he has a personal reason now against johnny. He did have one thing going for him that was tossed out. Amber heard was arrested for domestic violence against her former wife after attacking her in a public airport, she had also previously been arrested for faking legal documents trying to smuggle her dogs into australia. Her some of her other girlfriends also spoke out against her, so that shows she has a history of lying, breaking the law to get her way, and abusing partners.",2021-04-06T23:21:16Z,4
