Poor Johnny was emotionally traumatised, very hurt and angry at what the disgusting barn witch had done to him, he needed to rant to a friend in order to get rid of his rage. The next day he apologised for his text and said ‚Äòhow can you hurt the one you love‚Äô. I wonder how many people out there who have ranted to a friend would do that.

They are aware everyone hates them, and they can‚Äôt handle it. Think about that if you ever find yourself wondering if team #justiceforjohnny might be wrong.

18,UgyKXws3g6i_vXpiI3R4AaABAg,"Look here. I support JD. Do I think there was toxicity that both of them brought into the relationship, the answer is yes. The one that is more at fault is the person the puts their hands on the other first, meaning AH. I'm sure a good amount of Deep fans probably agree with me that JD isn't an unproblemattic Saint. He has problems and issues to work on like the rest of us; what he hasn't done is put his hands on her. I was emotionally, physically, and sexully abused by an ex. The easiest parts to handle and times to handle where when I was emotionally abused, it was so much easier to deal and handle crude words when compared to being throwin into walls and lockers or having my body violated. To the contrary those words hurt me less than the physical parts I want through. Want to call names and be toxic, fine. Want to put your hands on someone and be physically abusive, I think not. There is a fine line between being a toxic ass and an abusive ass, AH crossed the line by putting her hands on JD, end of story.",Spamachu Chan,3,2021-06-16T15:52:38Z
19,UgxwPacnNGqoXILT1N94AaABAg,"People in relationships with toxic, abusive partners are often called abusive themselves for reacting to the abuse.  In fact, abusers will provoke their targets of abuse to react in order to portray the victim as the abuser.  It's a time honored tradition of abusers.  Once the abuser is able to goad the victim enough to get a reaction, the abuser turns it around on the victim to make the victim look like the abuser.  Johnny calling Amber names in private text messages after the abuse he suffered doesn't make him the abuser.   Frankly, calling a woman a witch, who cut off your finger, routinely provoked fights, broke things, threw his phone off the roof top, punched him, threw things at him, and demeaned him, is not sexist.  He was justified in his anger toward this horrible, horrible woman.  Frankly, she was even worse than he knew since she had been compiling ""evidence"" against him the entire relationship and ruining his reputation behind his back.  That behavior is completely normal for abusers - it's how they get people to align with them against the victim and get off the hook for their abusive behavior.  Male abusers and female abusers alike engage in smear campaigns behind the backs of their victims.

I was watching Stevie J Raw's video with Come Geek Some about the mirror incident.  That woman left him to bleed for 12 or more hours while she went off and took a dip in the pool or hung out in the sauna, or even just slept.  I can't get past the idea that Amber -- whether she was really the ""victim"" or actually the perpetrator -- left that man to bleed and go without medical care.  Even if she had been abused, she would have reached out to his staff to get him medical attention for his finger.  His staff was just outside the door, and yet that woman claimed she took a couple of sleeping pills and went to sleep while Johnny bled from a serious injury to his finger.  She also claimed that she woke up at noon the next day and the man with his finger cut off purportedly continued to abuse her.  Like how is that even possible with his finger cut off?",Been There,13,2021-06-16T14:33:33Z

29,UgxVt3-dyqCu8XIVLOt4AaABAg,That comment about how he could speak about women in such a way when she goes into him looking like he smells like an ashtray isn't ironic at all. I made some unflattering remarks about Hugh Hefner today. Should I be ashamed of the way I talk about men? He was talking about specific women in regard to things they did. That isn't misogynistic.
