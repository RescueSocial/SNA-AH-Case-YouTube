1,UgyXhaNGHXe28EdDNxh4AaABAg,"How ironic, months on and look at where we're at now. Momoa is going to act alongside an abuser, AH, in Aquaman 2 even after whats come out about her. And he's also flung shade at half of americas population based on who they voted for.

3,UgwUNYlLBnCA0GmX1j14AaABAg,"I'm just going to say that I know I'm late to commenting on this one but, the hypocrisy with him defending somebody else against Warner's abuse is mind-boggling when he hasn't come out yet and defended Johnny Depp against Amber Heard. There's an interview where she's punching him repeatedly in the arm. I'm sure it's not the first time that that had ever happened. It's like, come on Momoa... You're going to dig yourself a deeper hole with Aquaman already since being outspoken on his Instagram last week about his political beliefs. Now if he defends her instead of stepping up and saying something in defense of Johnny Depp, even with ALL OF THE EVIDENCE AGAINST HER, then he's a hypocrite and I won't watch his movies anymore either along with AH.",peace_love&muzic,0,2021-01-25T15:04:18Z

5,Ugzrx3bh0-q9Um5Ut1F4AaABAg,"As sad as I am about Johnny losing his role as Grindelwald, knowing this is kind of relief that he no longer has to answer to them.

7,UgyrcNBAYEW3ZGb2dFB4AaABAg,Given that Jason Momoa hasn't said anything in Amber defense its very likely he had some experience with her  that doesn't paint her in a good light. That aside he likely doesn't have enough experience to want to comment on her since it would cloud the issue and  cause him unneeded grieve. But given his silence in defending her he likely seen enough to suspect that Depp is telling the truth and wouldn't be remotely upset if she was fired from the movie. That's one of the most telling things people tend to miss is that no one in the industry is coming to her defense yet they have for Depp.,Eric M,1,2020-09-28T13:41:05Z

9,UgxoM3NRmLm2fxRxsqh4AaABAg,The accusations are against Joss Whedon as far as it seems. Sorry but no other cast has said anything negative about Joss in the decades he has been directing.

10,UgyeNppSxO8_le2hQaF4AaABAg,"Even though I hope this is not true (mainly because I love Joss Whedon & everything he‚Äôs created), Ray Fisher doesn‚Äôt seem like a liar. Also, condemning a studio because they allowed their Actors to be treated poorly isn‚Äôt something a barely known Actor would want to risk, especially a Black one. The fact that Jason Momoa backs up Fisher‚Äôs statement shows that something went down. Hell, for all we know, that might be the reason why both Ben Affleck & Henry Cavill were talking about leaving their coveted roles.",Akasha Eyre,0,2020-09-22T10:51:10Z
11,UgxwhQ610NaZCtkrh5h4AaABAg,"Jason Momoa is married to the beautiful Lisa Bonet. Let's not forget she spoke out about her tv dad, Bill Cosby, and his ""sinister"" energy. I admired her for that, because most of the cast stayed silent or supported him. I believe Jason Momoa will eventually do the same thing. It may take awhile, because of his contract, but I have faith he will do the right thing.",vannaty7,2,2020-09-21T21:42:38Z
12,UgxYoOVVBsmSF5v_BKh4AaABAg,"The abuse has been going on since the beginning. It's the hours they're working and conditions. Your on set( wet) cold , waiting for the scene to be reset...20 hours a day straight. I think what Jason means is that the actors are not treated human... more like a prop than a person.

18,UgydGyTzGjhh3kIbQN14AaABAg,"Amber will have said something creepy to Jason at some point which has put him on his guard with her. There seems to be quite a list of men who she's done that with, like the guy from the car program who said she made a comment about them being alone in a downstairs car park and she could claim anything had happened. This is her M.O. Jason is quite right to be as distant as he can from her. Just because you have to work with someone, doesn't mean that you have to like them. I wonder who is under her thumb that she's threatened at WB. Once she's been proved a liar in the UK courts, a whole new ""me too"" movement of men who were put in the same position by Amber will emerge.",M P,0,2020-09-20T16:15:32Z
19,Ugz9jDyiijH2WrMaiF14AaABAg,"I think WBs, in a time of loss of revenue with filming and Covid 19, is saying nothing at the moment because they are awaiting verdicts. I believe they will constructively disregard her contract. Either by making sure the start filming during the trial, where she wont be able to attend, or just by saying, in light of recient events..Amber heard is being removed from Aquaman. Remember, they have alot of money to recoup because of the pandemic and they are making a ""Family friendly"" film. Most actor contracts  have a clause in them stating that if the actor gets into any type of trouble personally, etc, they have the right to discontinue the contract.

Many of Depp fans  and there are alot, will be boycotting the movie because of Heard. People are still afraid of not socially distancing and won't take their kids to the theaters, and others whom are seeing her and her lies in action may question supporting the film. That is a great deal of lost  revenue lost right there.  In these times is she worth being in the film if its going to tank.

I do believe this is why WBs is keeping tight lipped about it. Her disappearance from the aquaman covers and posters I believe is a huge hint. Why create all that merchandise with her on it, wasting more money, when they know the woman is probably going to lose her case. Even the Sun case has a high potential for a loss due to fact checking nothing!

Let's hope WB is creatively discharging her!",Margo Ellingsworth,0,2020-09-20T15:32:25Z

26,Ugx2k3OLmRa3R9NylcV4AaABAg,"The accusations sound genuine to me, and Jason Momoa sounds like a guy with morals and integrity.  This being the case, he would not be very impressed with the revelations about AH.  So people at the top level of Warner Brothers have been accused of abuse - if this is the case, as was pointed out, AH would be their type of person so no wonder she has not been fired.  I am so glad this is all coming out and these people can't hide it anymore.  It is ironic that in the movies these people make, the bad guys lose and the good guys win.  There is a moral in the story.  Yet, behind the scenes it is the bad guys who up until now have been winning.  It is time for this to change.  Good on Momoa for not wanting to kiss AH.

I don‚Äôt know the guy, but in the age of ‚Äúvictim‚Äù AHeard and a billion special little outraged snowflakes, it‚Äôs not inconceivable that he is being listened to more than he deserves.  On the other hand, we know now that Joss has some issues, is probably a huge a-Hole, and that Cyborg probably got shafted while Joss bulldozed his way through a salvaging process.

30,Ugx6nJyCqaFeoEQZi7B4AaABAg,O jon no stating that you dont know how sombody can abuse momoa becaus hea a big fella while your covering depp v heard üôàpower on the work floor trumps size! What's the name of the big black dude who got groped in the crotch in a after party by a Hollywood director? Just cuz your a big man doesn't mean you cabt be in a position to get abused sexually mentally verbally.  physically yes you stated right after there's diff kinds of abuse but come on man this is what keeps man from speaking out idk how you can co tribute to that when you cover a woman abusing a man it just flabergasted me and. I assume its social conditioning peaking trough but its disappointing. Still a fan but please be aware of your contribution to the stereotype taboo. Now this shit ain't that deep ofc a director screaming at you an a set isn't the same as sexual abuse or what Johnny went through for a couple of years but you know what I mean I hope.

By todays standards, William Friedkin would have been incarcerated for life, for the shit he did on set to his cast and crew. striking,  berating and firing guns to scare his cast, shooting car chases without warning the public or the crew what was going to happen. I am sure whatever Joss Whedon did was almost as bad. üòÇ",Pop Culture Minefield,0,2020-09-19T20:58:49Z
