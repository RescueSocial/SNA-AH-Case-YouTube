15,Ugwac8v-RnJqzHx813F4AaABAg,Leslie Fiorda,"Thinking about you Johnny Depp,  I pray you take time for yourself with your children  to grieve your mother properly 🙏!  I lost my Daddy...6 months later, I lost my mother...7 months after that; 3-11-21,  my daughter Sadie passed!
I haven't had time to grieve my parents,  because of my Sadie...
She and my boys grew up in a horrible D.V. situation... It had a lot of effect on them though out their lives. P.T.S.D.,
I still have nightmares.  
I have listened to your tapes of you and Amber... sounds so much like my ex.
Always my fault,  like she said about you.
You stay so calm while she belittled you. 
And you still tell her you love her, and you  will help her.
Do not worry about your career,  you are a wonderful actor, and you will get through this. 
I believe most of her anger came from trying to live a lie, trying to act like she was straight,  when she obviously wasn't. 
I'm not putting her down for that, I have many friends who are who they are.
No one should ever try to be who they aren't. 
With love and prayers,  Leslie",2021-08-11T15:56:56Z,1

185,UgwogLaFhneipMU9FBR4AaABAg,Wasn't me!,It's Amber in those texts I guarantee it. Every line in them is Amber manipulating him. Telling him not to tell Amber so vehemently and repeatedly. Not because they're afraid of her but so he will delete them so they can't be used against her. Repeatedly blaming the lawyers. That's Amber. You can tell because she's barely holding it together. Repeatedly professing their love? The suicide claim?

237,UgwVhDY8j22DS-lVzX54AaABAg,mikeyriot,"I feel you bro - listening to all these tapes and reading the txts reminds me so much of the relationship I had with my physically and mentally abusive ex 10 years ago. It's disturbing how alike my ex and Amber are when it comes to control, gaslighting and manipulation whilst all I wanted was to love and be kind to one another. Even the mockery and constant down putting is the same, it really upsets me to see that Johnny has/is going through this as all the evidence I've seen shows him to be such a nice person whilst she's showing all the same signs my ex did. Here I am 10 years later and not trusting enough to let ppl in anymore. Fuck I've not even told my friends the truth because they're her friends too and I didn't want to paint her in a bad light. Life fking blows man, Amber needs to go to prison for this, what she's done to his career is irredeemable, never mind the mental beating we know he's taken - that shit is tiring, I nearly kms when it happened to me.",2021-11-12T13:20:41Z,1

360,UgzvYdhVmFfmWCUWket4AaABAg,Amit Dutta,"@Snoochie Boochies I happened to read your first comment when it popped up. Sorry man. Listen bro, it will hurt for a while. That's totally fine. Let it. It may even bring you to realise some parts that you may have been responsible for as well. Acceptance in the end is better than bitterness. 
Love isn't restricted to only a romantic sense. It's a driving force or energy in the universe that is unconditionally accepting. I can't prove it to you. Let's just say I've had experiences of a greater unity that I can only call Love. We simply have forgotten that we are also it.
As you go forward just feel it all and let it go. That's the best way. I find it best to remember that all of us are trying our best and often become victims to the circumstances of our lives without realising all circumstances are ever changing. Everything is impermanent. There is a tremendous power and relief in that realisation. Mull it over.
Enjoy the present moment. It is all we really experience. The world will do its thing. It is up to you to choose how you respond to it and what you bring to it. Now more than ever we need to see our commonalities if we have any chance of survival.
Much peace and good vibes to you bro. It all works out in the end 😂",2020-07-17T08:55:34Z,0

365,Ugx-MTbbQFt8n36eGaN4AaABAg,BigCityJungleCat EnvisageThat,"@Peyton Brandon: Seems you are knocking those women just for being made victims. I'm sure they started out ""loving"" the men (the way it usually is) but after so much disappointment and abuse they were ""conditioned"" to ""hate"" men. It is not their fault that so many men had conditioned them and forced the feeling of hate on them. Even if you ""personally"" might not be one of the bad/evil types of guy (IDK), you should still have an ""understanding"" of the situation. And have you ever herd the saying, ""the monster you made""? I am not saying there are no bad women (there are some right slags out there) but they are bad in different ways. I have seen/witnessed the type of ""evil"" that the vast majority of men do - from as far back as my early childhood. I could write a book. 
Once again, if you are not anything like those types, then you are one of the ""lucky"" ones, because you really would not prosper (in any way, shape or form) from being like them and doing what they do. Believe me, I have never seen a ""good"" outcome for those types (not in the long run). Most came to a blunt ending. Whilst the good men have better standards and know how/how-not to treat other people and themselves, which helps them to live a better life - and for longer.",2021-08-31T20:33:43Z,0

You know that BOTH things can be true at the same time - Amber was abusing him, and he was/is an addict. Just calm down and use your head. Don't distort the facts to try to prove something. And no, this is not just the ''court of Youtube'' - this is people analyzing FACTS. Try doing this as well. You don't have to be Depps' ''fangirl'' or ''enabler'' to see what a liar Heard is, honestly.",2021-11-16T22:10:02Z,0

That is why they didn't want Amber to know what they were communicating with Johnny. Remember, her father told the mechanic what he was going to do to Johnny with his 45 because Amber was getting screwed out of any money. He said he had been planning to make a movie with the 10% of Johnny's money that Amber was going to give them. Normal parents would not even be involved in this nightmare.

551,UgzFe1lS4j3pG3isy2Z4AaABAg,lightinthedusk,"Yeah but we can't be sure whether she has BPD or some other disorder like sociopathy, psychopathy, or narcissistic personality disorder. People with those disorders usually can't even be cured with psychological treatment, because they don't actually think there's anything wrong with how they are. They think everyone else is the problem, and that they are perfect. These people will normally refuse to go to a therapist. And if they do get forced to go to a therapist, they are known to also lie to and manipulate the therapist! You're not gonna get cured if you're manipulating your own therapist to avoid accountability for your actions. To change oneself, you have to at least acknowledge that YOU are the one with the problem - which these people cannot do. It's literally a symptom of their disorder that makes them unable to.  If she has BPD, sure perhaps she could still be helped. If it were any of the other three though, the chances of her being helped by therapy are practically nonexistent.",2020-04-30T08:28:48Z,5

She did know the difference between being kind and nasty because the moment you distanced yourself, she would turn on the charm in order to bring you back to where she could manipulate you again.  It took me a long time to work her out  in terms of our relationship  but I have never been able to understand how she thought. Since then, I have found this  problem in varying degrees in other people including children. It's more than being ""selfish""  - it is being devoid of having any true feeling for  another person. Like you, I don't believe we can just label it evil and avoid those people - sometimes they are your children.    I haven't met anyone with this that is happy and it actually appears to be quite a tortuous way to live, to say nothing of the damage they wreak within their sphere of power.

BUT, there is a big difference between that, and being beyond redemption. To me, it is not just a matter of hopeful idealism, it is a matter of fundamental freedom. In the first place, no natural human being can truly know what is in the heart and mind of another, and therefore, they cannot possibly determine that person's true nature. Second of all, unless you can objectively see the future, you similarly cannot know what choices that person will make beyond the present moment. My point being, unless you can behold the entirety of that person's life, every thought, feeling and action, from their first breath to their last, you cannot judge their eternal existence.

771,Ugx404YWQMc3ysM8Ag14AaABAg,Felonius Skunk,"@DR Evil *While you are clearly not a practitioner, you also clearly have more than a casual interest in this: either you are a patient, or someone who has been victimized by one of these people.  Out of respect for your above average knowledge, I will give this to you the same way I have argued this with fellow practitioners.  You may agree or disagree with my position - I do not deny that my position is somewhat controversial after DSM-IV.*


*Until DSM-IV, BPD was considered part of the Narcissim spectrum of disorders, and in my experience, this is correct.  **_Unquestionably_** correct.  There have been no detailed long term studies undertaken to review the various BPD and NPD positions of the academy, and this is really unfortunate, as it is an area of research that is desperately lacking.  What we have instead is a few poorly designed, short term ""studies"" (I use quotes because they are so poorly designed that they qualify more as ""quick look"" than a detailed examination which can command the respectful term ""study""), all of which have come up with conflicting findings (and even conflicting theories in some cases).  That said, a touch of history is probably in order before I continue.*


*When I was first in training (1978), BPD wasn't even ""a thing"" yet - that didn't happen until 1980 (?) with DSM-III.  Honestly, by DSM-III standards, I had never even seen a ""Borderline"" patient until the middle 1980s, and what the term really meant was questionable itself up through the middle 1980s.  In a way, that is still true, and that is a natural consequence of the method chosen for the DSM's construction (I would be surprised if you don't know what I'm referring to, but if not, please feel free to ask).  The biggest differences between DSM-III and DSM-IV and later is that DSM-III and earlier were concerned more with how you arrived than at **_hwere_** you arrived, whereas DSM-IV and later appear to be concerned **_only_** with **_where_** you have arrived - which is how I believe that BPD was erroneously separated from the Narcissism spectrum.*


*I am retired from medicine (I was not in psychiatry - I finished half of my psych residency and chose to start over in internal medicine) now, and have been for many years, however, because of my early intent to specialize in psychiatry I spent most of my active life working with PhD and PhD Candidate level psychologists as their ""medical oversight"", along with a close friend who stayed in psychiatry.  My medicophychiatric opinions are based upon that experience base.*


*That said, we need to give a quick acknowledgement to todays curious victim phenomena.  Victimhood has become a form of social currency, and that phenomena has much in common with both classical narcissism and classical borderline disorder.  I would go a step further, and say that based upon my observations, there has been a tragic pattern of pronouncing people as ""BPD sufferers"", who have nothing more than moderate neuroses (a term which is itself mostly deprecated, unfortunately).  These ""diagnoses"" are not, by and large, being made by those qualified to do so (psychiatrists and doctoral level psychologists), but by a combination of masters and pre-masters level social workers who have [tragically] been given state sanction to apply diagnostic criteria.  What we have today is a twisted landscape where (1) a diagnostic label of BPD is seen as some kind of ""trophy"" by many, and (2) wholly unqualified people are attaching BPD diagnostic labels to people based upon needs that are not psychiatric or psychological in nature - for example, the label may be needed to open some financial door (insurance or state subsidy), or to open some edicational door (""special education"").  This has warped the entirety of the DSM systematology post DSM-III.*


*I believe the initial beliefs about BPD were correct - it is a manifestation along the Narcissism spectrum.  This does not mean that having a BPD primary diagnosis either requires or rules out a secondary diagnosis of NPD, it means only that there is by definition a Narcissistic substrate to the diagnostic disorder(s).*",2020-02-10T15:10:46Z,0

Congratulations on the views for this video! From the comments it seems to be a real eye opener for a lot of people. I am happy people are finally taking a moment to think about this case and the motivation of Amber Heard & friends/family to perpetuate this hoax on Johnny for so long.  Exposing these false allegations and standing up for DV survivors (no matter their gender, age or occupation) is an important issue. And someone needed to address the double standard and unfair advantage Amber has had in the media this whole time. Disinformation is too prevalent in this world we live in. It seems feelings matter over facts nowadays. No one really wants to print Johnny's side, even in spite of his overwhelming evidence. Why? Is something I will never understand. Amber is very much to blame, but cancel culture and the media were also culpable in the downfall of this innocent man.

954,Ugwp8uFof3pPusek-GV4AaABAg,Justin W,"The sad truth is that she never really loved him to begin with. Such people are incapable of true love, as deep down, they don't love themselves (but yet think way too highly of themselves). At most, she may at times felt some affection and attraction, and/or be amused by him, but not real, actual, deep love.  When you truly love someone, you start to care more about their happiness than your own, which clearly Mr. Depp did for her. 

   I know a lot of people don't really believe in astrology, especially men, but I've seen definite patterns beyond statistical chance in it.  Mr. Depp has Leo Rising. Leo is the Sign that rules the heart, and when the ASC point and it's ruler, the Sun, isn't extremely stressed, Leo often manifests in unusually big, noble hearted type personalities.  But interestingly, Mr. Depp's 7th House is Aquarius with Aquarius Saturn in same.  7 House corresponds to closer, more affecting relationships such as marriage, very close friendships, as well as to ""open enemies"".  Aquarius can be a bit cold, but by itself isn't a selfish or destructive pattern.  But, Saturn has long been known as the greater ""malefic"", and can correlate with cold, cold, cold, and extremely selfish and materialistic. 

   Having Aquarius Saturn in the 7th can be an indication of tending to be attracted to very wounded, selfish, uncaring, but charming and magnetic type partners.  And such latter types are often attracted to big hearted, empathic types like hornets to honey. 

     I also have Leo Rising that is more well placed/aspected than not, and some experience with being attracted to/attracting some very wounded types. Mr. Depp, I hope you learn from this and more closely and intuitively scrutinize future partners.  I tuned in a bit into Heard when all this hoopla started happening, and sensed right away that she is either a malignant narcissist or sociopath type. Either way, very, very low on love, empathy, and conscience, and very, very high on selfishness and callousness towards others. Her whole vibe and demeanor screams, ""cold hearted, manipulative"" but sometimes ""charming"" type.",2020-01-14T16:59:53Z,1

962,UgwQ04C1NNIpqk7sKn54AaABAg,psycho amy,"@James Ratliff And which translation is that because there are multiple versions?

Deutoronomy 22:28-29 (King James' Bible)

28 If a man find a damsel (that is) a virgin, which is not bethroed, and lay hold on her, and lie with her, and they are found 29 Then the man thay lay with her shall give unto the damsel's father fifty shekels of silver and she shall be his wife because he hath humbled her, he may not put her away all his days.
- - 
Deutoronomy 22:28-29 (NIV)
28 If a man happens to meet a virgin who is not pledged to be married and rapes her and they are discovered, 29 he shall pay her father fifty shekels of silver. He must marry the young woman, for he has violated her. He can never divorce her as long as he lives.

Those are just 2 of the multiple translations, interpretations, and versions of the bible. Even now, scholars are debating on the terms used. So, what makes the version you quote from more accurate than the version I or anyone else read from? And if it's not universal, how would it be a good basis?",2020-02-06T11:50:00Z,1
963,UgwQ04C1NNIpqk7sKn54AaABAg,James Ratliff,"@psycho amy Firstly, you are grossly mistaken about the rape comment you made.  According to the Bible not bible again and it's Deuteronomy not with an o as you spelled it....spellcheck you can right click and fix those things before sending or edit afterward....Exodus 22:16-17  And if a man entice a maid that is not betrothed, and lie with her, he shall surely endow her to be his wife.

17 If her father utterly refuse to give her unto him, he shall pay money according to the dowry of virgins.  


This is the verse you're talking about and it's not rape....it's talking about if he entice her to lay with him then he has to pay for her virtue.


Deuteronomy 22 briefly talks about rape because she did not cry out.  If she is in the city and cries out the man is put to death but if she does not cry out then both are put to death and if she is outside the city the man is put to death because no one could have saved her so it makes no difference if she cried out.  If she is not betrothed and a man lies with her and they are found meaning consensual not rape they are found it does say the man is to pay 50 shekels of silver to her father and she is to be his wife which was the law as it was now his responsibility to make an ""honest"" woman of her and the Law goes on to say that he may not put her away all of his life for any reason.  During the time of Moses men would write a bill of divorce to his wife for no reason at all but under this circumstance the Bible makes sure that a man couldn't just abandon his wife and children claiming all sort of mischief.  The dowry of virgins was very important should the man decide later that he didn't want to honor his wife and started making accusations against her.  By being able to show the dowry the father could actually save his daughter from death as they took adultery very seriously.  If a man said this woman wasn't a maid or virgin when I married her then it was a life or death situation for the woman and could result in the man being chastised should he be proven wrong.  I would urge you not to read Wikia for your Bible facts and to actually read the scriptures to see what the Bible really says.  There are so many people out there ""quoting"" a book they don't know the first thing of simply because they heard someone else say the Bible says this or the Bible says that.  It's a wonderful read and yes there are stories in the Bible which deal with rape like when one of David's sons raped his half-sister....his brother killed him by the way and then was killed himself sometime later due to his own sins against his father.  I hope you take the time to read that book before commenting again.  God Bless and have a wonderful day.",2020-02-05T06:48:35Z,0
964,UgwQ04C1NNIpqk7sKn54AaABAg,psycho amy,"@James Ratliff  I did not dispute it if it were in fact the case. I merely stated that the the ""B""ible is not a good basis for judicial system especially for modern times.

You mentioned adultery, which funny enough, would have been considered a worse crime than rape in the bible. And was it not in Deutoronomy where it was mentioned that had a man raped a virgin, that he should pay her father and marry her? Doesn't seem very moral or ethical.

 In Numbers, when the ""Lord"" said to Moses that should a husband suspect his pregnant wife of adultery, then she is to be given a potion that would cause her to miscarry if she had. That doesn't sound very ethical either.

You can be religious and still realize that the Bible itself is fickle because it was men who wrote it. Not to mention dated. Sure, men claim it was the divine who told them what to write, but it was still written, edited, and translated by men.",2020-02-05T04:37:53Z,2

I think she was confused thinking I meant the actual passing down of the law not the historical accounting of how Israel as a nation neglected to live by that law time and time again.  It's like someone saying David committed adultery so the Bible must not believe it's a sin when in the Law it says thou shalt not commit adultery.  Can't please everybody.

966,UgwQ04C1NNIpqk7sKn54AaABAg,James Ratliff,"@psycho amy I find it funny you dispute the fact that our country was founded by Protestants in many cases who were fleeing the long arm of the Catholic Church long before the Boston Tea Party and the Founding Fathers set up a government against English control.  If you read Exodus, Leviticus, and Deuteronomy you would understand that indeed our laws were loosely based on the very ""Old Testament"" you are besmirching.  Your religious and political opinion based on whatever rhetoric you consign to notwithstanding, I would urge to read the whole book starting with Genesis and ending with Revelation.  I would then urge you to read and consider with prejudice all other materials written by man after the fact.  It's not important to me that you believe me and everything I say, but it would be nice if you came to me with an informed argument based solely on factual events like for instance did you know there was a Church in Rome in 33 A.D.  From this Church the Catholic Church would spring up almost three centuries later do to a division between the members.  Constantine the last great emperor of Rome would then embrace the group who came out of the catacombs where the Church of Christ had been hiding and meeting and it is the State recognizing that faction which would go on to be the Catholic Church which fulfilled the prophesy in Daniel that from the ashes of the last great empire would rise an empire that would endure to the end of the world.  If you think that many of our Founding Fathers didn't make the Moral Law based on the Bible, I can't help you.  Is it that you don't believe the wrote laws or that you don't think Thou Shalt Not Steal had no relevance on Petty Larceny laws?  The prison system was not enacted by the Jews so I'll give you that...the system of government adopted by the Romans first practiced by Greeks and others gave us the Prison System we know today.  Did you know rats can't burp and the word toy was originally a verb meaning playful not a noun for a child's plaything?  Funny what a little knowledge can do to change ones perspective.  Anywho God Bless and thanks for reading.  I hope you search and I hope you find that which you search for.  I would warn though to be wary of anyone saying ""I believe"".  I'm skeptical of everything and study.  Have a nice day.",2020-02-04T20:28:29Z,0

There are many wonderful actors around the world, who are opening up their hearts, check books, by organizing Charities, fundraisers, etc., for all of those who are suffering around the world. Let's start with Australia shall we? If you cannot face the fact that a woman , a supposed actress, self-appointed leader of the me-too movement , FALSELY accuses a man of domestic violence.  (  The lie about a man, who has PROOF it's a lie.)  How about the damage that has been done to his reputation, his family, his children?  Do they not count in your eyes? Your concern about teachers, etc, are valid. How many teachers,  men, women, elderly, and  children,  have been victims of domestic violence and /or bullying?  How many will now  not come forward, because of the lies that have been portrayed by Amber Heard? You're bringing up the word ""actors,"" as if they are disgusting, did you forget they're human too? Are you saying because they're at a different level, because of what they have chosen to do for a living, that their abuse should be ignored? This case, is bringing it to everyone's attention, EVERYONE,  that BOTH genders are capable of such a heinous crime.  When this goes to trial in August of 2020, and the truth prevails, that Amber Heard has lied her butt off, she should be held accountable just like every other human being. The hell with being an actor. Why should she be excused, from NOT signing her medical release waiver, producing her metadata, all photographs, medical records, text messages, all of which she has demanded from her ex-husband but she has yet to produce., which has been ordered by the judge .   Why is she excused six times for not sitting for her deposition, what makes her so special? John Q public would be held in contempt   why has she not been yet?  She's just as human as all of us.

 I never said he deserved being physically abused, but he did deserve to learn his lesson. I don't know how many more times this exact same scenario needs to play out before men draw any conclusions. 
Actually, shallow men and gold-diggers are a match made in heaven. The grandpa has his arm candy rented out for a while, and she gets RIGTFULLY compensated. It's either explicit or implicit, but relationships like that are always transactional. A marriage to a grandpa is a dreadful game, but the rewards are to die for. 
Do you want a loving, genuine long term marriage? Find a kind, intelligent, educated woman with experiences simmilar to yours. Look at Bill and Melinda for example.

There has yet to be a truly objective analysis of both sides of the case from anyone in or out of the media, but you can't blame anyone else for that; you could do it yourself if you're that bothered. It would make little difference though; the evidence overwhelmingly supports Depp's account rather than Heard's. Plus, the client who hires the lawyer / law firm is responsible for their employment so Heard is directly responsible for any action her lawyers undertake on her behalf. They represent her. She has to sign off on their strategy and can reject or amend as she wishes. Excuses of helplessness and blaming lawyers for decisions are a manipulation of the truth.",2020-01-08T17:30:32Z,0

Couple that with the constant ""please delete your messages,"" it just looks like she was trying to egg him to jump off of a cliff and cover up the footprints.

I have followed Johnny's career since he starred in ”A Nightmare on Elm St”. He has never laid a hand on any woman ever and he wasn't going to start at the age of 50. The World owes Johnny a huge apology and he deserves to get his role back as ”Captain Jack Sparrow”. And she should be blackballed in Hollywood. She now deserves to be dragged through the mud and her whole life destroyed just as Johnny's was when it was believed it was Johnny that was the abuser which he wasn't!!!!! She is a nothing in Hollywood Johhny was like Royalty in Hollywood and her lies that were instantly believed because of the @metoo movement destroyed everything he worked for his whole life. Now it’s time Johnny gets and apology and his money that she took from him and she needs to be removed from Aquaman because as long as she continues to play the role of Mera I for one will never watch an Aquaman film again.",2020-02-02T16:46:01Z,13

 The petition to remove her from Aquaman has nearly 50,000 signatures & climbing. 
 Every time they report on it (negatively) the numbers jump, not what they intended. 
 Meanwhile, nothing has been reported about leaving her out of the next one, I think they are waiting to see how the case turns out....or don't care & assume the fans of the franchise will see it anyway.
 The POTC reboot lost the original writers, & Jerry Bruckheimer has been adamant he will not do another one without Depp, so lost the director.
 Disney thinks they will still make money without paying Depp's salary, but it looks like no one is interested in seeing a Pirates movie without Capt Jack.
 Something that doesn't escape the notice of Bruckheimer. 
 It will flop.",2020-01-12T09:24:06Z,0

AND he was still a snack - still in shape and looking good.


only thing he was missing was some thrill. he chased amber too you know. i don't doubt they had an affair while filming the rum diary and in 2009 and then he went back to vanessa and tried to make it work for another two years before they broke up in 2011. he cheated and yeah, they prolly did fall outta love. but he ain't no innocent angel. he could've said no. no mid life crisis.

Johnny Depp has plenty of ""evidence"" against her ,he is going to be fine, unfortunately she will probably try and get some money from him but that will be minor compared to not having to deal with her anymore,he can get on with his life and never see her again.So it will be good riddance and he can deal with his mental health. Younger men just need to treat woman how they want to be treated -with respect, loyalty,honesty, and learn to understand what woman need ,so there is mutual respect. Treat us like a human,not another species..... I swear if I get called ""A female"" one more time by some guy! Lol. ...We are human just like you,we bleed red just like you,lol... There is no need to get paranoid about women,we are not out to get you, you just need to learn to see the bad seeds out there, and run from those people,the good ones are out there,it may take time but they're there. All of us Men and Women need to wake up about people like this ,and we need to learn to spot them,they are a cancer on society. They destroy lives,I've been ther,in my own family...
