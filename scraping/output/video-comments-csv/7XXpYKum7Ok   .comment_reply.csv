Too many relationships being competitive it's immature narcissistic I would hate to have to minimize my accomplishments so as not to enrage someone I had a situation like that it was awful a year in and he and his family were like oh you are just our punching bag didn't you know then they wonder why I hate seeing them.,2021-10-24T04:42:53Z,0

Everywhere Depp goes people go crazy and know who he is, while Elon is only known by people who do research. I'm sure Amber realized this too after dating Musk and found out dating a guy with loads of money and not as much spotlight isn't as enjoyable as she thought, probably why she told her talent agent she was never in love with Musk and just filling space by dating him while she really missed Depp. Amber is evil as fuck lol",2020-03-16T15:12:26Z,18
