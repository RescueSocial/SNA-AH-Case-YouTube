10,Ugz9jDyiijH2WrMaiF14AaABAg,Margo Ellingsworth,"@eHacker Your welcome, let's hope they are smart enough to get rid of her. Since filming has not started yet, there is still a great deal of time to get her replaced. I hope she is panicking right now because of this.
I believe the only way to get through to her is by letting her continually deteriorate her own mental state with tiny possibilities, that when she is all alone, creep into her forefront thoughts and emotional breakdowns. This may be cruel  but what she is trying and has done to Johnny are irrehensable",2020-09-20T16:32:42Z,0

As much as I appreciate both sets of opinions from my 2 Favorite You Tube creators Tristen and Jon.  I do not have Twitter Thank God and I am a very neutral person that does not believe in Cancel Culture for Anyone. I have watched and heard the evidence stack up against Amber but the Judge has not made his judgment Yet. As For Ray I have not seen any evidence either way And Right now we All know how Toxic Hollywood has become so I must take the High Road and wait for the pesky thing called facts as for my favorite creator's it's their job to break the stories down and Give their own opinions and Views. I Must live in the Grey area and take everything in and with my Free speaking and free thinking mind and will Do the work study the facts and make the best educated decision I Can.
So on that note I would SAY keep digging Jon in the End Truth and Facts will win the day and I am very curious how this will turn out !!!üòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑ",2020-09-20T02:49:11Z,1
