0,Ugzt4NiZHxs91O0SaGR4AaABAg,I wish WB would just confirm or deny already.  This is she/isn't she is ridiculous.  This person is getting way too much media attention over these rumors which I'm sure she loves.,Patti_C,0,2021-03-05T02:37:33Z
1,UgxWbK-jcOGdwr2SUVR4AaABAg,"Anything out of Amber's mouth is a lie. Amber will not publish anything bad about herself. She will deflect so since she can't deny the rumours of the insurance she is making those rumours seem fake and put out there by WB. She is always the victim so we have to look at how the rumours support her narrative to have a clue of where the truth lies. What is Amber trying to hide or deflect from? If WB doesn't support her then she will make them look bad. She hasn't denied that she can't get insurance so there is a reason why she won't speak up publicly, because she can't spin it as someone else's fault. So she will destract from it another way, by saying WB, who used to support her, is only now trying to force her to quit, poor Amber the victim.",SweetChastity,0,2021-03-04T17:01:32Z

4,UgzJhEV9L1QF9LtBM6h4AaABAg,"Yeah, ""fired"" might be ""inaccurate"", cause she got bought out a long time ago and is uninsurable.",Cat Meissner,1,2021-03-03T22:28:01Z

6,Ugwz7duVAasxzfJwvKh4AaABAg,She‚Äôs not insurable.  No one will hire her.  On IMBD. She has nothing going on.   She‚Äôs done.,Jeanne Cihla,2,2021-03-03T20:24:39Z
7,Ugx5Ge8ibXhCI5mCn6V4AaABAg,She got no audiences anyway since all the proofs of her liessss and abused to multiple partners and stole money from CHARITIES. She ruined her own name for opening her own big giant stinky mouth,Crispy Co,0,2021-03-03T19:56:15Z

9,Ugyxowib3O3XUWwBO694AaABAg,"So many rumours, how do they all begin? I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if she started some of them herself. Anything to be in the headlines. If there is a lull on the news about her she starts arguing with Depp supporters on social media, she needs the attention, no matter whether is good or bad press she needs to be centre of attention, all eyes on her. Thank you Rob",Margo,6,2021-03-03T19:03:29Z
10,UgwbiL31v6oguOITp6p4AaABAg,Always with a question mark.  We want to see a posting from WB that says they fired this abuser.,DudeAbides,4,2021-03-03T18:51:14Z
11,Ugx2Cttk-COkQ5MQkbh4AaABAg,I hope Amber is fired from Aqairman 2. WB let Johnny go they should do the same  to Amber.  That would be far thing to do. Justice for Johnny,Galit Weissman,6,2021-03-03T18:49:34Z
12,UgyaAXrZDiO8fsGWrqN4AaABAg,"where is her publicist in this...shouldn't they be coming out & saying something to effect of Warner Bros is behind Amber Heard, no plans to re- cast....instead we hear nothing from.  WB.. i believe she will  step  down; WB will let her say it was her ides & they'll pay her what should would made ( she doesn't make near the amount  JD or big name actors make)",Marge lane T.,1,2021-03-03T18:03:54Z
13,UgxaffAVrqAetl9vK3h4AaABAg,I really hope they do get rid of her because of all she has done they rid of Johnny Depp for doing nothing,Megan O'Shea,3,2021-03-03T17:59:50Z
14,Ugz727IpE0jZfV4VMip4AaABAg,It's hard to say at this point. It's news we all want to hear but it's too early to speculate.,Maiya,3,2021-03-03T17:40:37Z

17,Ugzse9KYE34SmHAZxSx4AaABAg,Firing her for weight gain? Oh please I hope that's not true. She should be fired for abuse to Johnny. Being body shamed isn't a right.,MAJOT,11,2021-03-03T17:06:58Z

21,UgyENpAtXb4P16fCrQl4AaABAg,I think the weight gain ( if it‚Äôs true ) is a way out for the company so they don‚Äôt have to cope with amber saying stuff like am a victim and this is you hating woman,Lilly Potter,9,2021-03-03T16:50:00Z
