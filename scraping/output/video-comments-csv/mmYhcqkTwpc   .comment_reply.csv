25,UgxPmwucLpQtxNvfcrF4AaABAg,spellywelly,"NIBS exceptional (and exceptionally painful) summary. There are small clues as to how she went about mirroring him, which is so upsetting it makes me feel physically sick (as I‚Äôm sure it does to anyone who‚Äôs experienced it). In interview following The Rum Diary, Johnny stated that she reminded him of movie stars from days gone by - specifically Lauren Bacall. She didn‚Äôt even have to do any research on ‚Äòwho to be‚Äô with him - it was right there on a plate! The ‚ÄòSLIM‚Äô he had tattooed across his fingers is probably a reference to the nickname Lauren Bacall‚Äôs character went by in To Have and Have Not.
It now reads SCAM. I think Johnny‚Äôs clued up. There‚Äôs nothing more painful than trying to extract yourself from a relationship that was an illusion, even when there isn‚Äôt physical abuse. It can strike on a very deep level and it has nothing to do with intelligence.
I‚Äôm speculating with all the above, obviously. I just can‚Äôt shake the feeling that she saw him coming a mile off.

56,UgjYVXbYJMv_GHgCoAEC,Alana Atai,"SeekingKnowledge she didn‚Äôt donate the money to charity. Jonny did on her behalf then she tried to make him give her more for doing that. But she was happy to take the credit for the money going to charity.
While I‚Äôm on a rant:
The only reason she got that money in the divorce was because JD divorce lawyer (Bloom) was in Elon musks pocket. He‚Äôs the one who hid the building security staff statements as well as 87 cctv footages showing Amber with no marks on her face for the next few proceeding days after her last encounter with Jonny. Plus the footage of Elon Musk and James Franco going to jonnys penthouse with Amber (on different occasions) while Jonny was out of the country filming. 
Jonny only come in to possession of these last year when he sued his old lawyers (and won). 
Separate note but this Bloom guy is also the lawyer Amber used to try to get Kate James (her assistant that spoke up against her) to falsify legal documents to send to the Australian courts during her court case for smuggling in her dogs when she flew to Australia to see Jonny while he was filming. (This proves the lengths she goes to, as well as being proven to have perjured herself while under oath)
The only reason JD could sue Amber and prove her false hoax was because of the evidence he come in possession of after his court case against this Bloom guy.
So when she posted that op-Ed still defaming Jonny he had the evidence he needs to prove she has been lying the whole time and was in fact the aggressor on the relationship. 
Go watch Incredibly Average‚Äôs YouTube channel, he has lots of videos proving Amber heard and her co-conspirators hoax.
It will all come out in the courts. You can go to www.fairfaxcounty.gov/circuit. Once there type Jonny Depp in the search bar and you will see all the discovery for the upcoming trail in August 2020. Ambers already tried to have the case dismissed and lost. Now she‚Äôs trying to keep it private from the public but JD lawyers are arguing that‚Äôs not fair as it‚Äôs in the public she defamed him. #justiceforjonnydepp",2020-03-20T10:18:24Z,3
