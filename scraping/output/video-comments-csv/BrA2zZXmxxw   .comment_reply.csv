7,UgyCxxDqHyL2gshC9vB4AaABAg,Lost Beyond Pluto,"thanks so much for this info! if it's practically impossible to serve someone personally, then an application can be made to the court for substituted service (usually effected by post). service is normally deemed to have taken place after a number of business days since posting the document (7 business days where I'm at. it may differ in the states). so whether he actually receives it or not, service will be deemed completed after those business days lapse and if he doesn't respond, he'll be in contempt. the issue is finding him if he is found to be in contempt. I guess he'll have an arrest warrant hanging over his head for as long as he continues to evade it at that point.",2020-06-21T07:48:43Z,6

For example: I thought this took place in the middle of their marriage while she was claiming to be frightened of jd. And I couldn't wrap my head around why an abuse victim frightened of their abuser would even think to bring people into that abuser's bed...

Now that I know it happened during their seperation, I have no opinion on this indiscretion. I still believe her illogics illude to dishonest behaviours... But this particular behaviour? , not the biggest issue.

Amber, is filthy.  No conscious and a lost soul.  Johnny sold his soul marrying someone who was much younger especially when he had already made.  The grass really isn‚Äôt always greener on the other side of the fence.  Cheating is a sign of a liar and if low enough to cheat you are definitely low enough to make false accusations.  For me, I don‚Äôt believe Amber at all.  I am not a Johnny fan, I hate the guys movies.  The only thing Amber has done that I enjoyed watching was Aquaman.  This is not to say Johnny did not cheat with Amber and is simply getting back whatever emotional distress he caused his ex-wife, but he is more believable in this case and will won the defamation suit.",2020-08-07T12:39:02Z,0
