Mamoa is a huge draw. Most everyone I know who saw Aquaman either did so because they are DC fans or because of Mamoa.

35,UgxDE4AckARJxHLbxVV4AaABAg,"When they didn't fire Ezra Miller for choking out a fan on camera, I figured they'd never recast anyone, even if she's completely crazy. Also it's true she can't act, the only positive thing about her is she's attractive. Which I mean they could easily find another attractive redhead Woman who isn't crazy and can actually act. 

That being said I'll still watch it because I can separate the person from their work in most cases. Like Axl Rose is an asshole but Guns N Rose's is a good band. Brie Larson is the absolute worst not even tolerable. But I'll still Room or Scott Pilgrim vs The World despite her being in it. The only thing I completely refuse to watch something is if they're not just a shitty person but did something evil, like I'm never going to watch Jeepers Creepers 3 after I learned the Director is a pedophile who got hardly any jail time. Then again she completely destroyed Johnny Depps reputation and career so maybe I shouldn't support a movie she's in.",werewolf914,0,2020-09-05T22:28:50Z

I still think perhaps if contracts arent to much of a issue I would like to see her ""released and replaced"".

97,UgzW_iBNK0FPYrE-7BV4AaABAg,"This is the Deadline story...and to understand it, you have to look at it carefully.  What it says is Amber Heard has not been fired from Aquaman 2 *according to Amber Heard.*  Is Amber Heard a truthful, unbiased source for this information?  I would say that she is a manipulative liar who will stop at nothing to save face and make people believe what *she* wants them to...but that's just me.  This whole story comes from a filing in the Virginia Trial concerning the proposed delay.  Deadline reported, and I quote ""according to the papers Heard will only agree to it (the postponement) if it 'would not entail any prejudice to her, much less unfair prejudice' to her schedule.  *SHE expects to film Aquaman 2 at some point next year.* ""  Ms. Heard *DOES NOT SAY* that she is *confirmed* to be shooting Aquaman 2 next year.  She *DOES NOT SAY* that Warner Brothers has *confirmed* that she is in the film.  She simply says that she *expects* to film.

     Cue Mikey Sutton, Amber Heard fanboi and sometimes ""reporter"".  To continue quoting Deadline ""Mikey Sutton takes this as confirmation of his report Warner Brothers won't fire her.""  *Why* does Mr. Sutton *need confirmation* of his story?  He reported it as *fact* and as if he had a solid, reliable source.  *Now* he needs to confirm it...and the source he is going to use is Amber Heard?  Does anyone see Warner Brothers confirming that Amber Heard will be in Aquaman 2? *NO!*  Just Ms. Heard telling us she expects to be filming it, just like Ms. Heard is telling us Mr. Depp abused her, and just like Ms. Heard told us that she had, and I quote ""evidence...tons of it!""

     This is just *more* of Amber Heard's PR...and everyone is falling for it *again!*  There is absolutely *NO* evidence to support the claim that Ms. Heard will be in Aquaman 2.  *That* confirmation can *ONLY* come from one place...and *that* is Warner Brothers themselves.  But Amber Heard *LOVES* it when everyone falls for her ploys.  At least this Deadline story made Amber Heard really happy, and I'm sure that she's sleeping well in the knowledge that she made the world believe her lies once again.",NIBS,0,2020-09-04T06:34:28Z
