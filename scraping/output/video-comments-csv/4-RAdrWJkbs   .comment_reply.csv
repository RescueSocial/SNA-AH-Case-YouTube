The real idiot is you because you don't know anything about this situation and instead of actually finding out the truth (which isn't hard with you being on youtube) you think if you call both of them ""idiots"" it makes you look like you are the smart one. Here's a better idea: If you don't know about a situation, don't comment on it. Don't speak on it. You don't need to have an opinion on everything despite what social media wants you to think.

And spoiler alert: Johnny Depp is the victim and Amber Heard is the abuser and liar.

If your support for Johnny Depp is unwavering which means through any and everything he does right or wrong legal or illegal moral or immoral smart or stupid that'd still be only 100% of your support. How does a single individual double or tripple the amount of support they have when their support is unwaivering at 100% let alone 900%? Maybe you should go back to math school.,2020-08-01T16:36:31Z,0

115,UgxvaW0ltNk3cib8j4l4AaABAg,tigerlille,"Julia Mimi :  You are absolutely right.  Borderline Personality Disordered people are notorious for creating drama, manipulating and telling lies, pitting people against each other, and just overall nightmarish behaviors.  They will change their stories and allegiances at the drop of a hat. A calm, peaceful existence is boring for them.  Where ever they go, conflict follows.  They have narcissistic features, and are indifferent to any kind of moral code; their definition of morality is that if their behavior gets them what they want, it is moral..  Milder cases of BPD can respond to treatment, but the more extreme cases, of which Amber is one, have a very poor prognosis.  Once you have experienced a BPD up close and personal, they are thereafter immediately recognizable. Fortunately for them, the average person has not had a run in with a BPD, and that tends to make them susceptible.  They are taken in by the BPD outrageous behavior because they can‚Äôt imagine someone faking such horrible allegations.",2020-08-05T08:29:19Z,1

I'm not looking at it from a  battle of the sexes POV.  Its 2 people that stayed too long in a toxic relationship and made mistakes. And instead of owning it, they are playing the blame game. That is my opinion. If this was a same sex couple, I'd still see it that way. I do believe it's possible for both people to be wrong, it does'nt have to be one or the other. What's f*cked up to me is that its trendy to be in an ""abusive"" relationship...everyone we know that we dont like or disagrees with us is a narcissist.  It's sad. And I'd bet any money true victims of narcissistic abuse are the ones suffering right now because they are just getting thrown in the mix with everyone else claiming they're a victim when they are actually just in a shitty toxic relationship.
