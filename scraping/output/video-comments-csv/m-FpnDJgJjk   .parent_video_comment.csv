8,UgyYfgTOqzPbppQDK2t4AaABAg,"I agree with you that the fb franchise is not great, however i would like to say something about a few points that you made. First of all, you do not need a gay actor to play a gay character. I'm sure you watched bohemian rapsody right? Well, Rami Malek and Aaron McCusker were both straight actors that did the job just fine back there. Second: Rowling said that dumbledore was in the lgbt community since 2007 and she has also say recently that she was going to focus in the tragedy behind that story because the relationahip between them is the key to dumbledore changing to the good side, before that he was with gridenwald and his ideals.",Alan Richardson B,0,2021-01-04T12:21:38Z

10,Ugx3AWZS1YTP4Y80twl4AaABAg,"Yes wb, good thinking! Just fired johnny depp from fb3 because it's not like he was doing one of the most important characters of the franchise. (I was being sarcastic btw).

The way i see this is that johnny depp is far more important that amber heard with their own franchises, first of all because mera is not an important character in aquaman, the one truly important character there is played by momoa obviously. Besides of that amber heard is an anwful actress. So who cares if the replace her. Now with depp and fb3, he is important for the story. Not a big fan of fb but they should have at least reduce his character and give him the conclusion he deserves because when you have a new actor you only confuse the audience.",Mt Nicke,0,2020-12-31T01:20:57Z

55,UgxDIuk2v-_4jqX79Md4AaABAg,"The more important trial will be the one against Heard directly, not against The Sun.  That's the one he is going towards proving, which when he does, it will be worth it for him.  'Just let her get away with it' isn't an option. At least as far as he is concerned.    

Many more people seem to come to his side as they recognized him being wronged in the UK and The Sun. Being even more angry at the system where his mountain of evidence essentially got ignored by a judge that was focused more at defending a publication than actual justice.  If anything this 'decision' by the Court put more people in the side of seeing Johnny as the victim, of not just Heard but a system.   The only people defending Heard at this point are trying to say ""well they both abused each other"" despite their only being actual evidence in one direction, which was Heard abusing him.   

So at this point, the most important case will be the one Depp has directly against Heard, when he wins that one, whatever The UK did defending The Sun will be irrelevant.

The reality is this.  If we switched the genders on the basis of the evidence (ie if all the evidence against Heard(the abuse, the statements, the tapes, the videos, the physical evidence) was against Johnny instead, and all the constantly changing stories, lies, disproven evidence were coming from Depp's end instead of Heard's) then Depp would have been fired the second those tapes came out and he'd never be able to make another movie again.  There wouldn't be a ""wait and see"" approach by WB or any movie company.      People notice this, and the 'UK ruling' only seemed to increase both support for Johnny, and more people wanting Heard gone from Aquaman 2.",carrastealth,0,2020-11-10T17:56:30Z

They could just say Gellert crafted and transfigured himself into the Depp figure seen in the earlier films to appear more intimidating/menacing and that the new actor or Farrell is his true appearance. 

I'd have been happy if they kept to relative unknowns in their casting, Depp was very Depp throughout FB2. He's a good actor for sure, but I didn't care for him in the role as it just felt like Depp in the part. Much of the casting in this franchise has read like they wanted big names to carry the film rather than trust the quality of the story (which admittedly one can see why the story is a bit messy). 

I wish Depp well, he's got a fantastic catalog of films I enjoy. I do think he deserves a fair shake at Heards defaming accusations on his character in a court.

Remember when Dr. Ford came forward to testify against Kavenaugh? Most abusers have a pattern of abuse. Where there is smoke there is fire. There were other victims refered to.  Johnny Depp does not have a closet full of skeletons. There has been ample time for former girlfriends to come forward and tell similar tales. None have. Typically true abuse survivors, like Dr. Ford, are not motivated by vengence. They carry shame about their abuse and only brave the spotlight to try and prevent others from suffering a similar fate.

So all we have is a short video and an unverified story to go off of, no police report, hospital papers, etc. As far as I'm concerned, there's no problem. Yes, it looks bad PR-wise, but if someone, particularly Ezra, would simply step forward to clear up what happened there, then all of this would be over.

Let Dumbledore get Grindelwald to out himself while trying to seduce Dumbledore and that trait of getting people confess, showing their hand as being a glorified fascist, become one of if not THE reason that the Ministry of Magic need Dumbledore to take on being Headmaster at Hogwarts. Then later you can have Tom Riddle try to come on to Snape but Lily Potter play protector like Snape was  her little brother or first “son” before Harry. And remembering this become why Snape knows in his heart that Harry is a good buy because that’s what Lily always said to Snape. Maybe Harry’s dad picking on Snape is how he meets Lily and they arguing like parents is what leads Snape to have bittersweet feelings towards Harry like having a baby, for better or worse, was a game changer. Snape loves Lily, Lily loves James, James loves himself but then too they all love Harry. To which Riddle, now Voldemort, says ENOUGH! “You took Grindelwald from me so now I take your baby from YOU!” To which Lily sacrifices herself full circle standing in front of Harry like she used to Snape only this time there is no love from Voldemort like there was from the now deceased James. And knowing he should have stayed as part of the family than walk away is why Snape feels he should have been there and sees Harry as a living memory of what was now becoming what is having to share a school together at Hogwarts. And Dumbledore being there leans over and says “you’re still a good boy, Severus.

And as much as he was ""rounding the corner"", the people who have actually done any research themselves - listened to the tapes, followed the trial... I think it's fair to say the vast majority side with Depp.

This was a private trial that people had to dig (e.g. search Depp's name in YouTube *rolls eyes*) to find any info on. All the majority of his condemners have seen (or will acknowledge) are Amber giving ironic speeches, this court ruling & very selective media coverage to paint Johnny in the worst light possible. I am praying that this 2021 trial will be in the open - so that people can see that at the very least. Even if you believe Johnny is a domestic abuser.

824,UgyDNBoabig1BfeX6Nh4AaABAg,"Frankly, Depp should have never been asked to come to the Fantastic Beasts franchise... There was no need for him after Colin Farrel's performance. I remember when there was outrage during the 1st film and Rolwing and WB stood by him. As a major studio, they shouldn't have done that, especially with Depp continuing with the lawsuits. So, I can't say I'm surprised by what happened.

I think asking Colin Farrel back could help soften the blow... However, logically, casting a new actor would be the best route and the movies can play with how ""that new actor"" was Grindel's actual face all along (in a sense, he was also fooling his followers).

Anyway, with who knows what Rowling will continue to spew online until the release in 2022... I think scrapping the Fantastic Beasts series, or limiting it to only a 3rd and final film, would be for the best.",Aj Raven,1,2020-11-06T19:59:53Z

Not only was the online video situation clearly ignored because no one decided to press charges against him (making this all just a matter of unverified speculation unlike Depp and Heard's cases), but his conection to the Snyderverse is what keeps loyal fans of the old DCEU backing him up. We want to see the franchise mantain a semblance of continuity for once, it was already hard to win people over with Robert Pattinson when everyone wanted the Affleck directed in-universe standalone batman movie. 

What I would do is, as you said, introduce a new female lead for Aquaman 2 to relegate Amber Heard's Mera to only maybe 3 or 4 minutes of screentime.

And phasing her out or limiting her role would still read as WB punishing a victim. What they can do is just keep her as Meera and pray 🙏  that it doesn't affect Aquaman 2 in the box office. Or.....they can buy her out of her contract, make her sign an NDA, ask her to make a public statement that she is leaving the film due to personal reasons and for the sake of her mental health, and to assure her cooperation....promise her first pickings from a pile of B level projects in about a years time.

917,UgwockK4XsSRKvhhlyp4AaABAg,"I think this also opens up a discussion about the loyalty that Warner Bros oftentimes lends to their talents both in front and behind the cameras. You've been saying this many times that Warner Bros thrives on loyalty. With all of these horrible things happening to their talents, they are unfortunately dragged through the mud along with them. They entrusted people behind the cameras and now look at where they are in terms of Ray Fisher's allegations towards not just the team that worked behind Justice League but this travels all the way up Warner Bros suits! J.K Rowling is a major problem for them who they can't seem to get rid of. Now with Amber Heard and Johnny Depp whom they've entrusted to play huge roles in their films. No matter how much they want to stand by these actors, it's a lose-lose situation for Warner Bros! The Ellen Degeneres situation at the beginning of the year. That really hurted Warner Bros' image as well! They entrusted Ezra Miller and put him in not one, but two major franchises in house! It's a very interesting situation, an unfortunate one, that will surely have effects in how Warner Bros does things moving forward. And I think we're seeing that with Warner Media's recent shake ups over at HBO Max! Putting people whom they think can deliver for them and not for fans who force these projects upon the studio!

Most movies are going to flop over the next few years - this isn't a comment on their quality. Theatre chains are on the edge of going out of business and them getting a bail out is going to be political suicide, and the ones that will remain will have a much more limited capacity  - so say 25% of the Theatres go out of business (which is looking like a best case scenario), but then of the remaining 75%, they're only at half capacity - so overall 37.5% of the potential box office is going to be available. Maybe they can get that up to a %50 potential box office compared to 2019 if they're diligent and lucky. But that's not enough to make back a $150M Hollywood Movie, unless that $150M is including EVERYTHING - the movie, the marketing, the tie ins, etc. So any movies made for a ""normal"" Hollywood budget are going to flop.

WB should shelve this movie entirely for 3-5 years. Don't even start filming until 2023 - and only then if it looks like it's going to be able to make money.
