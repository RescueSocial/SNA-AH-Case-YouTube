21,UgxwzF9Vs0hUpn4NNKB4AaABAg,edie,"@Abbie Hazel Hunter i had hoped Venessa would forgive and he could go home. But it looks like Vanessa has moved on with her love life. Johnny will just have to do some house cleaning. He has lots of properties. If I had the choice the island in the Bahamas would be kept. All the other sold. But Vanessa and him have found it difficult to sell the French Vila. I mean it is a small town so not to many possible buyers. He is strong and if he quite the smoking and drinking he could still have another 20 to 30 years working. I mentioned back quite a ways that his first real love is music. You can see the love and incredible joy he gets when playing. I believe he to has shifted his feeling about movies being a top priority. Now I believe his new way of thinking will give all his focus to music. But movies do pay well. During this Am'poo mess he was always to generous with her and just wanted it to be over. Think about just the expense to flying two dogs home from Australia in a private plane. That is a cost she should have been responsible for. And he always was the one to reach out and help a friend. When Nichols Cage was in finance trouble Johnny stepped in and took care of it.  His friendships are very strong and for life. In the end he is going to be just fine. He will create more movies and continue with his music. He is going to have a very successful book that will help push him in the right direction. The fifty million from Am'poo he will never see. Mostly because he will just walk away as to not wanting to hurt her the way she did him. I really believe he has that kindness in his heart. So by finish my rant let's just saying his a wonderful kind and gentle man. He will figure it out without me telling him what to do.  Hahaha
