Not saying that all women are lying because  I know abuse does happen alot. But a lot of women have realized how easy it is to lie about abuse as a way of revenge or punishment for not getting what they want. Because it's always  guilty until proven innocent when it comes to men. I have even heard of divorce lawyers telling women to lie and say they where abused to get a easy win in divorce.

MeToo has become an automatic disgracing of people, killing careers, livelihoods, etc. I think the movement can be good, but hey have rethink their narrative a bit, or more of the accusatory narratives will flourish. Anyway, so glad someone spoke up about this, and the ""MeToo"" movement. She should be held accountable. And for costing him roles, she should be ordered to pay him back--if he's down for that.

I can't really disclose anything but in L.A. the vibe for Johnny was so bad. I worked in Burbank at the lot/building and people were looking at me crazy when I brought him up and how I thought he was so dope. It was like he was shunned or something and he has always been one of my favorite actors since childhood. Studying film theory and human responses, I was always telling people something was off about Amber Heard in that Me Too interview I saw in late 2017 and it was like she was putting on in a way (more or less acting/putting 20 on 10) but people were so quick to say I was shaming her. That I was victim blaming. I am literally studying the theory of film and how actors and actresses work. That was 2018. Now, here in 2020 it was confirmed that she was abusive to him.

On the other hand Amber did actually admit to physical abuse. I think somewhere in our psyche we find this situation somewhat more palatable if there was ""mutual abuse"" which according to the National Domestic Violence Hotline is a myth.¬†

From my understanding, Johnny's mother may have been abusive to him which explains why he took a lot of shit from Amber. And she has a history of domestic violence against her ex-wife whereas all his partners came out (including Vanessa Paradis, Winona Ryder, Kate Moss, and his first wife) in defense of Johnny and stated that he never abused him. ¬†

Who does that?! And the whole time he is taking it because his thinking was what can he do? He's not going to tell anyone his wife is beating him up. Too much pride. Sad.

TMZ uncovered it, and have released a YouTube video about it. Ms Heard had it expunged from her record when she became involved with Mr Depp, but she was unaware that airports have to keep separate documentation of arrests. Tasya van Ree did not protest the arrest, she did not bail Ms Heard out of jail (she had to spend the night) and did not appear at the arraignment the next day, to speak on Ms Heard's behalf. The Judge opted to keep the case open for two years in case Ms van Ree was assaulted again. And as per the accusation that the arresting officer was homophobic...the officer was an openly gay woman, who volunteered at domestic abuse shelters, and who knows the difference between ""grabbing someone's arm"" and domestic assault.‚Äù",S.
