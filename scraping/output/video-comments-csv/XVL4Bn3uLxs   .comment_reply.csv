1,UgyMbqzL4ejnuvxG1AR4AaABAg,Doc Brown,"@Tony Vega yeah she‚Äôs definitely that type, I know what you mean I‚Äôve met women like that. But if Johnny‚Äôs been beating her she would‚Äôve been able to explain details a lot smoother, her pause and expression was of a person thinking of what to say at that moment (when they asked for details) If it really happened it‚Äôs easy to go into details. Her dependency on her lawyer when asked questions is also not of a genuine person who wants to defend her rights. Also snacking while talking about getting abused? Luckily she isn‚Äôt that smart it could‚Äôve been worst for Johnny..",2021-11-06T23:09:18Z,1

What makes your channel so accurate?  Where‚Äôs your proof Johnny pays ppl?  Just more false accusations, Amber, is that you?? If your info was legit, you‚Äôd have more than 24 views and TMZ would be reporting what you claim.  Your claims are one-sided, clearly against Johnny.  If anything, their relationship was mutually abusive.  Amber is vile for weaponizing the metoo movement.  Her accusations were during a time where Hollywood demanded we automatically believe anything women say.  Screw that, this is America and ppl are innocent until proven guilty.  Hollywood cannot change law.  I don‚Äôt believe in, believing whatever women say, as truth.  There are a lot of mentally abusive and manipulative women out there, and with them, comes a lot of men wrongly accused and lives ruined.  Bc as we know, when a woman says she was abused, it‚Äôs ALWAYS true üôÑüôÑ Just bc you feel so strongly about women speaking out, doesn‚Äôt mean innocent men should have to go down.  This controlling, manipulative person she painted Johnny as, turned out to be her.  It‚Äôs complete defamation.  She deserves for her career to be destroyed for destroying his by acting like some innocent victim and taking no blame.  Disgusting.  Men are mentally abused by women all the time, but nobody bats an eye.  But when a woman says she was abused, we automatically believe her?  Lol why even have a trial then, why not just throw every man, that any woman accuses of abuse, in prison.  What if I accused your dad of abuse, would it be ok if everyone automatically believed me just bc I said it happened?  Would it be ok for his name to be dragged through the mud and for him to lose his career, bc of my claim?  My perception of Amber does not come from Johnny Depp, it comes from her behavior and actions.  She is very calculated.  Secretly filming him and recording calls, encouraging him to act a certain way so she can use it against him.  Manipulating him with the things she says, hoping he‚Äôll respond the way she wants while being recorded.  Taking no responsibility for her actions and blaming everything on him, portraying him as a monster.   She is not a victim, she is an abuser.

@Sarah Brit---> Yes, actually, people are analyzed by how behave after a crime (review the psychological literature, or criminology literature via medical journals).

You're deluded if you think parroting the same trope of ""A.H. is an abuse victim"" somehow magically makes it true. There is something adults call evidence, and all the tangible evidence is stacked against A.H. from what's been revealed to the public through official court records. No statement possibly made by an internet 'stranger' can possibly hold greater weight compared to tangible evidence released by the courts.

Your efforts to gaslight the public when the evidence is clear & irrefutable, is a hallmark trait of a narcissist. Take your own advice and 'stop hurting victims of abuse'- i.e. Johnny Depp. I don't formally subscribe to a religious tradition, but it's people like Amber Heard who provide a genuinely convincing argument for the existence of Hell. No hyperbole.

198,UgyCMrWyiyMJBobfIxx4AaABAg,lisa richards,"MarieClaireLucaMusic  She has so much anger and hatred in her towards Johnny, that it always ends up coming to the surface.
Think of all the interactions we have heard between her and Depp‚Äîvirtually all of them, end up showing her sheer contempt of him.
In the depositions, she can never hide her her loathing and contempt.
Even when she was with him, like in those tapes we heard. 
Poor Johnny never figured it out until it was too late.

I think when she got together with Depp, she was jealous of his fame and money, and adulation people give him, and she wanted it for herself.
I think she was very jealous his success, and wondering why he had it, not her. 
She clearly has no respect for him as an actor‚Äî which is nuts, because everybody in Hollywood knows what a great actor he is, including other actors.
But hey, that is a narcissistic personality disorder for you.
I know she does not respect him as an actor because she referred to him as ‚Äúsome old man‚Äù when talking to her assistant.",2020-03-23T17:42:46Z,4

206,UgyEkgxWRIdZxserodZ4AaABAg,invisibleme75,"lisa richards is it possible for someone to have npd, bpd, and be a sociopath all at once? Also agreed on how come Johnny did not clue in. The only theory I can think of is she was almost like the reincarnation of his mother. Something in the relationship with his mother had not yet been healed in him. Something within that probably compelled him to re-create the relationship he had had with his mother, and it was probably a chase her tail dynamic. Nothing was ever enough to make her happy, he was designated by her to assume the role of caretaker, and it became engrained in him to validate himself (his sense of self worth) thru that recurring cycle of trying to fix, soothe, heal, save. The only reason that is my theory is bc I have read a few things about how he describes his mother. And how his relationship w her shaped the way he perceived women, how he interacted with them. The article in which he talks about that is out there somewhere. It‚Äôs somewhat recent. Just weird how his other longer term relationships seemed much more normal. I don‚Äôt know any of these people obviously but Vanessa Paradis etc just seemed much more grounded and warm. I mean there is something about amber, aside from the fact that we can now see she is deranged, but also just seems like a very shallow and disengenuine person.
