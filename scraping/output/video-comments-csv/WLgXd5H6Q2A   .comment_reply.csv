Most of the actors of this franchise like Will,Gibbs , Elizabeth etc. did a great performance, the music is phenomenal and the cgi and settings play a huge role on why these movies are awesome, not just the jokes of Sparrow. Don't get me wrong, he's an amazing and beloved character but him being present in any pirate movie Disney makes , for the sake of being there is a bad choice. In the last movie , he's almost nothing like the witty Jack from the first trilogy. He's mostly there for the nostalgia and the fan service. 
 Pirate movies is a rich genre with so many stories to be told that can be expanded with new comedic (or not) characters different than what Jack Sparrow can offer at this point. We don't have to drag him till we become sick of his downgraded character writing.",2021-02-26T16:03:20Z,0

How he stirs the pot can affect his career indefinitely. So if it is not his situation, and he is not directly involved with the case already, why would he put himself into it? Why would he stick his nose into an already messy situation. Doing so would mean that his name would be brought up for the remainder of his career as long as people continue to talk about the Depp Vs Heard case. As someone who rarely gets into scandals, that kind of thing would probably keep anybody quiet. There‚Äôs no point in talking, especially if neither party has asked you to give your opinion. He can stand with Johnny in other ways. But shooting against his own costar in a movie that hasn‚Äôt even been released yet is opening up a can of worms that could have been avoided. I understand that for all of us, it‚Äôs a situation where we just want Justice for Depp at any means necessary. But this is a very difficult and complicated situation.
