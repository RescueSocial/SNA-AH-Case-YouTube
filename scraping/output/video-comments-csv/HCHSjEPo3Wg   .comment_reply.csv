1,Ugwkg2_9P4F8tN1bvVd4AaABAg,Tasheena Johnson,Unworshipediety that’s the thing WB don’t care in the end lol; the only way there fire an actor is if it’s something they can’t ignore totally.,2020-04-06T14:17:50Z,0
2,Ugwkg2_9P4F8tN1bvVd4AaABAg,Unworshipediety,"@Alexis Miller No one really knows _who s fault it is_ a few months ago it was Depp's fault then a few months before that it was Amber's fault.  Now the blame is right back on her, opinions change based on who releases what about the other last.  At this point, there's no real way to tell who is the worst.  The thing is I think they both at some point really liked each other, but it was clear they both had issues.  Johnny has always been in and out of rehab, while Amber has always put her career first and relationships second. So basically you had two people who had no business getting involved with each other.  


I just think this is a clear case of two people who just didn't work out and both of them are caught up with trying to prove _it's not their fault_ that things didn't work out. Both of them or at least one of them just needs to take the loss and move on.",2020-04-02T01:34:42Z,0
3,Ugwkg2_9P4F8tN1bvVd4AaABAg,Alexis Miller,If the relationship was volatile why did she play victim? If I remember correctly she was the one who let off the fireworks.  She should have left the marriage quietly.  People turned on Jonny Depp.  She lied and tried to run with a narrative that she knew was not true.,2020-03-31T08:38:38Z,0

5,UgxBoLkLaeFthoQq7i14AaABAg,Dark Claw,@Super Nerd Video hopefully they do fire her,2020-03-31T17:45:30Z,0
6,UgxBoLkLaeFthoQq7i14AaABAg,Super Nerd Video,It's hard for WB to gauge whether or not keeping her will drive ticket sales down. It's possible no one will care and still see the movie anyway.,2020-03-31T17:35:36Z,0
