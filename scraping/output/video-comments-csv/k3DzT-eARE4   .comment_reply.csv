7,UgzKtDvxm3tonXs4G0p4AaABAg,SEC,Agreed. It‚Äôs typical Manipulation behavior. Fat he has never been. I would say he was thin before fat any day. My ex did the same thing. It gets in your head. Hope all is well in your world ‚ù§Ô∏è,2020-06-10T23:04:23Z,5

9,UgxkkRRiZolobhisvNt4AaABAg,Connie Diaz,"Exactly! Johnny has always looked 10-15 years younger than his age up until he turned about 51. Then he got involved with this psycho, and he deteriorated and aged FAST. 

In interviews he looked about 20 pounds heavier, looked drunk, he would stutter profusely, and just looked more withdrawn, more shy, and more insecure. It was awful. 

Just look at his interviews when he started dating and eventually marrying her. What a difference.",2021-04-01T08:58:51Z,2

19,UgzdUEhaAXVnNyShdlJ4AaABAg,Love DicedTomatoes,"@Debbie California Interesting insight about his mother. From the outside my first thought was why get involved with someone so unstable, especially when you're Johnny Depp and could be with pretty much anyone you want. Yes, she's physically attractive but there's no shortage of attractive women he could be with. Hearing that about his mother, maybe he unconsciously saw his mother in her and that attracted him to her.",2020-06-10T05:04:56Z,1

22,UgzdUEhaAXVnNyShdlJ4AaABAg,Debbie California,"Of course he is. It was an AWFUL thing for her to throw on him. I have a feeling that not only is he incredibly attractive, kind, bohemian and a great man, I think he probably also has some self esteem issues. That‚Äôs why she used THAT against him. I‚Äôve also heard over the years that Betty Sue (Johnny.‚Äôs mother) had been very hard on him as a child (and even as an adult), which is why he dealt with Amber when most people would run the other direction. I know we all get into bad relationships, but at his age (we‚Äôve also learned to better see them coming) unless that type of behavior seemed ‚Äúnormal‚Äù, he would have never married her. I‚Äôm NOT ‚Äúdissing‚Äù Johnny, I‚Äôm just saying that I‚Äôll bet he‚Äôs had to look at himself and why he WAS in that relationship to begin with. Just a thought.......ü§îü§îü§î",2020-05-26T00:50:20Z,6

24,UgxpK1j48J9Camf6e9B4AaABAg,Love DicedTomatoes,"Sad but at least you found the courage to walk away. All the people feeling stuck with an abusive partner. Has to be awful. With Johnny, it really looks like he was the victim, but he the media and social media mob tried to cancel him- so he was doubly abused.",2020-06-10T04:57:34Z,4

I still struggle but channels talking about narcissistic abuse have helped me overcome a lot and have helped me to recognise the signs to look out for in people going forward.

I was also amazed when I found this out, my ex at the same day like her, and my birthday is eight days later than Johnnys bday, and I experienced many things like JD did, there are so many things in common in my life, beginning from childhood..this is amazing and scaring at the same time.

31,Ugyl0xNzpbjN9QCjW2Z4AaABAg,Paris,"@Debbie California being a sociopath most likely develops when there is extreme trauma at a young age and it's not like you're daughter could have chosen to be one. there is a little thing in all our brains that gives us all empathy but with sociopaths and psychopaths it's just smaller then normal. sociopaths are still able to develop a relationship but just difficulter. i don't know, what when on with you and your daughter but even though it might not seem like she want your help i do think y'all should talk and try and establish a good relationship. ofcourse still be careful around her because she could be very impulsive.",2020-07-01T05:36:44Z,3

There are actually two people DEAD BC of their relationship with her. It has broken my heart a number of times to the point where I just CAN‚ÄôT have any communication with her.
