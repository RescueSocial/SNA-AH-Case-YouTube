When we started talking again she'd pull an argument out of thin air at least once a week, pin all the blame on me then claim I was attacking her and/or being a bad freind if I defended myself. She even got it into her head that I didn't want her talking to other guys and spent hours yelling at me via text. I never did figure out why she thought that. Thankfully this was only ever via text or phone as she lives 90 miles away from me and my country is on it's 3rd lockdown so it was easy to cut her out of my life.

Pay attention to her framing - it's all using their buzzwords and applying their ""theory"" (which is an insult to science, by the way) in defence of her observations of the (mis)treatment of men around her. The only fault I see with that is that an argument built upon a foundation of bullshit (feminist bullshit, to be precise, equally applied as it may be) detracts severely from the (presumably) objective observations at its core and brings their validity into question right away.

So far as I can tell, she's slowly realising that the ideologues lied. I'm here to speed up the process. They didn't lie about one or two things, they lied about everything. It's what ideologues do.

The tools I listed above (logic, evaluating evidence, etc.) will let anyone reach a firm conclusion wherever possible based on their own observations (as well as evidence presented by others). No faith required. No ""listen and believe"" nonsense.",2020-09-24T19:42:33Z,0

Hats off to you for getting past the most difficult hurdle.  As children, we absorb the behavior of our parents and role models, and when we do not have a prepared response for life's events, our reflex is to do what they did.  As adults, we have the opportunity to retrain ourselves and substitute ""bad"" habits with ""good"" habits.  I say ""substitute"" because habits are not discarded.  We have to actively ""overwrite"" a habit in order to condition a new reflex for ourselves.  It takes time, effort, and patience, but you can do it.",2021-07-16T04:54:45Z,1
