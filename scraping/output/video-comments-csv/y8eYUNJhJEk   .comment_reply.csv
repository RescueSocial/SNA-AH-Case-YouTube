2,UgzpkPnX8OhoKB8Y_BN4AaABAg,YouYou,"They were 20 years apart too. It's something that make relationship difficult as they aren't on the same page. It's basically 2 decade. I know rich men can always date young beautiful women because they have money and lots of young women are after it. But you need to be careful. 
It's like the SUGAR DADDIES and SUGAR BABIES where oldmen meet young 20 somthing for companionship or sex in exchange of money. It just that some women take it on a higher level of real relationship and divorce.",2020-10-18T20:33:33Z,0

While amber on the other hand, just used johnny purely for her own gain heck she clearly never loved him even a little and she dare hurt him like this? After milking money and joyriding on johnny‚Äôs success for years she has to abused him as well?? That woman is vile can‚Äôt you see? She treats people like some sort of accessories. I‚Äôm not surprised if you‚Äôre just like her irl. They always say: birds with the same feather flock togetherü§≠

Amber knows how to manipulate people into thinking she is young and innocent and that‚Äôs what makes her a despicable human being. The only mistake johnny ever made was biting her bait.",2020-12-01T18:29:21Z,0
