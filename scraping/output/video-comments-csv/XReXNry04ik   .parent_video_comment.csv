A lot of corruption and evils are being exposed in Hollywood it seems lately and maybe they are afraid he'll talk. He has always seemed to be an authentic person despite what he does for a living. I do believe there are good people, caring people with kind hearts, that get pushed around and railroaded in Hollywood. There is a lot of evil stuff that happens behind the scenes. I think in the beginning, Johnny fell for a pretty face with bad disorders and got in too deep and now he's paying for it unfortunately. He may have some issues too but never believed he was physically violent or physically abusive against anyone. I really hope he gets vindication and justice eventually. He should never have gotten with Amber. It was a bad combination. It's frustrating to me that outlets are totally ignoring the abuse he suffered. It's mind blowing that they are ignoring his bruises, the fact that she cut off the tip of his finger, and the recordings where she admits to starting fights, throwing things at him, and hitting him. Infuriating that he is not portrayed as a victim of abuse himself.",Kelly Hayward,0,2020-11-08T19:30:53Z

In fact it was a reporter from The Sun reading the texts, Milly had been murdered within hours of being taken. The Sun's sister paper The News of The World was worse for illegally tapping into phones of the famous and powerful, the actor Hugh Grant led the charge that eventually got that paper shut down.

Did they not hear the tapes, the deposition, and transcripts from the court. Come on, your telling me this women's claim to fame his ex, is only known by who she divorced. Notice I did not say married, because nobody even knew who she was until the TMZ tape, the DV order, and the filing for divorce to JD. The only reason people know if her is her  photo shoot with her flat hair, no eye makeup, wait she had some on her cheek. The somber face, or was she medicated? Regardless I am speculating of her appearance and  tactics for the filing before JD could file, after he told her he was going to divorce her. The big show that no one saw of him winding his arm like a pitcher and throwing a phone at her, and hitting her face flat on her cheek. Maybe JD should have been a baseball player, with a throwing arm like that. I wonder how many MPH it clocked at when hitting her face. I am in no way for abuse towards women, children, animals, oh yeah and MEN. Anyway WB has asked or told JD to step down for a part he has made his own, to this actress who would have gone unnoticed had she not filed a restraining order against JD and beat him to the court, photographers in tow.  All this so she had photographers could get a good shot of the smudge on her face, and her historical crying after leaving leaving the court.  This actress gets her part back in the movie that has not started filming until May 2021, yet Removes JD, a Major Motion Picture Star who has been filming and under contact since September 17th 2020.

443,Ugy8XSe4GZKazIb00194AaABAg,"The judge's decision was about as biased as you can get. Ignore her lies and discount witness testimony. I'd appeal NOW. As for WB and Disney, the Rat is going down in financial flames, and I wouldn't waste a drop of piss on them.",Dwayne Harvie,333,2020-11-07T18:28:06Z
444,UgwiRd1dX1H5_gtmKAN4AaABAg,"By doing this WB have totally shot themselves in the foot. Honestly the only thing on their side is the court. After what happened no one in their right mind will watch either Fantastic Beast 3 without JD or Aquaman with AH. They are a movie company that sell their product to people who are willing to pay for it, and now they insulted these very people and completely blew it. Their stupidity honestly amuses me.",Nicholas Chen,330,2020-11-07T18:27:21Z

457,Ugxg8a2vcYBqJWkyBNt4AaABAg,"I feel like a woman (AH) is being praised for acting ""like a man"" by these companies (WB, NGN) and being included in the ""boys club"" for some strange reason. It's also weird that JD and Musk are two of the few men she had public relationships with, she dates mostly women. AH gives women, feminists, dv survivors and LGBTQ women a bad look. JD is treated atm like the victim who dared speak up, disturb the narrative, and is getting punished for it. This case and lawsuits are so much bigger than we realized at first imho. What I think is that he is being made an example of by a corrupt court system and people who are trying to push unhealthy ideas (women and men are this and that, people shouldn't try fighting back etc.).",Marta Lalova,62,2020-11-07T18:17:45Z
