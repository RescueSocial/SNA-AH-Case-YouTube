She got Musk's Billion Dollars, WB/DCEU still holding on to her and the Judicial System bending the knees to her. This is Lucifer in a Dress, ya'll.",2021-02-23T05:23:21Z,3
1,Ugwt5KbfMtj7q09iTWl4AaABAg,Wild Heart's Can't Be Tamed,"@Anthony M I agree. I have seen how she acted in the flesh with my own two eyes and she makes rude comments and harasses JD fans whoever speaks out for JD I should know very well cause as a matter of fact I may have ot harrassed by her today alone behind a fake JD account makes me sick they say JD is the one with the smear champain I can say hell no to that rumor AH is ruthless and burtal I got a full taste of her today on another video saying I  wintessed the abuse and I would come out and testify mutlilpule of so called  JD ""fans"" attaked me after I said I have wintessed the abuse between the two of them. she triggers my anxity through the roof true JD fans would have never spoken so poorly to me I know that for a fact right now AH is in despo mode she has no where else to hide and I sure as hell wont shut up I saw her abuse JD she can threaten me all she wants but I never back down from a fight and I will also have my day on the stand soon to speak how ruthless and burtal she really is!",2021-02-23T03:20:45Z,3
2,Ugwt5KbfMtj7q09iTWl4AaABAg,Anthony M,"I understand personally. But it's really double standard. Johnny was contracted with Fantastic Beasts and Pirates. But they had no problem firing him and suggesting he be replaced immediately. So if they had any issues firing an abuser, they wouldn't have acted so promptly on Johnny's case. I'm not suggesting she lose her job. But if they treated the situation so quickly with one person that they knew would in fact receive backlash for accusations. How should evidence in a civil case be treated differently. Just the scewed logic of Hollywood irritates me.  Clear evidence she is a terrible person but she still gets a place in the movie? She doesn't deserve 2 seconds in that movie. Let alone a reduced role. Bad behavior should not be rewarded. Most especially when there is clear evidence of it out in the public view.",2021-02-23T03:09:42Z,2

12,UgzP1sS7_03_xyjMqTh4AaABAg,EAprima,"WB doesn't care. One of the worse things you can do in the US is messing with the kids. Amber messed with the kids in a huge way and yet WB STILL doesn't do anything about it. All they care about is money and only doing things their way. They don't care about moral, being a role model or anything like that. If a killer is praised by the sick media, WB will hire that killer in the hope to generate money.",2021-02-23T02:55:55Z,4
