Marvel recast some of their roles for understandable reasons (like with Ed Norton and Terrence Howard for example) but it kind of pains me that WB arn't doing the same with THEIR actors, like how they were about to recast Will Smith with Idris Elba as Deadshot in The Suicide Squad but they decided to have Elba play a different character instead and writing Smith's character out of it. :/",Sam Kresil,0,2021-09-29T10:27:11Z
