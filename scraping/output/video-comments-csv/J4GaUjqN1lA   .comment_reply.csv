15,UgxGXBTfbsCEtJA6BQx4AaABAg,Mike Wilton,"@Who Knows I have to agree with him on games, the DC properties seem to have something extra in production value, and I would also have to add animation to the DC side of things ...

However those are the two most junior parts of the discussion, and Marvel dominates quite heavily (at the moment) in movies and comics, while the TV side of it is less clear cut, but judging by the popularity of WandaVision (and that is only on their own streaming service, while DC TV is mainly networked) the Disney+ series' will extend that dominance in short order.",2021-03-02T10:47:01Z,0
16,UgxGXBTfbsCEtJA6BQx4AaABAg,Who Knows,"@Arnioli99 Except this is completely wrong. As far as comics, Marvel makes more revenue yearly off of sales than DC. Marvel wins there..

As far as television, Marvel has/had multiple shows that have received critical acclaim while almost every DC television show gets ripped apart. For good reason too. Look at the Arrowverse. Pure trash. Its basically Gossip Girl and 90210 with superheros who look like they're cosplaying and doing a bad job at it. Not to mention the soap opera level dialogue. Those shows are literal garbage for preteens. Flash, Supergirl, Batwoman, LOT, Black Lightning etc etc... all absolutely terrible. Some of the worst acting and writing I've ever seen and heard. DC hasn't produced one TV show that can rival Daredevil or Punisher, let alone everything else. Look at WandaVision. Totally encapsulating the TV world right now and its a smash with critics and fans. Just wait until Falcon and Winter Soldier or Loki or any of the other 10+ shows Marvel has coming out. Point being Marvel smashes DC in the TV arena as well.

Video games??? Who even cares?? I don't play any, but I know the Marvel Spiderman game was loved. Idk what games DC has out but I'm sure Marvel is still killing them or at least a strong competitor. Bottom line is Marvel is without dominating the superhero genre.",2021-03-01T23:37:33Z,1
