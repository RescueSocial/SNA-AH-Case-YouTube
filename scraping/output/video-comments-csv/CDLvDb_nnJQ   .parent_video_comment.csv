I fell into that too especially when talking to a woman I'm interested in and she ask me if I've ever been, ""with"" a woman. That question used to scare me to death because according to worlds standards it's crazy that a guy my age has never done that. This also goes along with the Matthew Kelly book I'm reading about the seven levels of intimacy. I really like this part when he talks about how we are often afraid that people won't like us for who we truly are, so we portray ourselves as someone we are not in hopes that they will like us. It is better to be rejected for who we truly are rather than being loved for someone we are not. That really hit home with me when I read it.Â 

I totally experienced the money thing earlier this year with a woman. On the first date she asked me, how much money do you make? I was honest and told her and she said well you need to at least make this much because I like to shop and I want 8 kids. As you can guess, it didn't work out. It did make me have a negative view of women for a little while. 

A lot of guys these days are scared to commit to a woman. There's many reason I think it is that way now. I don't understand it, I've been wanting to get married since I was probably 5 years old ha ha!",JesseMM1892,0,2021-08-01T04:15:39Z
