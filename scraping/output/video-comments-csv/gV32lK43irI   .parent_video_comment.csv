But I'm sick to death of racism being pushed into the main stream and being excepted as long as it's against whites. I am sick of politics being an issue in entertainment! I'm sick of a witchhunt for anyone of conservative views whether you're a writer a director and actor or even a fan! You can be a strong woman smart and independent. You can be the star of a movie or series book or comic you can do all of this without pushing some toxic feminist agenda! But they do this while at the same time still pushing the double standard that allows them to attempt to destroy Johnny Depp's career while hers continues to flourish! I don't get me wrong I think Deb is also a liberal retard. He should lose his career over it. And nor should he lose his career over alleged abuse what was it 2 Lane Rd.. and not for nothing if even half the abuse that came from her is true she's psychotic!

And I have utterly no problem with Emelia Clarke replacing her! IMO, Emelia is ten times cuter, has many magnitudes more screen-presence than Amber does, and also doesn't have a documented history of physically assaulting her husband, over and over and over again.

However, if this does end up true, I wouldn't be very shocked either. It seems that one of the narratives that the media wants to push is that JD and AH were both equally abusive to each other (which we know isn't the case). To me, it seems like because of all the bad PR Warner Bros received from firing JD, Warner Bros wants to go from the narrative that JD is the sole abuser to that both were equally abusive. So if this report is true, and Emilia Clarke does replace AH, then WB will see it as an accomplishment, as they'll see it as the controversy not being their problem anymore. Only problem for them with this plan, is that the public knows the truth. JD may have been on a lot of drugs, but he never actually absued AH. She actually abused him, verbally,physically, and mentally. So this ""equally abusive"" narrative isn't gonna work with us. So the general public is still gonna be happy that AH is gone, but also still gonna be pissed that JD is still gone aswell. So the Bad PR is still kinda there (if this report is true, that is).",Gamemediafan 17,0,2021-02-22T21:25:19Z
