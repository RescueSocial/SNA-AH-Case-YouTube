1,UgykzmIFZh6VoZ_jasN4AaABAg,"What you SHOULD have said is NO INTERNET DIAGNOISING, unless you are qualified to do so, because THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT YOU DID!! She cannot be a therapist/psychologist, she did not even recognize the BLATANT ABUSE ON THE TMZ VIDEO, it's a full showcase of goading, gaslighting, etc in 3Minutes!!! NO ONE who didn't pick up on that should be speaking on narcissism.
 She isn't a ""toxic narcissist"" ...she is a Malignant Narcissist old term. DSM-5 diagnosis. 
   She has several Cluster B things going on 1) Borderline as witnessed primarily by the SEPARATION TERROR, on audio & throughout many depositions, Sociopath by the level of violence, & narcissism is part of the Borderline & the Anti-Social Personality to use the correct term (Sociopath & Psychopath), I personally would say a Borderline with secondary psychopathy is the most accurate diagnosis. Also, all these things are on a sliding scale as to the severity of the manifestation of Borderline or NPD, AND her use of drugs makes it impossible for any Dr to gauge her properly, see her outbursts? They are out of control, which is the behavior used to determine the severity of narcissistic injury which can lend itself to secondary psychopathy....how much of this is due to drug use? 
 All Cluster B's were abused in childhood, but not everyone abused in childhood develops a personality disorder that has no cure & involves a total lack of empathy, exploitation of others (to get what they want or in a sadistic manner), this we do not know. 
 Your guest needs to do some research at the very least, this is a great opportunity for people to better understand an abusive personality, so they don't become one (if under 25), raise one, or get abused by one. I have followed this case because 1) opportunity for REAL SOCIETAL CHANGE 2) SACRIFICE has been made on the part of Mr. Depp for DV victims, we need to use this 3) People in the future can avoid abuse, if everyone recognized the BLATANT abuse of Heard against DEPP in the TMZ video, well, things would have possibly gotten better for society & certainly JD at an accelerated pace! Men are victims as well of DV & narcissistic abuse! These are my educated opinions, I mean they are backed by recent studies but only my opinions!! Much Love

However, I'm wondering whether Amber changes herself to match her female romantic partners, or if that is just a thing she does for her male partners? It's already known that her father was abusive. If she is only changing herself for her male partners, that could be a symptom of an unhealed wound, like some part of her is still looking to please her father in some way. For that matter, her own abusiveness could be her trying to model herself after her father because she never received validation from him? Not excusing her abusive behavior.

I have come to one realization.
A.H. is a highly skilled Grifter. She surrounds herself with ""Remoras"" (the fish that attach themselves to sharks and feed off the scraps.) and fellow grifters.
They back her up so that they can ride the gravy train as long as they can.
Even before she had finished J.D. off, She was already lining up her next Grift which was Mr. Musk.
But she couldn't worm her way into his head or feed him meds to keep him doped. So he caught on to her and ran away. She was angling for a bigger better payout. Once that failed she had no choice but to try and take as much as possible.

I believe in my own opinion that She planned from the start to take as much as she could, then get out and move on to a bigger fish. He was a springboard to bounce her career and social status so she can get in with bigger, richer people.",Honey2800,1,2020-09-30T12:41:11Z

So you can say that for at least 37yrs not one partner has claimed him to be abusive in anyway  except Amber Heard and she was the last significant other .
Also bear in mind that Johnny has had drink and drug issues for many years and so a good few of the exe's will have been with him during those episodes and still haven't said anything about any aggression when on binges.
Does she not think that when she shows the photos of Johnny passed out , sleep on the settee spilling milkshake or whatever, hardly helps her case of him being violent, it tends to show me that he was a man clearly too inebriated to make it to his bedroom let alone commit acts of violence.

126,Ugw1g24t_iU59JwWUzB4AaABAg,"Gang, although I am not a lawyer, I may be able to shed some light on why AH and many others are able to repeatedly make false statements without repercussions, despite information that disproves the statements. It is a three part wall against prosecuting perjury charges:
1. Despite claims by ""me-too"", nearly every charge brought to law enforcement is taken seriously and should be. To lay an accusation is a serious act and is listened to, reviewed and considered in context. This is limited by resources and time available to the law enforcement agency and is weighed against the harm the claimed act caused, could cause again and the ramifications of the act being repeated, thus serial murder is investigated more diligently than jaywalking. 
2. In the areas I am familiar with, perjury is a felony and the standard of proof is ""beyond a reasonable doubt"", making proving the charge significantly more difficult for a crime many see as relatively minor. Top this off with the secondary requirement that perjury must be proved to have been intentional and many District Attorney officers are not willing to risk their reputation by attempting to prosecute perjury. 
3. Many DA's offices are heavily loaded with prosecuting what are seen as much more serious charges with limited resources, do not gain any resources or gain much in recognition from their superiors or the public by winning a perjury case, but lose a great deal by losing that case, making them reticent to even bring the case. 

The biggest loss for our justice system is that lying becomes accepted as a way to gain resources, to browbeat your opponent before and in court and to risk very little by using these tactics. Divorce and family court attorneys have known this for years, commonly suggesting a woman involved in a divorce and custody case include charges of domestic violence, child cruelty and requesting a domestic violence restraining order as the first three shots to open the battle,  charges few have the time or treasure to fight effectively. 
JD is one of the very few people who has the resources not to back down from his Virginia case and potentially subsequent litigation, making it a very rare telling of so many stories and I, for one, thank him for speaking for so many. For him being such a private man, I can only imagine how much he would have preferred to avoid this whole three ring circus...",Bear,3,2020-09-27T22:18:22Z

Then, unknown to me she went to the Family Court and got two orders against me. I was then arrested, put on remand, the Covid shutdown happened, the courts closed and I couldn't get a bail hearing. I have done nothing wrong. 3 weeks ago I was released and now have to start the fight to clear my name. These people are dangerious nighmares. She cant win because her statement to the court is peppered with lies that I have exculpatory evidence to disprove. She doesnt match her lies up and is all over the place.

By the time reality sets in it’s so far down the line the abuser has pushed their mind down so far, they believe they have little worth, they doubt themselves, that they could even cope with anything. Many victims of covert narcissistic suffer with PTSD. That’s what drew so much attention to this case, many people following have 1st hand knowledge of this type of abuse, they know how it makes one react and feel. Thats what made the public outcry and support JD, that’s when people (hopefully) started to see what Narcissistic abuse is.

The only thing was it wasn’t enough, she never had any lying or covert or ambition about her, she just desperately wanted someone to be able to say this is my boyfriend etc. I found that very sad. But a covert narcissist does it for self gain, to empower themselves, to draw the sparkling object closer so they can own it. AH is nothing like the girl I knew, I could feel sorry for her easily.

Just the way you look your eyes tell VOLUMES  .. look at the way JD started to loose the spark he had before he got with AH he started to look over his shoulder and was very careful what he said and looked at AH to make sure it was ok and you can hear it in the recordings in case something would 'set her off'.  Once you've gone through something like this you CAN'T unsee it. I saw it when my daughter was being put through it and it broke my heart BUT she's come through it but in saying that we ALMOST lost her he beat her so bad .. thankfully he's being held until it goes to court and in that time you can see her spark has come back shes SO much stronger and wiser and shares anything that can help those that are currently going through the same and that's for BOTH men OR women and that's one of the MOST important things NEVER stay silent that's what narcissists thrive on silence solitude and manipulation and the 'no one will believe you' or 'you're imagining it all' and 'you're being paranoid'.,Ginger 67,6,2020-09-24T10:33:20Z

Not specifically all on Johnny Depp or Amber Heard (although the examples gleened from their relationship are helpful), having a conversation about different behaviors and character traits is very helpful. Duane is correct they all follow the same pattern, but understanding the pattern is deep because a normal person cannot think the way they do. That is where most people get tripped up.

222,Ugx9zFTrnH-B2wy5y5J4AaABAg,"Amber didn't mirror interests on purpose? Yes, it was unconscious perhaps. But all liars don't lie exactly on purpose. A liar is not thinking:  ""let me lie with an intent to be a liar"". A liar probably thinks: ""I'm so scared of rejection and I know they'll hate me if I say the truth. And so, there is no way I can say the truth or I'll be screwed."" They imagine danger or something horrible from people who know the truth,  and so they lie - it's a poor safety mechanism with emotionally healthy people. ( But a lie can save your life in a very abusive and extremely dictatorial environment, which was probably their childhood.) Still, this is not an excuse to think it's ok to lie in every environment. On this thought, I might as well conclude that criminals also don't commit crimes with an intention to be bad criminals - there must be life circumstances that led them to choose crime. Yet it was still their choice. Liars choose to lie, just like murderers choose to murder. And I don't want to pity those people nor leave them unpunished.",g,1,2020-09-22T18:16:45Z

233,UgwqsN9yZJunrsODYzl4AaABAg,"DSD,    It’s not just morphing to attract Johnny. Borderlines have identity issues.
They may become very businesslike and corporate, then they will be around someone that is a hippie, and they quit showing up to work, and get stoned all day.
As narcissists do not have a self, borderlines also have identity issues.
Those are two very deep concepts in psychology, a you really have to study psychology to understand them.
I believe with Amber, it was both manipulation to change her style of dress and books and music, but it was also part of the borderline syndrome of having “identity issues.”
Borderlines have a difficulty when it comes to a sense of self.",lisa richards,4,2020-09-22T15:34:14Z

On YouTube, the word “Narcissism” has become a catch all phrase for everything that people don’t like.
Go by the DSMV criteria, not by emotion.
It is evident she is a borderline, especially in the tape where she talks about it being overwhelming and frightening when he leaves the room or the apartment.
This is not an assumption, or conjecture.
Johnny said she was diagnosed with borderline, and I don’t think he lied about it, and I studied psychology for several years.
Borderlines are narcissistic by nature.",lisa richards,9,2020-09-22T15:15:05Z

Me: goofy humor, extrovert, artistic, spiritual,  loved throwing parties and being social, hugely into family.  Him, nope, none of those.  A narc does this to suck a person in.  I felt like the guy I loved had died and this shallow monster was left in his place.  We now live platonically to care for our son, and I got a PO on his a$s so he cannot step out of line.
