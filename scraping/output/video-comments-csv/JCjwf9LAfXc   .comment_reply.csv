I don't doubt the abuse and trauma he's been through either, but it's pretty well known he's a heavy drinker and quite possibly an alcoholic.

88,UgxF8iqwUkvfF79rmpN4AaABAg,Laura Biegel,"@Corbin Ziegler. This was about 3 years ago at movie press conference. Do you really not know that is Johnny Depp and co star Dakota (Johnson?)
Im not sure why Johnny is showing her his finger but his ex wife was abusive and threw a bottle at him,  cutting off his finger. The picture is in the video, warning it's gruesome. He just finished a trial against a British newspaper calling him a wifebeater without proof causing him to lose work and to continue as Captain Jack Sparrow as Disney released him. There ate rumors he wi be returning but not as the main character.  It may be Sept until the judges decision. Then next year it is Depp vs Amber Heard for libel/defamation in Virginia for an article she wrote claiming to be a survivor of domestic violence. I hope this helps clarify. #JusticeforJohnny",2020-08-05T23:34:12Z,1

91,Ugwbdqm8MgZXBFxhj1J4AaABAg,Tymon Dąbrowski,"No, we aren't talking about gender equality here. It's just the downside of patriarchy: men are supposed to be the stronger, more violent gender, while women are supposed to be soft and empathetic, so everyone assumes that the man is the abuser and the woman is the victim (there is also some amount of somewhat supporting statistics like if a woman dies from murder, most probably the murderer was her husband, boyfriend or an ex-boyfriend, alternatively someone who wanted to date her, so it skews the perception too). If both genders were treated exactly the same, it would happen differently (maybe even Johnny would speak up earlier, so the whole believe-Amber-because-she-says-shes-the-victim wouldn't happen). Note that I'm not necessarily in favour of treating both genders exactly the same, but we're still so far from that point that the details don't matter anyway. But yeah, there is no gender equality here.",2021-06-25T00:35:04Z,3

100,UgzRb31HuLnK1FmbVX54AaABAg,Jessica Keim,@T Tephi okay I looked it up. Apparently theres two sides. During a movie he did he wanted to fully understand what his character went thru so he pulled his own tooth out (not sure why) and refused to bathe to better understand and relate to the character he was playing. As for his normal daily routine it says he doesnt see the need to shower on a daily basis but not much info as to why. So I'm not really sure hun.,2020-08-01T23:27:33Z,0
101,UgzRb31HuLnK1FmbVX54AaABAg,Jessica Keim,@T Tephi not sure. I wondered same thing.

And that other actors and actresses he worked with would say he smelled just awful. Also said his ex wife not amber heard but the one he has children with was the exact same way.

I have laid it out plenty for you, but your Bias shines through.   I know there is a recording of her saying she hit Depp.  And people claiming she faked the injuries, I am aware of all the back and forth.  Most of it is silly.  This was an abusive relationship.  He is mad at her that she talked about it, and his hard drinking/drugging likely abusive lifestyle got played out in the media.  It is 100% obvious you are a DEPP Fan as you are clearly condemning Amber and clearing Depp of any wrongdoing.  The drugs and liquor play no role according to you, the video of them arguing and him being drink means nothing to you.   Yes you are a very very biased Depp Fan..",2020-07-02T23:15:52Z,0

Also no I’m not responding to you or others because I’m a Depp fan. I barely knew shit about him before this happened. I’m responding because I’ve witnessed *mutually* abusive relationships when I was younger and I deeply relate to this situation because of it. I’m not gonna sit here and act like I’m an expert on abusive relationships because of it but I can at least give insight to those who are too ignorant to do their fucking research. Hell I already recommended a channel to you that covers this situation. Also if your only proof of him being abusive is because he’s an alcoholic and the TMZ video then that’s just sad.",2020-07-02T23:00:42Z,0

Debunked by the press leaks from his lawyer?  Use some common sense.   You really think a drunk that had a volatile relationship with this woman never got violent?  That rings true to you?  What about the video that started it all?  Depp is drunk AF at like 9AM banging shit around the kitchen and they are about to argue for obviously like the 1,000th time?  That seem normal to you?  That pretty summed up their daily interactions it looked like to me.  They would fight and he'd get drunk.  Or he would come home drunk and they would fight..  You are a Depp fan and want to make this one sided.  He's got a problem.  it is far from 1 sided.",2020-07-02T22:16:19Z,0

217,Ugz_dH7E2GuP85AS35B4AaABAg,Noam Bjarnson,"@Panda What? 😅 You've been watching too much South Park, friend-o. Also, what a weird example to use for your defence 😆 Anyway, it's okay for you to be upset by my comments and remarks, that's fine 😊 And you call me whatever you want, if that helps 🤷🏻‍♂️ But, _don't_ twist my words to make it fit your view on this, putting your personal experience(?) and interpretations of my comment / replies or other people's replies and comments you've seen regarding this subject(etc.) on me. Did you even read the replies I called / call biased? Or do you only see and hear what you wanna see and hear? Maybe you just love drama online, I don't know 🤔 Also, your views are only narrow when you _don't_ look at the other side, but oh I _do_ see it from both sides, do you?! Right now, the evidence is just pilling up on women (like Amber) trying to ruin mens lives, that's it 🤷🏻‍♂️ Women like her misusing the #MeToo movement, ruining it for rest of the women that would _never_ do crazy stuff like that. Also, when I wrote ""...scary how women today..."" I didn't / don't mean _all_ women, but it does seems like you're calling out _all_ men, also personally targeting me, or am I too misinterpretating? 😉",2020-08-08T17:49:57Z,3

Also - it's not ""society"" that demeans men who are abused - it's mainly other men. When an underaged teenager gets raped by his female teacher, the majority of people who are saying ""he shouldn't complain, I'd love to have been him when I was that age"" are men.

I could not afford a lawyer at the time and I just wanted to be away from this person. My retribution was living a very happy life after him. But he, apparently  became diabetic and would not give up sugar and  sugary drinks and bit by bit parts of his body were cut off and he had to live in a wheelchair until he finally passed away.",2020-07-31T17:46:50Z,3

Yes. You where actually bringing up a fight here when all this person did was share their story of abuse as a way to relate and sympathise with Johnny. Two victims coming together to be strong. This was positive. Yet you had to jump in and start being accusing and hateful and just plain out disgusting. You tainted this as a ""Women's fault. Men are the real victims. Men v Women' thing. You are just as worst as the feminazi's defending Amber.
Do us all a favour and back the hell off.",2020-07-31T10:27:19Z,4

288,Ugy2IzCaAp0kK72oh2F4AaABAg,EFAL,She is indeed toxic. There are many psychotic people who are kind though and non psychotic people who are toxic. Maybe she is not psychotic. Psychosis is an illness caused often by trauma that can be done by abusers to their victims and should not be used as an insult.,2021-04-30T13:48:36Z,0

/s alright, look. go talk to a doctor about a panic attack really  looks like.  Why they happen, etc. ""Taking a walk and breathing, and eating a snack"" is not a cure when you have something wrong with your stress levels and brain. I eat well, I sleep well, and my anxiety is better. But I still get attacks, and it is like being in hell with a 2000 pound weight on your chest.  Thanks lol, take care and have a good day.",2021-05-24T17:36:29Z,0
