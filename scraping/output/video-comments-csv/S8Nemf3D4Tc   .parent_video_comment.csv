173,UgwClSEnXfOvf48EyXZ4AaABAg,"Why would Forbes put that sentence in their article about Emilia Clarke selling her California home? Unless if other major trades also confirm it, then treat it with a grain of salt.

Anyways, WB really needs to do something about the whole Amber Heard situation and the public drama surrounding her and Johnny Depp had caused. If they had fired Johnny Depp, shouldn't they do the same for Amber Heard as well because the evidence of her being a domestic abuser is also there and I can imagine the awkward PR nightmare this may cause for the Aquaman 2 press junket because we all know that everyone will definitely be asking about the Amber Heard situation for sure. I wouldn't want to be either Jason Momoa or James Wan in that situation.

Okay, so going for the rhetorical question in mind, will a recast with Emilia Clarke as the new Mera be plausible? Well, unlike with Amber, there's definitely no drama with Emilia as she seems to be free of any personal drama and everyone who had worked with her before in the past really loved working with her so having someone like that on set would definitely boost morale and fans loved her despite the let down of the widely despised final season of GoT and her questionable film choices. Since her and Momoa already had the chemistry during their early Game of Thrones days, maybe they can try and replicate that for Aquaman 2? It would definitely help make things as smooth as possible for everyone.

Of course, the only downside with Emilia is that she's probably a bit too short compared to Momoa and would be a bit distracting of the height difference if they go ahead with the recasting? But then again, if she does great with Mera then I think people can forgive the height differences and just go along with it.",Lycosyncer,2,2021-02-23T00:15:55Z

213,UgwfrdiHUtWWkTw0Y6R4AaABAg,"I am not up on the Amber Heard story so I read up on it quickly. Sounds like she is in a pissing match with her ex about who beat who. Lots of he said she said. The same crap has been going on for years in sports and Hollywood, why be so sensitive about it now? I think she did a good job in the first Aquaman. I will see the second as well with or without her.",Charles Rives,7,2021-02-22T22:48:03Z
214,Ugy1eMuOYpXuVzX9xON4AaABAg,"I don't think that's likely to happen. Maybe the studio is planning to replace Amber by not recasting her but giving her a way out so in that way WB can be done with her. But if they do replace Amber I don't think Emilia Clarke is the right choice. Not because she's a bad actress but she's too small for the role... Physically. Whether we like Amber Heard or not, the truth is we are used to see a the character of Mera with a similar height as Jason Momoa",Lincoln 23,5,2021-02-22T22:47:37Z

We have Emilia Clarke ready to replace you,  in a heartbeat.  You do see how there are millions of fans demanding Emilia Clarke replace you?""
