Compliment u on your black hat that I believe flip flaps in front, also black hat that has feather in it   - u may have worn it in one of ur Disney films where u resembled I think a fox or wolf in the woods.

15,UgybkZ0ovUqjXOlBiip4AaABAg,"I see that a lot of Depp fans confound love by loyality. If you are loyal to someone you take his sie, if he‚Äòs attacked, and defend him to
a certain degree. But to love someone means to love him in spite of all his -well known- flaws. Think about it if you have time.",hungry wolve,2,2018-06-26T11:26:35Z

17,UgxS1nSosvRS0ymEURN4AaABAg,"Johnny, you find out who your real friends are when you're at rock bottom. I feel Alice is looking out for you now, he seems a good guy. As for what you said to Tom, he died due to prescription pills overdose. Fentanyl, Oxycodin and benzos. Which caused him to have respiratory and cardiac failure. Yeah he had the beginnings of COPD, but smoking didn't kill him. And so what if you blew loads of money on wine, if I was rich, I would probably be the same. So Johnny don't listen to the shit people have said about you. I was a victim of serious domestic abuse, and I think I can spot a violent man in 10 minutes. It needs no qualifications to be in the fault finding game, and nobody can make you sad, upset or depressed without your permission. So, Johnny, fuck 'em all. Life changes everything is temporary, happiness, sadness, success, it all ends. You had also just lost your mum and I don't think you got the time to grieve when everything went wrong. But the Hollywood Vampires are great, I love your cover of Heroes. So basically surround yourself with good people, people who really care. I would love Alice Cooper on my side, even though he used to scare the shit out of me when I was a kid! But he's a good guy. So take care Johnny, Betty Sue is looking out for you too.

22,Ugw4F0PPbbAq-6j1XbZ4AaABAg,"$30k on wine? Meh. If you got that kind of money, it's not hard to do. I mean, there are tons of excellent $1k wines out there, and you get 30 bottles? That's $30k. I'm more of a $10-20 bottle kinda guy myself, but if I had zillions in the bank I'd probably spend that much as well. Let's face it, Johnny Depp probably makes $50k a day. It's only shocking to us that make that a year. 

And, no, he didn't beat his ex wife. She's a known crazytown resident. Super manipulative.",Erich Tisnado,2,2018-06-21T23:51:02Z
