1,UgxOYmRCoayOEJ2Z9Oh4AaABAg,Matilda Project's,"@Christopher Aikens when some of us women speak about women's rights, we don't mean equal, there is not much equal about us. This is why we should not let rich people hijack our causes, they ruin it. 
We are looking for justice and fair treatment. When i was a little girl my mom came home upset, so i asked what was wrong.  She said, not now and made a call to my uncle. His wife answered and said he wasn't home, my mom began crying. This is a grown women, widowed with 5 girls. She worked and saved that money, i never saw my mom cry before that. 
She told my aunt, i went to ford to get a car. They said, ""they wouldn't sell me a car till i came back with a man."" Then she said,  "" i have the money for the car, i don't understand."" It was at that point my mom took the money out and placed it on the table. Can you imagine the very ignorance. Happened in the mid seventies, but it still goes on today.",2021-08-04T04:17:05Z,0
2,UgxOYmRCoayOEJ2Z9Oh4AaABAg,Christopher Aikens,"I think your interview was fine for a novice. It's so great to be seeing someone defending Manson and questioning some aspects of the me too movement. Too many women are preaching for equal treatment and rights then acting like helpless naive victims with no free will, capability, or accountability. There are real cases of horrible abuse and mistreatment of women and now it seems women are being taken multiple steps back by some of these baseless accusations and their actions in general.",2021-08-04T03:18:11Z,2

4,UgxTT6VyL1QIUgP850l4AaABAg,Natalie Saad,"@John Case Brian was like a psycho therapist, during the worst time of my life, he never was pleasant, he was honest and blunt we never met face to face, I didnt know who he really was for a decade, never saw his face, we were not freinds, we were enemies, arguing religion, but if it hadn't been for him rejecting the wrongs that were happening to my family, being a pain in the neck invading my privacy, with the other two amigos. I'd probably not come out of that terrible situation my family was going through alive. My family was broken in the process, but we're all much better today. My children have a halfway decent relationship with their father and I have a new career. Once we all got some sleep things got a lot better. I left science and now work in human services. I really didn't expect to find him as Marylin Manson. Brian's speech is vulgar like that, but he's so normal. His two jerk buddies who helped him I love too. I only figured out the name of one of them. I'm still unraveling. Whiney, I'm gonna find you too. I miss them they were my dysfunctional family of strangers. I hate to see the allegations of abuse against him because they invaded my privacy and were like you know your husband's abusing you right? He didn't do half the things these ladies accuse Brian of. If Brian was so upset over the abuse I was going through and was so angry when children were abused and sooo opinionated about how kids should be raised, he didn't do it. I just can't buy the story. He helped me and we were religious opposites who agreed on nothing argued it out and were not on good terms.",2021-11-08T12:59:00Z,0

8,UgyfU2bXs31Bto3wob94AaABAg,Kitten,"No proof of his innocence ? Manson literally has many evidences of his innocence. His victims on the other hand, nothing. Well besides Ashley morgan, she stole fake abuse pics from Pinterest. Lmao. Nice proof.
Anyways I will never support someone who is thinking that rape jokes are funny. Yes, Evan Rachel wood said rape jokes are funny. Her own words. You can watch the video, it's everywhere. Weird behavior for a ""victim"" don't you think ? When she saw  that it didn't work, she asked her followers to call the police for her. She is insane. Even the FBI couldn't find anything on him. Don't believe the tabloïds; it's easy to say someone abused you without proof. They have been after him for years.
And It's easy to ruin someone's life. 

After the Amber Heard and Johnny Depp case I will never ""believe the victim first"". Sometimes there is more than fake allegations.",2021-10-13T12:00:04Z,3

10,UgzuoDqzoh-qo-CmVwp4AaABAg,catherine boubouka,"@The Lisa Lair honey oh lord the ""killing his victims pets"" part really set me off because i started reading his autobiography and in the first chapter where he talks about his childhood he also talks about how his neighbour who was like 17 years old and a male, sexually assaulted young manson and he thought it was a game until he realised what was happening was wrong and ran to his mom crying about it. so mansons mom went to the neighbors house and talked to his parents and the parents sent him away to a boarding school. few days later mansons beloved female dog, who has a name that i cant remember right now was found dead by poison. and he characteristically says that he knew the neighbour poisoned his dog because manson snitched on him and his sexual assault so the neighbor wanted revenge by killing mansons dog and young manson was traumatized by it. the accusers are literally pin pointing and analyzing everything that manson has ever said/done to make their stories sound more believable. its honestly not possible for him to have been abusive, it's one thing for someone to be hurt in a relationship or for him to be a womanizer, used doesnt equal abused and cheating/womanizing doesnt equal that either. those women are very much obviously lying, ashley morgan smithline writes on her lawsuit and in her people's magazine interview that she was with manson in Thanksgiving November  2010 and her mom even cooked dinner for them but a little research on her own and her moms facebook will show you that ashley was in thailand and headed to london that same period and her mom was at a winter resort in a random place and even posted saying she misses ashley but knows how much fun shes having in thailand. plus lindsay was with manson in november 2010! also evan rachel wood for fucks sake dressed up like hitler in 2007 when she was 20, and claimed she was underage and those photos were blackmail but she forgot to mention how she posted through her ""abbey road"" facebook page in 2014, photos from that day and was like ""7 years ago i was in this hotel room in vegas with all you of amazing people and my life has never been the same since"" obviously reminiscent of that great day. leslee lane who was also there, and evan's brother was there too who btw recently got accused of sexual assault, and leslee said that not only did not anyone force evan to dress as hitler, they partied all night and when the sun came up the next morning she REPAINTED her face cause the mustache was ruined. also, esme bianco talks about the ""i wanna kill you like they do in the movies"" music video in which she was allegedly abused throughout the shooting of it, in her lawsuit she claims another woman was there too but doesnt name her. that other woman was evan! evan shot parts of the music video with esme and manson and even took promotional pictures of him those days and posted about it on her facebook. why wouldn't evan mention THAT in her story if esme was actually abused? probably cause she wasnt. the only victim here is manson, he without doubt suffered a lot of emotional abuse by evan, a starfucker and a gold digger who always had men at the palm of hand.",2021-09-09T00:11:04Z,3

Ozzy Ozborne and Judas Priest went through way harder ordeals with the Christians than he ever did after he achieved the ""controversy"" he was begging for after a decade. 

The guy had 3 big records because Trent Reznor produced them and then nearly every original member of the band successfully sued him for millions because he ripped them off. He cried and complained about every band who ever took him on tour before he got anywhere from White Zombie, Danzig, Ozzy and many others because he was raised a spoiled, rich, whiny, bitch.

He knew it would work because he was a music writer, he wrote for the entertainment journal when he started the band!

The song Beautiful People is supposedly his critique on societal beauty standards and how superficial and ignorant they are. Well? Did a single one of the girls he dated since then fall outside of those standards?

62,UgyVuoHPZzZ0pi4xG7B4AaABAg,Shifting Mercury,"@Angela Shinner Well I guess it doesn’t shock me that you don’t believe her her either. Despite all the evidence that shows Depp was violent. Believe it or not, I’ve always been both a Depp and Manson fan. Prob more of a Manson fan than a Depp fan. But they fucked up. They both need help. I’m not going to be a hypocrite and only condemn the actions of people I never liked in the first place. One person I think who is being unfairly attacked is Cuomo. He acted inappropriate professionally  but it’s hardly sexual harassment. I analyze everything single case individually and try not to be swayed by popular opinion since that often doesn’t mean shit. The Amber Heard thing is one of the most ridiculous witch hunts I’ve ever witnessed. She had more evidence than most average domestic abuse victims and it was even proven in court that Johnny was lying but Johnny’s legal team masterfully leaked an edited recording along with other things in an attempt to control the narrative and manipulate the public using Johnny’s fame. As long as you don’t look too closely, they can make the public believe Amber is some evil witch from hell. It’s bizarre. I mean a makeup artist testified to covering up her injuries after one of their fights before the James Cordon show. Her sister witnessed the abuse. Her friends said she was often covered in bruises and were aware of the abuse. She texted her mom about the abuse long before all the came out. Yet it was just a hoax she came up with. According to what? What evidence? It doesn’t exist. It’s all smoke and mirrors. It’s a joke. So yeah I’m not falling for that bullshit. 

I hope Johnny gets help and takes responsibility for his actions. I hope Manson does too. I hope they can change. I don’t believe either started out like this. I think fame, money, power, addiction and mental health issues can be a toxic mix. It’s sad. A part of me feels sad for them even. I don’t know about Narilyn but I don’t believe Johnny is a monster. Manson did the same thing to many girls and it seems premeditated. I don’t think Johnny wanted to hurt Amber but Marilyn seems genuinely sadistic. I hope the victims can heal from this and in the long run, I hope both of them can overcome this and heal whatever part of themselves that is contributing to this behavior. Denial and blaming others won’t help. Enabling them and accusing the victims of fabricating stories won’t help them change. There may be a lot of fans blindly defending them but they should realize that there are fans out there who they have disappointed and aren’t going to just pull the wool over their eyes.",2021-05-22T08:24:34Z,0

64,UgyVuoHPZzZ0pi4xG7B4AaABAg,Shifting Mercury,"@Angela Shinner That happens all the time. People stay silent when they shouldn’t. Doesn’t mean it’s not true. To say you saw something means more than that you didn’t see something. It’s possible to not witness certain events but if you say you saw something and have no reason to lie about it, it says a lot more. That combined with the number of women making these claims says even more. What are the chances that all these women just decided to lie about this? False accusations are rare enough that the chances you would have multiple false allegations are pretty much slim to none. That’s just common sense. Plus what do they really get out of it? Most people would find it more trouble than it’s worth to falsely accuse someone and they’re usually mentally ill in some way or desperate for attention. Evan has a successful acting career. She doesn’t need to lie about abuse for attention. It just makes no sense, 

it’s actually very difficult to accuse a famous, powerful man of abuse because of all the people who attack you. All those women who accused Trump for instance had their lives ruined and nobody believed them either. Of course, it’s almost always fans who accuse them of lying which tells me that their just biased. It’s not the same as someone objectively gathering the facts and then doubting the claims based on inconsistencies.. Then there are those who tend to doubt a lot of claims of abuse made by women because of their personal beliefs or agenda. It’s not a coincidence that this YouTube made several videos doubting Amber Heard’s accusations either. It could also be for views. When well respected and popular celebrities and public figures get accused on these things, you tubers who defend them get a lot of views. When less well respected celebrities and public figures get accused, you tubers who attack them get more views.",2021-05-22T06:00:32Z,0

Now, I guess Manson is the most important part of his project ""Under the sky"" (judging from the way he presented him in all trailers). He was planning to release it in 2020 (Unfortunately it was delayed). It was probably almost finished in December. Therefore, I think Yoshiki finished it by now and apparently he is not releasing it because he doesn't want to remove MM from it.

It’s just impossible to me to even think that all these women are lying together to get money, like it’s a plan or something. You can say whatever you want about me, I never said she was too weak to have a clear understanding of her experience because it’s just not that. When you’re in relationships like this it doesn’t happen because you’re weak. It doesn’t make you weak. It’s manipulation.

238,UgyHuYOCgiyt9kGE09J4AaABAg,Alexandra Furnea,"I respect your opinion and your experience. In this situation though neither I, nor you, know the people involved personally, so as to be able to make statements about their guilt or innocence. While your experience of abuse is certainly horrible and it is brave of you to speak of it, projecting it onto other situations that seem similar but might in fact be different is not a healthy thing to do, neither is it a testament or proof of the allegations being true. Calling this woman a victim and saying she just doesn't know it yet is not empowering or feminist at all! What it says is that she is too weak to have a clear understanding of her experience, while you do, which is absurd since you were not directly involved with either of them. 

Where exactly am I making him look like the victim? I was simply stating a truth. No one here knows him, except for the person interviewed, who happens to be a woman other women dismiss because her truth doesn't coincide with their prejudice in a case they have no direct knowledge of. How is it feminist to believe unproven allegations, while dismissing other women's experiences? Let's wait for the authorities to investigate and come out with an official resolution. Plus, it would not be the first time celebs accuse each other of things for media attention, revenge, money or other reasons. I know people want to believe the narrative that they're just ordinary folks, but they're not. Look at how the police, FBI and courts were all over this, yet when a plain person goes to them for help, they are dismissed. Sadly it's people using allegations as weapons that creates disbelief and bias around victims, and celebs are no strangers to that. Look at Amber Heard and Johnny Depp.",2021-03-30T12:45:44Z,0

She didn’t even know much about Manson and his life and just wanted to ask people to question what they hear on media before blindly believing it. She did her research more and more and now she believes he is innocent. I’m not believing he’s innocent because “it’s impossible Manson i always innocent” or because “It took them too long to come forward” either. I myself have gone through an abusive situation where i didn’t even know I was abused because I was 13 I’m all about disgusting abusers getting what they deserve but this is the fishiest case ever. If you focus on what these women say and what they do when the cameras are off you’ll see what I’m saying. You’re just too scared to side with him cause you were abused before and you wanna side with people like you. But these people will just make it harder and harder for victims to stand up and be believed and trusted.

-sharing fake evidence found on Pinterest 
-contradiction in their own words

-hypocrisy by calling M a na*i for having na*i memorabilia while they themselves have many and have had a lot of photoshoots with n*zi context.

If you think there is nothing wrong in their stories would you explain how PTSD works that for them they can have it because of being whipped and still wear clothing with “whip me” written on them or do scenes in which they have to whip someone or claim he gave them PTSD but they still go to his shows, wear his merch, have his artwork in their house etc. years after parting ways with him?

244,Ugx08_5lC_lsznpB9qV4AaABAg,Maiara Calixto,"@Angela Shinner As a big fan of his music since I was ten in 2001 I don't truly believe this profiles to be non biased and I don't think his image had been smeared like you suggesting in over a decade, to be honest his career has not been even close to what it was when he represented a really antagonistic figure for the media to bash. I don't think the accusers got any fame/recognition for doing so, I don't think his image is that great anymore that would allow that and he has not been a big thing in the media for years. Money and connections can easily get someone free of consequences specially when you are not that controversial and antagonistic anymore and are well stablished even without being a big deal in so long. I won't blindly think he is innocent because I was such a big fan and still like his music. I've been in an abusive relationship were from the outside the guy looked like a great person while in our private life things were close to hell, I won't say ""why did she stayed?!"" ""what did she expected dating a guy like that?!"" because it's just a stupid thing and easy to do when you never faced shit like that. 

I do believe that actions need to have consequences, allegations need to be properly investigated, the way the victims exposed the situation might be because when you're dealing with money and public figures things can get pushed under the rug I don't know, personally I would have gone trough legal channels first and only released publicly after that but even so it's ludicrous to completely side with him because how people chose to come forward with their stories. It's pretty easy to get off a lot of stuff when you conveniently constructed through the years a shocking persona and can hide behind that, people are people and money, status, drug abuse surely can lead to a narcissistic abusive behaviour. Even before all that happened I saw him as really narcissistic and not as just being the persona, so many people had real problems with the same aspects of his personality while working with him and it since 2010 at least I've had problems with a lot of misogynistic and racist comments/jokes. 

Behind abusive relationships there's a lot happening, don't dismiss someone else's claim based on the public image because that's so superficial and can be faked to perfection when money and connections exist.",2021-05-12T04:29:07Z,1

To be honest, I'm not from america, so this is just theoretical knowlege, so you may be right. 

And yeah, she looks ""gothtic"" and pale here, but try to google her name and her photos without white makeup. You can even see this ""orange"" undertone in this interview if you look closely. She looks great but I guess she's not quite ""nazi approved"" type.

You guys are idiots. I can tell you first hand Marylin Manson is a racist because I’m Hispanic and he assumed I was middle eastern and called me a Arab terrorist when we met and refused to take a photo with me because I wasn’t white.

I have a friend like this, she actually thought she had celebrity friends on Facebook and was shocked when people told her they were fake. The interviewer sounds like a bitter, weak minded woman. Strong women don't victim shame other women. Johnny Depp situation is not the same. There is a ton of evidence against Amber Heard. EVIDENCE. She's the only female who's ever accused him of anything. The MULTIPLE women accusing Manson have nothing to gain. My father was an abuser, almost killed my brother in front of us. He was very charismatic and everyone loved him. It was disgusting. I know way too many men like this. JD and MM being friends means nothing. NO a 17 year old girl does not know what she's getting into. We are young and stupid at at that age. Clearly some females never move past the fan girl stage. I lived in LA for 25 years. I knew a lot of celebrities. I had friends who worked for them as well. Paula does not come across as a personal assistant. She's got so many holes in her ""timeline"", doesn't remember much. Personal assistants are very involved in the details of their celebrity bosses, the literally know everything, more than their partners many times. Funny how she says she rarely saw these women yet somehow feels she knows what went on. Disturbing. She's a victim and has no idea she was being groomed and he didn't end up wanting her. I believe she didn't see or receive any abuse but is clueless about the rest.

339,UgxMPFXhKEjtFQl-F9l4AaABAg,Leonardo Lodagin,"You say that it makes too much sense, but that is the exact point. I won't defend Manson but I will say that this is the exact type of reaction a false accuser would want. I'm a huge Manson fan, you know how much people that don't know anything about him, that could not name one single song of his, messaged me on instagram saying ""look what your friend did, I knew he was the type"". And I don't blame them because that's really easy to think when you don't know anything about him. And let's face the truth, the vast majority of people don't know shit about him if not what mainstream media kept saying about him since the start of his career.

Also, I won't question your claim to be a big fan, but if you followed him in its entirety, every single interview or apparition on tv, I feel you would have the opposite opinion. Because I have followed and watched every single bit that there is to watch about him and I have a very hard time beliving these accusations. Maybe he brainwashed me too, who knows, but I find hard to believe that a big fan first reaction is ""I knew it"", because that is not what his persona is like. Quite the opposite indeed, he always looks super polite and with a lot of good manners and education. If you are basing this opinion only on his stage persona than I understand, but why would you do that? He blew a guy on stage, just for shock and entertainment value so you see why that really does not work.",2021-08-04T18:22:30Z,0
340,UgyCuswy3PZ-ELy9Kh14AaABAg,Mikhail k,"@Aisha A Maybe I didn't put it right, but I wanted to support Marilyn Manson. I am 100% sure he has been slandered. It really pains me that anyone can accuse you of anything without providing proof, as Evan Rachel Wood did. I've been a fan of Brian for about 20 years now, the guy is clearly no fool and it's not the first time he's faced this kind of injustice. This whole story is killing me.  
I certainly understand the psychology of the victim when a woman endures beatings for years and doesn't walk away from an asshole. It answers the question ""why didn't you say anything before"". But the interesting thing is that even these victims do not keep quiet - at least there are witnesses, in the form of worried friends and relatives who see the depressed state and bruises. There are neighbours who hear scandals behind the wall and call the police. Maybe there are a couple of very close people she told about what's going on. If a man is a psychopath, he fucks up not just one woman, but all of them, and no matter how he hides it, some witnesses will turn up somewhere. In stories like this, there are always people who know or guess what's going on. So I don't believe that he fucked/raped/abused some people and not others. If it's in the habit, it doesn't change from partner to partner. I don't believe there is any proof she hasn't cried to some girlfriends and they didn't advise her to go to the police. until there is proof, fuck her with her statements.

Granted, there probably are a number of opportunists involved; but it's still sad to see women dismissing such serious claims by other women just because a guy's famous. Also, speaking of opportunists, if all Paula really wanted to do was show her support, she could have issued a statement and left it at that. Instead, she did an hour and a half long BS video trying to make it seem like she had to sit back and watch a grown man be manipulated by a bunch of girls half his age. Then she claims she doesn't want to be in the spotlight while at the same time giving this thirsty interview. Give me a break.",2021-03-25T20:44:08Z,5

It’s harmful for people who try to speak out about serious things like this to give a big platform for fan girls to disagree with it. Yes There’s a special place in hell for people who accuse someone of being this abusive and are lying but I just do not believe this is the case with Marylin. Without a doubt I believe those girls, and I’d like to add that it’s super convenient on Paulas part that she just wasn’t there most the time he had these relationships. He’s a rock star for Christ sake you’re not his personal assistant for all of this time and NOT witness certain fights that get out of hand or anything of the sort.

I’ve been friends with girls like Paula, and I’m sure she’s a chill person but she carries herself like she’s better than, the way she looks down on the girls he dated saying they wouldn’t be her choice in friends.

Look I get it 2020 was a shit show we’re still in the shit show, & if you listened to mansons music growing up you probably had shit to deal with then too. 
You can separate the man from the music ! You should !  This conversation has nothing to do with music or allegations of abuse & everything to do with character witness & minute interactions. So remove that too !!
Communication is still a good thing, community, relationships, equality. 
If your an abusive person, if you’ve been told so in the past, if you’d quick to anger, if you say aggressive stuff, if that’s you !!
It doesn’t make you less worthy as a person, it means someone in life shit on you & you’ve had to fight for survival at some point. If you acknowledge that if you work on that, it’s no longer as issue especially if you get help for it. 
There’s a female version of you out there, there’s are kids who would love a home, if you look for it, you will find it. 
Manson is getting called out & some people are reflecting wrongly, I don’t have money power status, how am I as someone his age or someone that looks up to Manson supposed to compare. You don’t !!!! You don’t because there’s no comparison. If you say to a woman I think we share a lot in common, I think your smart, I think your beautiful, I would like to get to know you, that will never ever be construed as anything negative unless you do it while holding her puppy hostage as leverage to a conversation. 
We need to put a stop to this bull shit & encourage people, men especially to engage with people, not just online, but in the real post covid world.

Let’s imagine abuse was too complicated and we have ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA what basic human psychology and logic is. It’s not just about the bedroom. She says he was anti semitic and racist and sexist and homophobic around everyone and he abused everyone who didn’t cooperate with his racist/anti semitic/etc. actions. So it wasn’t just in the bedroom. AND it’s not complicated to know someone is a bad person for doing all of those and also threatening your life and your parents life 💀 you don’t go around saying wholesome things about these people like “he had a hand in raising me...I will always love that guy... he always supported me and believed in my abilities...

Dita von Teese was with him for 8 years and said he never saw that behavior from him. They are even still friends after years. Even queen of metoo Rose McGowan said he was never like that to her and said amazing things about him in her book. If there was any abusive behavior she would’ve recognized it during a 4 year long relationship. Leslee Lane was around them and was even friends with ERW and was living with them when they were together and now she’s the one exposing those pictures of ERW in Hi*ler outfit and makeup proudly posing in them. SHE WAS THERE ALL THE TIME. His ex band mates support him (except that one guitarist who wasn’t even a part of their band for more than a few months) Rob Holiday was his bassist exactly when they were dating (2007-2009) he supports him and says he saw everything and calls the accusers Hollywood leeches :) I’m missing out a lot of people like Erica Summers and negini but I’m sure if you want you can look into them yourself. Don’t side with liars babe. People like them and Amber Heard just make real victims look bad. Do more research.

His disturbing behavior goes beyond his abuse towards his former partners or  ""friends"" he has already spoken many times himself about dangerous behaviors and thoughts and actions. If you are a fan then you know he has admitted to wanting to murder a band mate by burning her home down, stalking a woman for months sending death threats. He made a video with Evans that was depicting the movie lolita where a man in his 30s was obsessed with a 12 year old girl. He made a song and video about killing his former partner. The list goes on this is public knowledge and idk how anyone could support it. It's highly disturbing to think he has been that person for a long time and it is shrugged off as a ""rock star persona""",2021-08-31T13:00:44Z,1

436,Ugz7l2fUGhkPgFKu3rB4AaABAg,Angela Shinner,"@bri well I’m sorry but Paula is not the only one defending him. You need to do more research cause I don’t think if you’ve done any. Dita von Teese was with him for 8 years and said she never saw that behavior from him. They are even still friends after years. Even queen of metoo Rose McGowan said he was never like that to her and said amazing things about him in her book. If there was any abusive behavior she would’ve recognized it during a 4 year long relationship. Leslee Lane was around them and was even friends with ERW and was living with them when they were together and now she’s the one exposing those pictures of ERW in Hi*ler outfit and makeup proudly posing in them. SHE WAS THERE ALL THE TIME. His ex band mates support him (except that one guitarist who wasn’t even a part of their band for more than a few months) Rob Holiday was his bassist exactly when they were dating (2007-2009) he supports him and says he saw everything and calls the accusers Hollywood leeches :) ERW said MM is racist all the time and whoever doesn’t support his comments will be left out and abused. But Norman Reeds who has been a friend of his said he was never like that and he would never tolerate such behavior around him. Even JD who everyone at this point knows is a genuinely nice loving person has been very close friends with Manson for more than 20 years now. Manson is the godfather of his only daughter. I’m missing out a lot of people like Erica Summers and negini but I’m sure if you want you can look into them yourself. If media doesn’t show this side of the story it doesn’t mean these people don’t exist. They don’t show this side because it doesn’t sell. People don’t wanna believe a group of women are liars and this man who’s been called America’s boogeyman for years is innocent. Despite the people who are siding with ERW, MM supporters are not related at all and are sharing their own stories with evidence. They are the real brave ones in a time like this when the popular opinion is to side with the “victims” and his supporters will be sent death threats and horrible pictures and threats and hate speech for not standing with the “victims”. Don’t side with liars dear. People like them and Amber Heard just make real victims look bad. Do more research or don’t involve yourself at all if you know you don’t know enough. So many actual victims who’ve done their research are siding with MM in this.",2021-03-24T13:45:32Z,1

She collects antiques, is fascinated/inspired by Weimar Germany. She’s also a burlesque dancer. I know other people can like these things, and I’m not being critical, friends share interests. it’s just interesting how similar she and Dita are down to their entire aesthetic.

Leslee Lane who used to live with her and him for some time and partied with them shared those pictures. They are her own copyrighted pictures. Check out her account Leslee_lane on instagram. 
Also well I know abuse is complex. But is being a racist sexist anti semitic person is complex too? Okay she decided to stay on his side because of the ""abuse"" at the time. But why did she continue to not see these simple things years after getting out of there? She sometimes hints that she KNEW she was getting abused as I said. She said she wanted to get out of there she didn't wanna stay on his side. She says she couldn't ao she started doing self harm. So how does that work?!?!

497,Ugz_OcIb5k9ArZsVN354AaABAg,Juanita On the go,"@Angela Shinner The nazi thing sounds very contradictory indeed. I´ll check on that. 

The other stuff...abused people don´t always see clearly what´s happening to them, they might unconsciously rebel against some sort of abuse/oppresion in some ways and at the same time feel they love (and are properly loved by) the abuser and want to remain by their side. That´s actually very common. So that kind of contradictory feelings, actions and even retrospective analysis about abusive situations is not something that indisputably screams ""LIE""...it´s more something that could be reflecting how complex abusive relationships can be/are.

By the way, I don´t think ERW is telling the truth or lying, I don´t have a definitive conclusion about her case, precisely because I don´t think that at this point there´s enough evidence to support either her or MM side. My point about lack of objectivity is that I see comments that apply some criteria in favor of the acused but not the same criteria in favour of the alleged victim.",2021-03-24T20:50:57Z,0
498,Ugz_OcIb5k9ArZsVN354AaABAg,Angela Shinner,"@Juanita On the go maybe you just don’t know something here huh? Look into her story. 
ERW says she was abused everyday and sometimes says she wanted to get out of the abusive relationship but she couldn’t cause she was trapped and she would do self harm to stop her abuser temporarily(meaning she knew she was being abused at the time and must’ve felt great after finally getting out of there and never looking back ever again.) She says she was suffering everyday and he would tie her up and threatened the life of herself and her family and she would be always left out for having Jewish relations and MM would always talk in a racist sexist anti-jew way around her and everyone. Yet she went on for 10 years talking such WHOLESOME things about him like he had a hand in raising me and he always believed in my abilities and supported me and I'm always gonna love him etc.! She says it took her 10 years to realize what he had done to her. So gurl did u know you were being abused or not cause you used to do self harm to stop the “abuse”!?!? She also pointed out Manson's tattoos to put him under a bad light which was such a lazy attempt cause we and even she knows that collecting nazi memorabilia and being fascinated by the art concept doesn’t mean you support the idea of Nazism if that was true she’s be in real trouble too here cause she has her own collection and in a picture she is posing with one of her OWN n*zi knives and dressed and did makeup as Hi*ler and posed for pictures proudly. Yet she says seeing the Swas**kas that Manson drew on her bedside traumatized her 😂 she’s so full of sht. Sorry I’d really love to support victims here. But I don’t see it the more I look into it. Even before Paula’s interview I already believed M is innocent and a lot of people who were in his circle in those days are defending him now “Leslee Lane, Rob Holiday, negini etc.” so this interview is not that groundbreaking for me.

Also as far as we are investigating there has been so much more contradictory evidence against those women than anything against MM.

Pain is the best inspiration, and the Manson/Depp bondship was inevitable because both shared similar mindsets not just in their emotional state but their creative directions. They both wanted release while simply coexisting with their creative endeavors, and eventually someone gets their release and becomes a big motivator in the maelstrom. I do not feel that either have ever been satisfied, however, and they will continue this until one passes. They are best buds in an honest and real sense, and having celebrities have that same human connection is a perfect beacon for understanding.

528,UgxoyeQvWGEpvRqJcxt4AaABAg,RandomSauce,"@M T fair enough. Yet, I am a psychologist and what you may call a ""behavioral profiler"" - I haven't dug enough in this case, that's for sure. But there's a few kinds of evidence we take in such cases: circumstantial (which are behavioral patterns, whereabouts, cell phone pings, photographs, video footage, etc; and physical evidence - blood, seamen, DNA, medical documents of certain events, fingerprints, weapons, etc) and direct evidence (personal statements of witnesses/victims of the event, or confession of the perp). Usually, circumstantial evidence are rarely enough to convict a person of a crime, which is why police works hard on getting a confession or at least some incredibly strong witness statements. Direct evidence should also be backed up by circumstantial evidence, as well as by motive, opportunity and method. This is why, the only people who can be sure beyond reasonable doubt, what had happened in this case, are Manson, his accusing victims, and the direct witnesses of the claimed events. You, me, Paula, the lady who made the video, and everyone else is reaching and speculating on some really stretching grounds. So this is why I'm not speaking about myself only, but about everyone - everyone, who is outside the circle of the few people, who took actual part in those alleged events. Good news for Manson is that there's nothing here, but ""he said/she said"" - so far, I believe no one went to report an event right after it happened, and medically documented it; there's no medical or psychological assessment, following directly an event; no direct witness, no rape kit, no nothing... this is going to be a case of ""my word against yours"" and a lot of behavioral circumstances and character assessments, a lot of logic and reasoning, which is good on one side - for him, and not very good if the alleged victims are actually telling the truth. Which we may never really know, because of the same reasons.",2021-03-24T08:31:11Z,0
529,UgxoyeQvWGEpvRqJcxt4AaABAg,M T,"@RandomSauce When you say nobody can be certain, I think you should speak for yourself. There are a number of people who can be fairly certain.

There are also researches, who I personally place a lot of trust in, if they are honest, deductive and willing to go the distance until the full puzzle is there. We have somebody here who is not a blogger, but an analyst with outstanding brains. If you value your opinion as the final one, speak for yourself.",2021-03-22T19:52:09Z,0
530,UgxoyeQvWGEpvRqJcxt4AaABAg,RandomSauce,"@Colonel Kurtz again, I'm not strictly ""anti-Manson and pro-JD"". Even as much as in JD's case I have a much clearer basis where I can draw the conclusion of his innocence, and that being the audio tapes, the recorded depositions by both sides, their body language, their state of mind, court documents, etc - not anything anyone has said so far... Even though, I'm not completely 100% sure that he never did anything - I want to, but I can't be - that is up to a court to decide. As I said previously, I want to keep my mind objective and opened, and not jump on any wagon, which I suggest is what everyone does. We haven't been there, we don't know who did what under what circumstances, and we shouldn't be quick to judge - that's all. There might be more to any story, that we shouldn't be quick to dismiss, once it comes out. In fact, just because we have all of this mountain of evidence in JD's favor and we don't have that in Manson's favor, it's easy to be seen as if the pro-JD people are taking the opposite side in Manson's case. But fact is one doesn't have the same amount of evidence in order to change the 50/50 chance position into a 99% or 100% position. So, yes, it may seem like pro-JD are anti-Manson, but it's actually not really as it would seem. 

Again, personally, I am supportive of Manson up to the moment that one should be considered innocent until proven guilty in a court of law and that any ""trial by media"", with all the consequences that follow it, is already a miscarriage of justice. It actually shows that people haven't evolved much beyond the stage, where the angry villagers' mob took their torches and farming gear, and went to the ""monster's"" house to seek immediate punishment, instead of justice. We live in the 21st century, and that's far beyond the 16th, but alas, our minds (on a general scale) seem to be stuck in the dark ages.

The reason why I'm asking the two cases to be kept separate, is that people are already drawing links between Manson and JD, and in one case one part are saying ""oh, one is innocent, so the other must be innocent as well""; and on the other ""oh, one seems guilty AF, so the other must be as well"". That can be used as a weapon in a court of law. What if they're both innocent, or both guilty, but one pulls the other in the counter direction? Or worse: what if one is innocent and the other is guilty, and the innocent pulls the guilty party into freedom; or the guilty party pulls the innocent party under the water? Could you live with the consequences of that? I couldn't. Knowing that a monster walks free or that an innocent man gets locked up - that's going to take a toll on my conscience.

I've seen so far one other video which covered the opposite POV, but where the presenter was obviously biased, and tried really hard to convince his public that Manson is a guilty man, and I said almost the exact same thing in a comment under it. I haven't seen your other videos on the subject, but I will do that, as you peaked my interest. I was just stating a completely non-biased opinion and trying to make an objective point, so I would appreciate if you don't twist my words and don't place me in any ""camp"" or ""wagon"". My comments were much more general and never towards you as a presenter, so I don't get why the defensiveness - my initial one was based upon what Ms Paula (forgot her name) said, which parts of it could and should or shouldn't be taken under consideration, and why. Much appreciated that you actually took the time to read and respond to all I wrote - sorry for the length of it.",2021-03-22T09:30:42Z,0

So that's what I'm trying to do. I do feel I've examined both sides in great detail--I originally assumed he was guilty but changed my mind after researching it. As for JD, my agenda is truth. In fact, I think it's the kind of bias and timidity that people are showing regarding Manson that is part of the problem. It's interesting to me how many JD supporters were so quick to jump on the anti-Manson train when they know how a group of scheming friends and a biased media can destroy an innocent man...Thanks again for your thoughtful comments, though.

578,UgxqimIBoy8QALOdCRl4AaABAg,Angela Shinner,I like to know her take on that too. But I’m pretty sure he was never racist. Many times in the 90s he was accused of racism too for covering songs like “Rock n Roll Ni**er” and having a song called “great big white world” or the song “the irresponsible hate anthem” in the lyrics it says “everybody’s someone else’s ni**er” the first case he many times explained that the song has nothing to do with race and it’s about being the odd one out in the society and yet standing up for yourself despite people putting you down. The second one he explained in many interviews including the one in Howard Stern show in 1999 (I have it on my channel hehe) he explained it’s literally just about drugs lol. The third one again like the first song goes back to the original meaning of “the N word” I think you could guess yourself that the meaning is the different levels of social statuses in every society. He is very intelligent and so much deeper than just mentioning these words to offend someone’s race. He’s been accused of racism soo many times and has always proven people are wrong. Also he’s worked with so many people from other races. Right now ASAP Ferg still follows him and has all four posts with MM in them up 🖤🥀,2021-03-22T18:35:53Z,0

There are literally pictures of ERW hanging out with Amber Turd and she didn’t just support her for being bisexual. She said AT is an example of how bisexual women get more sexually abused than others. Despite other ex AT supporters she never said how sorry she is for getting manipulated by AT’s lies and still only a few months ago reposted a post from an AT fanpage. Is her own picture but she doesn’t mind being on an abuser’s fanpage at all apparently. 
These stuff you say are literally the bs sewn together by Looney Laura dear 💀😂the type of “proof” she gives ( screenshots) is the same type Annie uses to prove she’s ever been noticed by MM despite not ever having even met him. again I’ve never seen any of the stuff you are saying rn in their own context and the way you mentioned those old messages from discord didn’t look like you either knew or wanted the reader to know Leslee was being sarcastic and you can believe it or not I’ve seen those messages myself and Leslee was just mad that Lindsay wanted the wedding dress pictures and when Leslee sent them she didn’t respond to them or like them and Leslee felt like she is upset over sth.

Ah yes, everyone who believes the victims must be ERW and follows Larura. 🙄
1. There is nothing to support ERW is friends with AH unless I missed something. She defended her bisexuality on Twitter. The victims who spoke out gained nothing except perhaps harassment from fans. They haven’t received money, they risked their careers and reputation, and if there’s a FBI investigation there would be criminal consequences for lying. Manson’s own actions are sketch, he publicly called Lindsay a pig, followed her hate accounts, and made a video mocking her. 
There’s people too afraid to make a public statement because they see what happens if you do., you’re harassed and threatened by fans. 
As an ex fan I know firsthand the lengths some fans will go to defend him.  Someone who claims to be an ex friend of Annie and spoke out against her said the exchange between ERW and Annie was fiction. No idea if that’s true. 

2. I quoted Leslee Lane verbatim from the discord while she was discussing Manson, there’s nothing to twist. Lindsay’s wedding dress in those quotes/context makes zero sense and yes, she was being sarcastic using the word torture while referring to Evan. Leslee also claimed to have a threesome with Evan and Manson. That that would be up to her the explain why she would say all that. It’s fair to question the motives of someone who moderated and obsessively talked about Manson in a discord, posts Manson pics almost daily on their social, and helped Lindsay “shut up” Evan. 
Anyway, it’s clear we’re not going to convince each other continuing this so last response. ✌️",2021-03-25T08:25:38Z,1
649,UgxgTzkAtLrC3dug6IN4AaABAg,Angela Shinner,"@eziligede 
1- it’s funny that you think women wouldn’t lie to get what they want after what happened with Amber Heard lmao it’s not like AH was an alien and all other women are these pure innocent beings. AH was just a famous example. So many other women have done this to get what they want whatever it is. It’s interesting that ERW is friends with AH too and the other accusers all are AH supporters and are friends 
I don’t care his accusations go back to what time as long as they are al connected with the same writing pattern all containing triggering words to get the attention of people with no proof. Actually the accusations go back to even six months ago if u knew Annie Jana Abrams’s accusations. But I think since she got exposed too hard nobody cares about her anymore. At least she said before that she had a fishy zoom meeting with ERW and Illma and if sht goes down for her too much she will hopefully release it. Idk she’s a psycho. But the funniest excuse to claim MM is nt innocent is to bring up ERW and Esme testifying against the congress. 

2- It’s weird how you’ve pulled these messages out of context and expect me to take them seriously without knowing their back story. The fact that you said posting MM pictures means someone is obsessed and it somehow supposed to make her lose credit is even cuter. I’ve seen some of these messages you’ve mentioned here myself that were pulled horribly out of context and twisted to match the narrative. She was even just talking about Lindsay’s wedding dress pictures that Leslee wondered if she liked or not or that “tortured” word was in italic bruh. This is gross I feel like I’m chatting with ERW herself rn lmao. You took those words grossly out of context. Stop lying my dear and unfollow that stupid Looney Laura. These exact things you’re saying here are being used against her for a lawsuit that she is actually winning and the police has told her there is nothing for her to worry about. Anyways.

Evan and Esme testified before congress, you don’t think there would be serious implications, at least to their work and reputations, if it turned out they’re lying? These aren’t the first allegations, he’s been accused of harassment as far back as 2013. 
Leslee’s words were not twisted, she said them and should at least own it. If that’s what she’s claiming to backpedal that would be a lie. Judging by her IG profile she seems pretty obsessed with Manson. How do you twist these words that were directly taken from the discord and witnessed by many?

Who really IS risking anything are the people who are supporting him because they are not going by the popular opinion. People like Dita and Norman and Leslee who received so much hate and Leslee would gain nothing out of this except some lawsuits from Illma Gore ERW's girlfriend who is a con artist herself lol. I'm friends with Leslee and her words got horribly twisted in that discord. She never said those things in a serious manner. They were italic being sarcastic captioning one of ERW's pictures. I've been in an instagram group with Leslee for 2 years now and all those years she's been just giving us info about that ERW is a liar. ofc they'll put her under a bad light when she's exposing them so hard. Even if she's changed sides in some type of way lol she' still at least giving hard evidence that ERW is a hypocrite with her Jewish backgroud bs. She has nothing to gain from this.

708,UgzUl32mAPCWO5-3tkN4AaABAg,CamIam,"@Lara Will so these ladies should understand all the intricacies of trauma while the accusers can't be expected to understand simple concepts like ""no means no"" and ""N*zis and p*dos aren't funny to most people."" What about ERW saying, while laughing, that she had been r*ped and could laugh at a r*pe joke? Should she not understand that she doesn't speak for everyone? As for the age difference, I can say that the relationship was ill advised, but our personal opinions aren't, and shouldn't be, the law. You don't ever become all knowing. At what point are you responsible for your own mistakes? ""Possible manipulation and power difference"" is vague and manipulative language. Possible doesn't mean certain. Manipulation doesn't mean force and doesn't necessarily mean coercion. We don't know that she was manipulated. Even if she was, why is it relevant outside of her personal life? Power difference doesn't necessarily mean one overpowered or had authority over the other. Being older, having more money, and having more notoriety could all be possible power difference. Wanting to please someone because you're infatuated with them is your own responsibility. If they ask you to do something immoral, it's your responsibility to say no. No, a swastika does not interact with you. The people who see you wear it do, and there are personal feelings involved for them. Evan Rachel Wood wore one.

I think it’s hard to be on his level of fame and find someone who is genuine about their feelings. ERW said it herself in an interview that she was never in love with him and just wanted to explore her edgy side 😒 but he said in interviews at the time that he went from a household in which he had to fight for his own lifestyle and sleeping on the couch in his own house to someone who understood him and related and sympathized with him.

You should've been more selective when it came to women but it's easier to blame others for your failures...that won't help you improve. When the surface is all you look for, that is what you'll get.

What is obvious is a pattern of self-destructive behavior and inflicting that misery on others. From everything I read he is a addict that needs to sober up. He may even OD as he is getting older. His body will eventually give out from 30 yrs or so of drugs and drinking. Look @ what is happening with the governor of NY. Andrew Cuomo, the accusations aren't have as bad as with MM.

There are posts on their own accounts from many years ago (2012 2013) partying with each other and mentioning each other. Esme bianco and ERW and Ashley Walters knew each other for sure. Esme would even go to MM's concerts with Ashley years after they both apparently got traumatized. These posts are still on smashley walter's instagram account. Follow @marilynmansondefensers and @mansonhashumanrightstoo on instagram to follow these stories. 
Also we know that months and weeks before the allegations Illma Gore, ERW's girlfriend who is a con artists, tracked down all the women MM had ever interacted with and asked them to contact her introducing herself as someone who works for the Phoenix Act with ERW. She has a reputation of faking stories to get what she wants under the name of a human activist. You can again see all these in the accounts I mentioned.

Luckily, I had a few Vicodin on me from some recent dental work I had done. I was the only one who got a photo with him that night and an invitation to hang out on his bus! That same night, I wanted him to sign my copy of Long Hard Road Out of Hell, so he asked me what my name was for the inscription. When I told him, he signed it, “For the C word”... 🤣

Once again, he was in typical Manson form upon our second meeting and dared my husband to lick one of his male assistants directly across the face. Of course, he did it because who could refuse such a hilarious request by Marilyn Manson? So, yes... He is super funny in person and he treats his fans very well. I really hope you get the chance to meet him one day! Hopefully this virus won’t put an end to fans meeting their favorite artists forever.😞",2021-03-19T23:39:06Z,9

Leslee Lane is mentioned on this channel before. She was living with her boyfriend and MM and ERW when they were dating for a long time and now is exposing her and siding with M. Rob Holiday is his bassist from 2008-2010 the time ERW claims the abuse happened and now he calls the accusers Hollywood leeches. The only ex band member I’ve seen who said “everything the accusers say about him is right” is one horrible guitarist who didn’t even play with him for more than a few months and then got kicked out ofc.

809,UgzLyuKcCzCxRB-hv9N4AaABAg,CamIam,"@Jay A Errington another example of love bombing is what cult recruiters do. They shower potential members with positive attention. They also look for a person's vulnerability while they do this. Loss of a loved one, illness, financial struggles, addiction, failed relationships etc.. They look for people who need help in order to negotiate dependency. All the sympathy and help that was initially offered is turned against them. For instance, the person with the the loss of a loved one may initially be comforted by the concept of Heaven, then coerced by the concept of Hell. A person with these other problems may be enticed into believing they can experience a miracle to fix it all, then be told they haven't sacrificed enough to get their miracle. Cult leaders have NPD. When a narcissist starts a relationship, they basically use cult recruiting tactics.",2021-03-21T07:13:20Z,1

I know when I've met people we have joked that we are both on our best behaviour because we want that person to like you... Its like a job interview.. And after a while people become their normal every day selves it usually lasts for a few months and this us what I called the honeymoon period however... I see where they can use this normal behaviour and turn it round and call it ""love bombing"" however... It also seems that it was the women who did the running... Esme messaging and happily jumping on a plane and ERW chasing the bus and manson... Gabrielle time wise doesn't seem to have spent much time with him at all and the text messages show manson was trying to avoid her... So within a few weeks she was trying to manipulate him through suicide  because he split with her?

811,UgzLyuKcCzCxRB-hv9N4AaABAg,Olivia Layla,"No, love bombing is a lot different from the 'honeymoon period' of a relationship. It's something typically narcissists and emotionally manipulative/abusive people do to reel the other person in. I can't speak much on the MM case but regarding amber heard and Johnny Depp (which is also covered on this channel), amber love bombed him by saying she'd 'watched all Johnny's films' for example, when this was in fact one of many blatant lies.

 Amber basically showered Johnny with over the top gestures of love and affection to reel Johnny in, but when people love bomb, it's always an act, it's not a real portrayal of how they are, it's what they're trying to make you believe they are like; then once you're with the person who love bombed you, and their true colours start to show, you often feel trapped in a relationship with them because you were so pulled in and attracted to the love bombing act they pulled when the relationship began. 

It's different from the honeymoon period because normal people who aren't emotionally abusive typically don't overshower someone they've just began a relationship with, with endless love & affection. But narcissists like Amber and apparently ERW and the rest of MM's accusers will do really subtle things that are love bombing to reel someone in and gain power over them. These people who love bomb convey a superficial version of themselves to their new partner, a version that is all their partner's wants in a significant other to reel them in, when their real personalities are much different from that.",2021-03-19T22:48:48Z,2

Almost from the start my opinion was that you just can't be under influence of drugs, alcohol and whatever and also hide that kind of behavior. It bleeds through despite how good an actor or manipulator you are. And here we have someone who's seen him probably at his worst and his best over many years and still she didn't notice any type of behavior he's been accused of. 
I was mostly referring to the comments I've read on how she didn't remember ERW, G, or Dita so the question was how much of a witness to his behavior she really is. If an event stood out for something she would have remembered. It it had been traumatic she probably would have had trouble forgetting. But for me, she said it all at the beginning when she mentioned how she reported her own father. It's something I've commented often under other videos- if all of these accusations are true, and some events happened with other people around- why hasn't anyone else come out to confirm? Although, I'm also of the opinion that some people would have gone to the police on the spot or done something to stop the abusive situation. It's statistically impossible that he was surrounded by so many cold/psychotic people all the time and no one cared to help these women. But then I could just go on and on...",2021-03-20T18:08:28Z,0

We already have 2 people who have been with Manson  long enough to have info on him. And it's not looking like he did anything as of right now, based on their accounts. So its still too early to decide if he truly is guilty of any thing. We'll have to see if more evidence surfaces. In the meantime. We shouldn't blindly assume There is a guilty party until there actually is a guilty party. See this is the issue with a lot of stuff that goes on on Twitter. False accusations run wild on the sight. Its gotten to the point where people need receipts to show something that has yet to be proven true or false, otherwise I r demonized and the accuser is automatically believed.

Nature and nuture and just her life experiences of being a stripper may have continued to hardened her - especially against men.  Plus she takes tons of drugs and alcohol that may have impacted her mind throughout the years.

He is long term friends with JD and is godfather to his daughter. He probably would have been a very believable witness against AH.   There is a humongous and overarching revenge motive as well - AH wants to dig the knife in a little deeper to destroy eveything connected to JD or anyone supporting him.

949,Ugza-pZrOnISZT06D554AaABAg,Angela Shinner,@Pancake boi yeah ofc. But the problem isn’t that. It’s that I’m from a country sooo far away and foreign music and bands and artists aren’t allowed here 🤦🏻‍♀️😭 so there goes my chance,2021-04-15T17:00:48Z,1

960,UgxNdHpjHKE31oJPIh94AaABAg,Lourdes Skidgel,"I met Manson in 1994 in Miami after a meet & greet at a record store called Specs. My friends and I invited them to come with us to the Dairy Queen where we worked, with the offer of free ice cream. In our excitement we had forgotten that they closed early that day. So we just hung out in front of the DQ, loitering and smoking cigarettes. We had no drugs, no alcohol, not even free ice cream! But they (he and Twiggy) were so cool and nice and never made us feel like the asses that we were 😊 I wonder if he remembers that. If he does, he probably remembers it as the most boring and disappointing night of his life as a Rockstar! Hehe 😊 After that, we followed them around the Florida club circuit for a while. They had my friend, Mauricio, walk around the stage wearing a fluffy pink top hat before one of their sets.",2021-05-18T21:55:55Z,2
