62,Ugyde-wRn-NIFPV1XUN4AaABAg,Simon Barré-Brisebois,"@Stevie J Raw Thank you for your great words. It is disgusting how Hollywood uses Cancel attacks like this toward Johnny Depp or toward anybody. Many of their cancel attacks are based on hear say without any factual or visual proofs. Only the words of people who gossip on others through social media, at the expense of people who try to defend themselves but are treated as liars. 

Though there are nasty people in the showbiz culture — which I can attest for as I have been extra on a show set and have studied in film school and seen there rotten individuals among the aspiring filmmaker students and certain teachers we had — I have noticed how the massive majority of celebrities who embarked in these cancel culture were celebs with problematic history (diva behaviours off and on-set, power struggles, catfights, poor behaviour toward fans and in public, etc.) It wasn't until Asia Argento got exposed for her rotten behaviour that people could finally criticize those witch hunts Hollywood was doing on Johnny Depp and others and public protests could be heard over those movements. 

Then again regarding Asia Argento, I was not surprised at all by what happened with her. Hell, I expected her to be unmasked because her family has always had a controversial and disturbing history within their professional and personal lives. Anybody interested in this family should read Alan Jones's book ""Dario Argento: The Man The Myths and The Magic"" (ISBN: 978-1903254851). It reveals many details about each member of the family. Including some very shocking matters and behaviours that have stained their careers and reputations as they have let the toxicity of their personal lives poison their work. A real shame because so many figures like Tarantino, David Bowie, Clive Barker, and Hideo Kojima have been influenced by them. In the end, the Argento clan is the definitive example of talented artists (when they do their work seriously), but very rotten, obnoxious, and narcissistic human beings. Which the special features of Dario Argento's films reveal about him and his family. Including Asia Argento's film Incompresa which displays the family climate she has always lived in and inherited herself. Where everyone in the family behaves like spoiled rotten and immature brats who never swallowed bricks in their lives, cause mayhems on others and when caught, they refuse to recognise their share of the blames. And if they befriend people/fans it is if they can get something out of them (sycophantic compliments, flatteries, etc.) or if you have a big of a name, it is to profit out of it. And when they are tired of you, they toss you out. Emerson, of the group Emerson, Lake and Palmer, worked on the soundtrack of Dario Argento's Inferno and said in Alan Jones's book that he was so disheartened by Dario's behaviour he said he'd never work with the man again. Again Alan Jones, who is a very close friend of the family and a collaborator on some of Dario's films, doesn't deny their toxicity, admits he saw them do terrible stuff and explained that were he to reveal them all, he could lose their friendship and support. And with the stuff he reveals about them, some of which very documented in the Italian Press, I am amazed that people still find time to praise/befriend them. Again people should read Jones's book. The ISBN is 978-1903254851. It contains important facts that I wish the USA press had known about her family. Had they done, then they, Rose McGowan and her witch hunt clique, would have known more about Asia's history, alongside her family's. And now she is a pariah worldwide, only relevant in Italy and in France where people still suck up to her. Though she knows she has lost countless opportunities with Movie companies and artists in North America/worldwide, now that people know who she is. The definition of hypocrisy. Like so many of these figures behind the MeToo and TimesUp Movements. Movements who were biased the moment they were made as they are led and made by a bunch of competitive and toxic divas/actors/actresses/comedians/press critics/musicians who are not necessarily good artists, but good at promoting themselves, and who use rag culture and social medias to gossip/attack/slander others without due process.

As for Daniel Radcliffe, his behaviour toward Johnny did greats stains toward him. And the way Daniel played Judas on J K Rowling because she denounced the extremist culture certain LGBT activists have been spreading around through ideologies which hurt the voices of trans, gays, lesbians, bisexuals, and women is infuriating. And his condescending and chauvinistic speech toward Jo angered so much the public that many trans men and trans women have risen up to denounce what those extremists are doing toward their community and toward LGB and women. I even remember when the UN did an ask Daniel Radcliffe hashtag on Twitter and how it turned into a big fiasco as LGB, trans and women were booing and denouncing Dan's behaviour toward Jo and Johnny Depp. And outside of Twitter, people are just angry and disgusted by the various Harry Potter actors who attacked Jo, finding their behaviour worthy of Judas as she gave them their careers and names. Then again, several of these actors resent the Harry Potter roles because it typecasted them and they have trouble getting roles. Many of them were among those who attacked Johnny Depp as well.
And this is why the Johnny Depp fandom has been the first to defend Jo back in June. Because they knew that the attacks she got came from people who resented her support for Johnny Depp.

In the end, it is difficult time periods like these that make you realise who people really are and what are their principles. And of what I have seen, there are loads of artists from Hollywood and the comic book/video game/music industries whose stuff I do not want to see.

Thank you for taking the time to read my message.

Have a nice week Sincerely, Simon.",2020-10-21T17:34:27Z,2
