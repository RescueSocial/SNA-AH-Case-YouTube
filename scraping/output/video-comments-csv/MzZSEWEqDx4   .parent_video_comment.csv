0,UgyhgyI8udh7XnIkKMh4AaABAg,"Why say this now. She has been filming already and tabloids have picked it up. So why make this statement now.  Maybe to divert attention from Johnny’s huge win against ACLU to get all the evidence She NEVER donated her settlement!   1.8+ million petition and YouTubers. This goes way beyond Depp Fans. 
People have been fired for decades-old tweets.

She admits in her own recording that she made that she:
-instigates physical fights,
-can't promise she wont do it again,
-gets enraged when he runs away and won't stay and fight

NO Its not! so many different people want this to fail so hard because they kept the ABUSER. This movie has to FAIL. Please if you have the integrity to not watch this, save your money, no matter how much you might want to see it.

20,UgwaEzZzfrRgupmKvQR4AaABAg,"Personally, now I feel REALLY offended at this response from filmmakers.  Wow.  Kind of a crappy brushing off of all of us,  like we don't matter.   Like mere flies buzzing around their heads.   Why make movies at all if that's actually how they feel about movie goers?  What a jaded way to think of the people who pay to see their films.  They still don't understand what really motivated our rejection of Heard in the first place because they didn't really listen, clearly.  I'm not going to the movie, simply because I don't want to look at her face, knowing exactly all she did!   She abused the ACLU and the courts for her own personal advantage out of a vindictive, selfish, rather greedy purpose.  Most women I know that have actually been abused wouldn't even think of going public after a trauma like that, let alone invite a gaggle of reporters to photograph her, while she turned her face just so they could all take a good pic of her ""bruise"" that was mysteriously gone the very next day. Then she scratched herself for other pics, all while lying.  UGH!  This whole thing is just so wrong, on many levels.  Many women have suffered awful abuse and others ended up dead, so her malignant antics hurt them all. THAT's why it's so reprehensible to see someone like her, with so much going for her, abuse the legal system to destroy another person's entire life.  Taking his his jobs, his money, his property and his dignity. So, that's my itty bitty little stance!",Marta Womack,3,2021-07-31T16:03:42Z

I want justice for Johnny as a victim and Amber given her due,for trying to ruin a man who did nothing but LOVE her. We Depp fans LOVE HIM AND RESPECT HIM, because he does the same for us. His hospital visits ALONE are enough to make him amazing, but that he treats everyone with kindness and compassion, shows me,that he is fully deserving of this love ,support, and respect from his fans. He has never been cruel to ANYONE. He has been carried AWAY from signing autographs, while Amber waves,signs ONE,and jumps into her car.

Every time a Superhero film is made Frito Lay, Pepsi Cola, General Mills, or some other food product advertise the film on their product.  Refuse to buy these items.  Refuse to buy the toy line that comes out.  Refuse to buy anything related to Aquaman 2 or Amber Heard.

Boycotting a film only helps some.  Boycotting their advertisers, and stopping the flow of their sponsorship money, that is a whole different ball game.

78,UgwMFNXUvoca1SEMU3B4AaABAg,I wasn’t a FAN of JD before AMBUSER HEARD bullshits accusations. Now I am a FAN because he is innocent and man DV victim is also important and women abuser must hold accountable for all the lies and abuse and not just believe all women moments,Crispy Co,8,2021-07-31T03:03:06Z
79,UgxetFvJwmQwIGp3f3d4AaABAg,"Warner Bros. & Safran have made it even for us to wanna boycott Aquaman 2. We gave them PLENTY of warnings, and they chose not to listen to us. If they thought that we were bluffing then they've got another thing coming. If they lose money, we shouldn't feel bad at all. As the Bible saying goes: ""You reap what you sow.""",Luke Maher,6,2021-07-31T03:03:00Z
80,UgzCEiT_T69X9ZyIaVN4AaABAg,"Though I like Johnny and am a fan of SOME of his movies, I'm more into this to cut out the #MeToo garbage like actresses have never heard of 'the casting couch' in Hollywood, or so help me if Sally Fields suddenly recalls how Burt beat her a few times decades ago. And I support Kevin Spacey as well, and thought it so rude to nix him tout sweet out of the movie on these allegations and replace him with Christopher Plummer. Why not get the young man that accused Kevin to play the role, he was an aspiring actor too wasn't he? So yeah, this definite double standard of 'I won't watch anymore Depp movies new or old, because of what he did to Amber' to 'Boycotting Aquaman 2 because Amber's in it isn't going to do anything and is so childish!' ARGH! These bitches need to be REALLY SLAPPED! Not in an abusive way, but to snap them out of their delusional hysteria and back into reality. Just like they do in the movies! Amber, snap out of it! SLAP! SLAP! Come on Amber, remember where you are! SMACK!",DungeonStudio,0,2021-07-31T03:01:55Z

82,UgwcBebCM-WGrjHxqfl4AaABAg,"I'm sorry, not sorry. But when you say things like ""doing what's best for the movie"", I don't believe you. You know what movies need to be a worthwhile endeavor? It's money, box office revenue, streaming service subscriptions. This chode, just pissed off so many people, all at once. Potential customers who while don't like AH, but where still willing to watch the movie. The idiotic double standard BS that just came out of his mouth, lost this movie money. I mean, how many nails in one coffin do you need. And I'm not saying for sure AM2 will fail and nor do I think boycotts do all that much, but at this point, this guy is making a concerted effort by tempting fate.",Raymond Candela,1,2021-07-31T02:55:58Z

87,UgzsyVGC6TXfhj9qGRh4AaABAg,"Let’s be honest this is going to go one of two ways. One being more likely, the other being more desirable. Either 1) the boycott succeeds with a lot of damage and WB learns a nasty lesson. Or 2) the boycott does some damage but not nearly as noticeable as people are expecting, and much of the exudes will be made up by the normies who have little to know context or knowledge of what’s been going on with depp",Robert Willing,1,2021-07-31T02:46:46Z

I truly hope that
 Aquaman 2 💣💥 at the box office! 
Warner knows the criticism & facts, but they don't care. They dropped Depp and stuck with Heard.
