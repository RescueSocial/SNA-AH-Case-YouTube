There has been a largely negative stigma against men and in cases of abuse a woman will almost always be seen as the victim regardless of whether she was actually the oppressor. This case will become a benchmark for male abusive victims to have a stronger voice, it gives them hope of fair treatment under the law as well and shows how truly damaging false accusations can be to one's career. Hopefully corporations will be less harsh about terminating positions until a proper verdict has been made and that trickles down potentially to average people.",2021-07-01T21:22:20Z,1
