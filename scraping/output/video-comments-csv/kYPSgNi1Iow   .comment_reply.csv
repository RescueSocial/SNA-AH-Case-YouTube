9,UgxrG_jApYZKtf5r9G94AaABAg,Stefanie Jones,@Stephanie Olds they are counting on them to succeed.  If they don't they will bring him back.  Jason will carry the Aquaman movie and that's what they are counting on.  The other two won't do well with out Jonny.  It's happened before in the movies.  Just now more exposed with the availability of media.  I just don't understand why they are being so hard on him.  There are actors  who did beat their wives and are still prominent actors.  He didn't and was the one abused and he is removed from the movies.  She beats Johnny and still get to be in movies.  It isn't right but hoping for a turn around for him.,2021-09-12T22:00:12Z,0

Another Joan Crawford? 😬.I will never see anything with that b**ch in! Nor will I watch the 2 movie's that does not have Johnny in. So unfortunate that alot of us won't be seeing. There had been alot of people that have not signed the petition for Johnny. The 2 studio's are in for a big surprise, especially Disney.",2021-09-12T21:31:10Z,0
11,UgxrG_jApYZKtf5r9G94AaABAg,Stefanie Jones,@Kem Wills I could say a lot of negative about this situation but I try to not be negative.  She makes it difficult.  Must be why no one would charge her for what she did to Johnny.,2021-07-03T22:29:59Z,2

14,Ugw30aNKiAqWaHSjPqJ4AaABAg,Michelle Trunks (shelly),I Know it makes me upset about this what has happened is unjust completely there a saying a powful man is  a lonely old man Amber and he would be very good as she's just like him it makes me so cross johnny deep has to go through all this at least hes got all his supports friends and family  women and men who have been through what he has so we see the simualtys of what is going on reach to johnny 💞💞😇👈,2021-07-08T17:02:09Z,1
15,Ugw30aNKiAqWaHSjPqJ4AaABAg,Lola Twinkle,"@Michelle Trunks (shelly) Yep! Murdoch actually owns the Sun, The times and the NYP and WSJ as well as hundreds of news outlets all over the world. He did own Sky and Fox until a couple of years ago. Consequently he is possibly the most powerful man in the world. No one should have that much power. Its impossible to get justice against someone like that.",2021-07-08T16:31:57Z,1
