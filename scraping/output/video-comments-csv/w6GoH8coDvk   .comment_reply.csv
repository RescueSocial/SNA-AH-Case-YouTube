1,UgzVPNZtSsyoEOLJZPh4AaABAg,beplatinum2014,"Your late to the party, re-watch the video. JD was accusing years ago. Earlier this year, a recording of the his argument with Amber Heard was reveal, incriminating Amber Heard for being the abuser. Not to mention, she’ bisexual, and has had a history of abusing women herself in a past relationship.  The elephants in the room of DC Films is Amber Heard, who still has her job, and Ezra Miller. People saw this during the pandemic. Before the pandemic, the Flash was suppose to start filming in Iceland. Instead on April 1st, we get a video of him, putting his hands on a woman’s throat, and slinging her or the group. WB says little to nothing and Erza is still the flash. Check the DCEU tract record. 
After BOP comes out, the Marketing team changes the name, because Harley Quinn got more google searches. Movie still flops.DC Fandome, a 24 hour event, changed a month before and removed untitled panels.  Re-organization now at AT&T and WB/DC Films. Who’s honestly in charge there. Seems like same name, different clowns.",2020-11-07T15:11:40Z,0

You have one guy choking women but the woman who wasn't actually choked amber heard she's in the right screw the guy who didn't choke a woman johnny depp 
and then Ray Fisher comes out with some racial allegations against certain exacts who aren't even with the company and Joss weadon and they defend those a-holes and just sweep it under the rug because apparently the rights of a lying harlot is more important than the rights of a black man who feels like he's been unjustified 
And I'm glad he spoke out about it and isn't letting it go because people can't treat people like that.

Ray gets no justice Ezra gets forgot about his crimes and Amber Heard is in the right even though there's no proof of that.
WB needs to wake the hell up and start doing what's best for business firing Johnny Depp and keeping Amber Heard That is not good business nobody gives two shit about Amber Heard Johnny Depp's the one that makes the money
And then they say women get no justice men don't apparently get Justice either not in England.",2020-11-07T00:42:48Z,0

What the hell Rock have you been living under she made sure he can't have a job in Hollywood he's been fired from fantastic beasts he's been fired from pirates of the Caribbean Hollywood doesn't he want to touch him if it wasn't for Robert Downey Jr offering him a spot in his movie and a couple years Johnny Depp would be screwed when it comes to work and he's lost a lot of money he lost 500 million the day amber decided to punch him in the face and his lifestyle was expensive he is broke now this pandemic did not do him any favors either.

See you asked me who should be canceled Johnny Depp or Amber Heard because she still has work unlike Johnny.
She still allowed to be in movies and infect us with her shitty acting skills.",2020-11-06T23:52:39Z,1
140,UgwzDzylB3NzmyrpfQh4AaABAg,Grimm Wicked,"@Madness Arcade if they really cared about women that much they would have fired Ezra Miller as the flash because he put his hands around a woman and choked her to the ground and the video does look fake but it is actually him it's not a stunt and there was a police report filed Johnny Depp didn't even hurt nobody Amber Heard ruined his career and is not even that good of an actress or that big of a part of the DC universe the next Aquaman could survive without her character very easily. 
if they want to keep their image clean then they need to be fair and uphold their own double standard not only when it just suits them and they're afraid to make women mad women are not the entire population so I will not watch any movie involving Amber Heard none of my friends will watch any movie involving Amber Heard eventually that's going to damage their box office revenue and given a lot of their customers have been suffering from the pandemic they're going to need all the customers they can get all the box office revenue.
I feel like wb has been messing up big lately in the PR department. 
And then you have Ray Fisher being treated racially against by executives at Warner Brothers and Joss whedon but they've damn near swept that completely under the rug oh they didn't investigation my ass Jason Momoa was there and he said there was no investigation so I guess women's rights and feelings are more important than black people and their rights and Feelings.
Good Job WB way to make everyone think you're racist and pandering to the feminazis.",2020-11-06T23:48:38Z,0
141,UgzW5XT1F8izcHXSlwR4AaABAg,Boudica X,Yup. It reminds me of Sylvester Stallone's disastrous marriage to Brigette Nielsen. All of Sly's friends knew it was a colossal mistake and begged him not to marry her. Just like Johnny's family and friends begged him not to marry Amber. Before they got married there were reports that she was sleeping with multiple women and that they were routinely fighting. Talk about a red flag. There are women u sleep with and women u marry. Amber Heard falls squarely into the former category.,2020-11-09T22:40:54Z,0
