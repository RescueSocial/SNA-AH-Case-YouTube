went up her nose and came out her mouth.",2021-08-19T06:38:13Z,0
1,Ugzv_c8QxK0M2LmDG-14AaABAg,Laura Peterson,"Any time our clients were due in Court, part of my job was to coach them on proper Court and witness etiquette. Eating on the stand should be a natural unacceptable behavior! Anyone testifying about being abused is not going to be chowing down on snacks. She couldn’t portray an actual, genuine abuse victim, let alone have a friggin clue what real abuse victims deal with. The only victim in that case was JD. The only criminal and true abuser was her. She is a contemptible, lying, self serving miserable excuse of a human being. Anything done to her was done in self defense. Now, ERW is attacking Marilyn Manson? I don’t believe a single accusation.",2021-04-12T18:28:50Z,1

4,Ugzv_c8QxK0M2LmDG-14AaABAg,Karen Hussey,"Amber Heard needs to spend some time in jail for perjury, and spousal abuse. She's is a narrscisist and a brat. Terrible person. How did Johnny's never report the abuse. I believe Johnny's should donate money to men and women that are abused and make Heard pay back money to Mr. Depp. She has no morals or an ounce of command decency towards others. She needs jail time. Angeranagement, working with, well, no humans or animals whatsoever. She also ruined Johnny's career, hopefully he comes out a hero for abused men.",2021-02-16T03:04:48Z,2

67,UgwUn8fSVPvQSW0Coqx4AaABAg,Michelle Horton,@Michael Keaton any kind of abuse is wrong but I believe a man being abused can be worse because he gets told he's being weak or a pussy. I think we abuse ourselves along with our abusers I used alcohol too and the alcohol makes things 100 times worse. I just hope we have jack back because he got me through the mad hatter also. I think we feel as lost as Alice and as mad as the hatter. I hope one date can all stand together ❤,2021-03-12T08:46:20Z,0

But to abuse one kid, then treat the others like a diety worshipped by all, wtf.

176,UgyNXlSFSwTvkcjeNw94AaABAg,Potato Patty,"Ridiculous! The whole thing is just crazy. I was wondering if charges could be brought against her for perjury, maybe it's not that kind of trial but there should be consequences for her casual lying and her flippant attitude toward the whole thing. Disrespecting the court? Perjury? Being an assh*le? There should be something. It's like she's blessing everyone with her magnanimous presence. And her storytelling is really terrible. That whole bathroom tale, the way she tells it, is so obviously make believe. I wonder how long she spent trying to come up with it - I suggest not very long. I hope and expect victory for Johnny in this and the upcoming trial. I hope his career hasn't been too scarred by this, he's a great actor. Amber on the other hand, she should be blacklisted. I also want to stop seeing her on my TV saying ""because I'm worth it"". You would think Loreal would have pulled her commercials now that we all know what kind of pig she really is. I'm talking about her deficating  in Johnny's bed and saying 'oh come on, it was just a joke'. Among the different stories she's told about it - it was the dog, it was one of her friends and finally she admitted on tape that it was her, just a joke and Johnny's taking it too seriously and he needed to lighten up. I've actually tried contacting Loreal to let them know she's not the sort of person that should be a spokesperson for their beauty brand and I'm not going to be a customer anymore. Maybe if a few more people let them know having her as a face of their product it might make a difference? Well, that's my rant for the day. Good luck to Johnny Depp. Kiss my ass  Amber Turd.",2020-08-17T19:20:17Z,10

192,UgyDu6-swQpIw7hNCuV4AaABAg,Danny B,"I know. I was thinking that. There's almost no chance its a swing door. But the only way the physics of what she claims would work, is if it was a swing door.  Thats the only way it could roll over her toes with Johnny as the aggressor, and have it swing into Johnny's face. But if it was NOT a swing door, the only explanation is that Amber alone was the aggressor. Because it would have to open in Johnny's direction to be able to corner him in the head, which means she was pushing it at him to get to him. And if it ran over her toes, its because he was pushing it back shut, because she had moved forward to go through the door.",2020-07-15T14:44:24Z,1

Johnny has always chosen sort of odd characters and he's been amazing at all of them. They really shouldn't let him go, if they do, I'm sure it will be a major mistake. He's got the right stuff for such a character and similar characters, as he's proven over  the years. AND - over the years I've never heard of anyone claiming he's been abusive. Maybe a little self destructive or he's trashed a hotel room (way back when) but I've never heard of him being abusive towards another person. Amber, I think you picked the wrong person to f*ck with. He's not going to sit back like you thought he would. You grabbed on to a rich, famous and popular man and thought just how he could benefit you. I think you made a big mistake. I think Johnny's at that vulnerable stage in Hollywood where his age is starting to matter and he hoped to grab the pretty young starlet, put her on his arm and take a few years off through your youth and beauty. You were both making a big mistake. He was grabbing youth and you were grabbing status. I think you broke him down because you're a greedy selfish bitch, taking full advantage from the start. I think he loved you - until he realized what you really are. Even still he was willing to just put an end to the chaos in a peaceful manor, go your separate ways and let things go. That was a final kindness you should have taken. Now you're exposed as the disgusting being that you are - violent, evil, conniving, phoney bitch. You could have walked away quietly with your '?' reputation intact and a pocket full of cash. Johnny would have let it go and probably not disclosed all the raunchy and evil details. You pushed and now you'll have to deal with the fallout, I think the consequences will be worse for you. I really hope so, honestly, I hope you never get hired again. Johnny isn't the abuser, you are. It's all coming out now. You used him up as best you could, not thinking he'd actually stand up to you. Tough shit for you (or maybe not so tough considering the sweet ladylike gift you left in Johnny's bed to remind him of just what a lovely lady and great catch you are). Maybe Elon will look forward to those types of love gestures, I hear he's a bit of a freak and a good friend of yours. Enjoy the future you've bought with your crass, rude, selfish and disgusting attitude. Good luck to you Johnny, I hope things go well for you. Amber - eat shit. As you claim for Loreal ""I'm worth it"". You sure are.",2020-08-18T02:57:16Z,1

When it comes to her, after watching other footage of her, I just really think she's just a nasty fake person in general and that her smiles like these come from that nastyness. But still, in a vacuum she could be just a nasty person who's ALSO a victim of abuse. Fortunately there's far more evidence than just body language out there, so the body language analysis can just be a fun thing to think about as armchair psychologists. it's definitelly not conclusive in itself.",2020-05-24T12:18:57Z,0
256,Ugzt1_tuwLjjPpGyCCx4AaABAg,Hamza Riazuddin,Viqala sure yeh I agree context is so important. I’m just not sure we can say with any real certainty body language tells us much. Again with what you said there. Johnnys smile vs her smile. We only attribute Johnnys to trauma because we think he is innocent. We couldn’t use the body language to tell us if he is innocent. Does that make sense. The arrow of causality is after we have an opinion. Can anyone really look at Johnny’s smile vs her smile and say which one is evil which one is genuine  without holding an opinion first?,2020-05-24T12:06:56Z,0
257,Ugzt1_tuwLjjPpGyCCx4AaABAg,Viqala,"I only partially agree. I dont really put a lot of faith in the looking up/down thing for example. Also many times when people shake their head 'no' while saying something, I dont think it means they're lying, tho it did here, (she obviously understood the question). There's times where it makes sense and we all do it, you tell a story and go ""and then on top of that it started raining!"", someone asks ""oh no, really?"" and you go 'yes' but maybe shaking your head no cause in your head you go 'yes, it was a terrible day'. There's an emotion we express by the head shake on top of the simple answer. All truthful. So its best to just be careful recognising context when judging that body language.
With the smiling thing, I think there's a difference between them tho. He smiles as a coping mechanism cause those traumas are hard to talk about and possibly awkward. Her smiles are mean, mocking and dismissive. Of johnny and of everyone around her.",2020-05-24T12:01:15Z,1

Your comment pretty much explains why marriage is stupid and these ""fewer"" people that do get married, without the benefits or financial motivations playing the biggest part, then these people are the only ones to take marriage seriously. How the hell could Johnny ""benefit"" from marriage since he shouldn't have to worry about finances? Take Eddie Murphy for example who has 9 children from 5 different mothers, what's smart about that?

I also think that most women that (really) suffer from domestic violence only stay with their husbands because the financial benefits or obligations are far more important than taking a beating once in a while. Most DV victims always say that ""fear"" is the biggest thing of leaving their husbands but in reality these DV victims are just as horrible and crooked as the man who hits them.

Being an addict does not automatically make you abusive as a result; drugs affect people differently. Some become violent, others become mellow, others depressed, others happy.

Hold onto and nurture that inner strength to move forward. Forge alliances and deeper relationships with the siblings who are available for such and make new friends who have no association with your past. Write a journal. Do art. The Courage to Heal is a good book if you are looking for one. Make a point of giving yourself credit for the things going through this experience has taught you: you probably have elevated empathy and intuition, among other things.

393,UgwNNq7_KUDo8eCW_dd4AaABAg,Ruthgar,"This is just for clarification.  This recording was strictly of a hearing to gather information, most likely without a judge in attendance (potentially one of several such hearings), in order for the lawyers to help prepare there cases for the upcoming trial.  Now at a hearing each side takes turn asking question, to which the other side may or may not object to, but because this is a hearing and not a trial the witness is still required to answer the questions regardless if there is an objection or not, they just have to wait until the lawyer making the objection has fully stated the objection for the recording.  After the hearing is done, the recording is reviewed by a judge, specifically for only the questions that were objected on, or any questions that weren't answered (hearings typically are only for a set amount of time due to scheduling conflicts of the lawyers involved, so the lawyers will try to get all of their questions out in the initial scheduled hearings).  Now once a judge has reviewed the recording they will provide a report to both lawyers, along with copies of the recordings, and the report will state which questions weren't answered at all, which objections were overuled (invalid), and sustained (valid, question/answer can't be used as is).  Now the lawyers then have the option to keep things as they are, respond to the report for reasons for the judges decision on an objection to be overuled (the judge may or may not decide to overule their previous decision on the objection based on this), and/or hold further hearings to narrow down bits of information that weren't clarified in the previous hearings.   Now once the trial actually starts, each sides lawyer may decide to use all, some, or occasionally even none of the information from the hearings(usually only when said information would hurt their side's case).  So getting back to her lawyer's bunch of objections, this is a typical tactic at a hearing(from the few real life hearings I've seen), object to as much of the questions to key witnesses as possible,  and hope for favorable responses on them from the judge.",2020-05-01T06:59:28Z,9

609,UgwukdIWvRCbzn68fGZ4AaABAg,Gino diFonzo,"@Sum Dud That's a good point, but it isn't likely, if she decided to go with ""not guilty by reason of insanity"", that such a tactic would be successful.  For openers, an insanity plea is typically used in a criminal proceeding, not a civil one, but even in a criminal proceeding, if there isn't a prior diagnosis, 90% of the time the plea fails.  Moreover, tests like the M'Naghten Rule are used to determine insanity for legal purposes, and they are far more difficult to satisfy than Hollywood would have people believe.  Basically, she'd have to assert that her condition(s) is so severe that she didn't know right from wrong, even when she was lying about the abuse.  The problem with this, is that it means that her mental health issues are as ongoing as the diagnosis she asserts.  Therefore, she's nuts and belongs in a state facility until it can be determined that she is no longer a danger to herself and others.
My guess, is that her attorneys are going to recommend to her that she reach some agreement with Johnny that is protected by an NDA before her net worth and her career take a nose dive into the shitter permanently.  Her twisted, egotistical ass will fire them and she'll take this thing all the way to trial anyway and lose everything.  She'll be okay though; she'll con a wealthy old man who's soft in the head into marrying her when the smoke clears (but nobody in Hollywood will touch her).",2020-03-29T14:39:36Z,0

Something that I think UK barristers would draw the line at. Such things as leaving the court before the end to do a little press stunt. Which in my view backfired, especially when she tries to imply she was given special treatment by the court staff being so polite. They are ‘so polite’ to everyone, that is Everyone... and the Police suddenly got a mention with the implication as though they were protecting her personally, (must think the public are stupid), or are in some way allied to her. The UK Police do not have anything to do with civil cases or divorce. In fact you have to sit in the same waiting room as everyone else before you go in, unless you are lucky enough to run in early a grab one of the couple of rooms available. Then still these are normally off the main waiting area where everyone is... if she thought she needed protection she would have to hire body guards like anyone else would.

Here is the link to an OFFICIAL US GOVERNMENT WEBSITE - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4062022/
Also here is an article from THE SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN WITH OFFICIAL 2019 DATA,
In 2019, for example, this survey showed that equal numbers of men and women reported being forced into non-consensual sex (either raped or forced to penetrate someone else). Extrapolated to the US as a whole, this would represent 1.9 million victims among each sex during the preceding 12 month.NOW OBVIOUSLY IN THE OLDER DAYS WOMEN WERE RAPED MORE BUT NOW IT'S JUST EQUAL.ALSO MEN DON'T REPORT SO MUCH SEXUAL ASSAULT COMPARED TO WOMEN.

IN THE US, Men are assaulted at the same rate as women by women.

It mocks, belittles, harms and delegitimizes every genuine victim out there - by crying “wolf”!

When so many women do it and get away with it, time and time again - pretty soon people become desensitized and stop taking it serious. 

Your anger and frustration should be directed toward Amber and every other woman pulling the same obvious B.S. tricks that Amber is - because that behavior and perversion of the justice system (and court of public opinion) is what makes real victims, like you and your mother, afraid of coming forward and not being believed...

Also, I don’t know where you live, or if these are ongoing problems you’re dealing with, but if all of that is true (it’s the internet, you never know..) - your local justice system is f**ked and you might want to consider looking at some“emergency relocation” advocacy groups, to get away from there!

If you or your mother still need help and you feel comfortable with telling me, please let me know and I will try to find you some local resources and groups. 
(I actually work closely with local abuse prevention foundations in my hometown, so I am more than willing to assist). 

The advice that I give to ALL abuse victims is this - 

*“If you’re afraid for your life and your children’s lives, you need to take action and remove yourself from that dangerous situation immediately. Don’t be concerned about what anyone might or might not think of you - it’s not them, it’s not their life or children’s lives on the line and it’s nobody’s decision to make but yours. 
Even if you’re completely surrounded by a^sholes that think you’re being insane or overreacting- I hope you see that the choice between being a popular dead person, or a potentially unpopular living person, will be an easy decision to make.”* ...",2020-03-22T02:22:37Z,1
750,UgySFmeQ0qJ4wH7Vd0F4AaABAg,Little Wolf Taima,"@GloryGlory Hole’allelujah My mother's ex husband and boyfriend has literally gotten away with multiple counts of attempted murder on her and her kids with machetes, trying to set us on fire, strangulation pouring boiling oil etc. The police know. All he has to do is go to AA meetings. When my mother left my father she took nothing and left us with him because she was scared f being stereotyped as some feminazi witch who was demonising the man and turning his kids against him/taking them away and taking all the money putting herself in poverty and at the mercy of yet another abusive man. Psychos like AMber also influence the decision of women who are abuse because they are scared of being thought of as manipulators like her using their gender to their advantage. She did all kinds of mental gymnastics to let them get away with saying they were going to make her head roll down the hill in the back yard now she won't ever leave him because if she has two filed relationships with a guy accusing her (the working one) of 'using him' then abandoning him she will look like the evil spinster who hates men... I admit I have this feeling as well from the time I was sexually abused by my grandmother's boyfriend when I was about 11 and was told to not make a fuss or ruin a man's life if he's never done this to anyone else. I've been raped many times since and still have 'you wouldn't want to get me into trouble' whispered in my ear stuck in my head. Don't be a feminazi. I upset my boyfriend telling him about this stuff because he said I was making all men look bad and had a victim complex.

My husband was a cheating Narcissist and I’m glad to find out all his secrets and infidelity with the help of cyberhackinggenius. I’m here in UK and able to access my husband’s phone messages with a link on my phone even while he was away in Canada cheating on me. I got to discover that my husband who is legally married to me here in UK is also recently married to another woman in Canada and I’m finally going through a divorce with lots of evidence against him. I read all deleted and recent chats on his Whatsapp,Call logs, Text messages, Twitter,Facebook,Instagram messages and Skype without him knowing.

Entirely unrelated to this, a couple got divorced and the husband got full custody of their daughters because she was violently unstable. She went to court, pled her vagina and got overnight visitations. She took her daughters to an abandoned house, slit their throats then called 911 demanding they save the older daughter who was still alive. She also refused to give her or their names, the address or even the name of the street. They eventually found her and managed to save the older daughter who was put in the ICU. The court decided that as a mother who lost one child and had another in critical condition that she had the right to visit her daughter in the ICU, where she told the daughter that she only killed her sister and tried to kill her because she knew it would hurt her ex-husband and it was really his fault for divorcing her.",2020-03-21T00:55:44Z,1

It’s so obvious she’s lying and has been the whole time; she can’t even finish her sentences bc she has no idea what she’s saying, and once she finally makes up a coherent sentence she repeats it over and over. She’s just there to get his money and that’s it. I’m not sure how her lawyers are able to get away with objecting to questions that are absolutely relevant and reasonable to ask, like if she ever hit Johnny on multiple occasions and if she’s ever been violent towards her sister. The fact that they don’t end the case right there and declare Johnny the winner after witnessing all that completely baffles me. It’s just so fucking clear she’s lying!!!

Also how is that even supposed to work? She says she was trying to close the door in attempt to get away from him, he clearly got hit in the head by the door, they both admit that much, a door has to go outwards towards JD for him to get hit in the head by the door, that means her toes can't get scraped if the door is going outwards, and she's supposedly according to her story attempting to close the door which has to be inwards, you wouldn't put your foot in a spot where you know the door is supposed to close while you're trying to pull it closed would you? However if you're forcing your way into a room with a door that goes outwards for you and somebody on the opposite side is trying to close it it is possible that your toes get scraped and that you hit the other person in the head with the door, which by the sound of it is exactly what she did.

I hope he gets justice too, he's sure to win the libel case with The Sun (the most toxic tabloid in the UK anyway) as the burden of proof is on them and they have none, but general reputational damage is harder to clear up; after a smear campaign by a malignant narcissist like Heard, he'll just have to ride it out and over time people will see from behavioural patterns that he was the gentle one, whereas narcissists tend to act out more as they age and lose their looks/charm and their exploitative lifestyle causes people to steer clear of them in ever greater numbers. when Amber Heard is left only with her personality she'll be screwed.",2020-03-20T15:04:46Z,1

And then she tried to sue him for giving it away but now she’s taking all the credit for it going to charity. This thing wouldn’t know the truth if it jumped up and bit her in the ass. 
While I’m on this rant:
The only reason she got that money in the divorce was because JD divorce lawyer (Bloom) was in Elon musks pocket. He’s the one who hid the 87 cctv footages showing Amber with no marks on her face for the next few proceeding days after her last encounter with Jonny. Plus the footage of Elon Musk and James Franco going to jonnys penthouse with Amber (on different occasions) while Jonny was out of the country filming. 
Jonny only come in to possession of these last year when he sued his old lawyers (and won). 
Separate note but this Bloom guy is also the lawyer Amber used to try to get Kate James (her assistant that spoke up against her) to falsify legal documents to send to the Australian courts during her court case for smuggling in her dogs when she flew to Australia to see Jonny while he was filming. 
The only reason JD could sue Amber and prove her false hoax was because of the evidence he come in possession of after his court case against this Bloom guy.
So when she posted that op-Ed still defaming Jonny he had the evidence he needs to prove she has been lying the whole time and was in fact the aggressor on the relationship.

882,UgwaaGApkZgzTTpyC4N4AaABAg,lisa richards,"Didi X     That is very astute of you.
It’s not that they “don’t know the difference,” but rather they are conditioned to put up with such behavior.
How do I word this best and make is quick and simple?
It’s like a slot machine. When you are in a relationship with an abuser, there are “good Times bad Times,” as the Led Zeppelin song says.
Abuser goes through hoops, trying to get the reward, the feel good times back again.
That turns into an addiction, literally. 
That is how gamblers become addicted to gambling, and I have known a couple of gambling addicts.
The abuse victim tries everything to try To get the “good Amber” back.
They attempt reasoning, bribing, threatening, behavior modification, etc.
But being a “personality disorder,” these things are ingrained “pattern of behavior,” literally, as noted in the DSM, every edition.
It is like the abuser is programmed to engage in the destructive, chaotic patterns.
And now, take that, and add the following:
Johnny was abused mercilessly, by his mother, who was often irrational, and when she went into rages, her anger was always immense, and disproportionate to the event she was enraged that.
Johnny needed a healthy relationship, but instead, he got another personality disordered person in his life.
It is common for abused children to grow up and exchange one abuser in their life up for another.
I hope that helped.
I used to do a lot of coaching for adult children of abusers.
I wish I could do it for Johnny. 
I wouldn’t charge him a dime.
The therapist that they went to was not good. 
I could do a far better job with him.

She saved the number in her phone in all caps as my ex's first middle and last name. She showed it to me trying to tell me he was cheating on me with her.

I have also looked at her body language and listened to the evidence on the audio. I’m not going to judge solely on eating habits but I must say the way she was conducting herself looked very off. 
I actually take offence to someone calling me screwed up. I’m not someone who judges people quickly in this way. If you have taken my comment in the wrong way then ask me to clarify before stating your judgement on me.
I have listened to all the recent audio and her ADMITTING hitting Johnny is what I take as her being an abuser.
Perhaps judging me on whether I am screwed up or not based on a comment you have read out of context and without knowing my thought process makes you the one who is casting judgment here...

I think his frustration just got the best of him when he wrote those things. There comes a point for everyone where you just can't handle the crap anymore and you just want to fight fire with fire. I don't blame him for getting a little bit ignorant. I feel like after all I've heard, read and seen, he's been honest and transparent to the point of talking about his drug use and drinking - those aren't very flattering admissions on his part, but he faced up to it. I think if he was trying to be deceptive he would have tried to minimize that situation too. He's just saying 'this is who I am, warts and all, but I'm not an abuser'. And I really don't think he is.

The advocates at the ""women's shelters"" are very helpful and will help you get protected as you navigate a new way forward.  Once you realize you're a victim you become a volunteer in a sense if you make excuses for their behaviour, which of course comes from wanting to help them or blame yourself bc it's easier to fix your own stuff, etc, so don't be hard on yourself if that's your case like it was mine. It took me a couple years to fully realize and find a way out. Make audios if you can,  ur phone will prob pick up sound from inside your pocket. Mine saved my life. It's very helpful evidence. Don't provoke your aggressor, and stay strong and make a plan b. It's all  so heartbreaking along with all the other traumas but you deserve happiness and the best!  Much love.

We had three wonderful children together and divorced as after ten years when his abuse towards me and his wreckless ways progressed to the breaking point.  Little did I know things would only get worse from there. I felt I was serving a life sentence until he died of liver failure (his ICU doctor told his family he drank himself to death).  Life has been peaceful ever since especially because I had a chance to forgive him before he took his last breath.  I even sat with our kids and his sister beside his bed and said goodbye while his (third) wife was at their home dealing with the mess he made.  I feel for Johnny and all those who have loved a NPD.,2020-03-18T14:08:10Z,3

I too have experienced the logic defying hidden damage that lurks within long after you feel you have dealt with this level of trauma.  It is insidious. And Oh So True that even today after experiencing so many without empathy am I astonished yet again when I come across another.  And ditto on the female MO as exemplified by Heard.....luckily Elon Musk ( his true essence remains to be seen though) escaped her treachery.


I am so grateful to have you on the planet.  Breath of fresh air!

 I don't believe it either.
 She's never dated a man who didn't have something she wanted/needed...although that's true of female's as well, since she's incapable of love/empathy.",2020-03-21T14:07:06Z,1
1023,UgyMH-t9mEJS0T756Dx4AaABAg,Julie Lea,"@Wyldengel He broke up with Vanessa. I believe his Mom had cancer. This left him vulnerable.
 He has unresolved C-PTSD from childhood, leaving him open to be exploited by a abusive narcissist in spite of being highly intelligent...which intelligence has nothing to do with it. He may have healed from the C-PTSD, but that unconscious abuse can be buried deep from childhood, where the person isn't even aware it's there. 
 It had nothing to do with physical attractiveness. Kate James testimony goes through part of the stages.
 1) she was preppy & started dressing like him, hats & lots of jewelry.
 She started a collection of old 1st edition books, expensive, paid for by JD. 
 She even got a old typewriter like his, although I've never known her to write & it's highly highly unlikely she was into 1st edition books!!!! 
 2) Kate James testified she was bewildered that she seemed to want to BE Johnny, while expressing disdain for him.
 3) This is called ""mirroring"". A Narcissistic tactic where the Narc pretends to have the same interests as the victim to make them think they are made for each other "" See, we have all the same interests!! We are a match made in Heaven!""
 4) then there's the love bombing..."" no one has ever made me feel like you do"". 
 Evidenced in the audio when she refers to how hard she worked on the marriage. She talks about how they both wanted a foundation to feel ""safe"". It also shows he was not for the marriage, also seen in photos, & he says "" Please don""t talk about our wedding like that (how hard she worked to get him to marry her), please refer to it as our 4 yr relationship"". 
 5) Putting them on a pedestal
 6) Devaluation phase
 * people think other people are like they are. A person with empathy can not truly understand a narcissist, & a narc can't understand people with empathy.
 By this time the person is confused. 
 Here's the full explanation, if you really want to know.

There is the ""extortion"" letter, with Ms. Heard's demands of $50,000 monthly support, the Range Rover, the Penthouse Apartments worth $13,000,000 , $100,000 lawyer fees, $25,000 forensic accounting AND an undecided Divorce Settlement, that Ms. Heard's lawyer sent to Mr. Depp BEFORE she accused him of abuse. Witnesses have come forward to officially complain that Ms. Heard attempted to make them change their testimony (Witness Tampering). The heavily edited video that Ms. Heard made of Mr. Depp without his knowledge or consent, and then SOLD to TMZ breaks a number of serious laws (and proves that, even when very upset, Mr. Depp never touched her.) Then there are the lies. Even if Mr. Depp did not have ample proof that she is lying, Ms. Heard contradicts herself repeatedly, making a powerful case for perjury in at least three different case depositions, and every lie that she will tell on the stand. The defamation is probably the easiest thing to prove in this case, as a Judge has ALREADY found her case for domestic abuse to be ""egregiously flawed and without merit"" and DISMISSED it WITH PREJUDICE. Ms. Heard's accomplices testimonies are already falling apart, Josh Drew was deposed last November, and since then Mr. Depp has known that Raquel Pennington was NOT in her apartment, but hiding in the hall closet--which discloses a formidable lie in her deposition. Domestic abuse causing bodily harm will be the least of Ms. Heard's worries, and iO Tillett Wright, Raquel Pennington, Whitney Heard, and Elisabeth Mars should be questioning how much jail time they would like to serve for Ms. Heard, because as all of this unravels, their multiple lies are being uncovered...and Ms. Heard would ""throw them to the dogs"" in a minute to save herself.",2020-03-18T20:03:23Z,3

Sorry I'm not from the US so i haven't followed the whole story.. I only found out about this after she was already exposed (I guess I live under a rock lol)
I totally agree with what you said and honestly these type of things are what have given actual feminism a bad name... Not to mention this asshole Ashley.. Abby.. whatever her name is that's only making it worse for actual DV victims -_- 
The only good thing I hope comes out of this, is people taking more seriously DV in *general* because a lot of the times male victims are overlooked and it's disgusting.. 
Just a note though: I was just trying to point out that what she's doing is what all abusers do. Showing the victim that they're in power and/or no one will believe them etc. But ofc if you have some issues in your society(which she was obviously counting on), it's more than your right to point it out!
I have noticed in USA feminism and any kind of activism is now a ""trend"" and a ""brand"".. companies use it literally to make money and people buy it 😅 (well not only in the USA unfortunately but for now I think the biggest issue is there)

SORRY for the wall of text... This quarantine has given us too much free time xDD

And the worst part is *she was right* ; It was widely reported on and Depp was immediately fired from Pirates of the Caribbean then was treated like shit; Until all of these recordings revealed how abusive she is.

When I look at Amber, I see a confused, paranoid, self-centered narcissist. A lot of the people who branded themselves as poster-girls for the #metoo / feminist movement have been caught out in similar ways as Amber. I think they should examine that, and learn from it.

My true hope(s) out of this thing is:
1. That the real victims of abuse feels a sense of empowerment or courage regarding their own situation 
2. I really really wish Johnny a partner who will be able to help him heal from all the crap he's had to deal  with.
