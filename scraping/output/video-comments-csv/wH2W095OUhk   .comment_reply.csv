The body cam footage was one of those things. This lawyer also had Elon Musk as a client, so make what you will of that fact",2021-05-22T04:26:08Z,2

2,UgxuhinndowJDFyAMSF4AaABAg,Jazzo Nation,JD should be able to sue them for defamation. It may sound harsh but it would definitely make them take such a movement more seriously. It's disturbing that a movement made to protect victims from predators ended up protecting a predator while hurting an actual victim.,2021-05-26T11:11:22Z,1

7,UgznTd9VDdlcVVUWRdV4AaABAg,Chris Meyers,"@Janet Sorenson Nah, the #METOO movement has always had a bad reputation, especially the fact that they  always support women who make false rape or abuse allegations against men, and when it all comes out that they were false, the whiny #METOO movement is nowhere to be found for a public apology to the men wrongly accused, they were never a good movement to begin with and folks were saying that from the start of the movement about how there will be false accusations against men and they will support it, it's a scam in the highest degree",2021-05-25T20:59:08Z,0

10,UgznTd9VDdlcVVUWRdV4AaABAg,Janet Sorenson,No he can't reappeal the case in the UK that case was against the Sun newspaper not AH. All the other stuff is directly against AH here in the USA for all of the stuff she has been saying and writing about JD that isn't true. The #metoo movement compromised their reputation for her lies. It is too bad that they don't check out the character of someone before they start waving their banners for them.,2021-05-19T04:25:07Z,13

12,UgyM4sWm0dfKtEt62XV4AaABAg,Janet Sorenson,"Absolutely! A lot these high powered men lost everything should be given the same rights as any other person who is accused of anything. The right to a fair hearing. Many of the ones in Hollywood did take advantage of their position in the casting of films but was it forced or consensual? Who has not heard of the casting couch? Woman are just as guilty of taking advantage of men in the same way. They, both men and women, want an acting job and go after it any way they can. Now you are hearing about how unfair this practice is. Actually it sounds more like the complainer didn't get the role they were ""sacrificing"" their bodies for, in other words, sour grapes! ""I didn't get what I wanted so I will fix you!"" That's what happens when a movement such as ""metoo"" gets so powerful. It gets corrupted and destroys what it was supposed to help. People like Amber Heard see an opportunity to use the movement for their own personal destructive benefit, to hurt someone. They don't care about all of the actual victims out there. They don't care how much it compromises the reputation of the movement by lying and having the movement take the hit because they backed her. When she is found out to be the abuser, it makes people question the entire movement. It destroys all of the potential good that it can do.",2021-05-19T03:55:24Z,3
