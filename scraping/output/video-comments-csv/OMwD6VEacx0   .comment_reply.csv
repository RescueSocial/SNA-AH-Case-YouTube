Because I feel like a lot of celebrities aren’t rehabilitated. They just straight up get away with things which I think is mainly due to wealth but I suppose other things too.

The only time I blamed individual men was when I blamed men who body shame. They bodyshame each other btw too. We live in a fucked up society that is still dealing with patriarchal issues, and mindsets that came from said society. Sure women criticize each other and body shame each other (and men) all the time. But that’s because society tells them that they should look a certain way. Does that make it okay? No obviously women aren’t drones they have a mind of their own and stop bringing men who gender nonconform into this? They deal with more toxic masculinity than anyone?",2020-05-25T09:59:23Z,1

307,Ugw111cqwdoylZcsV0R4AaABAg,Anna Lassila,"@Dino Earth nothing. that was an accusation. not a proven incident. a statement from a witness: 

""A City of Lies script supervisor says she was on set when Johnny Depp allegedly verbally and physically assaulted a crewmember — and claims she has proof none of it actually happened.

Location manager Greg ""Rocky"" Brooks in July sued Depp, along with the film's director and producers. He alleges Depp screamed at him, punched him twice in the ribs and offered him $100,000 to hit back. Brooks also claims he was fired from the movie after he wouldn't promise not to sue over the alleged incident.

Script supervisor Emma Danoff on Monday submitted a declaration stating that she witnessed the altercation and it was nothing like what Brooks described in his lawsuit.

Danoff says they were shooting outside and Brooks berated an African-American homeless woman with ""racial and derogatory slurs"" because she was in his way. Depp was sitting next to her about 25 feet away when it happened.

""He immediately stood up from our shared seat on the edge of a planter bench and went over to Brooks to stand up for the woman,"" Danoff says. ""Mr. Depp said to Mr. Brooks, 'You can’t talk to her like that. You think she is something less than you? Who do you think you are? How dare you?'""

Danoff says there were no punches thrown and no offer of $100,000 for Brooks to punch Depp — and she says she has 40 time-stamped photos that prove it. 

“Mr. Brooks, and others who have abused Mr. Depp, are about to discover the consequences for making false accusations,” says Depp's attorney Adam Waldman.""

Her mother was both verbally and physically abusive to her.  There was one instance where she could’ve died if her brother did not intervene.  She ran away from home at 16 because she knew that if she didn’t, she would’ve died by her own mother’s abusive hands.  My grandma still suffers the affects of such both physically and mentally.

The No True Scotsman Fallacy does not apply in this case. That argument only applies in cases where somebody is denying a rigid fact about a person’s social standing or group because they got their feelings hurt. i.e., “no true scotsman puts sugar in their porridge!” when legally, this person is indeed scottish and there is nothing you can do about it. apply the same thing to somebody who is NOT scottish, i.e., french or something, and you get a “no shit, because he’s not scottish” even if the frenchman claims to be. 

in this case, the fallacy would apply if somebody said “no TRUE feminist would wear a skirt!” because that has nothing to do with what feminism means, and so is only a matter of opinion. it does NOT apply, in the case of these comments, where people are saying “no TRUE feminist thinks women are worth more than men!” because, factually it goes against the very basis of the movement, which is equality.

if i say i like the colour red when i don’t, it’s not an an example of a fallacy, it’s an example of a lie.",2020-05-25T06:45:53Z,2
