Good work by the hopefully stand in look alike  Depps – hard to keep a straight face about australian concern for the environment if you  actually care, have been or live here. They may have flown over the many non australian owned open cut mines, clear fells, fracking sites, uranium dumps, rivers of shit turning to arsenic, rabbit runs, squashed toads, dying coral reefs and kilometre after kilometre of red dust. They may know Barnaby Joyce is a typical insecure jealous violent inmate of 'Terra Nullius'. That bj rode into town on the same weener wagon as the jesuit tony abbot who shut down the Climate Change Commission back in 2013 because global warming isn’t happening. Yes fellow earthlings they sacked Ministries for SCIENCE, CLIMATE CHANGE, higher education, WATER, work place relations, youth, disabilities, aged care, mental health, and early childhood but selected a Ministry of ANZAC Day, Border Patrol and Sport. The Depps may also ponder the concept that arguably Australian ecosystems haven’t really been pristine since the final forming of Gondwanaland. Or they may have read about this happening soon
“Commissioner Kevin Scarce said there were 390,000 tonnes of high-level nuclear waste in worldwide inventories, and nearly 10 million cubic metres of intermediate-level waste — all of it produced from nuclear power generation. He said SA could take 13 per cent of the world's waste.""Nations have not been able to find a disposal solution that meets their geology,"" Mr Scarce said.""National consensus is that deep geological storage is the right solution for spent fuel, kept isolated from the environment for hundreds of thousands of years.""A 138,000-tonne facility built in South Australia would be expected to generate a total revenue of more than $257 billion, with costs of $145 billion ""over 120 years"". http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-02-15/sa-nuclear-waste-dump-to-meet-'global-need'-recommended
 'Protect our fragile ecosystems' lolol Aussies please most you folk typing here I will not have met pulling weeds, planting trees, picking up rubbish, saving animals, feeding the increasing homeless etc. so get real about life most of you don’t care about anything but your own mediocre pretensions of middle class gang mentality and a soft cock political correctness – a lot like Europe pre World War II here but aussies will need uniforms and lots of theatrics before they will recognise a fascist.

Citizens of earth have the idea it is the Depps with the get out of jail free card! No... big business
has ALL the cards, designed the jails we built that they never go to, but will slam you in  for hindering their obscene profit. Those little puppies were going no where, hanging out being pampered not roaming amongst the weeds, four wheel drives and introduced species of our National Parks biting feral cats and dogs. Not at all.... and we have rabies  – the flying foxes  (Pteropus poliocephalus)  can carry it – no don't publicise it or every  drunk bogan and its mother will try harder to kill them. ausssies eat kangaroo  and emu  the national emblem! – koalas are nearly extinct with chlamydia (a Sexually Transmitted Disease) wombats were speed humps, tassie devils have face cancer, verging on extinction for examples lead beater possums and cassowaries  – we have the HIGHEST RATE OF EXTINCTION IN THE WORLD (GOOGLE IT) Do you think aussies care about wild life that are basically road kill and a hindrance to money making? Well some tax payers and humans work against the tide in conservation or perhaps just conversation but that is a tiny minority of harassed citizens. 

But 'the Depps' act great advert for 'Nobody Land' idiocy – the whole country is stolen wealth – we have a black history, a pinky white present and a multicultural future. We don’t treat everybody equal - google for a few examples; indigenous deaths in custody, fight for native rights and title,  detention centres, death of two females per week, rape and assault rates etc. Equal? please 'worlds most liveable cities'– rewash your brain with reality – check out Struggle Street SBS – when skips and aussies aren’t mimicking the cultures they criticise,  that IS the prison colony of flesh eating, alcohol sodden menacingly mean spirited genetic waste products. And the whole Continent or island semantics – the definition depends on the continent model used being the seven, six, or five continent model. As citizens of the colony we understand we need a boat or plane to get off, we ain’t walking to any other country – think alcatraz but as a big desert and even if you don’t want to get off there is the Australia Tax for remembrance.  G'day welcome to the land down under – now the planet can see why we are the arse hole of the globe. Cheers and  a combo quote of two 'charming' aussies 'dumb cunt buggering off'

Well, any sensible Aussie does not care that you feel that way but we are glad that their stupidity has highlighted the fact that you should not smuggle animals etc into Australia.  They were lucky to get off so lightly frankly.  It was barely a slap on the hand.  We do not have rabies, amongst other diseases of concern, here in Australia.  They risked introducing it to our country because they did not follow some simple safety procedures.  No sympathy here.  And you can troll me as much as you like I won't be replying.  Rabies is unsurvivable and horrible and we do not want it.  Go Barnaby Joyce.  I don't like that man particularly but I totally agree with what he did when those dogs were brought here.  They are damned lucky (particularly Heard) and I think it stinks that they got off so lightly.  $1,000 didn't even cover the costs of the police who had to keep everybody at bay for their safety, let alone the Court costs etc.  Had they followed proper procedures this could have been totally avoided and Australia's biosecurity would have been protected properly.",On A Serious Note,18,2016-04-18T23:35:41Z
