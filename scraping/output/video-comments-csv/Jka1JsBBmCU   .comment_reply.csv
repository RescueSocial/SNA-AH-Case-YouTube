Also the situation with Johnny and Amber is a perfect example of why gender stereotypes hurts everyone.

No medication = Alex gets aggressive with themselves and starts having flashbacks that makes me lose myself into my own mind. And JESUS CHRIST am i in pure self hatred right now. All the things i find out of self defense and out of a final effort to get the pain to stop just come back and haunt me. shit. Talk to my alter, they are sending me back into the system.

hewwooooooooooo. Who you? Why you being a weirdo? We don't talk to strangers. Imma get my dad.

sorry. Cleo takes over very easily sometimes. She is meant to be in bed, and i know you are reading this Cleo.

i apologise. The usual fronter, alex, the one born into the body from the bodies birth, has been struggling with her PTSD and self harm recently. I assure you, that anything you have been called, apart from the hurtfully true ones, are entirely false. Believe me when i say hurtfully true. She called me an Axl Rose wannabe just because i came into existance as a protector and was based on him. And that i will not ever be as successful. She is usually the cute one. But due to... well a VERY abusive childhood, she has me, cleo, alice, charlie, Mae, and of course... well no.. Trevor is an attempted murderer so we lock him up in the hidden depths of the system. We thought she was ready to come back out, but she clearly isn't. She is however soending the weekend in the mountains down the road, so she should be ship shape to continue this conversation with a clear head. But ofcourse thay will not happen because you think she is crazy.

which makes you a stinky!

Johnny: There can be NO physical vi0lence
Amber: I can't promise you i won't ge physical again.  (she means she WON'T promise)
And this exchange.. Johnny:  I was laying in bed watching television, man…. Amber: I f'd up last night. I'm not going to defend myself. You can't blame me for going to the finish line (this means she punched him) when that's where you drive it… (blames Johnny for her vi0lence i guess because he was watching tv)

32,UgwbzjR86aALuVx1BX14AaABAg,Rock Candy,"@DmDaPDm i hate her behavior - i do know she had a troubled childhood that contributed to her vi0lence but she is a criminal who has created false allegations against JD.  When Johnny gets some justice i'll move on.  this video is saying Jason is difficult because he rips pages from books and ""pity me"" amber has her property damaged. hahaha so funny - or not so funny depending on your view.   Well i don't find it funny that she puts down Momoa like she's morally superior yet lied about donating $3.5 million to sick children, severed Depp's finger with a vodka bottle, put a cigarette out on his cheek and lied about DV allegations against her by him.  so yes J4J.  Also if you know anything about Amber you know those books ARE props and Momoa supports her - he doesn't put her down.  You can have the final say here.  I'm tired of listening to people defend her right now.",2021-07-06T14:23:01Z,0
33,UgwbzjR86aALuVx1BX14AaABAg,DmDaPDm,"@Rock Candy Also lol...Why do you think Johnny is the victim? I’ve tried to see if he’s innocent but nothing confirms he was a victim, she may have lied but she’s been exposed, but that doesn’t make his actions any better. This is why I don’t get the investment, if he was truly some innocent man I think more people would be speaking up for him. 

They both were in a drug filled abusive relationship, and while it’s unfair slightly that he’s been punished more financially, that’s not solely Amber’s fault. He has to take blame.",2021-07-06T14:14:06Z,0
34,UgwbzjR86aALuVx1BX14AaABAg,DmDaPDm,"@Rock Candy Who said lying about charity is the same? Who is saying Jason Mamoa is a bad guy? No one. This is what I mean by blind rage, you’re so angry you’re exaggerating stuff to keep fuelling your anger.

You’re calling her a liar, but you’re verging on doing the same thing...’prop books?’ Momoa putting her down. 

Don’t let your hate for her turn you into her. You should move on, it’s unhealthy for you.",2021-07-06T14:04:03Z,0
35,UgwbzjR86aALuVx1BX14AaABAg,Rock Candy,"@DmDaPDm on the side of the v1ctim/survivor Johnny.  I just tired of Amber pushing this story about her being a v1ctim and how Momoa gets put down because he supposedly ripped pages from her ""prop"" books.  But guess what she claimed in a court of law and on TV she gave $3.5 million to sick children hospital.  She personally got thanked by the hospital and got positive PR for 4 years and a ruling in a UK court case that she wasn't a gold digger because of her charity. Now there is proof it  was a grandiose lie and admitted by her own lawyer - NOT paid - ZERO paid - NOTHING.  Even when found out - still...she donates nothing. So when are we going to stop pretending that lying about donating money to dying children is the same as pranking people.",2021-07-06T12:41:17Z,0

38,UgwkJYn7YCmeO3d9KLJ4AaABAg,Rock Candy,yeah that's a lie.  johnny is known for deeply respecting his fans and there is many years of video evidence where he signs autograph after autograph and speaks directly  to fans.

39,UgxCCWKqCOaDhoHBpgp4AaABAg,Rock Candy,like i've told other people in this chat.  Amber likes to have stories where she is a v1ctim and she likes to put other people down especially men who are in a leading role which is what she wants.  She is a pathological liar and this story is sus because it puts Momoa down and it turns her to a v1ctim.  i think there are two possibilities - he made a joke about doing it and she decided to run with it to the media and he isn't going to correct her  and the other option is he may have ripped pages out of her book because he noticed she wasn't reading it and she only uses it as a prop for photo ops.  My money is on the first option though.,2021-07-06T03:44:23Z,0
40,Ugwf9CFstcXYJ_T4nEN4AaABAg,Ama Cela,"Apparently, her physical appearance is subjective because I have always found her to be the average, girl next door American blonde. Nothing special.

41,Ugzfm-_DZMyInrQ8-0N4AaABAg,Rock Candy,Amber is a pathological liar.  She makes up stories with an element of truth like Momoa joked about doing that and he likes doing pranks.  She then tells the media this and he won't care to correct her publicly.  The reason she does this is because it makes her look like a v1ctim and it takes down Momoa in people's eyes which she relishes.  She is jealous because he has a leading role and she actually doesn't like men that much.  So i would take her story with a grain of salt.,2021-07-06T03:51:59Z,0

43,Ugw4NVd3YhwJR_Zs7qN4AaABAg,Rock Candy,that's a story she loves to tell but is sus because she is a pathological liar.  This is the type of lie she truly loves because it puts Jason down while turning herself into a v1ctim.  He may have made a joke about it or he noticed she was only using the book as a prop and wasn't really reading it.  She then mentions this story every single chance she gets because it is very satisfying for her to tell it.,2021-07-06T04:03:11Z,0
44,UgyTaTeq6LqNjT5Hlad4AaABAg,Rock Candy,this is a possibility because more and more people are starting to understand the level of her viciousness and criminality.

She has also been caught by lapd bodycam video framing an innocent man (Johnny).

Everyone was urging me to ""get him back""- even the supervisors. I considered the possibility of the pranks escalating to the point where one of us would go stomping off to HR.

Good for Lisa Bonet for protecting her man and his reputation!  I don’t believe Jason would have had the slightest interest in AH past their working relationship but Amber is known to get “involved” with her costars.  JM didn’t need to be put in the position of deflecting her unwanted attention or advances IMO.  Aquaman was Jason’s first major starring role blockbuster film.  He didn’t need it destroyed by someone like AH!  I love that LB had his back!

JM’s wife was there often on set, and she did that stuff with his kids and wife there, too. For his bday, on set, she had a whole group of tribal dancers come out and perform for him, and he even jumps in. He’s so heritage oriented. What I’m trying to say is, his wife is probably feeling significantly disrespected and that’s enough for JM to  I suppose change his behavior around AH moving forward? I’m sure there’s some sort of NDA that was signed where JM or his wife made it outspoken not to have her rejoin the cast for A2, but the side eye 👀 from your wife on set should be all he needs to go to work, keep making them money, and also be the “neutral party.” Long talks at home about what scum AH is as probably taken place during the making of the first Aquaman. I certainly wouldn’t be happy if I were JM’s wife. AH seems like she’s just a clout chasing hoe who uses famous men to get movie deals and support. To me, she’s pathological.

Gal Gadot, Ray Fisher, Jason Momoa eventually cut in to co-sign there were issues on set, and pretty much most of the cast either directly complained about this Joss, but that was shocking to see it come from JM. I highly doubt if WB approves AH to stay on Aquaman 2, since she’s been in just about everything Justice League-related as well, she’s too far invested…he won’t complain about it, despite the morality issues. I’m sure he agrees with all of us that she’s trash and shouldn’t be afforded the opportunity to film a single other movie ever again, but he wants to get his money too so 🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️ it’s a shitty situation bc Jason Momoa IS Aquaman. They made Aquaman cool bc of JM, so you’d think he’d have that kind of “pull” but the people in suits funding the film will just laugh and tell him to mind his business. Do y’all agree or do you think he would actually have some positive  results against AH if he legit went public about not wanting to work with her?",2021-10-17T23:03:53Z,1

194,Ugw-4pmqceEyDmg0QnN4AaABAg,Chemichael Traces,"@RCTaliesin I guess maybe I have a unique perspective on all this because I live in LA and I between all the fucked up relationships that I have had a seen a shit bed, a missing finger, and some he said she said bullshit going on with the media, that doesn’t seem that extreme to me, that just sounds like Thursday to me. Pooping the bed…yeah gross but that type of thing happens more than you think. I once had a girl put all my clothes into a pile and piss all over them because she thought I was cheating on her (I wasn’t…yet, but started to shortly after that incident). As far  as the finger goes, i don’t think she meant to take his finger off, I’ve known so many people who get into fights with their significant other and throw things, sometimes not even meant to hit the person just as an outburst of negative passion, but then it does hit the person and it fucks them up and then they are like what did I just do. I am not condoning any of this or saying that is acceptable behavior, I’m just saying that it happens in relationships. When people fall in love they open themselves up to another person in a way that makes them extremely vulnerable and a lot of times, especially in LA people don’t take that seriously enough, so people get hurt, and hurt people lash out. Does that make them horrible people? I don’t think so. If somebody enjoys hurting the other person or uses fear as a control method, then I would be more likely to say they aren’t a very good person, but often even then if you get to know to the abuser you will often find a fragile psyche being hidden behind a mask of violence and fear, often the victims of past abuse themselves. Add fame to the mix and you have Amber and Johnny. People in Los Angeles have a tendency to be a bit vapid (that may be a bit of an understatement) and I think one of the reasons we want to root for Johnny in this circumstance is because he is one of the more real personalities in la la land, so when you lay all this out it makes Amber look pretty horrible, and maybe she is, I have never met the girl, but when I look at the two of them I just see two people that for whatever reason followed their passion when they met and then realized later that they weren’t compatible. Obviously Johnny must have seen something in her to marry her. He’s not an idiot, and he probably has chicks throwing themselves at him all the time so it’s not like he can be easily taken advantage of from a place of desperation. They loved each other at one point, and then they didn’t. Now imagine the worst breakup you have ever had, and imagine among things like broken hearts, pet/child/plant custody issues, seeing your ex with someone new, you are also on a reality tv show and everyone is watching you and chiming in their opinion of you in real time. I have always believed reality television is fundamentally impossible because when you are on tv you aren’t being real. No one is. Aside from the element of producers planning the issues that arise on the show and the person who conducts the interviews of the testimonial segments egging the drama on, just on a fundamental level people act differently when they know they are being watched. Now imagine that you can’t stop your reality tv show. It’s like the Truman show, except you know about it, so everything you do or say in a public place or to any other person could end up in print or on tv and then analyzed and memed and joked about don’t you thing you would tend to be a bit more reserved and dishonest from time to time. I actually accept that because I don’t really think it’s anyone business what goes on behind these peoples closed doors, and if they want to lie about it or deflect questions, it’s their right to do so. So I think that accounts for a lot of the he said she said media bullshit. The one part I will say was foul play on her part was trying to purposely play up the abuse to torpedo his career. That was bad form and I will not defend her on that one point. The rest of it just sounds like love gone sour with a healthy dose of tmz to me and I have seen and lived through enough of that in my life it doesn’t really phase me anymore, I hope I have cleared up a bit where I am coming from. I tend to be an extremely empathetic person so I always try to walk a mile in someone’s shoes before I pass judgment on any particular situation",2021-08-01T05:38:39Z,0
