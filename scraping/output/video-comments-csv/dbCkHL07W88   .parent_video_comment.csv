2,UgzhQd9dWr_w33734hp4AaABAg,"As long as there's no bias against DC Films or the Fantastic Beasts franchise, we should keep the personal stuff away from filming!",Niko Panther,1,2020-09-02T13:27:17Z
3,UgyAnryWgjG2hm_mjLF4AaABAg,"As much as I’m disappointed about what Amber has done with all this controversy, she  did a good job portraying Mera. I’m not gonna deal with the CANCEL culture stuff. If Wb didn’t make a fuss to fire Ezra ( cus of that video that’s quite unclear), I don’t see them doing it for Amber. They’re trying as much to keep some kinda continuity in the DCEU with these characters rather than just recasting. I’ll still support the movie, once the quality is good",Anthony Lewis,3,2020-09-02T12:28:47Z

We all do stuff we are not proud of..""Let those without sin cast the first stone"". Fricken cancel culture needs to just fook off. She is awesome as Mera...thats all I'm bothered about.",George,0,2020-09-02T11:26:14Z
