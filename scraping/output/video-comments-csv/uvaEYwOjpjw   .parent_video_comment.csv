Again, in my humble opinion, it appears that J.D was found guilty in the court of public opinion which led to him being persecuted/punished by W.B‚Äôs acting as judge, jury & executioner prior to the findings in a Court of Law!

I (as someone who has been on the receiving end of a mans ability to physically over power and cause unbearable pain & suffering), find it completely unfathomable that in 2021, the concept of us living in a world where the powers that be are of the unbelievably narrow minded view that only men commit acts of violence and that these ‚Äòpowers that be‚Äô cannot conceive of the idea that females are very capable‚Ä¶.in-fact equally and in some cases much more than capable of being abusers and committing acts of violence against their boyfriends/husbands & causing just as much pain and suffering.

97,UgzoTLC5gPbSbqkRFi54AaABAg,"It makes me extremely upset she is allowed to remain and it is for so many reasons.

Attempting to ruin JD simply out of spite. She IS the abuser YET she attempted to frame him to turn attention OFF of the abuse she has caused JD and others. Slowly  others will come forward about the abuse she acted against them - more than her sister. However, go back and look at the attacks A did to her sister *way more than just sibling rivalry.*  JD was fired from movies based on hearsay, there was NO proof he did ANY of the things he was accused of when he was removed from movies. Yet, it is being found out that she actually DID this and she is being kept? Epitome of lies and disgrace.

SHE single handled did MORE damage to/for ACTUAL VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC ABUSE. Giving a platform for the ABUSER to discuss DV is absurd. She STOLE other's story of what happened to them. DV VICTIMS have to go through a lot of conflict within themselves before they even TALK about the violence they were put through. ACTUAL VICTIM where they have to basically reprogram their mind to remove ALL the negative comments and actions their abuser REPEATEDLY told them. Abusers brainwash their Victims - telling victim they are unworthy, horrible, no one cares about them, no one will believe this abuse occurred, etc. Abusers take every tiny drop of self doubt a person has and then turns it into a billboard and tells the victim daily those self doubts ARE REAL. Abusers are basically psychological terrorists who will completely destroy a Victim's mindset and often times abusers find people they admire for the qualities they will later destroy in that person.  Can you imagine having someone do some of the most awful things you can think of to you - then allowing that person to say YOU did those horrible things to them? She took HIS story of HIS abuse and made it hers. Everything A accused JD of doing is actually what she did to JD. 

How much evidence do they need showing she did these things? Recordings where she admits to violence she did against JD have come out. Emails proving she lied. Photos showing that she painted on her bruises. Police Body Cams showing no damage she described at the apartment after he left - proving she lied, her friends lied, and that she in fact orchestrated the choas she claims he did. AND THEY WANT TO PROMOTE HER HORRID BEHAVIOR??? She is flesh and blood Cruella Deville walking around. 
Believe me when I say more lies and deceit she perpetrated will come out. Her cruelty did not just target 2 or 3 people. Allowing her to continue in movies with no repercussion for how she treats other will end in disaster. It allows others to think the way to get ahead is to abuse and torture others. She does NOT need to be presented as any type of role mode.... unless she actually faces consequences for her actions.

2) In London Amber had strong ties to the judge, friends with judges wife and son or stepson I forget which.

3) One of a narcissists"" strong traits is to be the ""perfect person"" to their victims in the beginning of a relationship. However, unbeknownst to them she is gathering evidence that would shame their victims. That includes digging up dirt on them through other people or going through their victims stuff or whatever it would take to dig dirt up on them. Also, another advantage of them doing this is that they get to know the victim more and so they can ""mirror"" them and share interests with their victim which they may not even have an interest in.

 Especially in regards to Anything online (twitter, internet searches, l'Oreal contract). 
Elon Has also previously bragged about how much power and sway he has in Hollywood (Financing movies etc; he also fancies himself a comedic lead actor!?!)
Not to mention his power and connections overseas ( he most definitely had some involvement in Acquiring the Judge for the Sun Defamation case, even if it was merely an introduction)

The big question is Why He is continuing to fund and support her despite knowing that she is a manipulative liar, and why is Grimes so okay with Elon doing so and seeing Amber behind her back?........ More and more it seems like their Embryos are being used as leverage, 
 Or Elon is fully showing himself to be the adulterous, evil, underhanded and manipulative
 dickand liar that he is....
 for him the real world is just a live action game of sims, where he uses his money and power to get and get people to do whatever he wants; despite being wrong.

If you really stop to consider Musk's Power and reach in so many various sectors, it is Terrifying and shocking!.

I do think he was jealous of Johnny for being with Amber he got a taste of the fish pie whilst Amber was still with Johnny and wanted more, sure he‚Äôs a knob for cheating on his wife and with another mans wife but I do think he truly believed what she said when she told him Johnny was abusive because he was blinded by love just like Johnny was. He even said in a magazine interview that AH was into science and all the things he loved just like she love bombed Johnny by researching him she told Johnny she had seen all his movies and was into the same books and music as him, she even started dressing like Johnny.

If the Australians do not cave and go ahead with the perjury trial AND refuse to give her a visa, then she will have to utter another lie to explain why she will not be filming in Australia.. She will definitely put the blame on JD which will make her look even more foolish, desperate, vindictive, vicious and all the other applicable words starting with 'v' which will hopefully turn more people against her. When JD (hopefully) wins VA case, it will be blasted all over social media because not even the scummy journalists will be able to resist a juicy article like that. If they don't, channels like yours will report on it. If there is any hope for mankind, once JD won, even those who had still defended her and/or decided to watch the movie, will not watch the movie. But the most wonderful thing is that the VA court date is in April 2022 (if I am correct) and the release date for the AM2 movie is currently in DECEMBER 2022, so those who believe the truth will have a blast in blasting her and WB with irrefutable proof. I do not think it will tank at the Box Office because her super duper rich FAN is going to have to dump a massive amount of money to buy tickets and to make it look as if trillions of people watched the movie. He hopefully will eventually come to the realisation that she will now expect/demand that he has to back every movie she wants to play in.  That said, I am a cynic. People are fickle. I am convinced that some of JD's firm supporters who had sworn high and low they will never, EVER watch the movie will end up watching the movie. They will argue that if they spit at the screen each time she appears in a scene, it will show their contempt and disgust, forgetting if they pay for the movie, the figures will go up.

As for 'writing around' actors, I'm even less of a fan of that than I am of recasting (by the way, if you're going to fancast people, at least choose someone like Teresa Palmer, who actually looks like Amber, and not frickin Emilia Clarke, who looks as much like Amber as Maggie Gyllenhaal looks like Katie Holmes - way to take us out of the continuity...)
