I feel bad for men now having to adapt to the world going in women's favour all the time. I watched it as a kid when a girl had a grudge against my brother and accused him of rape (lying) she then admitted she made it up. But I'm so sick of women getting off Scott free.

IRL if a woman her size was slammed against a table and it broke, her spine would probably be broken. She she shouldn't even be able to walk around much less have nothing but a couple scratches) and fanciful and convoluted, something you'd see in a movie, odds are it's fake. She apparently is quite a good actress, and believes her audience is stupid and can't tell the difference between a movie and real life.

89,UgyPLzYyVIzSD3ZJyfN4AaABAg,"You know, all you have to do is listen to her-- the things that she says, ways that she says them-- and you can tell in an instant that she is a classic physical, mental, and emotional abuser who blames her victims for what she is _""forced""_ to do to them. That she, in ways, believes that there is nothing wrong with what she says and does because she is ""made to do it"". That tells me everything that I need to know. Those kinds of things still live in my dreams and steal my sleep-- and although my mother made sure that her children were never touched, psychological and emotional damage is forever. All you have to do is be there and see it all for it to damage you for life.

 At the same time, she has a narrowed objective of exactly what she wants to do to him-- to ruin and break him... a man. She feels powerful. It is calculated, cold, and narcissistic-- and probably sociopathic. It's a power play. Because I grew up around severe violent domestic abuse during my childhood and early years, I know all of the things that they say, and I know all of the tactics to manipulate and deceive, to make other people doubt themselves. I also know that they _always escalate._ What I find even more ironic is that some people ""circling the wagons"" around her, are those who have suffered and experienced DV themselves in their lives... and they don't seem to be seeing those same exact patterns also--  hearing, and recognizing *_exactly_* the signals that I am getting from her? I just don'.t understand that.

Yes, she knows exactly what she is doing, but at the same time she just cannot grasp that anything is her fault. She does not believe that she is in the wrong. Because he is ""bigger"", ""stronger"", etc., there is just no way that he could be her victim-- some people really believe that. If you don't fight back-- fire with fire-- then that is only because you are a ""coward"" or ""weak"", not because you don't want to harm them back, or you just don't have it in you to do it back. SMH. I don't see how abused women (men?) who have helped her along the way have not recognized the same things. I'm so confused. Is it really because she is a woman? Whatever she gets away with will be a ""win"" for their causes? I can't find anything that makes sense in the ""DV Advocates"" who have stood behind and beside her. I mean, she has every marker, every signal, every trait, and every thought process that identifies her easily.

96,Ugz7NZ8yZaD_P77UI6x4AaABAg,"Ughh she‚Äôs nasty. She remembers me of a similar situation my dad went through a few years ago. He dated a younger woman for 2 years, he in the beginning was very straight forward and told her he didn‚Äôt want any kids or to get married. 2 years later she was obsessed about getting pregnant with my dad, I guess she thought that would be a way of to secure the relationship. So she started following him everywhere and listening to his calls, she wouldn‚Äôt even let him talk to me. One day she became violent and though herself at my dad punching him, he had to run away and scape from his own house, leaving her there. He had to stay with me and my mom, the very next day I went to the house to get her out and close the door since he ran out and didn‚Äôt had time to close it. When I arrived to the house there were a bunch of police officers outside talking to her. She was wearing a cervical collar and  had scratches on her arms. She claimed my dad attacked her violently with a knife. Insane allegations, my dad has never been a violent person. Anyway, I asked her to take her things and leave, she used to live 3 houses from my dads so she did. On her way our she took a knife from the kitchen with a paper towel and said that was the knife he used to attack her and that‚Äôs she was talking it as evidence. She also made a huge mess in the house and broke several things, she claimed since my dad left the house and didn‚Äôt close it someone got in in the middle of the night. At some point one of the cops said to me that if someone would‚Äôve broke in it would‚Äôve have stollen objects and nothing was missing so it was clearly it was her the one who racked the place. A few days letter my dad got served with a letter of her lawyer including a lawsuit claiming that my dad kept her hostage, that he was violent and even raped her at some points and I think she even said he was a pedophile. Insane allegations so my dad lawyered up. A few months later she stopped the lawsuit, I guess she realized she didn‚Äôt had any evidence to support her claims. Weeks later my dad ran into her at a mall and she begged him to forgive her and to get back to her lol. There are crazy violent women out there.lll and Amber is one of them, I can‚Äôt believe how theres still some people that refuse to see the truth just because ‚Äúshe‚Äôs a woman‚Äù, even after all this evidence.

165,Ugyt8EEISzqlqFfiKzZ4AaABAg,"I think this is how she controlled her parents ‚Äî with bullshit vagueness, talking in circles, and finally throwing a violent tantrum, so they back off.  It worked well enough so that in the midst of all this, her father referred to her as his ""baby girl.""  How he must have spoiled her.",Ernie Lederman,7,2020-05-06T17:43:01Z
166,Ugxed-YNTIg9DlPf5UN4AaABAg,"Based on the many recordings I've listened to and the many witness testimonies, I'm pretty positive she is a narcissistic sociopath. People like that who don't feel normal empathy or emotions tend to start mimicking it from an early age in an attempt to blend in and manipulate. She's probably spent her whole life ""acting."" The funny part is she can do it in movies, but she doesn't realize how entirely fake and ridiculous it comes across to rational people in real life. 

I really feel for Johnny getting sucked in by a cruel abuser like this. They tend to be very skilled at love bombing and turning on the charm when it suits their goals. Then when they inevitably tear it away, their victim is left on a confusing roller coaster of approval seeking and chasing that dopamine hit that the abuser initially dolled out in spades. It's hard for normal people to wrap their mind around how anyone could be so devoid of compassion and love, so they find themselves making excuses for the abuser's behavior, self-blaming, or just trying to constantly appease them to avoid conflict. The gaslighting and up/down drama creates an addictively toxic combination for a gentle and empathetic partner. It's easy for even very intelligent, talented, capable people to get sucked in because the manipulation is so subversive and almost intriguing at first. Finally though the victim realizes, just as Johnny did, that the person they loved never actually existed at all. I wish peace and healing for him. ‚ù§Ô∏èüôè 

The only thing worse than getting wrapped up emotionally in one of these toxic people is also having the painful saga unfold in the public eye. I'm very glad the truth has come to light! His patience, gentleness, and moral character really shines thru on the other side of this, whereas her's does as well -- in the opposite fashion.

232,UgxRXqw3Y4HJny9aMkN4AaABAg,"Cluster B Personality disorder. If those bruises are real, they are likely self inflicted to sell an 'image.'  I lived with a cluster B.  That was something she did after I walked out of a fight - deliberately injured herself.  That gives then gives optics of 'I'm being abused.' And feelings over facts. Cluster B's internal dialogue is a twisted pretzel of contortions to make the real world bend to a narrative they want to sell. In this case, Depp takes extreme measures to get away from her and she flies into a rage due to his absence triggering her abandonment fears, she gets violent physically and verbally.   When she pauses if asked if she's abused him, that stone silence for 20-30 seconds, I know it all too well.  Rather than face the RESPONSIBILITY of their behavior,  the cluster B brain goes through contortions  to justify and spin a tale of why they were defending themselves.  Optics again. The more you try to dig deeper the more you get a fantasy narrative based on cluster b's agenda rather than what happened. The recordings of her actual voice was masterful in pinning her down and she even tried to deflect those away, but she couldn't.  Reality and ownership in it is something that is very difficult for them because they have to face that dark part of themselves - which they won't do.  They have an agenda, which is to protect the image they are promoting.  Heard's identity is so fragile and she is so entitled,  dismissing Depp's ""clocking"" in the jaw, which she most certainly did - makes it all the more clear.  That was assault and she just diminished it to him being dramatic. And people still defend her?  This is a masterclass on why once you suss out a cluster b, you understand the psychological terror they are capable of inflicting on those nearest to them.  The court system knows this too now.  Cluster B's  like Heard, event though she professes she wants it to stop, she doesn't. It's what she does, not what she says.  Rather than settle it quietly and move on like most celebrities would want to do,  this is her punishing Depp for leaving her.  THAT is what her actions say by continuing years on to fight about this in the courts. 'You left me, I'm going to continue to punish you by any means necessary.'  Words mean nothing. Depp is the target of her unseen internal rage.  That's why it doesn't stop.   Ugly business.",Stephanie Sandlin,10,2020-02-19T11:01:13Z

They use the same logical fallacies you use over and over. Same victim blaming, same redefining terms, same spin, and the stupider ones can't keep their story straight.
And Amber, tho you play victim on TV, in real life, you don't know that you don't know what a victim is. By saying 'I hate being a victim! I won't be one!' you reveal that you don't know you don't decide if you're a victim, the perpetrator makes you a victim. You fight to survive it. But you insult and blame all victims, with your statement that disparages real victims.
#HeardYouLie
I hope you go down.
Of course, with your personality disorder, you'll probably 'attempt' a drastic, dramatic move. 
To get the sympathy back.
You hurt real victims. Because you tried to use all of us as allies in your lying cause. We all stand shoulder to shoulder, but with real victims of all genders. You thought you didn't need any evidence because we have fought so hard for women and children to be believed and supported.

What is the typical emotional state of a battered woman who has to tell her story in front of others? Traumatized, perhaps shaking occasionally because of the trauma, frightened as to what might happen to her when she talks, humble and seeking support and hoping she will be believed, shamed by what has happened to her and embarrassed when having to talk about specific details, but clear and forthright when she tells her story without hesitation or hysteria, and above all deeply grief-stricken, often with spontaneous eruptions of tears or gasps of pain.  You can't fake any of that.  And Amber Heard is no where near a good enough actress to even make an attempt at faking any of that.

You have walked the line of presenting everything as it is, and not how it can be perceived in favor of either side. You leave it for each of us to interpret the information in our own way.

559,UgzJF-UhMa9Bv7tZ8714AaABAg,"I've been wanting to say this 4 ages now even if I get hate: So when Amber Heard alleged that Johnny Depp beat her violently, she would have had much more noticeable brusies than the pictures show in her declaration after the alleged assault. The pictures (in all honesty) of her alleged ""injuries"" don't look like injuries at all. If they were injuries they would have been much more noticeable and NOT small... well I wouldn't even call them marks. I don't even know what to call them, just something that looks like it has been painted on. (Probably) 
Anyway, the day after her thing at the court or whatever, why would her ""brusies"" suddenly disappear like magic? Hmmm.... Coincidence or purpose? I mean brusies don't suddenly disappear like *click sound* and then come back again. 
You can tell me that maybe she used makeup to cover up her injuries. She could have, but not even huge amounts of concealer, foundation ect could cover her injuries up if she was supposedly beaten violently by Johnny Depp.
If she had been abused and there visible evidence of abuse on her face then she could say without lying ""I've got evidence that Johnny abused me."" That kind of thing.
But what really gets me is, Amber admitted to abusing Johnny, yet people are still like *pfftt* whatever she's a woman, women can't beat up men. YES they can. Looks at all Johnny Depp's ever growing list of evidence, witnesses lists, CTV footage. Then look at Amber Heard's. Oh yes that's right, she hasn't (in my opinion) really got any evidence, witnesses or CTV footage. 
And how the hell has she managed to ""get away"" with it, despite Johnny's evidence that he was the victim NOT the absuer that she was alarmingly and successfully painted him as. Is it cause people just automatically believe a women? I'll admit (to prove a point) that when I heard about this I immediately believed Amber Heard. But as soon as I did there was a huge (I can't emphasize that word enough) huge doubt in my mind that Johnny Depp abused Amber.
Looking into it more I them realised no, Johnny has never laid a hand on anyone in a violent way. Because Amber couldn't get her own way and (not meaning this to offend) a few days after Johnny's mother passing, it was pretty coincidental that then this whole abuse thing then came out right? You know, Amber lying about the abuse thing and selling all her evidence and photos to the media. I'm no lawyer or Sherlock Holmes, (and I'm only 13) but I can debunk stuff good.
You know the more I watch these videos, it seems more possible to me she is just doing this for money. 
And I also noticed when the audio tape was played, after she told Johnny she was sorry; it was a lie right away. If she was truly sorry she wouldn't have: hit Johnny in the head by kicking or pushing the bathroom door, clocked him, punched him in the jaw and face, threw objects at him, pushed him ect 
Strange how there's no retaliation from Johnny, oh that's right, he didn't retaliate, because he puts up with it and probably still loves Amber. And I kinda get that. 
I'm glad that the trial date is set for Feb or August 2020, Johnny will hopefully get justice, and his life back.",Grace Baker-Firth,24,2019-12-29T20:35:35Z

Johnny Depp, the male, turns out to be the real victim while Amber Heard, the female, was the one abusing him the entire time. She publicly ""exposed"" him with a story of deceit during a vulnerable time where empathy and awareness was being given to actual #MeToo victims who were brave enough to share their stories and by pretending to be a victim herself, she became a feminist icon, spokesperson for L'Oreal, etc., while people publicly shamed and demanded for the ""cancellation"" of Johnny Depp over a picture she posted with a bruise on her face.

It was clearly a toxic relationship, but from everything I have seen and heard so far on it, she is lying through her teeth & attempting to capitalize on the MeToo movement...which leaves me absolutely furious at her. My ex husband came within a hairs breath of killing me (his last assault left me with 14 broken bones and in a coma for 3 months due to a TBI from a cranial fracture after throwing me headfirst through a solid oak door). I‚Äôm not saying all the abuse was that bad - he also emotionally and verbally abused me, and I had to fight like hell to get away from him. I left with nothing but the clothes on my back and my kids, and it took years of physiotherapy and psychotherapy to become whole again. 

I‚Äôm also not saying Mr. D was an angel. He does have substance abuse issues, clearly. But I honestly do believe that if anyone was truly abused in this relationship, it was NOT Ms. H, and I pray Mr. D is completely exonerated. I‚Äôm sure he has said some really horrible things to her at times, and she him...but as I said, from everything I‚Äôve been able to find on this, the abuse victim here is NOT Ms. H; it‚Äôs Mr. D.

This has got to be so horribly humiliating for him, which is exactly what that woman is after. What a horrible person. I hope she gets blacklisted in Hollywood and has to issue a formal public apology for her lies. She may not realize it yet, but she is finished in Hollywood. NOBODY will want to work with trash who spewed such absolute sh*t and tried to cash in on a movement meant to help actual victims of sexual assault and other violence - or at least I sure as heck wouldn‚Äôt want to!!

I have one quibble.
A date error by Blair Berk might have given a way out of Heard committing perjury in one example.

Question page 387 of Heard deposition ""Did you throw on May 15 -- I'm Sorry -- December 30, 2015 a can of paint thinner while on the island of Exuma at Johnny Depp and hit him in the head?""

Question page 388 ""Did you or did you not throw a can at Johnny Depp on December 15, 2015?""
Answer ""No"".
If the can-throwing date was December 30 2015 and Heard realised Berk's error, Heard was truthful in answering ""No"". For this to be the case, Heard must know what she did and on what dates to recognise the error and take the opportunity to answer simply and truthfully to a misstated question. Despite all her wavering, did Heard pick up that December 15 was day before James Corden and  December 30 was on the island.",TwoNoisyLorrikeets,10,2019-09-16T05:57:44Z

Look at her body language and facial expressions (some of which you have cleverly screen shot for this video). I‚Äôve even seen several videos of body language experts breaking down her testimony and exposing her unconscious tells that signal her falsified accounts of the events in question and her underlying personality of selfishness and vanity.

Thankfully I'm one of the many that have always believed in Johnny & always knew he was/is innocent & she to be a compulsive liar. 
NOW, for every single person who has ever doubted Johnny Depp in any way, shape or form & ever blindly believed her words simply because she's a woman, or because she screamed the loudest, or stood on every pedestal offered with her ""I'm a victim"" stories. You were wrong & always have been wrong. You were blinded by the fact she manipulatively & publicly lied & you simply accepted it.
I'm pretty sure being the decent guy that Johnny Depp is - He will wholeheartedly accept your apology. After-all the truth is already out there & Johnny will prove this further on 3rd February 2020.",LM-JohnnyDeppfan,19,2019-09-14T11:05:22Z

Quote from Kate Moss's 2010 biography from a bouncer at the Viper Room: ""I've heard people describe Johnny as shy and mild-mannered. He is when he's sober. When he's drunk, he gets a bad, bad temper.""

It must take a lot for a BOUNCER on Depp's payroll (one of an army of paid entourage), to say that he has a bad, bad temper. That is not the kind of thing you say about normal men. That means that he is VIOLENT and NASTY when drunk.

I was once a fan, many years ago, and as a fan (since the early 90's), I was always aware of how often he or his colleagues/gf's would reference his temper in interviews and how lightly those admission were taken by the media. I remember Winona Ryder saying how he used to smash up her room (though didn't touch her), and then there was the incident where he was actually arrested for smashing up a hotel room while a 21-year-old Kate Moss cowered in the corner.

I remember him repeatedly bragging about his ""hellish temper"" (his words) and his threats to ""gauge out eyeballs, cut off noses"" of paparazzi that got near him.

When Amber filed for divorce a day after his mother died, I knew something serious must have happened for her to do that. When I read her DV restraining order application, saw the pictures, read the witness statements, I knew immediately that there was truth to it as I had seen Depp look completely off his face, drunk or high for several years up to that point and had no doubt that the drugs/alcohol plus his ""hellish temper"" could lead to a very dangerous mix, especially as he is now surrounded by yes-men and paid hangers on.

I watched in horror as he employed a PR army to absolutely annihilate Heard in the court of public opinion. I observed with distress Depp teaching an entire generation of children that when women say that they have been beaten, they are doing it for a payout. He didn't care that that was the lesson that went out or the consequences for abuse victims. He just wanted to save his career and future earnings at all cost.

Depp smashed his hand through a wall in a fight with Amber so badly that he had to leave his $200M movie set and fly home for surgery. Now he s claiming she cut his finger off. I suppose him dipping it in paint and writing EASY AMBER on the mirror was the ""lying gold-digger's"" fault too, right? Would it take you seeing Amber beaten to a pulp with your own eyes before you believe it's true? Even then I imagine, like him, you would say that she set him up.

What must it have taken to believe that there is NO WAY Depp could get drunk, high and violent (despite reports of violence for years, witnesses, photos)? When you hear Depp's side of the story, or hear from all his ""sources"", you don't just take them on board blindly. You think about why you are hearing them. Why did we hear a slurry of horrific stories about Heard just after she filed for divorce? Because there are powerful machines at work behind the scenes that want you to believe she is a wicked, non-human, monster caricature. Those forces are paid for by Depp and his studios/lawyers, propped up by the dozens of people on his payroll, and are vicious and ruthless and will stop at nothing. They include the ""sources"" telling us Depp's mother hated her, the sick sycophant friend calling her a ""demon"", the bodyguards calling TMZ with their laughable version of events whereby she repeatedly hit herself in the face in front of them, the army of PR reps spreading lies about her. There are forces at play here that want to save their billion dollar cash cow.

His own assistant, Stephen Deuters, sent Amber multiple messages, authenticated by an Apple expert, apologizing profusely for Depp's actions and saying that Depp ""cried when he found out he kicked you.""

Here is a quote from IO Tillett Wright about what she witnessed at the Depp house:

""The reports of violence started with a kick on a private plane, then it was shoves and the occasional punch, until finally, in December, she described an all-out assault and she woke up with her pillow covered in blood. I know this because I went to their house. I saw the pillow with my own eyes. I saw the busted lip and the clumps of hair on the floor. I got the phone call immediately after it happened, her screaming and crying, a stoic woman reduced to sobs.""

And I suppose it's acceptable that Depp is accused of punching his colleague on the set of the now-disappeared City of Lies for asking him to wrap up his scenes? In true Depp style, his PR army have now gone on to smear this man and say that Depp attacked him because he made racist comments. Yeah sure. It's always someone else's fault. Everyone else is some sort of lying demon...

And I guess it's normal that on the set of Pirates 5, his behavior was described as a ""trainwreck"", with a drunken Depp keeping the entire crew waiting for hours while having ""violent fights"" with Amber, and then cutting off the tip of his finger and writing ""Easy Amber"" in blood on the mirror, in a continuation of his emotional abuse of his 30-year-old wife.

Maybe the bodyguards suing him for exposing them to ""toxic and dangerous"" conditions where they had to ""wipe substances off his face"" are lying too? And perhaps those pictures showing Amber's closet totally trashed are fake too.

Normalizing the violent behavior of this man and glorifying him because you like his movies is disgusting. Believing his legal army's lies without question is abhorrent.",Monique H,4,2019-09-14T10:16:38Z

They did not have a prenuptial agreement, so the apartments, cars, jewelry and whatever else she got from Depp was hers ANYWAY, INCLUDING the 7 million that she agreed to donate - my guess is in order to avoid a defamation lawsuit directly following the divorce. (I bet Johnny didn't want her to receive a dime of his money, so they must have agreed she donates it all, but as always, she put a positive-to-her spin on these things. To her, it was important to avoid the gold digger label, and that must have been worth the 7 million pledge to her.)


I'm starting to see the humor in this tho, now that the truth is well and truly out and Johnny is safe and sound. Hopefully, at least. Who knows what that crazy bitch will come up with, tho.

Screaming at the top of her lungs that she won't be silenced, but when the time comes to show her proof of her slanderous claims that we ALL know where about Johnny Depp and no other, she runs and hides behind PR/'times up' lawyers. The only person silencing Amber is herself. She wants to keep the evidence from the public, because she doesn't want to be demonized. Well Amber, you should have thought about that before falsely accusing and abusing a beloved actor like Johnny Depp. JD a shy, humble and notoriously private man is fighting for real justice, he wants it all out on the table for the public to see, everything...the good, the bad and the ugly, because he is innocent and has NOTHING to hide. He is the true survivor of Domestic Abuse. It's so obvious Amber Heard is guilty as sin. She is admittedly a perpetrator of violence, a liar and a fraud...she knows it and soon everyone else will too.",Kt.H-talks to holograms,13,2019-09-13T23:14:50Z
863,Ugzf6HcOIE2OtDUHDqp4AaABAg,"I never liked nor trusted Amber Heard. Not for a single second. She has always had a shady history even before meeting Johnny Depp. I know someone who worked with Amber several times and she said Amber was not a nice person. To me, she's the kind of individual who play cutesy airs on impressionable people when she wants something and the minute you don't do that, she turns vile. And I know what I am talking about as I was friends online with a prima donna who behaved like this and so did her kid, who got herself caught up in a scary scandal that has put to tatters the family's reputation. Not only that, Amber reeks of toxicity in every image and body language she exhibits and anybody with enough common sense could sense it out. Can`t even believe that people were naive enough to believe her. Through her cringing deposition on the video, you can see she`s manipulative and she exhibits over acted emotions to catch the most impressionable people.
She's ridiculous!
Whereas for Johnny Depp, he has always had a wonderful reputation with fans and work colleagues. And his former girlfriends/fiancees have all stood by his side. To me, he's a very genuine kind-hearted man who got impressed and fell into a relationship with a toxic witch who was only interested in his money and in exploiting his kindness assets to pull crazy antics that would inevitably affect him and that's it. And those vibrations and shady airs from Amber were there from the minute I saw the first photos of that woman.


As for the reporters who stood by her side like Hadley Freeman, that Rita Skeeter's behaviour doesn't surprise me as she has always attacked people such as Michael Jackson with slanders, which one reporter denounced Hadley as a prejudiced woman with a racist agenda.


As for all those in Hollywood and in the medias who exploited Amber`s slanders to attack Johnny Depp their own way, or have exploited the jealousy-bashing culture surrounding Johnny's name to demean him (ex: Jessica Chastain, Evan Rachel Wood, etc.), I have no sympathy and respect for such scumbags. To me, all the artists who have taken pleasure in attacking Johnny Depp or in demeaning him with their pseudo-judgments are in my boycott list full time.

In the case of Amber and Johnny, the one video she leaked of Johnny going apeshit on his cabinets while Amber meekly asks 'what happened', and reading this transcript where you can tell Johnny is not being very calm.  It becomes clear who the narcissist is.   If you think it's the one being hysterical, you would be mistaken.  This is something most abuse victims can attest to. In front of others or after a fight the victim will often be the one driven to insanity while the narcissist will be completely unaffected.

Johnny, although receiving plenty of backlash from the bull of public opinion, holds up his end of the deal. Amber, however, writes an op-ed that yet again paints Johnny as an abuser, albeit without mentioning his name.

Johnny, feeling the deal has been breached and his name and career is being dragged through the mud, decides to sue. Amber now claims that the op-ed wasn't about Johnny while her lawyers continue to paint him as an abuser who is still abusing her mentally and emotionally by bringing her to court in order to clear his name.

Three times Amber has tried to get the case dismissed while also arguing that Johnny is trying to silence her. She has also asked for a confidentiality or privacy agreement when they go to court, which in effect is another effort to have HIM silenced...at least where the public is concerned. Johnny, who didn't break their previous confidentiality agreement says no to Amber, who did break the earlier agreement.

Absolutely incredible!!",Faust,33,2019-09-13T16:35:46Z

945,Ugym4rfXbXAH65aEEWp4AaABAg,"I think you posted a video or someone else did, about an ex-girlfriend of Amber had been abused by her. And if her ex and Johnny Depp have been physically assult ed by Amber, imagine how many other's there are? Just wondering.... plus, could any of them be called as witnesses for Depp? Do you think as the trial approaches, Amber will settle and ask for the settlement to be sealed? As well as any witness testimony? If she has any sense, she'll try too. And better sooner then later, because I think the evidence is pretty strong for Johnny Depp against her. Plus out of all the so called witnesses that Amber has had in the past, isn't it only two that will go under oath to tell what they saw? Plus, wasn't one of the witnesses way across the country when they said they saw said abuse? 
If this wasn't real, I'd actually think it was a script for a comedy drama. I mean it is pretty dramatic as well as funny. Only thing is, it's a sad twisted real story. As a man I am sure that Johnny didn't want to admit to what was happening to him. He gave up a long relationship for Amber after she played him like a fiddle. I really believe he was in love with her. She on the other hand probably had a list of rich men and a plan on how she was going to get rich off their demise. She'd learn what triggered them and set them off...... just like that night two days after Johnny Depp's mother passed away.",Gail,8,2019-09-13T16:28:01Z

She can scream, distract, slander him once again as  she and her #TimesUp lawyer without ethics are doing right now - her lies will get her in the end. She can scream as loud as she can outside court. Inside court she has nothing to present but lies, defamation, fingerpointing and distraction. Everyone with a single brain cell can see through her lies  (well, except the ones who still believe her, but their number is dwindling). The ones who scream the loudest are the ones who have most to hide. She is done. Happy funeral party February 3rd, 2020. :-)",LoveAndLaughter,8,2019-09-13T16:25:00Z

I mean she went on to say that she only hit Johnny once to save her baby sister (for the sake of God, who calls a grown-up woman their baby sister in court documents?!) only to contradict herself moments later by saying ""whenever he was hit..."". Are people really this blind that they can't see what this woman did?! But let's wait for them to make excuses for her and blame Johnny for the abuse he endured at her hands.
