I think this might qualify as attempting to pervert the course of justice, but I'm no lawyer. 
Besides- Amber wasn't the defendant, it's just that she told lies, that were then printed by a paper. To win, Johnny had to prove that the libel (by The Sun newspaper) had actually done him some harm or damage.

They can certainly order others to make investigations but this was a civil case and it was up to each party to make their own investigations and present them to the court.

As far as pretty girls getting away with stuff such as perjury and much worse, with little more than the bat of an eye, you are completely correct in your suspicion.  The bias is unfortunately all too common and is borne out by the stunning differences in conviction rates and sentences for equivalent crimes. 

This is what concerns me most, that a court will find AH guilty beyond any doubt but will give her no more than a stern talking to and a slap on the wrist.  This is also why she must be shunned and her movies boycotted, because that is the only justice we can be sure of.",2021-05-06T19:11:07Z,1

I live only a few kilometres from Warner Studios where they filmed Aquaman and near where the nameless one stayed with her dogs who, according to reports, were let outside unrestrained to do their business.  This action put my own dogs and the dogs of every other person on the Gold Coast at immediate risk from potential exotic diseases transferred from her dogs' faeces to birds and other scavengers to our pets.

The reason it's unlikely in the UK is simply that the UK has a pretty piss-poor record when it comes to issues of ""he said, she said."" They will typically assume the man is lying or is guilty of something, to the degree that they'll ignore evidence of a woman lying. Same thing happened to me 21 years ago and I'm only now writing an open letter about it after seeing what's happened to JD. I have evidence that the sack of shit that did it to me, who is now a lawyer, BTW, lied through her teeth but have found it impossible to get the police to take an interest. Contrast this with a cousin's stepson and his friend who perverted the course of justice by lying about a speeding offence and they ended up in prison for a few months.

Amber hurd breeched the bio security rules of Australia by taking her dogs into oz without them having the required shots or qurantine time that is required . She went to court in oz for it & had to make a video (cringe) as a slap on the wrist but since then witness statements in the depp vs NGN trial have proven that she lied in court & attempted to get 2 employees to lie for her also. Further evidence has shown that it was always her intention to take the dog's into oz illegally as texts show that she was trying to bribe a vet into signing a paper saying the dogs got the shots at a time frame that made it ok for them to travel there but they still weren't put in the required quarantine centre on arrival. Australia is very strict about their bio security, I'm a kiwi & we are neighbours with oz but they have refused to accept our apples because they feared fire blight, this happened in 1921 & they still refuse to tske our apples.

Your blaming Depp for being a victim, for running away cos she was going to beat him? For locking himself in a bathroom with her kicking hell out of the door trying to beat him and punch him in his face?? Your saying it was depps fault?
Are you for real!!??
She gaslighted him. You can clearly hear it in the tapes.
It's not just ""aggressive"" it's physical and emotional and psychological abuse!!
Why does she not deserve to go to prison for lying in court... Twice!!... Its a serious offence!
Your not making sense... How is this OK... She has been arrested for assaulting her ex partner too, she beat shit out of her sister, she then beat shit out of Depp and ruined the guys reputation and he lost work got fired... She went after him big time... Why is it OK? Is it OK to do these things where you are from... Are there no laws against violence and abuse where you are?
If someone was beating your mum for a year and giving her black eyes and hospitalising her I'm sure u wud want justice for ur mum. Can't let people continue to threaten and abuse people throughout her life.
As for the dogs it's stops diseases from other countries getting into that country they are there for a good reason stops diseases like rabies etc. Ignoring those laws wreaks havoc on the local animal population... Why shud she be allowed to bring in unquarantined dogs that could potentially kill hundreds of peoples pets.
Stop making excuses for her why should she be allowed to do this to people? Why is it OK for u to think she should be able to carry on.?
Millions of victims of abuse are invested in this case as many are too scared to come forward. This includes guys who can't see their kids cos women lie. Women hospitalised by men, men hospitalised by women, traumatic stories, people with ptsd.
Even your country has laws on these things and people will be imprisoned so why should she get away with it? Cos it doesn't affect you she should get away with it? Her ex assistant has ptsd from her. It's not right and we are all watching Elon musk who was also photographed walking with Amber with a big black eye I might add..
