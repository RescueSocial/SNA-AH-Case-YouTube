29,Ugy-vCVxoouSFGcOYqR4AaABAg,"Amber Heard is a narcissist.  She lies.  She also obsesses about her public image, and would do anything to make people believe her ""narrative"".  Mikey Sutton is an Amber Heard shill.  He writes stories that *she is the source for* ...so it is no wonder that those stories advance her agenda.  Read carefully.  ""Her expectation of shooting Aquaman 2 in 2021.""  Did that say Warner Brothers confirmed Amber Heard will play Mera in the film?  No.  It said that Ms. Heard *expects* to shoot Aquaman 2.  ""This confirms that Heard will remain as Mera, *officially* backing up my original report.""  Officially?  Did that say that Warner Brothers is confirming Ms. Heard will be in Aquaman 2?  No.  It says that because Ms. Heard *EXPECTS* to film the movie,  her role in the film is confirmed  *BUT ONLY BY AMBER HEARD*  NO official source has said anything!  Mikey Sutton cited *NO OFFICIAL SOURCE* for his original story...he just informed us that Warner Brothers would not fire Ms. Heard, and we're supposed to take *HIS* word for it.  But his original report was made as if there was absolutely *NO DOUBT!*  If he was *that* certain, why is he looking for confirmation--and if ""Amber Heard *expects* to"" is what Mikey Sutton calls an *OFFICIAL* source...then his official source for the original story was Amber Heard as well.

So...Mikey Sutton's report *should* read:  Amber Heard says that there is no way that Warner Brothers would ever fire her, no matter what she did, and we have *official confirmation* of that story from Amber Heard, who says that she expects that she will be filming Aquaman 2 some time in 2021!  In fact, if you read the latest letters to Mr. Depp confirming Warner Brothers ""requires Mr. Depp to be in the United Kingdom from September 17th through the anticipated end of the production in mid February, 2021.""  you will find *no mention* of Ms. Heard.  Amber Heard, in her latest document to the Court states that ""she was told months ago (Aquaman 2) would begin filming in February 2021.""  But, in the letter confirming Mr. Depp's role in Fantastic Beasts, Wayne M. Smith, Senior Vice President Corporate Legal, Warner Brothers, states Aquaman 2 ""will not start production any earlier than May 31st, 2021.""  So...Ms. Heard expects to shoot Aquaman 2 in February, but, in fact, Warner Brothers has confirmed that it won't begin production until June, AND they never mention that they will require Amber Heard for the film.  

All I can say is check out the letter from Wayne M. Smith, for Warner Brothers to lawyers Elaine Bredehoft and Benjamin Chew,  Praecipe, Exhibit A,  and ""Defendants Opposition to Plaintiff's Motion for Continuance.""",NIBS,0,2020-09-13T08:47:04Z
30,UgysgaGfu7JzizHFe8B4AaABAg,They are really stupid keeping her. Having her will flop the movie and will get boycotted. The movie is potential to make a billion. It could be close to 300m with her in it. Just replace her she was lucky Aquaman 1 came out before she was exposed as a false victim,Mojo K,0,2020-09-13T03:29:38Z
31,Ugyfo4CtBVJK7pGOzIh4AaABAg,As a fan of aquaman I feel the Warner Brothers did a fantastic job in keeping her as Mera in Aquaman. I'm glad. Everytime they replaced the actor to be play by someone else the movie become terrible. I would suggest that Hollywood keep the same actors if they are gonna plan as sequel cause replacing them will only make the movie terrible. I will continue to watch any movie or TV show that she is cast on. Congrats Amber Heard.,Jose Vargas,0,2020-09-11T00:48:59Z

35,Ugw-54mFOq8PlZRdbKx4AaABAg,"I'd rather have WB put up with Heard AND Depp both than continue to fuel the fires of cancel culture.  Far better if  companies leave justice to the courts rather than cutting off someone's employment and life over alleged wrongdoings.  If Heard is guilty, then she'll do time for it and will have paid her debt to society.  If we think that's not going to happen, then we should be protesting against the legal system and not petitioning companies to introduce an extra-legal justice system that's controlled by mob rule.

If the time that needs to be served conflicts with filming then WB would recast i think. Simply, they woldn't have to pick sides and they would only be doing business.  And i mean, Aquman was by no means a good film. It was a fun film sort of like the Resident Evil movies and the Transformers movies. Dumb fun action... Many of the actors in the film are not good actors. The story was meh. It was fun becaus the lead in the film is a likable dude and it had some cool visuals. But there was nothing really good about the film. Compared to much of what came before maybe. But as a film.... So for me it's easy to not go see it in theaters. And i feel like that's a way to vote. Cast your vote.... The actors get paid so you're not fucking any of them over. The only people who end up suffering are WB. And if you make it clear why you aren't watching the film WB would have to consider recasting or pushing her out of the film in some way. As you siad, this isn't cancel culture. This is standing up against a criminal and a proven abuser. I can not and will not show my support to such a person.

Because I don't watch that film for Amber Heard. And Jason Mamoa has given me no reason to regret him taking the Aquaman role. Overall, I thought the first movie was pretty good. And I respect a lot of the actors/actresses who took on roles in the Aquaman storyline. I'm not going to punish the other actors/actresses for something one of their cast did. That's up to Hollywood (and plenty of other people will be boycotting this movie, even if I don't.) 

Amber Heard, in reality, is really just a ""good-looking side piece."" The character of Mera's role in the superhero universe of DC is secondary, at best. So it's easy to ignore her.

The only thing that matters is that Heard is defeated legally. And so far, that seems to be going spectacularly well for Johnny Depp. No fan of Depp, or really any movie fans in general, have any respect for Amber Heard anymore. That's going to sink her career, sooner or later. It will happen. Even if it's not happening right now. Just gotta wait.",shindari,0,2020-09-02T17:39:45Z

Remember that they don't care about signed petitions or how loud people seem online, if they see their movies making money they are happy, and that includes the snyder cut. She is in it, so if you mean what you say about not wanting to see anything with her you won't be signing up to their streaming service and won't be giving them any views. They won't recast and reshoot Aquaman 2, so don't watch it and if anyone dares asking why make sure you let them know it's because you will not support anyone that employs her.

Note that I would be willing to say to give a pass to Justice League to people who want to see it since the scene in which she shows up has been done already and I don't see them spending more money shooting different scenes to replace that sequence entirely if only they had been smart and fired her from every movie moving forward but since they won't be doing that it's about time they learn a lesson. Remember they only make money because of us and while they continue to make money they will think they can get away with doing whatever they want. This just proves that they don't care about what fans want, they don't care about justice and truth, as long as we keep giving them money they will keep laughing in our faces and keep hiring people like Amber Heard since they are literally willing to let people like her get away with murder if we let them.",SilverSonic2099,0,2020-09-02T15:50:56Z

They just needed better writers, villains and story.  If Snyder was willing to stay more comic book accurate with heroes that act like heroes, regardless of how dark the story gets, then I'd be willing to give him a second chance.

I loved 300 and Watchmen.  He really is good at recreating pages in a cinematic setting.  But Batman and Superman shouldn't kill, and Wonder Woman should actually care for mankind, not have forsaken it decades ago.  These are suppose to be the good guys, and while it's okay that they be people and fail from time to time, they still have to be, at their core, better people than the rest. It's what sets them up to be heroic, the powers and the gadgets only compliment their already willingness to save lives and fight for justice.

That all said, I draw the line at abuse. Depp is the victim, this much has been verified already with multiple accounts from various different pepole.  I know it isn't the choice of Snyder, but it's his movies I will have to give a pass to.  I will not support abuse, and so long as Herd is in the role, I won't be seeing the movies with my family and friends.

Personally I don't really care. Most actors are not nice people, she's hardly unique in her behavior. Jason Momoa is what matters with the Aquaman movies. As long as he's there it'll probably be a decent movie. I am curious to see if how much she's going to be in the movie.

This is a globalist agenda btw not just a Hollywood agenda. Destroy the middle class. Pin men against women. Black and against white. Men are usually the defacto defenders of a society so if you emasculate and pussify men, then women (who these same people think are mentally inferior) will be more willing to adapt to stronger outsider types. 
I mean all these actors and studios work for the same people. Research bilderberg and the people who meet up to these gatherings. Research their companies and you'll understand why there is a repeating narrative. 
Objective is to normalize instability and then to present an alternative for stability that is actually a reduction in freedom and prosperity. In short this is all part of a sort of slavery. 
And pinning men against women and choosing to reward a bully over a victim is totally intentional. Social media has been doing kangaroo court abuse for a long time now.
