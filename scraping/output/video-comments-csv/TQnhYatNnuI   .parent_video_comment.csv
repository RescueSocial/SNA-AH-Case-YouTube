96,Ugywwufb-TxBUeFKQfp4AaABAg,"Very interesting. The case will probably end up being one ole nicky will probably wish he never touched.
He probably never thought his decision would have any impact for millions of people.
To me I do hope JD wins cause it does set a precedence of false allegation with no or faked proof which has been sorely overlooked in the courts and in society. The people accused lose everything and the false accusers get a slap on the wrist. This has been going on in the U.S. for over 2 decades now and it is now out of hand. Plus it makes it even harder for the true victims to get the help and justice that is do. All because people like the nameless one didn't get what they wanted. 
People have lost faith in the judicial system with good reason. The hashtag movements started for good intentions yet was perverted by people for personal gain or vengeance. 
There are millions of dv victims both women and men. If one high profile publicly gets away with it what type of message does it send to all the others and the victims.",Shijusanify,0,2021-02-09T02:53:26Z
97,Ugw127eo9O1Ob1Y18jB4AaABAg,"This thing will decide whether the British legal system delivers justice or not. Reasons not to believe AH were presented and rejected without proper examination. Reasons to believe in a conflict of interests from the judge were established. In my view, AH lost her case. Now, the British legal system will decide whether I can trust him or not.

My gut feeling tells me that I'm not alone on that one. Judges are now on trial. Public hearings are the reason to forbid them from doing what they want. This last line of defense is now being tested. I fear next time they'll decide what the public will be allowed to hear and how it will be allowed to be told. I suspect this thing is coming. Legitimacy of British authorities would die if this process is being implemented. Any revolt would become legit if this control is implemented.

Western societies are suicidal now. I fear being proven correct on this idea. The ball of showing me I'm wrong is now in the hands of the court of appeal.",Didier Favre,0,2021-02-09T02:42:44Z

I am not familiar with UK law, but from my understanding, in the US, if a Judge is found to be incompetent, or has shown lack of unbiased judgements it is grounds for an investigation. If at the end of the investigation the Judge has been found to have abused power etc. they can be thrown from the bench. I'm hoping this ""Judge"" faces repercussions for his mishandling of this case. Look, I will be the first to say that a person who is hurt as a result of DV, may not always seek medical attention. Either because the person who accosted them, will not allow them to. Or, they are too terrified to do so. And, for those who do go, they will lie to Drs as to how the injury happened. Because, just as JD has said, ""I needed to protect my abuser."" Here we have AH claiming she suffered horrific abuse, cuts, and I believe her head broke a solid wooden bed frame? Where are the scars on her body from the broken glass? Where is the medical reports saying that she has suffered some sort of damage as a result of her head breaking the head board.

His dismissal of such evidence was indeed incompetent and if not incompetent then at the very least downright malicious in its intention.  Judges like him are the reason why so many continue to lose faith in the system and probably will NEVER in their life time get it back.
