Yes, indeed. It brings more force to the table. Unfortunately, you have people who are just like the person above, @KARA ZOR-EL, who would rather have the polarity *_shift._* That means that it appears that the ""new feminism"" movement is all about rising *_above_* equality, and being on top. Making them even worse than the oppressors before them, in my opinion. Additionally, it is glaringly obvious that they care not one whit about equality as a whole-- it is only about what they can gain for themselves... or it seems to be arcing in that direction. Sad isn't it. More sad? Not all women will stand for all other women. If they don't fit their agendas, there will be no movement and no support. As a woman, I am acutely and keenly aware of just how women ""tick"". My best to you.  Be safe and be well. ~Peace!",2020-08-05T23:26:45Z,2

You don't ever sacrifice any values when you stand for equality and justice for *_everyone!_* It would be *_THAT_* which would make this woman proud to love you and respect you as an actor, a husband, and as a fellow human being!

It is also no less than any *_woman_* would demand if AH were a *_man,_* is it? There is a time to stand for honor, justice, and truth-- that time is *_NOW!_* No matter what it is, it is the *_truth_* that you are standing for-- not a singular ""gender""! If she is in another _Aquaman_ film, it will shatter my heart, but *_I VOW to my dying breath that I will NOT watch it. *_EVER!_* I will do all that I can to convince my 4 daughters and my son and husband, as well as every person who will give me just a minute of time, just to make sure that they do not even rent a DVD when it comes out. 

Further, I will NEVER watch the *_Original ""Aquaman""_* EVER again-- which I have shamefully watched 3 times already! Thank goodness I have not bought it yet as I've intended to! For once, procrastination worked in my favor! I am _woman,_ hear me roar!

If you are selfishly only fighting on behalf of a small or single group (who *often exclude* members of that group for multitudes of reasons), then you don't really want equality. You want superiority.

The issue involves the dispute between Depp and Heard. In this specific case, it appears that Heard is the guilty one. ""Whataboutism"" is not a legitimate rebuttal argument. 

Are women more often the victims of domestic abuse than men are. Yes, most certainly. In this case, is Amber Heard the victim of abuse, simply because women in general are more likely to be the victim in instances of domestic violence. ""No"" all available evidence, including audio recordings buttressed by eyewitness testimony, paints a pretty graphic picture of Heard as an abuser. She is also quite likely a liar. And there also appears to be a strong case to be made that she perjured herself in deposition and under oath in a court of law. 

I get that you're passionate about this issue. As well you should be. As well we all should be. But don't provide cover to Amber Heard, simply because men tend to commit more abuse, and are therefore, on a statistical basis, more like to get away with it.
