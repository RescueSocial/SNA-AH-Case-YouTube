Amber has now started on Marilyn Manson too knowing Johnny is friends with him she's totally trying to wreck lives all just because of her own rage of the abuse and neglect that happened in her life she's desperately trying to find anyone and everyone to blame. So if this court case falls through i highly suggest he gets a restraining order from her too and be done with it.",2021-04-17T04:57:48Z,1

14,UgxaxrhTYBT-bq92yhR4AaABAg,Diana Rosalind Land,"You bring up a good point. Although I have arrived at a place where I do not believe Amber and think that they were just in a very toxic, drug-fulled relationship, I also have to wonder why all the staff, friends, etc. of JD did not step in. Sadly, I know the answer all too well:  everyone involved is greedy, selfish, and only looking out for themselves. Assistants lied because they ""didn't want to get fired"". Well guess what, I would rather get fired than lie about something important. Am I some kind of fucking saint? No. That's supposed to be normal human behavior. It's like when Amy Winehouse was abandoned to drink herself to death. Anybody with half an eye could see that she was way too fucked up to let onstage towards the end of her life. But her ""adoring father"" was off in NY doing some cheezy crooner tour off the back of his daughter's fame. The new fiancee was only interested in her for her fame, which is why he wasn't around in her darkest moment, and she basically had no real friends left. I bring this up just because, although I feel badly for JD, I am also very suspicious of all his supporters who now claim they knew AH was a maniac. Oh yeah? Well they were together for several YEARS. Where were all the self-righteous friends who knew he was being abused, and why were they silent for so long while this was all supposedly going on? Sounds like everybody was focused on keeping their seat on the gravy train. JD is also culpable in his own downfall, though I genuinely think he's an OK dude. But still. WTF are men in their 50s getting with young chicks for? It's so stupid how they honestly believe that these young girls are seeing into their soul and loving them despite their puffy face and out of shape body, nothing to do with the bank account. As the saying goes ""there's no fool like an old fool"". Fifties is not ""old"" but it's certainly old enough to know better. Lie down with dogs...you get fleas. Hard to feel too super sorry for either of the main players in this tawdry drams.",2020-11-04T00:55:13Z,2
