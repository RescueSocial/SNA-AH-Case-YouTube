2,Ugw5RZZCXB7kdMzIFQl4AaABAg,Rock Candy,"originally he did try to settle with her in 2016 when they got divorced - 7$ mil was generous - but not enough for her.  She  broke the terms of the agreeement to not talk about the marriage and then continued with the false accusations.  She doesn't think twice about breaking any agreements...and she won't disappear of her own accord.  She will keep trying to speak as a UN representative, and continue to disparage him anyway etc.",2021-05-17T17:02:00Z,0

6,UgwI41_D_Xm0eMytJa14AaABAg,Rock Candy,that's very telling because he usually is trying to be affectionate and loving with her.  but not in that picture surely after one of her episodes.,2021-05-17T17:10:20Z,0

But it wouldn't be healed or healing perfectly straight...no bandages, no bruising,  no medical reports.  As an actor dependent on your looks, you are going to go...oh no...my nose is broken - i'll just wait it out without medical attention...hmmm...",2021-05-17T16:47:13Z,1

20,UgwFFqcu9RHGesSXk7t4AaABAg,Marianne Erni,But the pics of the Gordon late night show were available and the judge said he could spot a swollen lip. He did not wanted to have a look at the evidence. He maybe had the verdict written before the trial started by someone else.,2021-05-16T09:08:25Z,1

23,UgzTpUQom4T8618Ss4t4AaABAg,Me A,Agree 100%.   My friends used to say I never looked happy.  I was afraid all the time even in public with friends!  AH is a narcissist and absolutely lies and projects.  She needs to be punished for what she’s done.,2021-05-16T19:11:39Z,2
24,UgzTpUQom4T8618Ss4t4AaABAg,Gennipher Lot,"Thank you for speaking out. We need more like you to have a voice to bring light to the blind. Let those  that have been abused on the wrong side of the domestic word/hand . Let the men be vindicated, those stereotyped as the aggressor and those afraid to speak for fear of backlash and lack of trust. Abuse is an equal opportunist.. 
ABUSE DOESN'T CARE WHO YOU ARE !",2021-05-16T04:18:18Z,4
25,UgzebEMdKfOFFeRidXF4AaABAg,Rock Candy,@Ride or Dis it was pretty clever - if she had managed not talk about her fake marriage and enjoy the 7 million... but for that pesky personailty flaw of being a narcissist. How little she thought that her lies would come home to roost - like that beautiful LAPD bodycam footage.,2021-05-17T12:00:06Z,2
26,UgzebEMdKfOFFeRidXF4AaABAg,Ride or Dis,Because she never thought Johnny would speak out and defend himself publicly. He’s notoriously private and acquiesced to her during their whole relationship. She set up this hoax to get a larger divorce settlement. She expected 30 million dollars for a year of marriage. She only got 7 so needed to grift for publicity and more money. She never expected her lies to surface. She thought it was a clever con she’s pulled with her friends.,2021-05-16T03:54:15Z,11
