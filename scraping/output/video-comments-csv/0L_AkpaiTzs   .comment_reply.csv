7,UgzVSqp6sguZgPKI2Cx4AaABAg,Random Person,@19TheFallen yeah but in one of his last videos about AH he said that she said in a tweet or some post that she couldn‚Äôt and wouldn‚Äôt be fired due to her contract. And the movie people even said they weren‚Äôt gonna fire her no matter what happened with her and JD. And even her costars stood behind her. I doubt her being a ‚Äúliability‚Äù had anything to do with it. And if she breached the contract I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôd know. In one of his last videos I believe the contract basically said she would have had to been found guilty of a crime in court for her behavior to have breached the contract.

101,Ugx7FgNC2b6LMEOCoHV4AaABAg,CD,"@Hercules Balls It seems my first response did not post as expected.  You are ignorant or stupid to continue to fail to understand that ""forgiveness"" and ""trust"" are two separate words and ideas.  If you think that trusting someone is required for forgiveness then you need to seek a professional counselor so you can get proper help because a dictionary and common sense are beyond your faculties.  If you think that trust is required when you forgive someone I must ask... do you automatically trust people that have done you no wrong?  How far does this trust go?  I mean... under your guidance a woman that forgives a man that raped her must also be willing to put herself in a position to be raped by them again to ""prove"" they have forgiven them.  Do you not see how stupid you sound?",2021-02-27T01:56:30Z,0
102,Ugx7FgNC2b6LMEOCoHV4AaABAg,Hercules Balls,"@CD  So you agree that forgiveness for you is meaningless and it connotes nothing, and you're so upset about how obvious it was that you've started calling me names.

104,Ugx7FgNC2b6LMEOCoHV4AaABAg,Hercules Balls,"@CD  So when you forgive someone, it means you hold a grudge against them forever?  I'm glad I'm not YOUR friend!

Marilyn Manson was fired from everything on what to me seemed one woman saying he's bad. Later, it seems they're might be something evil going on, despite Dita's comments kind of defending him.
