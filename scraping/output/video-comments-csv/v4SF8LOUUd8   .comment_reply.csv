It's at the baseline he said vs she said.  Depp's best outcome is that The Sun is found negligent because they didn't use the term 'accused' without a formal record of abuse. Of course, The Sun might wiggle and use the police reports AH filed as the basis. It may be enough to get them off the hook.  The British press laws are different too. Much harder to hold them accountable.  That's why it's such a hard thing to prove something you DIDN'T do especially if it's something that doesn't create something tangible.

Amber Heard has impulse-control problems, hence the cyclical physical and verbal abuse that she put Johnny Depp under.

Actually the testimony of Amber's former assistant is strong and today The Sun's attorney suggested that bodyguard on Coachella mistaken Amber with her sister when he saw her drunk and throwing up... that's very weak and proves they actually have nothing to deny a lot of people's testimonies against Amber.
