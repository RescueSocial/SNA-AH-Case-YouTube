11,Ugzqio2UQZruzavmd_Z4AaABAg,"They need to fire AH and replace her. Simple. Literally NOBODY will be upset, in fact EVERYONE would be ecstatic and they would save the day! Emilia Clarke would be perfect, she is a very talented actress, astonishingly beautiful and has chemistry with Mamoa. Id imagine she would agree to do it since its millions of people wanting her to do it and Mamoa is a very good friend. Surely WB has had SOMEONE investigate the case and SURELY know she is damaged goods so Im not sure why they dont just cut their losses and move on without her. I suppose she has likely threatened to sue but they can drag a lawsuit out long enough for the case in Virginia to prevail and then be able prove that keeping AH in Aquaman was Box Office suicide.

It really doesn't matter if they're right or wrong, no one has to explain themselves or justify their tastes. Insulting them doesn't help. So let's sit and watch these mega-studios suffer and die because of a pseudo-political agenda driven attempted indoctrination.

I'm guessing they've dumped the film because it was biased towards the female characters, especially the one occupied by one of the most unpopular actresses at the moment, including Brie Larson.

Moving on... Granted, with this type of script actors would all build towards creating a fantasy character world and hopeful sequel(s). This  genre of film is underpinned by parent power! They are the ones funding WB existing and potential customers, with merchandise being a huge part of this.

The Entertainment Industry knows they have a money maker with Aquaman 2. When the hearings, trials, and all the evidence comes out showing that she lied. 
She will be removed from Aquaman 2, another actress will take her place, and Aquaman 2 will continue...business as usual. 
The EI does not like losing money, if they continue, they will lose in the long run.  The viewers and paying customers aren't going to be happy, if she isn't removed. Who knows what might happen, it can turn into something like the Capital with riots.
Subscribers might cancel the Disney Channel, Comics Books and Merchandise sales down etc. 
Keep in mind, millions want her removed, replaced and arrested. Then there's millions of Mr. Depp's fans.. like myself want justice. A lot of money was placed into this project, but right now, they are waiting... they have to. It's to their advantage.

Is not only AH having bad publicity, you also have to add that Momoa also angered some fans, the fact that theaters are still closed in most countries, and in many countries too, money is too tight to wasted it in a movie that could be watched for free few months later because streaming services will need new content at some point

After dropping the entire slate of 2021 films onto HBO max WITHOUT telling those studios responsible for creating those films what they were doing, they faced a big legal battle.
The only way to save their arses, was to pony up a lot of $$$. 
The same way they had to with WW1984.
So if anything they are more in debt than they were a few months ago.
So maybe there's some truth to them cancelling, or at least postponing AM2, as they can't afford to spend the amount of money a sequel would need, incase there is a lot of blowback over Turd.",Christine Venner,1,2021-04-08T18:43:59Z

The environment has changed since 2020 and it will not return to its state before that date. Streaming is not there yet and cinema is dead. In addition they don't have the personal to start something worth to pay for. What you see is wrong ""diversity"", the return of racism (by whites against whites), wokeness of employed SJWs and uncorrect ""PC (political correctness)"".

(Masssive side note 2- Odd they‚Äôre just erasing everything at once.  Snyder cut people got a bit more interested into the dc universe. Gotta say tho i am a bit surprised at no Wonder Woman movie or green lantern. Hell, even w the AH situation, it also does surprise me that they actually did cancel aquaman 2. Mainly Bc I just don‚Äôt think that was the reason for the cancellation. I mean, they‚Äôre still possibly doing a freakin Mera movie! And They could‚Äôve replaced her to begin w. If anything that would make fans MORE inclined to see the movie. This is all quite interesting to ponder.....though I am excited to see Pattinson‚Äôs Batman, even tho I adored the Batfleck version. However did not like Joker at all so joker 2 means nothing to me. Honestly I‚Äôd prefer another go at a justice league movie or a green lantern movie. Thing that sucks most to me is that gal Gadot will never again play Wonder Woman. I cannot imagine anyone else in the role. She was perfectly cast and did an epic job w the character.

WB is cleaning house due to AT&T.
Their plans are getting scrapped after Zack Snyder's Justice League was a decent-sized hit for HBO Max.
WB trying to sabotage the project by saying they are not going forward with the Snyderverse and attacking the fandom has pissed AT&T off.
The current DC multiverse (not DCEU since that's the snyderverse and everything else has been rebranded many times at this point) is on its last legs with the suicide squad and batman being the current projects they are looking at after the disasters of WW84 and Birds of Prey.
Mark my words... whether WB likes it or not, it's over for them.
AT&T has the cards and doesn't give two craps what WB thinks, they are the controlling party and aren't going to take the sabotages lightly with those future plans WB wants to do.",ccateni28,2,2021-04-08T18:28:27Z
