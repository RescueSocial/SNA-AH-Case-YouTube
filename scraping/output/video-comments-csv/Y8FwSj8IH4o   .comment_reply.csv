111,UgyHbE4A4JDFF55VpHl4AaABAg,B.b. Gun,"nancy vagias People misunderstand the me too movement when they say believe women. What they mean is take their claims seriously. Don’t dismiss them without looking into it.
In the past when women claimed sexual assault, almost all were dismissed both in the workplace and by law enforcement. Since statistics who that only a tiny number are lying (only a tiny percentage of people are psychos) then the woman is probably telling the truth and we shouldn’t dismiss her claim just because the person who they’re blaming is powerful or likeable.
Btw, before blaming anyone I looked at the evidence and there were so many contradictions that the next day after Amber’s claim I was on Johnny’s side. I didn’t immediately dismiss Amber because I liked Johnny. And I didn’t immediately blame Johnny cause I believed Amber since she was a woman.
That’s what me too is about.
I also think that Louis CK didn’t sexually assault those women. And Chris Hardwick was innocent. But notice that apart from them, all the other men accused are guilty.",2020-04-23T22:35:44Z,8

118,UgxTG2BjcGp-diCS1RZ4AaABAg,MG,"@Nicole Newsome I said ONE OF.... and what a goddamn surprise... ANOTHER woman whining about how she ""isn't"" that pretty. Yah, sure... meanwhile, you'd all kill to look even 1% as good as her. The fuck is wrong with you women? I write a simple comment expressing how my prior admiration for her looks turned completely into disgust after I knew what kind of person she was... and EVERY single woman who's replied has said nothing but how Amber is ""not (that) beautiful a person"". As if it isn't enough to state she's ugly AF on the inside... nah, you all gotta be so goddamn petty about it & tarnish her looks, even though objectively speaking she's without question one of the prettiest women alive whether we like it or not.

Seriously, to what prupose? Other than to make yourselves feel better I suppose... WTF is the point of this? ""Oh, she's not that pretty"". YES she is & there's no point in denying that or talking about her looks only towards a comment that really isn't about defending her looks in the first place.

Oh, so now you're also going to justify the way that women talk about men huh? Nice to know I'm talking to another batshit insane feminist who thinks women treating men like complete garbage is completely okay b/c ""men mistreat you""? First of all, ""men"" don't mistreat ""women"". That's a whole bunch of NONSENSE. 

Riiiight... as women you try to ""uplift your sisters""... explains why you're so eager to downplay someone else's looks, doesn't it?

And no, women absolutely do not call other women out on their shit, specifically when it deals about how women can often treat men like garbage, which YOU are proof of, as you literally just justified women treating men like trash b/c ""men are mean to you"".
