0,UgzRH6q5NwGF31U2w8R4AaABAg,Lawrence James,"I am sorry but I do not think Depp is totally innocent, as you infer. Don't forget Depp so called ""accidentally"" shot Wynona Ryder when they were married. He has used hard core drugs since the 1980's viper room. He has cheated on almost every single woman he dated/ married, which is an abuse itself. Only 2 Exes would make a statement about him and that says a lot. This guy may not have been shown to be violent but cheating is worse in my opinion since it is so painful to go through. Redditt Relationships is full of peoples pain from cheaters. I am still on the fence whether Depp was violent to Amber because he could very well be smart enough to be violent  to her when no one is around, but Amber certainly is a huge liar. I am certainly interested to see if the son really does have proof of abuse to his mom. Depp has gone through so many relationships and divorces because he isn't a good guy at least to his partners. Amber is obviously worse than him probably from mental issues, I would say she is his Karma coming to collect for past sins.",2021-08-22T08:50:36Z,0

I'ver heard all kinds of things, he was bored with Vanessa, he was ""Love Bombed"" by AH and therefore left Vanessa, he and Vanessa had grown apart, who knows? Only they know the truth.

All I know is that, nobody wants to end up alone as they get older, especially men.  I can only guess that Vanessa could have been a potential partner for life. But maybe that is not what he wanted?

These celebrity folks always claim that they do not want to live a conventional life (married to same person for 50+ years), but what do they prefer instead, being 70 years old and dating women far too young for them and who are only after their money and fame? Perhaps it may seem boring, but I prefer the conventional life. But then again, I'm not Johnny. :)",2021-04-06T00:12:23Z,0

One woman, well known to me, my Mom in fact, called the police, they asked my Dad, did you choke her, he said yes, they said why, he said because she would not take the scissors out of my back.  Sure enough, when they looked, there were scissors stuck in his back in a place he could not reach them and take them out.    There are many women who are abused, it is NOT OK.    NO man should ever abuse a woman. I told my sons, and brothers (who are some years younger than I) if a woman makes you think of hurting her, leave the relationship, it is going to get worse, not better.

Someone COULD say they support the ""good"" things in all his Hate stuff but still that name is equated with genocide & millions of ppl tortured & murdered. So, if MeToo is seen & recognized more so for the bad & corrupt reasons, then it doesn't really matter what my intentions are when I use it. So I concede you're right. Thank you for explaining it so well & without being rude or insulting. I like to believe I keep an open mind about everything so that I can be open to new ideas & views.

But what I'm trying to say (perhaps poorly) is that the majority of ppl who use #MeToo aren't in actuality a part of the business. They use that # bc it shows solidarity with victims & helps ppl not feel alone while going thru this. If that makes sense. Of course there are some that do support the business side of it which is DEFINITELY corrupted to the core. But the #MeToo is still a good way to symbolize unity to ppl we may not know personally but wish to support. Just bc the business side of it lost its purpose doesn't mean the # side, that's basically a flag to ppl needing support, should be taken down too. There will always be ppl who are users & losers & try to steal the thunder from Good Ppl & well meaning ppl. If that makes sense.

It‚Äôs rather unfortunate they fan the flames of injustices based on JD‚Äôs private life releasing false articles as their usual MO to escalate issues further. Accountability he further explains with the Sun doesn‚Äôt put a dent on them. In most practices they bribe and hires spy fir any info they want on anyone their specialty. That fuels their reach obtaining fraudulent info is nothing new to them they have made lots of settlements and continue to defend their intrusive actions. They reluctant to debate the real issues at hand for fear of media retribution. Money being the king everyone wants it and craves it in oddest ways. Exposing others personal lives is a way of life for them owner R Murdocks style and everyone under that umbrella is protected so it‚Äôs I don‚Äôt care attitude for others abuse.

I drink from the moment I wake till the only meal I eat which is dinner, then start again the next day. Never in my life have I ever physically harmed anyone, whether drunk or sober. I've blacked out many times and even woken up in hospital after being resuscitated when my lungs stopped working. I can honestly say that alcohol does not create violent or abusive behaviour, it does however prevent you from hiding your true nature.

 AH drank 2 bottles of wine a night & was puking so much at Coachella she had to be brought Pedialyte, Gatorade wouldn't cut it.

 He was sober before AH, being with someone with a personality disorder who severs your finger & nearly kills you, lies & says you are the abusive one, will drive anyone to drink in order to cope with their violence.
 I used to drink in my 20's to deal with my abusive husband...that doesn't make me a alcoholic. 
 I'm a psychologist specializing in personality disorders. 
 I can tell you're warped by AA.
 Not everyone who drinks is abusive, & AH drank 2 bottles of wine a night.
 You are one sick puppy to think they are both at fault l.
