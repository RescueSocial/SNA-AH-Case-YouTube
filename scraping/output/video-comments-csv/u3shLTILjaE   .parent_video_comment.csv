While it's true that Depp is not flawless, and was clearly emotionally unavailble part of teh time because of his substance use, evidence shows that he DID NOT cross over into the anusive, gaslighting territory that Heard did. 

Two imperfect people -- one abuser playing her gender advantage in this context to the hilt.  When a narcissist becomes enraged atthe lack of proper ""worship"", they tend to seek ways to destroy the person who has inflicted such an ego wound upon them. This was obviously Heard's tack, but she destroyed her own credibility  (with people who bother to weigh all the evidence).",Anne Stephenson,0,2020-11-01T22:46:31Z

No, not only bias, because you are also actively lying when commenting on the replies she had on her tweets. Which means that you are not ignorant, you are deliberately saying untruth.

Why would you lie about Johnny Depp's lawsuits?
Where are your connexions?
Are you friend's with Amber Heard?
Are you afraid that you would be blacklisted in the news industries if you tell the truth because of Rupert Murdoch and Elon Musk?
Is it a direct order?

161,UgxhVHOzdM3Y5Qst7Y54AaABAg,"Let's not forget this chick not only tried to ruin Depp...Amber was out giving speeches on domestic abuse survivors. Pretending she was an advocate for these women & herself. & that she was going to use her voice to make a difference.  Blah, blah, blah... All the while shes the ABUSER! An extremely violent one too, cutting Depps finger off. The man had several black eyes over that time from her & bloody noses. So no matter what, I wont forget how far she went,bcuz she didnt just lie about being abused by Depp. It's been her ALL ALONG!!! Her own sister has been attacked by Amber, & she is afraid of her bcuz shes so violent. Fact check it all...its all TRUE!",Brookie Brooke,48,2020-10-17T03:16:07Z
162,Ugwur1ZSMKQvQWff4XN4AaABAg,"Bravo, Sia.

Shame on you ET Canada, for playing both sides.

Sangita, AH¬†is an¬†abusive, self-serving, attention-seeking narcissist, frantically trying to paint herself as a martyr. It is ridiculous. She wasn't ""there"" in your conversation with her, because she is NEVER there. She is a husk of a human being. Anyone who has watched her deposition video realizes that she is lying. Cue it up, and push play. It is blatantly obvious. 
Graeme, the UK court transcripts and witness statements state that Johnny removed himself from the escalating situation(s) whenever possible. He removed himself so often, it became a main complaint of AH. Now, just let that sink in for a minute. Does that sound like he was being terrible to her, or vice-versa? As JD was being abused, he put Amber's friends and sister up in a penthouse, rent free. Meanwhile, AH allegedly plotted to ruin him physically, psychologically,¬†financially and professionally. So, you are wrong. There is a victim. His name is Johnny Depp.

AH has failed several times to get the Virginia 2021 court case thrown out. She is going to go down hard next year, and rightfully so.
The fact that this story continues to be falsely reported is disgusting. Complicity?

Johnny has said he made mistakes in that relationship such as drug use but never did he ever physically assault her unless it was self defense these tapes never once have him admitting to ever physically assaulting her minus pushing her when she was assaulting him. the issue is that Amber for many years denied she even hit him and now these tapes come out where she‚Äôs admitting to throwing pots and pans and vases and cutting his finger off and punching him in the face oh sorry not punching hitting him in the face consequences have been given to Johnny look at his career he suffered for years silently they had a NDA which she broke. She has not come forward and admitted to physically assaulting him and I think that‚Äôs really what everyone who is supporting Johnny issue lies that she has not accepted responsibility for her part in that toxic relationship.
