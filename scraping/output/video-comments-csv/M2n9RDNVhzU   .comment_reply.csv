7,UgzKL3z4HUoGxq1ckYB4AaABAg,Marvin's Channel,@Peaked Interest I watch anything he will make but when his latest film Mank it just didn’t interest me I haven’t seen Citizen Kane either (shock I know lol),2021-03-27T19:01:26Z,2
8,UgzKL3z4HUoGxq1ckYB4AaABAg,Peaked Interest,It depends on your perspective. If you like fincher because he tackles dark subject matter then you'll probably not like Benjamin button but if you like him for his craft then there's no reason not to enjoy it.,2021-03-27T18:42:33Z,1
9,UgzKL3z4HUoGxq1ckYB4AaABAg,Marvin's Channel,"@Peaked Interest I feel like because David Fincher is one-of-a-kind I would just like to see more projects from him but if he wants to do other things that’s fine! I don’t remember much about Zodiac... i’m more a fan of Se7en, Fight  Club, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, Gone Girl, The Game, Panic Room
I haven’t seen Benjamin button but I have heard it’s one of his worst films or in might be his worst one (if you discount Alien 3) I didn’t mind a Social Network but I don’t think it’s one of his best ones",2021-03-27T18:32:28Z,2

11,UgzN6a6DbNUwDPyclSd4AaABAg,Alan Taylor,"@Peaked Interest 
I see, fair enough. I hadn't heard of this case and was like ""Amanda who?"". Now I know who Amanda Heard is.

 In Australian courts there has been sexism, and both modern feminist and MRAs have had something to complain about.

In my view both go too far in their respective assessments and I wouldn't want to identify with either.

I want true equality and don't believe modern feminist or MRA powerbases do a good job of representing. Modern feminists, as well as MRAs, have the same problem, they are sexist.

Having said that, the trend in the West these days is that modern feminist wishes are overtaking their mad MRA cousins'. It's usually one way or the other with people, this way or that. But I don't want to live in a modern feminist or an MRA world.",2021-02-01T18:24:40Z,0

13,UgxxEK5FkIm6iGJIEUp4AaABAg,Peaked Interest,Yes I would. And this isnt one incident either like you're trying to make it sound. There's multiple incidents of them both hitting each other over long periods of time. I'd refer to them both as beaters,2021-10-12T21:08:07Z,0
14,UgxxEK5FkIm6iGJIEUp4AaABAg,Ivana Plavsic,"@Peaked Interest No. If you punched an old lady I would say you punched an old lady. Because that would be the fact at hand. I would not call it a beating, not in a million years. This does not mean I condone punching old ladies. It's also worth mentioning that punching an old lady in no way equals to two relatively same aged adults getting physical with each other, whatever their sex. Like if a granddad punched an old lady would you look at it the same as if a 20 year old did the exact same? I don't think so.",2021-10-12T20:59:23Z,1

Just hope for better luck for Johnny Depp in 2021 has he has done so much for cinema and entertainment and just being a joy sure he isn’t perfect but no one is i just don’t think Amber’s accusations and abused should be overlook and get the same treatment with Warner Bros for Aquaman 2.. as Johnny Depp just deserves Justice as well! But whatever happens it is what it is it’s something Johnny and Amber and their fans (like you said does amber even have fans?)and the world has got to accept these consequences..

23,UgycUJziVR00ykGRaiR4AaABAg,NewtonCountry,"@Peaked Interest I'm not familiar with UK libel laws, but in the US, a lot rides on specific language and intent in a libel suit. Even if a defendant in a libel suit has sketchy evidence, it's difficult to prove they knowingly printed a lie and did so with malicious intent. Also, a cheap trick journalists use is using colloquialisms like ""wife-beater"" instead of legal terms like battery or domestic assault. There are no laws that mention wife-beating. It gives defense lawyers room to argue against intent. Libel cases are difficult to prove, they aren't as common as you would think despitr the abhorrent garbage that passes for journalism these days. Great analysis of the case tho. When I realized the case was actually against The Sun and not Heard herself, I doubted Depp would win. I believe it was an opportunity for him to publicly get his side of the story out there, and strengthen his US case by that information being on record in court documents. I would imagine testimony from the UK case could be submitted in a US court if it is relevant to the claim.",2020-12-28T11:45:38Z,0
24,UgycUJziVR00ykGRaiR4AaABAg,Peaked Interest,"The audio recording where he said the words ""I headbutted you, in the fucking forehead"" that's pretty rock solid evidence. Its an actual recorded confession. He tried to retract it in court but obviously anyone getting in trouble for headbutting someone will retract it in court in the hope.of winning their case. The US case will probably progress very different as it will be judging the merit of both sides, though the UK judge did also say that nobody was without fault",2020-11-23T19:45:21Z,0

26,UgycUJziVR00ykGRaiR4AaABAg,Peaked Interest,Nobody said amber is innocent. Not the judge and definitely not me. You missed the point the case was sun newspaper Vs Johnny they didn't need to prove she was innocent they just needed to prove Johnny was guilty.

As for the future case, it will be very different . The defendant is different and so is the objective of the case. Another key difference is it's much harder to sue someone for defamation in the US due to free speech laws. Its honestly too tough for me to say what outcome I think they'll get. it'll be an interesting case to watch",2020-11-07T15:16:45Z,1

35,UgxvALPfO6QOrZmEzMF4AaABAg,Jayden Ball,"@Peaked Interest LOL I have so many doubts about Johnny as much as I have about Amber. I have actually mentioned it in some of other videos covering the topic. I don't believe Johnny is completely innocent because I wasn't there during the marriage and ofcourse his past is quite colourful and I don't believe Amber is completely innocent either. At least not as how she portrayed in the media. I was talking about the judge because he's kind of ""the topic"" these days but there's not much about him on the internet except for a couple of negative things in the past. Not many though. I think I've read two? I get what you're explaining though.",2020-11-08T16:25:59Z,0
36,UgxvALPfO6QOrZmEzMF4AaABAg,Peaked Interest,"I can understand what your saying but for a second examine your mindset. Your doubting the judge, because of some rumour and bad things you have read, but not doubting Johnny as well even thought there are more rumours and negative articles about him. 

If your mindset is to not trust someone because of negative press you have to apply that evenly over everyone involved otherwise your just selectively applying it to try to achieve the outcome you agree with. 

Here in England it's extremely rare that the courts are corrupted. I'm not saying it's a perfect system because it's still run by people and people still have biases but I don't think the court system is corrupt, political system maybe but the courts arent. 

As for why he discarded other testimony he says in his judgement that Johnny was allowed to introduce the testimony of his supporters if he wanted. It was johnny/his legal team that decided not to. Likely to save it for the case against amber directly later next year. 

I'm not biased in my approach, I have no feelings either way as to who should win or lose (in regards to amber Vs Johnny)I just looked at the information available and analysed it as best I could.

As for the recording, I may be mistaken but the one in which Johnny admitted to headbutting was recorded by a therapist and so has an unbiased third party validation. The one where Johnny is being bullied by her is just them , but I couldnbe mistaken there",2020-11-08T16:13:44Z,1
37,UgxvALPfO6QOrZmEzMF4AaABAg,Jayden Ball,"@Peaked Interest I didn't actually answer my own question. I said it was a rumour because I didn't see it happen. Other channel never mentioned it was a rumour though. I don't quite trust the justice system and sometimes not judges and not lawyers so I don't know. I read a couple of negative things about the judge so its quite difficult for me to judge his integrity. These kind of things happens here in the country that I'm currently residing.

About the audio, the judge already mentioned that he dismissed the rest of the audio recordings as the conversation was not in the presence of anyone of the law profession and simply because it was a conversation between two couple that weren't under oath during the conversation itself so why is the one particular recording not viewed the same way? I mean, they were not under oath at the time as well right? If he said that the rest of the recording has nothing to do with the trial because its not about proving she hit him, then it would make more sense. Right?",2020-11-08T16:06:21Z,1

43,UgxW517NWhoclymV3X54AaABAg,Y2JMc,"@Peaked Interest But you ARE wrong, Creative VC handled the fulfillment, Oliver wouldnt have been aware of anything wrong until they where sent out, can you not see the wood from the trees here, you made claims that Oliver knowingly sent out faulty goods, which is a false claim.

The Gravitas bluray is from a different company, so comparing that to the backers bluray is a false claim, I did watch your long video, and also the short one you deleted, which is where you alluded to Oliver burning discs in his front room.",2020-11-04T20:10:20Z,1
44,UgxW517NWhoclymV3X54AaABAg,Peaked Interest,"I did know creator VC and Robin Block were involved I just figured that if I was wrong about Ollie being in charge and it was creator VC who made the mistakes then he would correct it. Turns out Ollie prefers to stay silent and try to abuse the YouTube claim system to stop people seeing the video. 

And it was STILL Ollie's choice not to be clear with people about what they would buy. I didn't make anything misleading in every single promotional photo at all tier levels Ollie used photos of OFFICIAL blu rays. So he misled people, not me. You can still to check all those images on both fundraising sites if you like and you'll see that I am correct. 

Ollie made no distinction between a gravitas Blu-ray and a standard one at the time that he raised money, when the campaign was closed or when items were delivered. And he also NEVER told even a single customer that they would receive a low quality Chinese bluray until they had shipped the orders. 

I also never alluded to the being home pressed - again you are mistaken. It was an amazon verified customer who said that. I simply put his feedback on screen and read it out.

Honestly you need to go back and rewatch the long video because I literally showed every single piece of evidence on screen

EDIT : A tip just between us, he careful about what accusations you throw around about Robin Block.",2020-11-04T19:56:32Z,2
45,UgxW517NWhoclymV3X54AaABAg,Y2JMc,@Peaked Interest All your research and you didnt mention that Creative VC handled fullfilment? It wasnt Oliver burning discs in his front room like you alluded to in a now deleted video. Why not visit Creative VC and see for yourself? Also comparing the backers bluray to the Gravitas one was a false claim.,2020-11-04T19:53:07Z,1
46,UgxW517NWhoclymV3X54AaABAg,Peaked Interest,"You're misinformed friend. My information came directly from backers and was supported by photo (and video) evidence directly from Ollie's customers. He also never updated backers that they would never receive official pressed Blu-ray's and would be substituted for cheaper Chinese ones - this you can still check for yourself on both fundraising sites as all the info is still there. I also supported every single claim with evidence. 

I did intensive research and never once made a false claim. Ollie never actually placed a legal claim against me he just utilised a quirk in the system to silence my videos. My lawyer is still waiting to receive documents regarding this and doesn't expect they will ever arrive. 

Now ask yourself this - if it was a genuine claim, which he genuinely believed was damaging his brand and he genuinely thought he would win... Why not beat me in court and prove to everyone how wrong I am?
