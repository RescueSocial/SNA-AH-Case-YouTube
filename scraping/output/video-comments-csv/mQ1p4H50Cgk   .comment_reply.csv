9,UgwJCcJjChauJN4NqcR4AaABAg,SANDRA Coulon,Yeah.  Even Johnny commented on how much she loved her own pictures and body.,2021-04-28T14:29:13Z,4
10,UgwJCcJjChauJN4NqcR4AaABAg,Gynette Marcil,I agree with you Sunny Exposure. She is vain and fame and money hungry and needing any kind of attention. If we stopped talking about her she would go crazy.,2021-04-22T20:45:42Z,3

15,Ugwe-PLB3LbKDdOjPyl4AaABAg,Sunny Exposure,"I have a feeling the sisters were encouraged by dad to playfight  and be aggressive like a couple of tom boys and possibly taught to lie & cheat and not trust men. At the same time they were told they were princesses and were superior to everyone else, that ""my Amber is more talented & beautiful than any of those top hollywood actresses"".",2021-04-23T22:35:14Z,1

17,Ugwe-PLB3LbKDdOjPyl4AaABAg,Doctor Soup,100% it's hard to say what exactly she could be experiencing but I feel there is something in her childhood.,2021-04-19T19:11:40Z,3

19,UgzvG0wu7FH5M6r1QMZ4AaABAg,a j,@Doctor Soup I get sometimes emotional when something like that happens to an innocent human being but soup always has her way of making me feel better about this.  The way she makes fun of her arguments and the sarcasm she uses is just honestly good. Soup is not bullying anyone she only is talking about amber‚Äôs ‚Äúkindness‚Äù if amber or her cult got angry at soup they cannot do anything since them saying its sarcasm means that Amber is the monster they keep telling us she isnt so good job soup üòÇüëçüèº,2021-04-22T00:36:04Z,0

21,UgwG_BTK71AUSDBmyIJ4AaABAg,Vampire Daddy,Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong but that sounds like gaslighting,2021-04-20T01:21:03Z,1
22,UgwG_BTK71AUSDBmyIJ4AaABAg,Peanut Gallery,"Absolutely against abuse, children are supposed to come first no matter what till adult hood n it's sadd some kids don't stand a chance! However, it's not a lisence to do the same after becoming an adult n ppl no better but some just don't care, teard knows what she's done is wrong or she wouldn't continue to lie, that I have no room or empathy for!",2021-04-19T19:25:50Z,0
23,UgwG_BTK71AUSDBmyIJ4AaABAg,Doctor Soup,I think it's unfortunate that anyone endured abuse growing up. It's very interesting how some people become good and some not so good. Thanks for the comment!,2021-04-19T19:12:33Z,1
24,Ugwg590Rvabhi4t6t-Z4AaABAg,Doctor Soup,Thank you Scandi! A lot of interesting points.,2021-04-19T19:13:15Z,1
25,Ugz08QhiXdRwRywkxiZ4AaABAg,Doctor Soup,"It's very sad that this kind of stuff happens. We often learn by experience, like you said; it's unfortunate that not everyone can be like Depp and become very kind hearted nurturing people.",2021-04-19T19:14:03Z,2
26,UgzQQnvilGVfyr1hDph4AaABAg,Chloe F,"@Marianne Erni Yeah I think she was the apple of his eye and there was a distinct difference in the way he treated her and Whitney. From what Whitney said to Jennifer Howell first it was her dad abusing her, then it was AH. There are also clips of AH telling her mum off at a film premier so I think she was always just a mini version of her abusive dad and treated her mum and sister, and subsequent relationships accordingly",2021-04-19T18:13:17Z,5
27,UgzQQnvilGVfyr1hDph4AaABAg,Marianne Erni,Didn't she say that she was her dads boy/son? And her father has been arrested and accused for cruelty to animals.,2021-04-19T18:07:35Z,2
28,UgzQQnvilGVfyr1hDph4AaABAg,Chloe F,"She also would've viewed Johnny as an absolute weakling because he's the antithesis of her dad, and I think really she doesn't like men, she uses them for a purpose again, because she grew up always getting what she wanted from a man, so she knows how to manipulate them",2021-04-19T17:54:07Z,6
29,UgyVCmrtFw4jUpbUkDl4AaABAg,Carolyn Dee,I think AH may have done the same thing with Elon Musk. He has more $$$$ than Depp. She used her looks ü§¢ü§¢ü§¢ to get Depp. She sleeps with anyone to get what she wants,2021-04-20T00:34:27Z,5
