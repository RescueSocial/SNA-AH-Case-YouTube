The rebellious state of mind and it being the thing they focus most on during that state of mind tends to be unappealing to anybody outside of that group. It's not something you want to spend your life hearing about, whether it's socially or intimate.",2020-04-04T15:53:24Z,0
94,Ugz_62_34uEWKBYAGP94AaABAg,MFlax,"@That_SnKfan My mom dyed her hair for decades and when she stopped her hair was white (which is a heritage of her family - my own hair started to turn white before I turned 20). In fact there are some ""unnatural"" colors that I would really like on a female. That is not the problem.
The problem is more statistical or just what you see mostly in public: most of the outspoken female SJW (and even some of the males) have those unnatural colors. It does not matter if the hair is fake or natural (sample Renfamous). It's like that small sketch that Ethan van Sciver made about a male SJW. Nobody expected it to fit, but almost all vocal males fit that sketch.
For me a combination of strange hair AND strange behaviour is significant, but like twitter you get only soundbites here not a 10-page discussion like in literature.
I beg your pardon, if you felt snubbed a bit - that was not intended. By my remarks on women I like you should understand that I appreciate real women. Not slaves, but a sex that is at least equal to me. I don't like dumb or uneducated. How can I grow if I have a partner that drags me down. I grow when I will be pushed and put to the test. I prefer that.
I love my mom and I have 2 grown up daughters. I've had always female superiors who were superior to me. I don't feel weak in their presence. I respect them - as I should.

95,Ugz_62_34uEWKBYAGP94AaABAg,That_SnKfan,"@MFlax Can I ask you a serious question. It isn't sarcastic, just genuine curiousity.  Why do people hate women who dye their hair unnatural colours? I'm a natural brunette who would never dye her hair (because I hear it ruins the hair and scalp) but I always wondered. I thought it looks cool if it's well done and if the colour compliments skin tone and eye colour. I think it's quite nice and signals a fun personality but I see people bash it all the time. Im just wondering why people are so against it.  I mean, we all know if we COULD choose our hair colour, no human in existence would go for blonde or brown or whatever when you could have silver or green or purple or red or blue. Again, it's just a genuine question.

Also Amber Heard should be so fired from this movie and jailed. They shouldn't reduce the role of an otherwise important character, the story doesn't deserve that. They should just recast (with Emily Blunt baby).
Johnny is my favourite actor. The pirates of the Carribbean was my favourite franchise growing up and I agree with what you said. It's nice to see that a guy doesn't care about the ass or the boobs but genuinely searches for a good heart.",2020-04-02T21:00:21Z,1

Here's my general take, if allegations impact the course of someone's career in Hollywood, then there's a reasonable expectation that Amber Heard will lose something. It would be consistent and just. If it happens to be her role in Aquaman, that's totally logical and rational. As far as the question about Johnny Depp and Jack Sparrow., I'm not sure. Perhaps his character was simply done. Maybe his character being complete provided the justification to get rid of him.",2020-04-02T16:10:11Z,0
109,Ugx75gQXCuUyEP3404d4AaABAg,barbiquearea,"@Julius Great Ok I genuinely want to know was Depp booted from the POTC franchise or did his character run its course? I'm not denying that his career has taken a hit from Heard's allegations but I honestly thought at the end of Dead Men Tell No Tales, Jack Sparrow's story had come to its fullest conclusion and that he would no longer be relevant in future films. I mean Disney even says they didn't plan on bringing him back for the sequel and were going in a different direction. If Amber really did hurt Johnny Depp's chances of reprising a important character in a loved franchise then DC should have replaced him as Grindelwald for the next Fantastic Beasts movie but that didn't happen.
