I miss when they would shut up and say absolutely nothing
But now I fully watch what celebrities say and when they run their big mouths ans show how much of a sociopath they are, I boycott anything they are in

And I only see stuff where the actors and actresses either keep their mouths shut and or aren‚Äôt lunatics",2021-02-25T15:54:54Z,0

And since when should politics be a thing for hollywood at all.. they are so much involved in it ist unbelievable
for this and other reasonsHollywood is a Cult to me, as sad as i am saying this. 
Used to Watch a lot of Movies etc but they truly Show their real faces. Rats Leaving the Sinking Ship so to speak. Speaking in General not necesarily relating to Depps case..

An abuser who denies it doesn‚Äôt deserve to be in the public life. Not only did she abuse Johnny Depp, she abused her previous partner. 

Asking for someone who has harmed others when the court does nothing is justice. 

Just like standing against the court who jailed a women for killing her rapist. 

Sometimes it‚Äôs important for justice. Cancel culture is best when both the left, right and everyone in between come together on it.

It's the courts job to determine her guilt and punishment (ya know, people with more information than we have, including Yellowflash and TUG). Not an an online mob or her place of employment. 
She hasnt attacked fans and she does the job required to play the role. Any actor doing those 2 things should not be fired, period.
