I wont let Netflix draw me to them because its Johnny Depp.  Yes it is a good platform to show your support for Johnny and Express your joy at seeing the Turdster to get what's brewing.  I'll still find a way to watch Johnny Depp without Netflix.  They support , as we all know , some rather controversial and complex issues and people.

8,UgwQIIM39zREgt0UBXJ4AaABAg,Christopher Lee Jackson,"@stealth women It's a very hard way of living and takes a lot of empathy and sympathy. We were given individual hearts, minds and souls but empathy and sympathy as well. Amber's filled with arrogance and pride and it controls every fiber of my being. Whether it's as big as Amber Heard or as small as us, those demerits, that time will come to pay up. No difference, If She's sincere, and learns the folly of her ways. Again Jesus died for All, who I am to wish ""No Forgiveness!!!"" Satan is the Prince of the Air (Earth and Politics) Why we look UP, not forward. I've learnt to never wish harm on anybody, cause Karma doesn't takes sides or vacations. That sword is double-edged. I agree, what Heard is doing, Karma's on her like a Predator to a Prey. She's getting her Just Rewards. I will just say. ""Maybe, this Lesson can make her better or she can continue to learn the Hard Way."" Great thing about Humility, it comes in full bloom when one's without resources and the 4 ""F's"" Fame, Fortune, Friends and Follwers"" Heard's is soon to hear this, not of spite, but of her own Actions. As with this ""Beer Bug"" Shutdown, Hollywood not making any money .Amber Heard will either run her big bucks dry, or they will cast Amber Heard out to dry.",2020-12-31T01:40:39Z,0
9,UgwQIIM39zREgt0UBXJ4AaABAg,Christopher Lee Jackson,"@stealth women Most definitely, won't be in an Instant, but in a Time Trial. Yes, Heard deserves to be Locked up and serve some time for lying, manipulating, abusing and just nasty AF. She owns us ALL a Apology.",2020-12-30T05:44:56Z,0

31,Ugz6P8Q8SZXQrXI8ACF4AaABAg,Theia_Loki,"Most likely both, especially considering she behaves way too reserved to even qualify as a ""victim"" but more like someone who gets off of acting like she is.

What is almost equally repulsive (if not more so to be honest), is that despite hearing those recordings of her blatantly admitting to abusing JD, #MeToo is not only letting her damage the credibility of the movement, but they're still backing her while she does so. 

That she will now get paid $33k per virtual speech to talk about domestic violence is just adding salt to an already festering wound.",2020-12-26T11:48:30Z,4
