4,UgyE7rm275ZYY7TP3yp4AaABAg,NIBS,"@mose jon , sorry, I wasn't ignoring you, I just got caught up in some work.  Yes, RDJ was a child star whose father gave him recreational drugs from the age of six.  After many years of drug and alcohol abuse he managed to turn his life around, but it was Mel Gibson's paying to insure him that allowed him to act again.  Once you become involved with the legal system, cast insurance becomes exorbitantly expensive or simply unavailable.  AH's first arrest took place when she was sixteen, and that mug shot is available online.  She was banned from driving for six years, which is so severe it must have been the result of a felony arrest,  but AH was arrested again driving while banned, the arrest record is available online.  

2009 would be her next arrest, for the domestic assault of her wife, Tasya van Ree.  At the time Amber had changed her last name to van Ree, to match her wife.  The assault took place in front of the arresting officers in the Seattle/Tacoma International Airport, and culminated with Amber tearing the necklace from Tasya's neck.  Officer Beverly Leonard was the arresting Officer, and although AH would attempt to blame the arrest on misogynistic and homophobic Police Officers... Officer Leonard is an openly gay woman, who volunteers at domestic violence shelters, and would not mistake ""grabbing someone's arm"" for assault.  The Officers arrested AH at the request of Tasya van Ree.  AH was booked, and had her mugshot taken again, and spent the night in jail (as Tasya didn't bail her out.).  She was arraigned the next day, where she did not protest her arrest, and because both women lived out of state, the Judge and the Prosecutor decided to keep the arrest open for a period of two years, in case AH reoffended.  There is a recording of the arraignment available online. When AH met Johnny Depp, she immediately changed her last name back to ""Heard"" and applied to expunge the record of her arrest.

AH was arrested next in 2015, for smuggling her dogs into Australia.  She was aware that the dogs would be euthanized when discovered, but didn't want to wait for them to pass the quarantine period.  AH would plead guilty to the charges, and Mr. Depp would pay a very large fine to secure her release, but in the UK Trial, it was exposed that AH had suborned perjury to lessen the severity of the charges against her.  Australia has reopened the case and is working with the American FBI to investigate the new charges.

When Mr. Depp informed AH that he intended to file for divorce in 2016, she immediately filed first, and had her lawyer, Samantha Spector send Mr. Depp a list of demands including $50,000 per month support payments, the Range Rover (with Mr. Depp covering all costs) three of the five Eastern Columbia Building Penthouse Apartments reportedly worth thirteen million dollars (with Mr. Depp to continue paying utilities and fees), $100,000 lawyer fees, $25,000 forensic accounting fees, and an undisclosed Divorce settlement rumored to be thirty million dollars -- to be payed within three days or AH would go public with accusations of Domestic Abuse.  (This letter is available online).  Mr. Depp refused, and AH went to obtain a temporary restraining order.  After AH sold an illegally made video to TMZ, Mr. Depp had the leverage to force her to accept the minimum divorce payment allowed by California's No Fault Divorce Laws.  She publicly stated that she was giving her entire settlement to charity.  In California, that constitutes a legally binding contract.  AH dropped her Temproary Restraining Order, and the Judge *dismissed it with prejudice,* meaning he found her allegations to be ""egregiously flawed, and without merit"", and AH *can never bring these charges against Mr. Depp in the future.*  Both parties signed a non-disclosure agreement.

AH continued to promote herself as a victim of abuse, although Mr. Depp has never been arrested or charged.  Her op-ed broke the non-disclosure agreement, which led to the Defamation case.  AH's involvement as a witness in the UK Trial against ""The Sun"" resulted in her making some serious accusations against the LAPD, whom AH accused of lying.  AH's lawyer requested the bodycam footage of the night in question, and it was recently provided, but it shows that the Police were telling the truth, and that AH and her co-conspirators had committed perjury.  The LAPD has opened a subsequent investigation of AH and her co-conspirators.  

These are the reasons that it will be difficult for AH to get cast insurance for Aquaman 2.  The Defamation Trial will be ongoing until next year, and will likely result in more criminal charges being brought against AH, and Australia and the LAPD both have open felony investigations concerning her.",2021-06-16T19:23:09Z,2
