By:Jeanne Larson
Livonia, LA, United States
Aug 23, 2020 — 

Yes, you read that right.

Just when you think she’s grasped at the last straw, she goes and throws a hail Mary like this.

Me, I’m still trying to wrap my head around how she’s suing Johnny Depp for lost work that she already got paid for by the studio. She’s not going to be in Aquaman 2, from all reports, but the studio still paid her for it.

How bad to you have to suck for a studio to pay you NOT to be in their movie?

But yes. Now Amber’s throwing out more subpoenas, just about every day, trying to smoke up the mirrors, all while trying yet again to get the case dismissed.

You know, for a woman who insists that she will not be silenced, she’s trying awfully hard not to be heard.

Speaking of subpoenas, I haven’t been served with one yet, to go and testify that Johnny didn’t have anything to do with creating this petition. Maybe the fact that I keep saying it over and over is good enough. Or maybe they just haven’t gotten around to me yet. Or maybe I’m just not important enough to subpoena. I suspect the latter. But it would be a GAS to look that flappy wench in the eye while I testify. Well, once or twice. The view on the other side of the courtroom will likely be immensely more pleasant.

But there you have it.

106,UgzmdA3ZaloIDUiS68Z4AaABAg,"My first thought when watching the video is that she seems so calm. Even after he starts really slamming things around. Someone who is truly being abused wouldn't be so calm. For someone that's being abused, this situation would spark fear because you never know when their anger is going to be taken out on you instead. She clearly isn't afraid or even remotely stressed. She even goes on to say that he was so SWEET and KIND. The exact opposite of what she's trying so hard to portray him as now. And not once did I ever see him raise a hand to her or even verbally abuse her. The most he did was get close to her and set a bottle down rather roughly. He's clearly angry about something unrelated to her but even so he's not taking it out on her. I know she's trying to portray him as violent here but he's just blowing off steam. Lots of people slam things around when they're angry. It DOES NOT mean they're abusive.",Paige M,31,2020-08-18T18:00:51Z

133,UgyTk69RHtH5jKhXsGF4AaABAg,"And how should I feel about this? 
Glad? 
Relieved? 
I’m tired... and numb. 
What little we have known about Amber for eleven years has been negative. She’s only a few years younger than I, and this is how she treats people? And not e we hen she’s drunk or angry, but when she is sober and calm. Her friends?!? Her significant others!?! Her sister!?! Her husband?!? Her stepchildren!?! 
We have know this. 
And L’Oreal hired her to be a spokesman for female empowerment. 
Female Empowerment! 
I don’t feel empowered by watching interviews/commercials of a person who abuses and manipulates every person she is romantically involved with. I don’t feel empowered listening to a woman who exploited a minor for the paparazzi. I don’t feel empowered by seeing the face of a woman who broke her marriage vows and maimed her husband. I don’t feel empowered by a woman who stole the survival story of a real victim. 
I just feel disgust. 
Deeply. 
Profoundly. 
When I saw Aquaman, it was a conscious decision. I thought on it, debated with myself, and chose to go in spite of Amber. I had full knowledge (well what full knowledge we had at the time...) and I decided to watch it. 
But I didn’t know she was a spoken for L’Oreal. I’ve been buying L’Oreal for years, and I had no clue. Not one idea, until youtubers pointed it out. Now, L’Oreal is tainted to me. 
Maybe that’s bad on me for not paying attention. And maybe it’s silly, unfair, or even hypothetical. There’s always a bad egg somewhere, you just have you look hard enough. 
I guess it the whole spokesman thing that makes me so upset. She wasn’t just a recognizable face to sell a product. She was an official spokesman specifically for female empowerment. 
I am glad they took her down. I truly am. 
It’s just that I’m so disgusted by the whole thing that looking at the L’Oreal products now sickens me. I’m not using them. I’ll probably just throw them away. I’ll not repurchase them. I probably will never buy any L’Oreal product again. 
Maybe that’s unfair. 
But it’s my hard earned money, and L’Oreal has lost my trust.",Rebecca Vaughn,16,2020-08-18T16:09:04Z
