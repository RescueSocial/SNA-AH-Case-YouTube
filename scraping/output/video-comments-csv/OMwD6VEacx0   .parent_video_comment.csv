3,Ugz1LyscUDzHvtI2nuB4AaABAg,This situation has made me sick to my stomach. There is never an excuse for abusing someone. No matter the gender.  Like you alluded to. Just because someone is an attractive actress doesn't mean they automatically are the only victim. She treated him terribly and has an obvious history of being an abuser. It seems like Hollywood has decided to forget her past. So sad.,Watchdog,0,2021-10-09T00:48:14Z

Where the fuck was that back in 2016???? Why is everyone suddenly so against cancel culture when they were all for it for Johnny, with barely any concrete evidence???? Literally Johnny Depp's team have pulled over 100 pieces of evidence to use against Amber Heard that include mostly CCTV, several eyewitness accounts, text messages, etc. Amber Heard has, what? Posted pictures of bruises to the media that suddenly disappeared for a few days or didn't discolor the way a bruise would? Absolutely fucking disgusting.

On a positive note though, I'm so happy to see their being actual social justice for Johnny. Do you know how happy that man must be to be getting support for him to actually MAKE a social media account in order to thank everyone on it?

Amber Heard is at fault. People who are supporting her are either biased by her or refuse to hear anything other than what they want to hear. Johnny is innocent.


Also, I know he has flaws, I know he messes up and had issues. But he worked to make himself better when he didn‚Äôt even have to. He admitted when he‚Äôs done bad things, and fixed the issue.

He was angry and slamming cabinets. She set it up like he was in a drunken rage and that he was angry with her. Complete lie! Nothing in that video was directed towards Amber, but she used it to set up the ground work for her being a victim. I‚Äôm sorry, but we all have our moments where we get angry, if he was the abuser she claimed he would be attacking her not slamming a couple of cabinets. Another important part in this story is in the leaked autos. She‚Äôs arguing with him about him leaving when they have an argument. She wants him to stay and fight, but he leaves. Her main complaint is that he ‚Äúsplits‚Äù. Again, if he‚Äôs this horrible abuser why is he leaving? Why is he trying to remove himself from the situation? He‚Äôs begging her on tape to stop getting physical and she out right says, I can‚Äôt! It‚Äôs absurd to me that she just gets a pass and has paid no consequences for this. Johnny who has had a fantastic reputation for years lost everything in a second with only her word, yet he has all this evidence and nothing! It‚Äôs a disgusting double standard. Every other woman in Johnny‚Äôs life has said that he‚Äôs not abusive, that he‚Äôs kind and sensitive. Not one of his ex‚Äôs had anything negative to say about him. 
Amber is a complete narcissist and I really hope she gets the karma she deserves.","Nola Salazar,Barnes",1,2020-05-26T15:23:45Z

After seeing horrible photos of abused test animals as a young child and failing to understand what they meant untill now, I decided to go cruelty free a few months back. Please, please, please don't support brands who are not cruelty free and that test on animals. Just google ""is ____ cruelty free?"" And the answer will pop up. It's easy. There are a lot of sources about the whole cruelty free thing, you can look it up on amazing websites like Cruelty Free Kitty, Logical Harmony and Leaping Bunny (but NOT peta. Don't trust those monsters). It's so easy to find dupes of a non cruelty free product that you use, and there are great, cheap and accessible cruelty free brands like E.L.F and Essence. You can really make a change by not purchasing a product that was tested on animal and therefore by not supporting the brands who pay for animal testing and/or sell in-stores in China (which requires animal testing).
It's so easy. It doesn't really change your life by a whole lot, but you can save animals from being subjected to horrifying abuse.
Thanks for reading if you did read it all, TL;DR- Going cruelty free is easy. You can do it.

Up until this shit with Johnny and Amber happened. The entire story felt off to me and I would say that I would wait to see what the court documents would say. 

I got berated by both the regulars and the staff for it and stopped bothering to read them after non stop articles about them. That is... until they suddenly just stopped writing about them despite all this new info about Amber coming to light.

A lot of people are unwilling to go back and retract all the awful things they were saying about Johnny (and Celebitchy was particularly cruel with him) because that means they were not only wrong, but monumentally, HUGELY wrong and villified the fucking victim. Not to mention the legal shit that will eventually come from all this for the defamation of Johnny. 

it's a lose/lose situation for him, no matter how it plays out because no one wants to believe they were duped so thoroughly by someone who did a horrible job at hiding who she really was and the abuse she was inflicting on him. They're going to punish him for being right and them being wrong, and punish him because he's a man who was abused for once (in their eyes, men don't get abused, remember?)

522,UgwAY3XPIPSoaVxryWl4AaABAg,"Looking through these comments has me pressed. Women who abuse partners and then say it was the other way round just because that situation would somehow be ‚Äúbeneficial‚Äù to them is horrific. It‚Äôs horrific regardless of gender for any person to make up lies about being abused - physically, mentally, emotionally or sexually. And all you people who want to stand by this woman.... to me it‚Äôs just like the women who cry rape.! They do it to get attention or to hurt an innocent person and it can literally ruin a persons life even if the truth comes out. It‚Äôs also why those of us who have been raped have such a hard time seeing our rapist or abuser punished for what they did. The #metoo movement has shown not only how so many women have lied about abuse to ‚Äúget their own back‚Äù or get custody of the kids or to get more out of a divorce, and the hypocrisy of many - including Alyssa Milano who suddenly thinks the #metoo movement should end because someone she likes is being called out for abuse. Regardless of whether you like Johnny is completely irrelevant to this case. Johnny is the VICTIM of ABUSE. If a woman was a victim of abuse and someone said ‚Äúyeah but she‚Äôs done some questionable things‚Äù the internet would lose its s**t.

614,UgxY3P73hrXZMUcp3TJ4AaABAg,"Thanks for talking about this it is a crying shame,
I will never buy their make~up again if they stand by perpetrators of D.V... 
You know over the years I have known people that have been victims of D.V...
the couples have been both straight & same sex. 
I have noticed when the male is the abuser. it is most often hard & obvious violence.
When it is female abusers it is insidious, the violence is often mental as well as physical.
I have also taken note females abusers are often the instigators. 
the abusers tell their story to anyone that will listen, 
They will put themselves as the victim as Ms.Heard did.
Just as Amber Heard said, ""who is going to believe you?"" to that I say,
 the truth rises to the top when given time, just like cream in milk.
I am glad to see that I am not alone in calling Ms, Heard out. 
I think it is liars like her that make it so much harder for truly abuse women, children & men to come forward to seek justice, to stop the cycles of abuse. To protect themselves & others from the abusers. 

Now people if you need to fake bruises to hurt the mate that gave you everything you have,
so you can blackmail them... Try L'Oreal's smokey eye collection! 
  
I am sorry this is not a joking subject but the absurdity is just getting to me.
I am glad Johnny found his voice it is triple hard for men to stand up to their abuser, 
to admit someone had that power & control is very hard for a modern male to do.
It takes strength to admit suffering at the hands of an abuser. 
Johnny is standing up for one of the voiceless minorities that have suffered in silence.

And while there is a lot of proof that Depp's been violent in the past, and may very well have been to Heard...now discovering that there's irrefutable evidence that she was abusive to him doesn't surprise me. Because it's not always a binary equation - people think it works like, ""If x person was abusive, then y was the victim,"" but there's often more to it than that; people can victimise each other. Any cop who's ever gotten a domestic callout can tell you it's not impossible, or even _uncommon_ , for a toxic situation to have violence on _both_ sides.

This is what happened to Johnny. As soon as the abuse allegations came up, many people, including his fans started despising him. He lost his reputation, his career, no one believed him (even though people from his past including his ex girlfriends, had nothing but praise for him). My sister was a big fan of Johnny and she decided to believe him and saw through Amber. Now, I'm not saying that when something like this happens we should all still support the accused.

819,Ugyf2sP2yFAvKr8npmx4AaABAg,"So here is my view. I heard about it but didn't really pay attention because I don't particularly care about famous people drama. I just like Johnny Depp as an actor and think the first thing I saw him in as a kid was Cry Baby. Since then seen almost all movies. I suppose since I never followed the personal lives of famous people it was easier to separate. Also heard later he was innocent but I never like read articles are heard tapes etc. 

That being said I don't think accusations should automatically end careers and to some extent even if proven. I only say this because you have someone like Roman Polanski having sex with children but still have a what 30-40 yrs career. I feel this is a lesser evil to get a pass with. I am not saying she isn't garbage person just that at least this is between 2 adults. 

I honestly feel this mindset is best because it's supposed to be innocent until proven guilty. How can you be impartial if you automatically believe accusers and disbelieve the accused? But if you say that you get crap for questioning the accuser and crap for even appearing to believe accused. You do that and when things like this happen where it's proven it was a lie but it doesn't get nearly the attention because people don't want to be made to look dub because they were wrong.

The saddest part about all of this is that MRA's as well as self-proclaimed feminists were largely silent on this as well, at least relative to how they were initially wishing the worst on Johnny Depp. And I'm not going to lie - I initially believed Amber Heard as well... which is sickening considering I was in Depp's shoes years ago as well. I allowed my abuser to paint themselves as the victim because I didn't want to ruin their reputation by showing the screenshots... despite the severity of the accusations and despite her still making drunk calls to me. I allowed it to go on for five years... until she started dragging my friends into it and painting them as abuse apologists.

Then I dropped the receipts and - wouldn't ya know? - suddenly she goes from ""always believe the victim"" to ""you guys, stop supporting call-out culture! it's so toxic."" 
Meanwhile my local community brushses off the situation entirely because everyone she's hurt is a guy and they like to keep partying with her.
The double standard is fucking real and I apologize for this incoherent rant. The Depp situation just reminded me so much of my own, hence why I wasn't surprised by the silence from most people.

923,UgzKPC4_oyfIThoxoqp4AaABAg,"L'Or√©al knows the full story and not the version that his legal team has been leaking. There is an audio that can be found on the Motivator Network. This audio has been circulating quietly on Twitter for weeks. In this audio, Depp admits beating Amber, she admits covering her bruises with makeup and she admits being afraid to go to the police, and says to him that she is trying to protect him and that she was afraid he would kill her in his last attack. 
The previous audio was chopped up by his team and stans to make it as detrimental as possible to Heard, but this audio where he admits beating her is NOT BEING COVERED by any mass media.
He has a PR and legal army that he is allegedly paying millions to to hide the truth about his abuse (not saying Heard is completely innocent but some of her behaviour is due to repeated physical abuse by this powerful man and knowing she had no way to ever be believed). He has a long history of violent behavior (with many witnesses to his self-confessed ""hellish temper"") when he is drunk or on drugs that has been covered up for a long time and given the lengths he will go to to sue and intimidate people, people are afraid to talk about him. Please can you break this story and cover this audio.
You can here it on the Motivator Network on YT:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibiPJvTTMXA
Documentary:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaR6L5nMGoc
The audio is revealing and disturbing. He is still trying to escape from the truth of his violence, using his PR army, legal team, wealth and power to get away with it. PLEASE BREAK THIS STORY.
All sides of this should come to light, not just the sides that this powerful man wants to present.
To anyone reading this who has been sucked in whole by the Depp machine, please have the decency to listen to the audios before commenting. Thank you.",Monique H,0,2020-05-25T05:49:49Z

938,UgyKuM9cloullbmfqeF4AaABAg,"I feel that the Me Too movement could gain major credibility as well as make a powerful statement by acknowledging that men can be abused and that there are those willing to hijack a movement with good intentions and weaponize it. It would be great if those leading the moment would call out Amber and apologized to Johnny and let him know they'll have his back as well as any victim regardless of their gender. What pisses me off is that those people who were very loud about the movement have basically said nothing since the audio recordings came out but had much to say when Amber first accused Johnny of being violent towards her.

It is shameful that there is a double standard. As a woman who grew up in a home with domestic abuse, I am horrified that a victim wasn't taken seriously because of their gender. I'm disgusted that Amber hasn't had to deal with the consequences of her actions when companies couldn't wash their hands of Johnny fast enough when she accused him of domestic violence. 
If Amber wants to be held to the same standard as her male counterparts, then do it. Drop her from campaigns and remove her from movie projects. It's what she deserves.",darkdistiller,0,2020-05-25T05:28:40Z

If you had any advice on starting a Channel what would it be I‚Äôm a photographer, cinematographer and not really use being on the other side of the camera.  But lately I‚Äôve wanted to express my feelings on a lot of topics I see. And start a similar style channel ( yeah I know we need more opinion channels) but it just would feel like a nice outlet to express some feelings on some topics.

1177,UgxWv-_Cc9tg9RXb_at4AaABAg,"To be honest, I had a hard time from the start believing her stories. I do like Johnny Depp, and I was going based on a documentary/behind the scenes thing of him I watched decades before. I was aware that people can change, and I thought maybe addiction had affected him deeply, but it still just seemed so bizarre to me. It didn't seem like a thing Johnny was likely to do... addiction doesn't necessarily turn you into an abuser. Sometimes, it just leads to self-destruction. It seemed to me he was more the type to self-destruct than to attack others. But I didn't really know her, so I didn't know her whole story that she claimed, or her whole background. Like that she was already an abuser. So, it's just okay now for a woman to abuse another woman, and then to abuse a man? We're cool with that? Neither of them get to be victims; instead, she gets to be the true victim of it all? Fuck thatttttt

Also, I certainly didn't know she CHOPPED OFF PART OF HIS FUCKING FINGER. Are you KIDDING ME

I read that article and not only did she chop off part of his finger by throwing a bottle of vodka onto the counter his hand was resting on, making it explode and break bones and slice off his finger, but he ALSO got MRSA three times in the three surgeries they did to reattach it. Which legitimately could have killed him, and he had legitimate reason to fear losing his finger, arm, or life over that. And he says the whole reason she did that shit in the first place is because he asked her to sign a prenup.

I am so enraged!!!!!! I fucking HATE the bullshit thought process that women can't be abusers and men can't be victims. That's such fucking bullshit and I want to yell about this all over the place - so thank you for yelling here so I heard about it, even though now I'm furious too. But this is something we SHOULD hear about and SHOULD be furious about. Especially as fellow women, we need to say it's not okay because if a man tries to say it, this kind of imbecilic mindset might say he's not allowed to say that. A little harder to say women can't say other women can be abusers and need to be called the fuck out on it, but I'm sure people will still make that argument.

GOD I'M MAD. Fuck women abusers thinking they can do whatever the fuck they want just because they're female and pretty! Fuck Amber fucking Heard. And fuck her mocking him about how he'll lose everything and die alone and fuck her smear campaign against him even now and just fuck off altogether off this Earth, Amber. Jesus. Or get your shit together, stop being a fucking asshole, take responsibility for your actions, own up, and make amends to the people you hurt.

1197,UgzomBfr_S5424WQgGV4AaABAg,"As someone who's unfortunately been the target of an abusive sociopath in the past, the way Amber speaks is so indicative of an abuser. She constantly downplays the abuse (""I didn't punch you, I hit you""), she gaslights (""you're such a baby"", ""you're fine"", ""you've been in a lot of fights"", etc.), she twists the narrative to play the victim (we all saw what happened to Johnny Depp's career, need I say more?), she's used economical abuse tactics (she made Johnny sell a bunch of his stuff), and god knows what else has gone on behind closed doors that she's done. 


Now, I'm not an accredited psychiatrist or doctor of any kind so I'm not going to play armchair psychiatrist and try to diagnose her or anything but I will say, from what I've experienced personally, she displays all the clear-cut signs of a habitual abuser. I imagined she's been engaging in this kind of behavior for a long time (we have allegations that she abused her ex-girlfriend after all) but has always managed to get away with it because of her looks, status, and to be quite frank, her being female. But hopefully this is the last stand of Amber Heard as she's already gotten fired from a movie and hopefully there's more to come. Anyone who abuses needs to be held accountable, regardless of sex. 

Brilliant as always RTG, I'm so happy to see people call her out and not simply dismiss her abusive ways. Not to get political or anything either but it's so refreshing to see a female commentator comment on this as well and want to see Amber be held just as accountable as a man.

1361,Ugzz-tD2GFFQB-3p9a14AaABAg,"Girl bye to Amber Heard. She did what she did to Johnny Depp and the worst part is that the companies and everybody else are justifying the bullshit she gotten away with. She claims she is a feminist and supports the metoo movement, yet she abuses a man which makes me want to give her the side-eye because it is apparent that she is using feminism and the metoo movement as a leverage to her image. She is obviously playing the victim, painting Johnny Depp as the villain in this situation when in reality, the evidences are written all over Johnny Depp's wounds and the audio recording. Additionally, if she is the ""victim"" in this situation, then where are the actual proofs against Johnny Depp, huh? 

The problem with her is it puts her in this victim mentality that it enables to sugarcoat/deflect things rather than take accountability and in the long-run, people will be turned off by her. She is the epitome why feminism is nothing but a joke let alone why there are people who disagree on the metoo movement. Feminism ignores real issues as well as the metoo movement promotes false accusations with fabricated evidence or without evidence plus disregards men as the victims alongside other people. They inevitably blame everything on men to the point we are not making progress here.

Now, some quotes of one of the audios for you guys:

(Amber angry at Johnny cause when she starts a fight he gets away from the situation): 
JD: I'm not the one who fucking throws... fucking pots... and whatever the fuck else you throw at me.
AH: those are diff... that's different. That's different. That's... one does not negate the other. That's irrelevant... Just because I've thrown pots and pans... 
JD: And vases... and fuckin'...
AH: Just because there are vases... No, you're trying to justify how you don't or do come to the door... based on whether I throw pots or pans. It's irrelevant 
----
(The punch that ""wasn't a punch"" incident):
AH: I'm sorry I didn't...
JD: You... uh... punched me.
AH: Uh, uh... Hit you across the face in a proper slap... But I was hitting you... It was not punching you... Bitc... you're not punched!
JD: Don't tell me what it feels like to be punched... No... when you fucking have a closed fist... 
AH: You didn't get punched. You got hit! I'm sorry I hit you like this, but i did not punch you! I did not fucking deck you! I FUCKING WAS HITTING YOU! I don't know what the motion of my actual hand was... But you're fine! I did not hurt you! I did not punch you!
(Interlude while Amber calls Johnny a fucking baby)
AH: I did start a physical fight.
JD: Yea you did... so I had to get the fuck out of there.
AH: Yes... you did. So you did the right thing...the big think... the... you know what? You are admirable. Every single time...
-----
(About their fights)
AH: I don't have to start yelling... I've gotten a lot better about that.
JD: You haven't got better about that... Otherwise, we wouldn't have had 3 physical fights in the last month and a half... 2 months. We got married.. I knew the fucking fights weren't gonna stop... But I though... maybe... it would curb them a little.
AH: I freak out... And cannot make normal decisions... calm decisions... or ones from the heart where I'm thinking more of you than me....
(Interlude about how she can't control herself and how many times she chased him out the elevator)
JD: If things get physical... we have to separate...
AH: No we don't. 
JD: We have to be apart... from one another. There can be no physical violence.
AH: I can't promise you that I'll be perfect... I can't promise you I won't get physical again... God, I fucking sometimes get so mad... I lose it.

She knows full well that false accusations will end up hurting abuse survivors and those who are trying to come out about their abuse and didn't give a shit about them either. She exploited people's compassion and trust and good will because who would ever in their right mind think someone would make up something so heinous.

I was abused by girls and boys, people definitely look at it differently when they find out an incident was from another girl. When I talk about the abuse from men people are rightly upset, but when I bring up something like the adult woman I 'dated' as a minor (and I don't mean like I was 18 and she was 19, she was in her early-mid 20's and I was 16) people deadass act like it's CUTE bc we where both female (and bi) and that makes it ok or even romantic.
