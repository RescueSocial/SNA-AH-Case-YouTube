8,Ugx_2pWYVGncCkCUlRd4AaABAg,"“To make a long story short…” Honestly, as a bit of friendly advice, when you go off topic and ramble (quite a lot), that’s when you lose us (me). Especially when you keep interjecting small snippets of information, then tell us you aren’t going to “get into it”, and for us to watch another video about it. I actually lost track of how many times you tell us to watch another video about something. And in the beginning, you discussed her voice, and at some point you switch to her hair, and then I completely lost tract of what you were trying to say. I truly believe, if you were to make notes and stick to your story, you’ll gather more subscribers. Again, this is just friendly advice. I promise you, I’m not trying to be mean, in any way. I’m just trying to help you, because you (or anyone, for that matter) can’t see yourself like we (the viewer) can. And I apologize for telling you this publicly, but I don’t know how else to contact you. You kept losing me, and I fell asleep a few times. (I’m sorry!) But I wanted you to know all this so that, maybe, this will help you. I hope you’ll accept this friendly advice in the spirit in which it was given… as constructive criticism and nothing more.",Emily Marek,0,2021-11-09T14:58:50Z

Also appreciate the truth of this ordeal being shared out into the world because Johnny was put through so much and he didn't deserve to be taken advantage of this way.  Amber is more lesbian, so it just feels like she took advantage of Johnny's attraction to her by hatching a scheme from the beginning, just for money & fame, not for love.  He deserves better than that.  He's entitled to a happy, peaceful life without the stress of this horrible woman hanging over his head.  She should just give up her quest for more riches & go away peacefully, at this point.  I think the world is tired of her b.s. too!  Her movies are being  boycotted in many areas because of her own corrupt motivations in hurting a man we all adore so much.  I never believed her story.  It was too staged from the beginning, with her press conference that was presented like a performance, complete with funeral costume and special effects makeup bruises that were not there the very next day.  WHO does she think she's fooling?  This should cost her her career, like what happened to Johnny.  They blacklisted the WRONG person, yet curiously, Warner still supports her!

The thing that means so much to her. She still has time to change, if she truly wants to get the help to do so.

From around 14 to 24ish I was completely fake.  I made a character out of myself adopted a more outgoing, confident personality.  I created traits for myself and even changed my diction and tone.  I did all this as a way to manipulate pretty much everyone I met. 

Even as a child I was very interested in body language and the body's reaction in to stimuli; I found it incredible how much information you could gain on someone by paying attention.  I watched my classmates to see thier reactions to different situations and read articles on different body language anything I could find on it.  I used that to shape the aweful person I was.  I don't know why but at 23 I got overwhelmed one night and realized how aweful what I was doing was.  I've worked to try not to use that anymore.",Looser1121,0,2021-10-27T03:10:01Z

36,UgzpiO0flYotf4lyKpx4AaABAg,"I think you'll find the film is Withnail and I, an English film from the 1980's.

Much as I think some of what you say about Amber Heard is correct I don't think you are coming from an unbiased viewpoint and I think your criticism of her isn't fair if you don't understand the material you are using to discredit her.",Yvette Alagul,0,2021-10-23T20:33:42Z
37,UgyE-kCuVQjOZnQ6TF14AaABAg,"What was meaningful is that you tried to find clips that most of us in the know, are not familiar with. That was great and gave depth to the video. You also tried to look at it much more granular than most and that provided a higher level of thinking from the audience. While I did not agree with all of it, I still found it great.

That said, my belief is that amber’s true voice is the deeper husky tone. I believe she likes women over men and the interviewer questions about her sexuality were purposeful and not a surprise to AH when asked. That was a time in her career when she wanted any kind of publicity to further her career and what a better way to do it than to tell everyone, hey I’m gay. I’m special, I’m not like all these other super hot girls trying to get a role in film. So hire me to show you are diverse. 
That is well and good but like you said she quickly shifts gear to draw the attention of men and play up that pretty Texas hottie. So when giving interviews she wears those cute outfits, talks very feminine and coy. She hangs out with her lgbtq community friends who we know have a tendency to bash men for the betterment of themselves, but at some point she hatched a plan to land a big fish. Whether that was JD or Elon who she met around 2011, it didn’t matter. Her plan was, date JD, beg him to marry her then a year later hit him with a divorce. But you see I don’t think her initial plan was to make him out to be a wife beater. I think she was just merely looking to make him out to be a druggie which he is. If you listen to the tapes she claims to have tapes of him that don’t show him in a good light.this is why her photos always seem focused on drugs and alcohol instead of any physical abuse. I think it was her lawyers that switched it to abuse. But this worried AH as she was afraid of looking like a gold digger. Which she comments on in one of the tapes. Hence she made a requirement that their divorce public statement include that verbiage she would donate the money. Her crooked lawyers related to the #metoo movement and later heard on tape helping mayor cuomo in ny undermined, smear an abuse victim, are the ones who put her in touch with the ACLU as an ambassador. So would I if you offered me 3.5 million of your settlement. Then the ambassador award with the UN. It’s all propaganda. Last thing notice how she talks about half or essentially gives her own testimony through the words she claims others spoke to her. Clear sigh of her lies as so does not want to be on record saying but from someone else she is clear.",Jeff Gutshall,1,2021-10-22T21:33:15Z

You're so right, she is gorgeous and she has that 'it' quality that makes people want to gravitate around her, but she is just not in control of herself, and an also believe she went after him in order to get financial security, after all, so many others have gotten away with ruining someone's reputation based on lies, she thought she could do it too..

51,UgxDCu_6nhArk9XfAX14AaABAg,"Amber's change in mannerisms and voice from earlier in her career ( before marrying JD) to now, speaks to me of just how much she was manipulating and playing the part of a young coquettish ingenue starlet.
It was an act that she put on to try to be seen as and get movie roles as the main love interest. Even her diction and poise are much more studied and proper ( in an attempt at coming off as refined and intelligent)
After She married JD and especially after landing her role as Mera, it as though AH felt that she had completely  made it as a bonafide Star and was now in the elite celebrity echelon. She no longer felt as much of a need to be studied and hold her true personality back ( she was free to be more her true self and didn't  need to try so hard) 

I also equate this to her adopting
 ( because she is ALWAYS  acting)
 the persona/role of what she thinks a powerful leading actress would be.
 ( more commanding and sure of herself and her place, think Meryl Streep or kate Winslet  etc. 
Older accomplished female actors who were successful due to their talent and hard work)
That and the fame and worldwide recognition of playing a superhero most likely went to her head, causing her natural brashness and arrogance to slip into the forefront.

Voice is important to stars. Also voice can change due to diet and hormones. Dhea will temporarily make women’s voices REALLY deep. So will smoking. Going vegetarian made me voice higher. I don’t think it was all just her altering her voice because sometimes you can sense the push and others not so much.

She then shows up on protagonist Adam Trask's doorstep where he falls in love with her while nursing her back to health. Shoots him and abandons him and their newborn sons. She's the archetype of a borderline personality/sociopath, becomes malevolent and violent when she drinks and betrays her fake, put on personality.

I noticed this with her quite a few times. And like u said everyone has their bad days or moments where u can't find the words but it stood out to me because u would think being such a public figure and actress that she would at least think a little bit about what she was going to say before going into this type of situation. Also there are I'm sure so many people who would give almost anything to be as famous as her or even to just be a well known actress who I'm sure would choose their words more wisely and even rehearse what they were going to say in this type of situation. So for me personally that makes me question the fact of is she even grateful of the fact that she is so famous or infamous whatever u wanna call it and why would someone as powerful as she is or as she should be considered not thinking about what she is going to say beforehand,Katz Vlog,0,2021-06-24T01:26:36Z

108,UgzfxCx4p3DseynigRd4AaABAg,"Here's my 2 cents: It took me until the UN banquet to crack the enigma of what the attraction of AH to any man, could be: vulnerability*. Most men will be drawn to a woman who in one way or other is in distress, to try to help, alleviate, support, take control and whatnot. And for someone who has serious issues about their identity, to the point of now being able to define it to themselves; this can be interpreted as a suffering in need of being mended or as someone who's lost and need guidance. 
That AH then has the looks to grab the imediate attention of anyone is just the icing on the cake and honestly skin deep beauty won't get you very far, so surely AH has her moments of getting it right, until she suddenly can't get away with playing pretend. 
An occasion like the banquet is where the proper code of behaviour is quite difficult to navigate, when you're not really engaged in the cause and you know it. Imagine the constant anxiety of being unmasked by a misstep, which would reveal what a shell of a person you really are.

*This would go for some women too, who might have an overdeveloped sense of protectiveness or Florence Nightingale syndrome. To other women AH would try to showcase a ""Strong woman"" identity, to be able to dominate them.",nay naynay,1,2021-05-12T17:30:54Z

In the tapes themselves, at one point towards the end, she actually describes to Johnny ""what happened"".  You have to be pretty delusional to tell the very person that Knows exactly what really happened, her ""public"" version that he knows to be completely untrue.  You hear the long pause from Johnny as he realizes Amber actually believes her own Lies at this point.  He asks her if ""She believes she was abused?"" and then asks her if ""She believes she abused him?"" and she again does not directly answer, but goes off in another direction.

Interviewer:   So what did you take out of it with each reading, for the character? 

Amber :   I love this book, y'know the thing I love most about it is it has heart, real heart. An earnest coming of age story in a sense, a struggle between two fundamental and timeless ideals. One's a society we continue to mull over for a long, long time, and it's an ageless timeless tale of truth and beauty and the heart of the opposite of that.

138,UgxodY5IQeCh_1f6Kit4AaABAg,"So I was always a hardcore tom boy. I got my hair cut at the local men’s barber shop.  If my
Mother even thought about putting me in a dress it was all out war.  I throw a fast ball better than most guys.  No exaggeration. 

When I was 16 I cut school with a couple of
Girls. They convinced me to let them do my hair and put make up on.  Of course my mother was ecstatic. She went out and bought me a purse the next day. I got annoyed and told her to slow down lol. 

Anyway I was not expecting the reaction I got.  Especially from guys. Well
It didn’t take long for me to realize I had this 
“ power” ( for lack of a better word) and I can admit I used and abused that power. I learned very quickly how to get what I wanted.  

It’s not that difficult (especially with men)  to kind of size them up and realize what sort of 
woman they would respond positively to and behave accordingly.  
I found most responded positively to the sweet innocent smiling agreeable woman. 

One problem with looking a certain way is many people automatically assume you are not intelligent. You actually have to prove yourself more often.  Although It does seems that was more of a problem years ago than it is now.  


Anyway,  Thankfully I matured quickly and had goals in mind.  I also wanted to be taken seriously so by my early twenties I abandoned that “ persona”.  

But I had to laugh when I saw the “sweet, high voice”  AH in that interview.  She was straight up playing to the interviewer.  I believe in the second interview she was speaking to a woman.  I’ve found woman like Amber tend to be intimidated by other women and we can see how she presented herself to the female interviewer VS the male.",Johanna Davis,1,2021-04-12T22:04:20Z

telling, yet mostly overlooked/ignored NON-VERBAL communication! Thank you @Colonel Kurtz! 

I stumbled across this, and it is the first video of yours that I’ve seen. I really enjoyed the deep analysis of the so-called ‘trivial’ behaviors. These ‘trivial’ things truly speaks louder than words (no pun intended).  I think you did a reeallly good job of breaking this down, and as a big believer of how psychology influences human behavior, this is the first video that I’ve found on the subject addressing all of these subtle, ‘trivial’ behaviors; both verbal & non-verbal communications, between her varying ‘masks’, as you well put it, body language, shifts in varying pitch, tone of voice, etc etc etc. ESPECIALLY coming from someone with minimal background on psychology (if I correctly remember you stating? Apologies & zero disrespect meant if not!)

Anyway! So yeah, from my experience, it’s the ‘reading between the lines’ that is most telling of people. I studied social work, and to this day, there’s still two things simply off the top of my head from the intro level courses that help me to understand these sort of things; 
(1.) When it comes to how people view/treat others, it’s 65% of what they SEE, and 35% of who someone ACTUALLY is, and (2.) Human behavior, in general, is based on an extremely intricate merging of ‘biopsychosocial’ characteristics that, together, help to explain the how & why one does what they do, are how they are, etc. (How by themselves, someone’s biology, psychology, or social environment does not make them who they are, but rather as a whole, this framework helps to explain human behavior.) 

Point is! Watching all the different content out there about AH/JD, break downs of what she set in motion, etc., the parts I found myself fixated on was EXACTLY what this video analyzes, because I find those subtle, ‘trivial’ things are actually the biggest indicators of her motives/true character. I kept finding myself wondering what sort of ‘biopsychosocial’ assessment of her personal history would say lol. Or in other, ‘less pretentious’ words as you’d say lol, a ‘character study’ breakdown of her would look like, which is exactly what you were trying to get at. Overall I very much so enjoyed this much more than other videos about her, and will definitely be checking out the others similar to this that you described.

Amber picked that up from Johnny, but he does it calmly as he contemplates the most appropriate response. Amber knows it makes him look more intellectual and she's trying to copy it. She's also using the space between speech to find a bigger word to insert for what she is getting ready to say. I other interviews, I have seen her do this so spastically, that she uses big words in different context to what they mean. So, the pause & stutter JD has when naturally speaking comes out for AH like she's on speed (because she is) and talking too fast & throwing in words she doesn't know the meaning to, and saying uh, uh, in between thoughts , and it's all a garbled mess.

Mimicry can be used not only to be liked but to be intimidating, so as to be left alone. Imitating strong women is a self defense mechanism and an attempt at ""fake it till you make it"". All those years of needing a defense also makes you strong and colder as a person, at least for the time being. There's some of that in her (maybe not the strong part). That being said... 
Everything else for her case just doesn't work. It's sad her upbringing made her that way. I'm sure we all know similar that just has to be liked by everyone and copies in a stalkerish manner. True NPD that refuses to face what they are. Lack of nurture can be very damaging until you see yourself for what you really are and understand why you are that way.

Of course the story of AH and JD is fascinating and horrifying and heartbreaking and I can't stop doing deep dives on it. I'm obsessed with it for the time being.
However, you hit on many interesting points that others do not: the voice inflection/change, her interactions with people _other_ than JD and I imagine as I (completely fucking binge) watch your library of videos I'll find much more that I've not gotten from other content creators however informative their videos have been. I'm hoping to see some talk about how AH completely isolated JD and literally surrounded him with *her* people except for his security. I cannot imagine what _that_ must've been like ... constantly dealing with Amber alone would be _incredibly difficult_ , and then she threw in her ""squad"" and had her friends living in the penthouses around/below them? I can only *imagine* what her  _""boss babes""_ were like when they'd kick up the dickens - my eyes cannot roll far enough back!
I love your sense of humor. When you said, ""I probably read more than Amber pretends she does!"" I cackled, yet I simultaneously get the feeling that you're not being a jerk and picking the low hanging fruit. You're not a mean girl. You're just giving authentic, funny content that I find refreshing. And your humor releases some of the pressure of the real darkness of AH, too.
Additionally, you're very relatable: self-deprecating, introverted, thoughtful, nuanced ... I feel like I'm watching a discussion that is something like I'd create if I were more motivated and more talented, lol. Of course relatability appeals to all of us. I too find AH to be quite charming as well, and many people don't want to admit that or can't see it or _don't_ see it at all. I too find her to be absolutely _stunning_ to look at. She's incredibly beautiful but versions like Deposition Amber are so striking in that she _is_ very beautiful yet her behavior is so intensely ugly - the dichotomy there is incredible and scary.

Franco interacts and responds to what the director (forgot her name) says, looks her way and is invested in that conversation but as amber speaks they both are silent and don’t interact whit her, he doesn’t even turn his body a little bit. Also in the answers the director gives she includes Franco but not Amber... it struck me as odd.

275,UgyuPsujoUBnBidfq5x4AaABAg,"I just started watching this, but wondering if you have incorporated mbti in your character study.  Amber Heard exhibits much of the architype of ESTP cognitive functions, and when watching her stuff I feel I'm seeing a Flynn Ryder type of motivation in life.  Like her motivation in life is more material, and in not getting that, feeling almost emotionally unfulfilled.  Flynn Ryder was motivated by the idea of obtaining his own Castle, and he was a theif for a living.  I think ESTP types can be motivated by the material, collecting it, and they may not realize this is not a normal motivation or expectation to receive from loved ones(or society at large even) in their lives, or do and try to hide it.  I am reaching in my assumptions in connecting the type and fictional rendering, but I think digging into mbti might help in understanding the hidden motivations and feelings she might uniquely experience and that she works to mask from others because she knows her methods, wishes and expectations from others aren't culturally normal or as accepted.  Not suggesting she's not sociopathic, she's definitely acting sociopathologically, and maybe because she's having a hard time culturally fitting in.  I'm just trying to wrap my understanding of people that experience the world different from myself, and mbti has seemed surprisingly helpful in this.",Gio,0,2021-03-05T07:57:11Z

285,UgyylEK9gKlsMqAtVU54AaABAg,"(1) Heard is hardly an intellectual; most serious intellectuals think Ayn Rand is a terrible writer  and an even worse “political theorist abd philisopoher.”  If strange and intelligent Elon Musk for all his personal foibles were to admire Ayn Rand I’d be shocked avd I hope it isn’t the case. Ms.  Heard’s use if the word “augment” isn’t impressive — it’s just ordinary English language.  PS — telling that Roberta KAPLAN stopped representing Heard quickly if it is as you say; while it’s a privileged relationship I wonder if Heard herself said anything to “explain” the change of attorneys.  Robbie Kaplan is one of the attorneys most supportive of women and women’s rights around today.  (2) I only dropped by here BC I watched the first half of your video on the “me too” movement having too many followers who infantilism women.  That insight shouldn’t be new but it isn’t getting much attention in main stream media (to my knowledge) and it sadly takes some “guts” to challenge that paradigm of the Victorian woman who needs pritection, cannot say not to men, is inherently unsophistucafed, powerless etc.  I only got halfway theogh so far, but I tend to finish it abd think it was good for someone (maybe very few people have, yet, as of 3/3/21, to pipe up on the main points you were making (have made) more recently on that other topic.  I’m not judging Woody Allen or others you discuss in the more recent video on the me-too movement but the overall point was very important and largely missing from MSM.  Men coming out to protect women as wilting wallflowers who cannot say no or who ask to be believed no matter wgqt— it’s not traditionally “feminist” rather the opposite.

She really has become an ouroboros with this and the only way she can survive with a shred of a career now is to lay her weapons down. It's ironic how she wanted to use Depp and stand on him and his accomplishments but broke him down to do so not thinking they'd go down together. He is mainly fighting so hard for his kids.

But also throughout the entire marriage she was collecting ""evidence of his abuse"" which was just pictures of her fake black eyes that she did with make-up, phone calls to her friends, calling the cops (the cops testified that there was no evidence of domestic violence) and that video of Johnny slamming his kitchen cabinets and yelling after his mom died and Amber pretending to be all innocent because she knows she is recording. It had to of been planned from the beginning....why else would she collect ""evidence"" the entire time they were married?  She even tried to blackmail him during their divorce. She wanted him to pay her off or she would go public saying he abused her...and he wouldn't do it because he knew he had tons of proof that he didn't do anything. Even after all of that Johnny tried to protect her and talk her out of doing it because she would look bad in the end after everyone listened to the recordings. Amber thought everyone would blindly back her up because she is a woman.",April Samson,0,2021-02-24T08:51:09Z

352,Ugxy4Fh7gfcQ4kopHwp4AaABAg,"I feel crazy that unknown people after 4 years of their break up still care who was in their relationship correct. 

If Johnny is such good character so why he left Vanessa for 20 years old or how much young woman?

My opinion is that people in time of covid have nothing what to do so they analyse relationships where no one of us was assisting. No one of us was presented there. So only Amber and Johnny knows true about how it was between them. But I feel really ridiculous that people are forgetting that he left loving wife with two children which she gave him.

So he isn't so poor how he try to be. My opinion is...that both were each other violent. That it was Italia from both sides. And if he wasn't hitting any woman in past it means nothing...Amber could make him with her own bad behavior so angry that she could be first whom he was violent.

But it totally doesn't matter what we think. It's their thing and none of us should pay attention to it. It's not mature and I really feel angry because I don't know why but YouTube somehow think that I have about this topic interest and doesn't matter that I am giving these channels away from my wall....so always new videos pop up on my wall. I saw 16 minutes of your video...it was enough.

I think that you have beautiful face features but really bad topic. 

By the way...if you will watch videos how Hillary Clinton was prepaired for election...so you will realise that all women who are in politics need to learn down voice because it sounds more masculine and it help gain trust in people because in people is rooted subconsciously belief that leader was always man and down voice make more calm and trust in people.

A moment later with Johnny - there is no longer enthusiasm, she's acting cool (probably only repeating Johnny's words like a parrot). 
There are a plenty of studies about people who mimic emotions (psychopaths and sociopaths).
Her cute soft voice mirrors fanboy-journalist who is interviewing her, and she's changing voice to unnatural deep when she's surrounded with an army of angry women.
Some people have noticed that she imitated Scarlett Johansson in her photo portfolio (her style, behavior, hair color, makeup) - until she met Johnny, then she switched to wild/casual hippy-chick = Vanessa Paradis wannabe. She even changed her furniture and bought tons of books and an old typewriter just to get Johnny to like her. When she talks about Angelina Jolie, her hair is darker and she's using her hands while she talks (but completely wrong, just giving rhythm to a sentence, while Angelina tends to do ""shapes"" in the air showing only powerful words like a sign language).

Just had to say: Reading doesn't necessarily make you a smart person. Many people can and do read. That this seems to be a huge thing that she goes out of her way to stress as if it makes her one in a million is strange to me (similar to people trying to convince you they're empaths who usually aren't). I have also heard her use big words when talking to Johnny seemingly to look smarter. A friend once told me that there are actual studies out there saying that using big words tends to correlate with not being as smart, though. That's probably because if you've really understood what you were reading, you're perfectly capable of expressing it in a different way i.e. in layman's terms for the person you're talking to to understand, which is what you'd usually strive for if you weren't showing off. I think your adaptability in this is what shows you're actually smart....She seems to be using big words intentionally to show off, instead.

(That doesn't mean that you're always showing off when using big words.

There is also something called the psychopathic stare which is them staring at you without looking away or blinking (because they don't know or go by the social conventions for this) and either their facial expressions being off or there being none at all (because they aren't genuine and hard to fake). This CEO woman has the most stereotypical stare without facial expressions and seems as ingenuine as I have ever seen (even worse than Jody Arias). Amber Heard isn't such a blank slate, but even in the first interviews, her facial expressions are always somewhat off (e.g. she wants to be playful and sweet but her body language looks annoyed and snappy when she tells the interviewer ""I can't tell you that"", she's rolling her eyes when praising the movie etc.).

I think a lot of Syrians would be happy to reject her for her bisexuality, maybe. Her colleague at the Dutch table interview looks up and to the left and then presses his lips together.

Also, yeah, she's pretty, but her looks are generic. Her personality and voice destroy her beauty. You gotta really be on your game to topple Brie Larson from number one most hated person on the internet! Amber Heard in first, Brie Larson a close second, and lagging a distant third is Anita Sarkesian. Come on Anita! Get off that grifted pile of money and MOVE! 

I watch most of That Umbrella Guy's videos. As he always points out, what you're analyzing isn't about celebrity, it's about JUSTICE. TRUE JUSTICE. It's obviously for sale most places in present time. Regular Joe's can't afford it, either. ""Topple the Patriarchy!"" Yeah, if a lot of delusional people get what they want, we're gonna end up back in ""survival of the fittest"" times. That happens, best case scenario, women become chattel property of the strongest male who can maintain and retain possession of them. Maybe he'll be kind. United States has stood for over two hundred years. That's old for an empire! But of course nothing horrendous like that could ever happen here............ Oh, wait! There's that pesky historical record some people are trying to revise. Again.

Reality check, people. It CAN happen here. The ""common"" people used to live in dirt floor shacks, like they still do in some places. The masses of ""victims"" in the U.S. are moaning and griping from a place of relative LUXURY.

It is clear he has a substance abuse problem as well, which can change one's personality and perceptions.  I do feel Amber is not truthful and no basis to go after Johnny Depp as she was equally involved, if not more so.   She definitely seems very manipulative and spoiled.  I don't think she uses big words like you pointed out.  They are basic words.  People in the arts and especially acting usually do have a good command of the English language.  You are using words that are like her as well, should we think something negative about you?  Don't get that point or the example you used.  I guess you haven't pointed out anything that I haven't seen.  My 21-year-old and my husband are voracious readers and I am not.  I don't see that being a thing at all.  You even said you read as much as she then laughed it off. Sorry, can't watch this anymore.  FYI you keep saying,  ""my point is. ""  Couldn't we be able to know your point if presented well?

It means also you abandon things, earlier lives and start new ones. Compulsively, because it is hard to master new identities and the underlying problem is only temporarily  resolved by switching.

That is why they become the love of peoples life and then starts to malfunction, because it is impossible to master a personality if you fake it. It costs so much energy. When the adaptation no longer pays off they just drop out.

527,UgwU-YzAObNsXo6HnrJ4AaABAg,"Her masculine voice seemed to appear right after she came out as being a lesbian.   Some lesbian women will either present as very masculine or very feminine, I'm guessing she chose to be the more masculine.

I believe that she was a lesbian when she met Depp and she ONLY went after him to become famous and for financial gain.  Johnny Depp didn't fall in love and marry ""The Real"" Amber Heard.  Sadly, she presented to him what he wanted her to be so that she could become a part of his world.  He fell in love with a person that he created in his own mind, she listened to him telling her 'all the reasons why' he loved her and she took that and fashioned herself after it.

Here we have Johnny Depp cruising his 50's, his career is waning and then he meets Amber Heard thirty years younger and his ego is so big that he really believed that this much younger woman (a lesbian woman at that) would fall head over heels in love with him and worship him like the god that he is?  Really?  I also believe that he was going through some kind of 'midlife crisis' when he met her as do a lot of men in their early 50's.  

And, for him not to have gotten a 'prenup' before marrying her just shows you how narcissistic he is -- thinking that she was just that 'into him'?  Huh, no.  She was into being 'fast-tracked' onto the Hollywood scene and introduced to all the right people to advance her career.  She was hoping to use Depp as a 'springboard' to catapult her into instant stardom.  Instead, they both ended up crashing and burning.  She's pissed that her plan didn't work and he's pissed because he was 'duped' and 'used' by her.  She never loved him, not even for a second.  The person that he fell in love with didn't exist (but only in his mind).  All she did was present herself as a 'pretty package' and he fell for it, can you imagine how he must have felt walking the Red Carpet with her on his arm?  She was the 'crown-jewel' in the big Swami hat that he wears on his head!  

Amber Heard actually sabotaged her own career by marrying Depp -- she would have had a better shot at making it on her own if she had never known him!  But, her career would have been short-lived because unfortunately Hollywood is still not writing scripts for lesbian women to play as heterosexual love interests in romantic movies.

She seemed incredibly sweet in that one interview, I had never seen her exactly like that and am less surprised that people have fallen for her shtick. I’m wondering if that early persona may be JD’s type. Charming, who reads, attracted by poetry, stylish, dedicated.

My fondness of Johnny Depp also started because of this sad case. I would have never thought that such a famous person like him can be so relatable!

I still can't wrap my head around the fact that I realized that only now! 
Guess, that's what makes great actor.
If it comes to Amber Heard, I have to admit that ever since I saw her in ""Never back down"" years ago, I've had this bad feeling about her.

596,Ugz2ZQwMOw5QaqSwmA54AaABAg,"Colonel Kurtz, I’m not defending Amber Heard, but  I work in Hollywood, and it’s harder to get roles for most films today if you have a high pitched voice.
It has always been like that, unless you are playing a stereo typical character.
I certainly see why she wanted to lose the southern accent, being an actress.
this idea that high pitch voice is don’t work well in films has been around since the beginning of Hollywood sound recordings.
There were successful silent film actresses that did not make it past silent films, because of their voices.
Secondly, many children that grow up in violent, dysfunctional, and alcoholic homes, or with sexual abuse, grow up with what is called “learned helplessness,” or feelings of powerlessness, and believing they have no power,  they sometimes become infantalized.
In other cases, they try not to be too threatening (or too assertive) around their abuser, for fear of retribution, and they tend to talk more childlike, in fear of what the abuser will do.
Secondly, when such victims develop more confidence from more experience in life, and/or they develop more confidence from being away from the abuser in their life, the voice will get lower, because they stop seeing themselves as a small powerless child.
In other words, when they get away from their abuser, or they develop more confidence, they “find their voice.”",lisa richards,0,2021-02-07T16:00:51Z

614,UgyMCZnSj-3LwuMWtkx4AaABAg,"but shes also from VA or some southern state right? I am an actress, what I felt was that she has had dialect and voice coaching as well as media coaching. I had a heavy accent from hometown, and dialect coach taught me how to work it out for the purpose of filming. I am not makind a judgement on any psychological issues, (the problem is we shouldnt be acting when we arent filming/rehearsing..that's when you practice being genuine (with a level of privacy and self respect of course for interviews)  but...if you are constantly acting in real life, there needs to be self-reflection of why) but strictly from a growing actress perspective, you would go through a lot of coaching esp media coaching will impact how you hold yourself, posture, etc depending on the event, red carpet, interview, surrounding, etc. We go through ALL kinds of coaching within the craft, yes , you learn how to morph for interviews and different things, and the presentation can often be very intentional. I notice her accent was heavy in one interview and more neutral in another...likely dialect/speech acting coach. Inflections can be so valuable especially in the theater/stage as well. We can do a number of accents and voice inflections depending on what is being asked of us  and where, that is...if we have the right coaches. I find perhaps, more seasoned actors who have been in the mainstream for sometime, very well known, are much more consistent than newer less known actors in their begining processes working their way up. Media coaches arent really terms you hear often, on purpose, bec audiences arent supposed to know celebrities are coached as they get out there, but they definintely exist as real as voice and dialect coaches.

The suit was position so you could not miss it. When asked about it she said it was it was a quote from her favorite poet and the other one was from a 10 century philosopher written in Farsi. She never did say what the translations were. Another thing I was thinking of that you brought up was how she could be beating him up in a car and then get out and totally snap into her movie star persona.

There wasn't breakdown on somebody's channel about her showing up to give out the hearing aids strictly to get her pictures taken and that in fact cheap has nothing to do with it. She just made sure she was there and cried on cue. Then I heard the audio tape of him asking her this is at the very end of their marriage why she showed up in whatever country it was. Who believe that the country was South America, based on remembering the video tape of them freezing that she is always looking for the camera to snap her picture. Then later hearing the audio tape showed up. If you remember after he came back from Europe that's when he went to her and he wanted a divorce. She knew that he probably was going to divorce her so she already had a list of her demands. She basically appear to blackmail him or it would be completely for him publicly.

She says a lot without saying anything and there’s no conviction in her speech either. Everything you talked about is so spot on and I’m so glad I stumbled upon your video!

How she behaved, the way she spoke and how she presented herself on the show and after versus who/how she is on her podcast.
Stark difference; her voice and how she speaks, mannerism. To me, it's like she isn't even the same person. The difference is most obvious if you compare her recent chatty broads podcasts to when she was on the show and right after. Just curious for your analysis on her.

Edit: Ms. Martinez also claims to be an activist (pro feminism, anti racism, pro inclusion/diversity and anti-bullying) yet she belittles, offends, judges people on her podcasts (RECAPS), spreads false information and claims concerning topics such as mental health, addiction, eating disorders etc. She posts all sorts of things on her Insta account and speaks on behave of movements such as ""Black Lives Matter"" yet she gives people that bully, discriminate and shame people a pass, she says she finds it funny and laughs about it during her last two podcasts recapping Bachelor episodes.",TN 1983,0,2021-02-05T07:49:21Z

Being as pretty as Amber would have been too much power, I knew I’d have been horrible.  Possibly irreversibly. As it was, I’m average, so I was forced to improve my personality. I learned so much after I left home. I think she was wrong, and, unfortunately, she wasn’t held to account. Maybe she could have been an activist or all of those things she wants to believe about herself. But I felt lucky. Abused little girls find ways to exert power that are unacceptable.

695,Ugx_IMwns9qahO6YrnB4AaABAg,"On the subject of AH being a ""big reader"". I have serious doubts. 
From her trauma growing up she is hypervigilant, her eye's goes around in circles, she twitches and swirl around like a small kid when there are stuff going on around her and she hasn't got a specific ""script"" for a interview like in the clip here at the start of this video.
She looks like a kid with ADHD, highly hyperactive, easy distracted and a lack off self control except when it comes to playing a role.
No shade to ADHD, personality disorders or trauma! You can't blame children for what they were put threw, you can only work on yourself as a adult and even that is a hard road.
I don't think AH has any interest of reading books but it is a great shield to hide behind and make her look intellectual and ""mysterious"" when she withdraws in her books. But the big thing was that she bonded with men due to her mask of being a reader like them. 
I do think she reads a book or two, or get someone to recite it to her, when she is in the hunting faze of getting a new partner. It's all a research for a new project in her life, like another role in a movie. I guess that is how they see relationships really, a story, a fantasy that mimic all the emotions they other wise lack without a partner. 
If you have to make a story for yourself in lack of one, why not make it look the best you can?

I think in that moment even though she stuttering it was the most human and sincere moment of her on camera you showed and that we’ve seen so I think that wasn’t worth laughing at. Also laughing at Miss Carolina or whatever. I just had to stop watching the video because we have to be better than that. We don’t have to tear women down or shame people for not being intelligent. I would also laugh about it privately don’t get me wrong but when making public videos I think we have a responsibility to make a better society and we can do that with a good spirit.

Behind closed doors when nobody is listening, another MONSTER resurfaces that majes you literally shake in fear and terror, literally acting and talking like the devil himself in the flesh, like Satan incarnate.
Please take such cases seriously. These women make you fall in live with them and when they think they got you where they think that you cannot leave them anymore, they unleash the demon that only wants to get at you and kill you.
AH said ""Nobody will believe you because you are a man!"" and that was exactly the same attitude of my woman. Who would have believed that this perfect, holy woman of God was actually a demonic monster? Right. Nobody...

I wish no because I'm not a big fan of him but you have to acknowledge he's one of the best actors of the history and in his private life I know he does of good in charity and music so thanks for your videos and informations that permit me to understand something more and I wish the prison for a hateful people like this idiot of Amber fucking heard",Fabio Tatti,3,2021-01-31T12:27:47Z

You have a fab way of presenting your thoughts and I especially like that you added at the end how tragic and different her life could have been had she gotten the help she clearly needs.

786,UgxZDR2CFKELh3_TtJx4AaABAg,"I like your take on this topic.  I think that voice is really important as it says a lot about people. In one of the audios Johnny calls her out on her violence and her voice immediately changes. It gets all strangled and goes up a few notches. I think it's the one where she says it ""non sequitur"".
Concerning her appearance, she seems to have different looks: When she's at an award ceremony: hair tied up in a  bun and the businesslike clothing (maybe trying to emulate Audrey Hepburn?), as an actress: long wavy hair parted at the side (Jessica Rabbit style), and when she wants to look like a forlorn victim: straight flat hair parted in the middle. (her forlorn face is ridiculous and it makes me laugh each time).
Concerning her relationships, and this is just my personal take on this, I think she prefers women and has a great contempt for men and she only dates to use them for money and her career. seems",Katanya Jason,0,2021-01-31T12:01:52Z

One thing about her voice that you discussed I would suggest listening to the audio recordings and reference THEM to her 'public' voice. Notice how very different her voice is in those compared to her public voice (even compared to in the deposition recordings!).

Could you do a video of ""The Moment Johnny Depp walked away from Aver Heard......there is audio where she is begging him for ""promises"" and don't leave, etc. He basically says, ""When the rings come off, then it's over, we don't say it's over. And when I walk out the door then you'll know.""
THEN, in the last audio of them, the call drops and they are talking and he says he is done...he then says, ""could you please hold on for one second?""....while she is still screaming at him, of course, he is still polite....you hear a door slam....he comes back and says we done. I believe that THAT moment, he remembered his word and he is a man of his word, ""If I walk out the door, I am not coming back"".

817,UgwqskyyWqG3L3G0dRx4AaABAg,"I think it is safe to say how Johnny could have easily fallen for her: she potrayed herself to be this pretty, innocent Texas girl.

About the coming out clip, I think she was going for an ""Ellen"" moment there.  Not only that, but I am also pretty sure ""I was strongly advised, by MANY people not to come out"" were  Ellen's words from an interview or monologue I saw. She proceeds to state the old boring "" I'd rather be hated for who I am than be loved for who I am not"", which is kind of cringe IMO, if you as well read as you say, be innovative.

She likes to talk about how women deserve full equality, and how our voices matter and what not, yet she did the most known cliche' thing one can do,
be with a man that has power, only to social climb, not only Depp, but Musk too. How is this hypocrite even allowed to motivate women on how we can do it on our own, when she killed that narrative with her own actions? ALSO: let's demand equality while taking, excuse my language, the piss out of men. Interesting.
