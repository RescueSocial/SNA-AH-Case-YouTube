I said clearly that I'll pirate those movies only if they keep Heard in it. If they fire her, all is good then.

When people rebel against unjust government, they are also called criminals in the eyes of those unjust politicians. Remember that.

And I'm dead sure that physical abuse, false accusation, destroying someone's reputaion and career is far worse crimes than pirating a movie.

If you pay for aq2 while AH starring in it. You are directly paying the abuser, the criminal. You're directly supporting people like her that they can get away with acts like these.

The Sun had to prove the that what they said was true to a civil standard. Proving something wasn't untrue is a weird way to say it. I'm not disputing your opinion of the judgement, since that's your right to have one. I am disputing your claim the defamation suits are hard to win in the UK. That is completely untrue. The burden of proof being on the publisher instead of the person suing (Depp) is the reason why the UK is considered a very favorable place to sue. His US case, with the burden of proof is on Depp and he has to prove actual malice, two things he didn't have to deal with in the UK, makes it much harder for him to win compared to the UK.",2020-11-14T04:01:48Z,1

Depp absolutely showed in any reality except for the one we're living what the Sun wrote was a lie and that he incurred monitary damages. He proved Amber lied on multiple occasions, forged documents and showed the Sun is a trash tabloid. the decision that the Sun did not print a false or misleading statement if fucking absurd, if you read the decision by the Magistrate - his decision is bat shit crazy.

Why do you think that so many of the celebrities who have been proven to be hugely racist in the past and have suddenly changed their ways to appear liberal? Why do you believe so many of the celebs who used to be best friends with Harvey Weinstein and knew what he was up to suddenly changed their stance on the man 180 degrees after he was exposed? Because the audience has become far more aware of these sociopolitical issues and has become stricter and more inclusive. They are just trying to cater to what the people want to hear. It‚Äôs why the interview scene in Boys Season 2 where they talk about inclusivity is such an outstanding and relevant scene because the Seven, who are actors and celebs, try to appear open minded and inclusive even though they are hugely bigoted in person. It‚Äôs a great reflection of the Oscars controversy and actors‚Äô general demeanor and conduct as well.
