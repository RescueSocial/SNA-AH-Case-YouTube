2,Ugwo3QfOtrJf9IywsJF4AaABAg,April Acevedo,"Listen I'd LOVE to see ANYONE but HER play this part. But after already fallen in love with a movie; it usually sucks when one of the main characters is switched out. You could absolutely be right. I'm just saying as a fan you can't deny how well this A-hole played this part. Lol That's all I'm saying. Try to stand back from an unbiased opinion. I didn't know anything about her and JD until I finally watched the first Aquaman and just HAD to know who played the mock ""Ariel"". And now I can't stand that I really love the way that she played that part. She doesn't deserve that part. I'm a true survivor of DV. I am just stating my opinion too guys. ðŸ˜‡",2021-05-02T15:45:57Z,1
