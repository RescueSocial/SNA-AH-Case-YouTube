The entire 2020 Depp/Sun trial is available, with maybe two exceptions. Depositions, all testimony, everything. The only thing they shielded there was James Franco's deposition and one day of AH discussing one of her 14 claims. Everything else is there. Same with this stuff. You have two venues making decision now; Cali and Virginia, leading toward Virginia 2021. That'll be Depp v Heard .

Added to your last comment, the news doesn't tell you anything on cases. They didn't produce 80% of the documents. You gotta do it yourself. Find the case ID and the court it is in, and follow it that way. The only downside is that some documents cost.

53,UgzjaBjBuit-bl-x_F14AaABAg,Stacey Docherty,"@wildmercuryfilms Theres more. The way the police handled us as a family wasnt the best.  They were nice and on our side but they changed our family liaison officers 3 times then the 3rd set we got went on holiday for a month so we were told if we needed to speak to someone about the case just to phone the police station and speak to one of their officers, by the time they came bk it was time for them to move on to another family. We also werent told much of the details but they didnt mind telling the reporters alot of details. We only found out what happended to him when reading the newspaper, that really sucked. They also told us that it was the most violent crime they had ever seen and that she was getting charged with murder which she did. The proscurator fiscal also told us she would be convicted for murder and not to worry as they had more than enough evidence to secure a conviction. Also the lack of compassion from the prosectutor was disgusting. When he agreed to the plea deal we tried asking him why he would do that. Did he feel he didnt have enough evidence or did she have a strong defence in place. His reply to us was that he didnt have to answer our questions. He also tried to down play my fathers injuries. He tried to tell us he only had a couple of cuts and bruises and the head injury. We knew that was bullsh*t because of his autopsy and the fact they had to take our dna to id him. My father was covered in cuts and bruises not to mention the damage to his head and face. His cause of death was blunt force trauma to the head and cardiac arrest. He had a heart attack as he lay there dying. She could have called an ambulance right after she done it and who knows they might have been able to save him, probably not though as the damage to his head was pretty severe but maybe we would have had enough time to say goodbye. My dads brother stayed on the floor above him and my brothers stayed in the building right next to our dads (they lived in flats) and our gran only lived across the street, so someone could have been there in seconds and held his hand as he went. My uncle, and brother carry alot of unnesessary guilt to this day thinking that they could have stopped it from happening as my brother was in my dads until 6.30 pm on this birthday and my uncle went to my dads door about an hour after my brother left but when he was at the door he heard arguing so decided just to go home and go see him the next day. I got a phone call from a friend who lived on the same floor as my dad the morning after it happend. She told me that my dad was dead and there was police and forensics all over the place and that lexie(dads gf) had been arrested. I had to phone my brothers and let them know and then i phoned my gran but she didnt answer as my uncle was over telling her about my dad and then the police came over, they had already spoke with my uncle as his friend had woke him up banging on his door to tell him something had happened at my dads so my uncle rushed out to see what was going on and spoke to some police officers and they agreed to let him break the news to my gran first. My gran and brothers had seen all the police activity that morning but didnt think it was connected to anyone they knew. We all went to my grans that morning but the rest of that day is kind of a blur. 
It shouldnt matter the gender of a person, abuse is still abuse whether your a man or woman and murder is still murder whether your a man or woman. Abuse comes in all shapes and sizes and the impact it has on the victims and their families can be devastating. I have these nightmares and in them my dads there usually sitting at the end of my bed but he has no face and part of his head is missing. I now have trouble sleeping and often have to rely on sleeping tablets from my doctor, i have alot of anger regarding everything that happened. I see a therapist, im on medication for depression and anxiety, so is my uncle and gran.",2020-11-19T12:37:47Z,0

Some people now use the name to describe themselves, claiming what Jason also does that it only means free-spirited, etc, however, this is not true and it's highly disrespectful as it in a way hides our existence. Also, the fact that it's called pride of gypsies makes it even worse. As I mentioned before, gypsies have been hunted for years. Many gypsies had to whitewash themselves and forget about their heritage in order to survive. Gypsies are very proud people and those who have held on to their ancestry and remained true to their roots fight to keep it alive still to this day. Hope this was understandable. And also it's not just that he has ""stolen"" this word, that makes me think he's a narcissist, it's also how he behaves. And you are right, many women wouldn't criticize him as he has a pretty face and is fit, and unfortunately, that is everything that matters these days, certainly seem that way...

At the end of the day, what we laymen think about her is largely irrelevant because the court of public opinion is not a basis for legal precedence.

However, we haven't seen the contract. So, we don't know how things are defined in it. 

My suspicion is that Warner jumped ahead of themselves in this action to stem any # metoo type pushback, regardless of the evidence that Heard was the aggressor, primary abuser, and manipulator (of Johhny, the facts, the media, and the courts). 

One certainty is the fact is Heard is even more controversial than Depp, at this point.

That one was deadly and the judge served like a really wild prosecutor. This was infamous.
I did not get my days in court as well, but the judge helped me nevertheless. My lawyer told me that usually the upper courts decisions are well done, but they are NOT what you would call ""common sense"". Therefore every information on the web includes ""take no advice from here / ask a lawyer"".

The history of the courts (and my own legal training on DV) show a clear trend on this issue.

Then there‚Äôs government policy which is heavily gendered.
Then there‚Äôs the UN and it‚Äôs total prejudice policy.
Assume for one minute that activists remain neutral. Then assume the judge believes in equality before the law. You still have all of the social conditioning from the last few decades that will sway the jury.

Except he chose to be a better human and that in turn changed his life. There's also his role as Sherlock Holmes. We don't want Amber Turd shitting on marvel too. The reason there's no dirt on marvel is cuz they're all good people lmao. People be simping over Gal Gadot when she's Israeli intelligence and now you have Amber Turd- a supposed domestic abuse advocate. What a joke. These two put a stain on DC and the other good actors which is a huge shame.",2020-11-22T08:27:20Z,5
