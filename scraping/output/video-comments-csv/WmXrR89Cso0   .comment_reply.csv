Like grow tf up men get get abused too you know right and the only reason it's because he didn't want to hurt her thats why he didn't do anything because he thought she loved him back. Now we know thats not true. Like she wasn't scared you see how she acted around johnny she actually hit him on tv if she was actually scared she'd never do that get your facts straight before you start attacking innocent people it's just plain ignorance. She was the one who wanted to go to court accuse him but yeah Johnny is still the bad guy right? Like he didn't wanna tarnish either of their reputation but she went anyways. Like stop being so sexist it's not cute it's not funny it's dumb. Also Jack Sparrow is a fictional character on disney they'd never let her abuse Jack I mean they'd let her kill him but not hit. Like this is real life. You don't actually care about this you just wanna attack people be mad and grumpy.,2020-10-07T15:16:30Z,0

Just because she's a woman doesn't mean she can't be an abuser she also didn't deserve the role. Her acting is really crappy and the only reason she is where she is. Is because she's a gold digging abuser. She used johnny. Johnny is the only reason she's famous. Now he's the reason she's losing that fame and rightfully so.,2020-09-24T00:27:41Z,1

There was over an hour of story content that was stripped out.

Also, Batman vs Superman Ultimate Cut is a much more complete movie than the theatrical version.

I'd say that Zack's biggest flaw is that he's a very detail oriented director that works best when he does long epics.  When a studio forces him to cram everything from a 3 hour movie down to less than 2 hours... it suffers a lot.",2018-12-15T12:32:05Z,4

107,UgzqOQPaTVs5gmb5DQ94AaABAg,Jacob Aarum,"@Dr Doom Everyone started to lose the trunks after the New 52. Superman, Batman, Martian Manhunter. I thought about Jessica Jones too but at the moment didn't remember what it looked like. Iron Fist, that probably depends on who you ask. I know people like the Wolverine suit but I think It's hard to see Jackman in it. He was already a foot taller than what he is in the comics. Obviously X-Men 1 had that joke about it and even then the Singer movies felt like they always tried to stray away from the comic look. We had a little bit of it in Apocalpse, I thought it looked fine but we probably won't see it again. I did think Nightcrawler would be the hardest to do with his red and white and I think that was in it.",2018-12-16T07:16:05Z,0
108,UgzqOQPaTVs5gmb5DQ94AaABAg,Jacob Aarum,"@soy boy with a big bag of chips and a big heart No, unless Billy has something shielding him. Black Adam might say it sometimes repeatedly but the rule should apply to him too, if he says it once, he's dead. I'm hoping when we do get Adam, he's alive for a while. He's too good of a villain to have him be one off or dead so soon. We should see Khandaq. I think The Rock could make a badass villain too.
The Rock was casted in 2014. If Shazam isn't received well or flops, It'll take even longer to see him I'm sure.
And god damn do I love Black Adam's New 52 look. Half hood, half cape like Shazam's New 52/movie look. I just need to see it in live action.",2018-12-16T07:09:31Z,0

115,UgzNmjIIneOBTbRhYLV4AaABAg,rcmanization,"imho, based on how snyder sucked at creating good character developments and pacing of the previous DCEU movies, I don't think that the snyder cut would be much better than the crappy movie we ended up getting. The action might've been better, but the storyline itself wouldn't have been good enough. @PSYCHOBEVO",2019-01-02T21:43:32Z,1
116,UgzNmjIIneOBTbRhYLV4AaABAg,yuri,"@PSYCHOBEVO holy shit I had no idea this happened. That's really interesting, but extremely disappointing, I now understand why Momoa and others cant speak on it too much. Thank you SO much for taking the time and filling me in!",2019-01-01T22:51:54Z,7
117,UgzNmjIIneOBTbRhYLV4AaABAg,PSYCHOBEVO,"@yuri What happened was director Zack Snyder left Justice League after a personal tragedy and then WB brought onboard Avengers director Joss Whedon to do extensive reshoots. At the time they told us that Whedon was only finishing Snyder's vision for the movie, not changing it. But it turns out that wasn't true. We know by now that the reshoots drastically changed the movie. It's clear the point of the reshoots were to add a bunch of comedy to the movie and cut the movie down in length, removing tons of scenes that Snyder shot. All of Whedon's reshot scenes have a heavily comedic tone, like Avengers. WB obviously wanted to turn Justice League into the Avengers to appease the critics who always give Marvel movies higher ratings. We know that Snyder's cut of the movie before the reshoots was very different because we have a ton of evidence: missing scenes that were in the trailers but not included in the movie, leaked footage, set photos, comments by cast/crew who worked on the movie, etc. And one of the most ridiculous things is that Henry Cavill was shooting Mission Impossible at the time of the reshoots and couldn't shave his moustache, so in all the reshoot scenes, Superman's face looks weird, because they used CGI to remove his moustache, but didn't do a good job. Zack Snyder's cut of the movie is confirmed to have been very close to being finished. He actually finished principal photography on the movie already. That's what fans are asking for when we want to see the Snyder Cut. We want to see the original cut. And it's not just fans, cast members like Jason Momoa and Ray Fisher have spoken up about wanting to see Snyder's Cut.",2019-01-01T19:41:59Z,14
