18,UgwTNnhD-LTJ0taiDk14AaABAg,Terminator Dark Fate suffers from what I call the Godfather Part 3 syndrome. That is you got a sequel which is better then the first film which is followed up by a mediocre third installment. Yes Dark Fate is the best sequel to T2 and it has it's awesome moments but it also has its flaws. Now if you look at the Rocky franchise from Rocky to Rocky IV each film got better and better then came Rocky V which is the worst in the franchise. But why did each Rocky to Rocky IV get better? Stallone created memorable characters and built upon the nostalgia. Rocky Balboa continues the trend....rarely has a franchise gotten better and unlike Dark Fate (Rocky III) is awesome thanks to Mr T. Once again Stallone created a memorable and cast the right actor. And he turns things on there head by having Apollo Creed train Rocky for his rematch. Stallone added something new. He also killed of Mickey which was a shock at the time. And with Rocky Balboa Stallone connected with a modern cinema audience something Arnold Schwarzenegger has failed to do. If the terminator franchise is to continue it needs a writer and director who are not fans of the terminator films and a new actor playing the terminator. The Rock or Vin Diesel being everyone's choice,Lee Johnstone,0,2020-03-14T12:26:29Z

I CANT believe Warner bros would support such a monster. Then again it is kind of to be expected with the double standards of Hollywoke. They WOULDNT dare fire her coz then the WOKE Feminist media would hav a FIELD day n trash the movie, calling them misogynists, sexist, and say they are against MeToo n DONT believe women, and a whole bunch of other lies n FAKE NEWS, but as Joker and sonic and Alita showed us...it DOESNT matter what they think...ONLY what us fans think and IF they were only to listen to us and replace her, then we would support and praise them for their bravery and commend them for making the RIGHT decision.

Unlike SJWs who support NUTHING, we ACTUALLY do show support to good companies when they listen to the fandom

ur right, alone we dont change a thing, BUT together, we CAN make a difference! Nothing will change if you dont try, so share this video and help get the word out. TOGETHER WE CAN MAKE THIS HAPPEN! HELL YEAH!
