7,UgyebAIs1MwFWVjqXjB4AaABAg,LOL that would be quite funny if she was to go to prison over her dogs and lying about them the one thing that gets her is her dogs wow but not that she abused JD but not that she took 7 million plus from sick children not that she pretended to be a victim and got paid to do so when she's a reoccurring abuser playing a superhero right all them reasons are not good enough but her being thrown in prison for 4 years over her dogs is more important than what she did to JD and countless others especially the poor kids what a shame for her to go down for only 4 years about lying about her dogs oh but severing a man's finger that's not a big deal right taking medicine straight out of babies that's not a good reason right pretending to be a victim when she's a reoccurring abuser that's not a good enough reason right? Or how about this the fact that she's speaking in behalf of victims and being paid to do so that's not a good enough reason I'm sorry I think she deserves more prison time and I think JD deserves MORE Justice for what she's done to him...!!! #Bing a bully at any age is not okay #you're a man won't believe you #yourawomanandwedon'tbelieveyou #AmberFBI #I didn't know you played in magic Mike that's how much of a nobody you are nobody remembers you in the movie you were nothing before JD and you were in nothing now without him do not deserve to play a superhero being a reoccurring abuser!!! #JD KEEP YOUR HEAD UP CUZ YOUR FANS GOT YOUR BACK!!!!!,Yalonda Howell,1,2021-05-18T11:50:39Z

As a Queenslander, I know she wouldn‚Äôt be jailed here, liar or not, nor indeed anywhere, if she pays the fines.

Johnny dosnt get his name cleared, h√© dosnt get a jugde telling amber she has to pay for all the emotion and money h√© lost. So i hope h√© gets the change to go to court, and wins his case, then she can go to jail in Australi√´. And to be clear. Amber took the dogs. Johnny had nothing to do with that.

23,UgyYnYTO17307qXX6ZN4AaABAg,"The facts of the Australian Dog Smuggling Case are in the open domain, all the Court Documents are available to be read.  Mr. Depp was living in Australia, shooting the latest ""Pirates"" movie.  Amber Heard flew to join him, bringing her dogs with her, although she knew that it was illegal... she falsified the documents, and hid the dogs, in order to smuggle them into the country.  Mr. Depp was not at the airport when Ms. Heard arrived, and did not approve of her traveling with the animals, because of the stress it caused them.  *Amber Heard, ALONE, was charged with falsifying documents in order to smuggle her dogs into Australia.*  During the UK Defamation Trial, Mr. Depp's estate Manager, Kevin Murphy, testified that *Heard suborned him to commit perjury,* under threat of having him fired, *in order to lessen the severity of her sentence.*  When Mr. Depp divorced Ms. Heard, Mr. Murphy contacted the Australian Authorities in order to change his testimony in the case.

Ms. Heard is NOT simply facing *perjury* charges in Australia, she is facing *subornation of perjury under threat* as well.  Perjury in Australia carries a penalty of fourteen years imprisonment, and subornation of perjury carries an additional seven years imprisonment, with large fines attached.  Evidence is now in the hands of the Australian Authorities proving Ms. Heard attempted to find an American veterinarian that she could bribe to falsify documents to allow the dogs to enter Australia, proving that she planned to smuggle the dogs into Australia before she left the United States... and she was fully aware that the dogs faced euthanasia if caught.  She isn't much of an animal lover.  The rabies virus does not currently occur in land dwelling animals in Australia.  The only test for rabies is dissection the brain of the animal involved.  Ms. Heard risked the lives, not only of her own pets, but every animal that came into contact with them... and she carelessly sent them for grooming while there.  Ms. Heard could also face the original charges that were dropped, illegally importing the dogs into Australia, which carries a ten year prison sentence.

Authorities co-operate in levying charges in conjunction with each other.  This case will not go to trial until the Virginia Defamation Trail is over.  It will be interesting to see if Heard faces the perjury, and planting and tampering with evidence (and perhaps attempted extortion) charges in California *BEFORE* the Australian charges of perjury and suborning perjury.  So many crimes... so many charges... so little time...  Narcissists disdain for Legal Authority always results in eventual incarceration.",NIBS,3,2021-05-16T17:25:50Z

40,Ugx99k6iEzJO-ZSPZ-14AaABAg,"If you think this case is bad, wait until more info comes out about the Marilyn Manson case.  I thought he was guilty when I first heard so many women come out with such horrific claims.  I have now learned that ALL of these women not only know each other, they all wrote their ""stories"" together.  Mansons lawyer has also come out and said the allegations would be kept quit IF he paid a large amount of money.  After reading 12 of their  claims I noticed they all said that the record company AND his agent knew about the abuse I began to suspect they would be named as defendants to get more money.  Sure enough they HAVE been included.
ALL of the women have carefully crafted their stories and the TIMING of their release to inflict the max amount of damage.  These women will be exposed, just like their close friend, and co-conspirator,  Amber Heard.",tammy koble,7,2021-05-15T21:46:19Z
