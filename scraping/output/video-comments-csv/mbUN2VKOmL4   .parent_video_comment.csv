I would love to have you guys show a scene from “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest.” It’s almost at the end, after Billy  Bibbit, one of the patients, killed himself. Jack Nicholson stands by the shattered window & screen through which Chief Bromden has escaped, he can run or he can stay, the camera pans around the room without ever leaving Nicholson face, it must be 15-20 seconds, a particularly long shot, just on Nicholson’s face, but here’s the magic! During the shot you would swear that not a muscle in his face moves, but oh my God, you can see every thought or emotion this character, McMurphy, is experiencing. It will mean more to you if you know the movie & the backstory, but it was the most damndestly brilliant shot of it’s kind I’ve ever seen - and I’ve been loving movies for more than 60 years. I have a really hard time choosing, if someone asks me to list my top 5 or 10 movies of all time, but if they asked about top 5 movie scenes, there is my number one. Lists change over the years, new ones take the place of the old, but for the ultimate  example of cinematography and brilliant, enthralling, well I can’t say “action,” because Nicholson never moves, this has never budged. The entire film is tremendous, significantly different from the book, but faithful to the author, Ken Kesey’s mindset when he wrote it, I’d advise you to read the book first, it’s a monumental piece of writing, hilarious in places, devastating in others, omg! PLEASE READ THE BOOK, WATCH THE MOVIE!!

I didn't think the movie was very good and I thought it was bad acting. Amber can't act and I didn't know who she is or cared because she wasn't memorable to me in the movie I only know who she is now after she put out all the lies about Johnny. I had to look her up to see who she even was and she is nothing but a lying gold digger. I wont go see anything she's in that's for sure.

227,Ugw878Z2mAQ5KL_D1md4AaABAg,"How do you two not see what’s really going on with Jason in this scene!??! I’ve never seen this film, so this is my first reaction, and OMG! It’s so obvious, and uncomfortable! WOW! I’m actually an actress in real life, here’s my take, if you’re interested.

Note how uncomfortable Jason’s body language is. It’s subtle, he mostly carries it in his shoulders, but you especially see it when they have to be close. Notice how it’s almost as if he’s trying to be as close to Amber as possible, while simultaneously trying to be as far away from her as possible. He’s always on the move, you could maybe argue that it’s an acting choice, but idk... It’s a lot, and quite spastic, to me. I swear it looks like he’s just trying to keep away from her. 

Now combine his body language with the fact that he won’t look at Amber. Notice that when he does “look” at her, he looks at her chin, sometimes her forehead, or like you noticed, her breasts. He should have looked up into her eyes right away, anyone could tell you that! Instead he literally felt safer looking at her breasts, rather than looking into her eyes. 

I do the same exact thing when one of my leading men has made me uncomfortable, but I don’t want to ruin the project. I’m not proud of it, but yeah, I’ve done it... They do or say things that you can’t really determine if they’re problems or not, and if you say something you risk the chance of sounding conceited, that you can’t take a joke, or you’re just starting drama. So you lie to yourself. You do your best to interact with them as little as possible, other than your time on stage, or in press. You do all you can to not make eye contact with them. Eye contact is so vulnerable, it’s so important for actors, it really sucks when this happens, because it REALLY hurts your performance, and chemistry. 

Compare how Jason is with Amber vs. Emelia. He’s all over Emelia! They look directly into each other’s eyes. They grab each other, and give cute snuggles, and hugs, he picks her up, throws her around like a Ragdoll! I’m obviously exaggerating 😝! The point is, they absolutely love and respect each other, they see each other like brother and sister. Emelia would never make Jason or his wife uncomfortable, and vice versa. 

So ask yourself... Why can Jason look one leading lady in the eyes, but not another?

I bet every penny in my bank account Amber has made Jason extremely uncomfortable on multiple occasions. She’s a hyper sexual borderline, sociopath, narcissist. She’s physically and emotionally abusive to everyone around her, it’s not too far of a stretch to add sexual harassment into the mix. 

Her mechanic testified against her at the Sun Trial. He said that when alone in her car, she immediately said to him, “You have me all alone in this car... What do you want to do with me?” YEAH! That was just to her car mechanic! Imagine how she must have been with Jason?!

It’s well documented she’s slept with almost all her leading men, and she even married one of them! Ha! Jason loves his wife, Amber is pure evil, she’d love nothing more than to break up a marriage (like she’s done before). She is beautiful, I’ll give her that, but extremely manipulative, and Jason is only human, after all . Her eyes probably scream “Come and f-me!” when he does have to make eye contact with her. 

There’s No doubt in my mind she made highly suggestive comments to him, and made him uncomfortable on multiple occasion, when she thought they were alone, or no one could hear her. 

Cut Jason some slack... It might not be his best performance, but remember, he’s trying to protect his marriage.",Rachelle Kates,14,2020-09-04T07:11:35Z
