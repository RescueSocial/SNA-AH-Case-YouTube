13,UgxyEm5BQPqge5mKIjx4AaABAg,m. wuzowski,"@Bill Smith  Ok let’s say Johnny’s a drug addict and he dealt with it way before Amber heard. Meaning if he abused her he must have abused his exes too but he didn’t, they even testified for him and those were his EX-GIRLFRIEND and EX-WIFE. He wasn’t even violent under the influence of those drugs. Whereas amber heard admitted to hitting him, there is so much fcking evidence. Even amber’s PARENTS sided with Johnny bcs they knew she had a mental problem, good grief IT’S HER PARENTS. If that’s not enough, for christ sake, SHE GOT ARRESTED BEFORE for abusing her ex-girlfriend. I don’t know tho whether you’re siding with Amber heard or just trying to bring Johnny depp down. But if you are siding with her, then as a neuroscience student, I truly wonder what goes inside your head to believe someone who has ADMITTED to the crimes charged against her 🤯",2021-03-14T22:59:20Z,2
