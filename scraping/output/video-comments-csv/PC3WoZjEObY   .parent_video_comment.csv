28,Ugz444Kmd33BR_sU6dV4AaABAg,"So I want to share my two cents and also share my personal experience as a man being on the receiving end of domestic abuse (though not in marriage, just a relationship).

I feel like this whole case has just been unfair. Not because Depp got fired, but because ONLY Depp got fired.
Either fire both of them, or non of them. The case is still ingoing in certain places, and saying that Johnny was the abuser because 1 verdict, especially where it was proven that the judge had close ties to the publisher of the article that dirtied Depp's name, is just wrong. Also: that judge should be fired. I find it mind-blowing that she was even allowed to be the judge in that case.

Now for my story and why I'm so closely watching this case:
I've been in an abusive relationship. It's honestly weird to talk about it, because even though I ended it about 10 years ago (with help from my friends, my family and even HER ex-friends who figured out what was going on), I still suffer from it. I have trouble with relationships. The last one I was in ended because I was ""too scared to mess around, have fun and she was shocked how scared I got when she wanted to joke and pretended to want and hit me (she knew about my relationship before that, but never expected it to be that bad). It's something that still haunts me to this day, and I sometimes catch myself thinking that I made a mistake of breaking up, because I believe I'm no longer in a position to ever get into a stable relationship.
The moment where I realized how messed up the world was, was when my ex kicked me down on the street, then kicked me in the private parts and pulled me up so we could get home (the reason this happened was because I didn't pick the right restaurant to go to).
Turned out that a policeman saw this. They came to her house while I was there as well, and simply told her (basically) that that was a bad thing to do and she shouldn't do stuff like that. That's all they said or did.
I started thinking what they would've done if it was me who kicked her while walking down a street, and I realized that I would've probably been taken into custody.
Now I'm not pretending that I was perfect: I once grabbed her arm when she tried to push me down the stairs, and accidently hurt her as she hit her head against the wall. Some friends told me it was in self defense, sure, but I still hurt her and I feel guilty about that to this day.
I'm watching this case so closely cause I'm hoping that this case will make me believe something that 10 years of psychiatry hasn't managed to prove me so far: that the world is fair and that justice exists.",Bahumut5,1,2020-12-04T23:15:45Z
