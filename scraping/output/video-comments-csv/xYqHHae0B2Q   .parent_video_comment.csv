I don't know what ""adult men 1 star reviewing this YA graphic novel"" have considered or not. I wouldn't review it, myself, as that would require reading it. I'm just here to watch the dumpster fire, not take part in it, and I expect that's the case for nearly all adult men that show any interest in it, at all. However, have you, presumably not adult man, considered that not all one star reviews come from adult men? Have you considered that adult critics raving about this graphic novel are also not in the target audience? Have you considered the possibility that there are adults, both men and women, who are ""review rocketing"" it?

How arrogant does one have to be, in order to assume that all negative criticism comes from ""adult men"" whose opinion doesn't count? Anyway, serious review sites have algorithms to compensate for review manipulation, usually by weighting the highest and lowest reviews lower when there are disproportionately many of them. Those lousy review ratings are probably an accurate representation of what people who have read the novel (and are therefore de facto in the commercial target group) think about it.",Erik Jarandson,1,2021-07-31T23:34:27Z

Or Mandy saying ""At least I'm not trying to be something I'm not"" while doing the Daria intro volleyball dodge.  Or Mandy wanting to go to France to get away from her mother, walks out on the SATs, cannot understand a word of French and doesn't take up her mother's offer to go to any university in the world, there is such a thing as studying abroad, many Indian and Chinese students do it all the time.  Drinks coffee that is little more than milk and sugar (we usually call that a milkshake).  The fact that we have another catty gay Asian, but this one is different for he is an anarchist who does not spout any anti government/authority rhetoric .  Mandy going full Gohan vs Raditz on her aunt, honestly what is it with young people who never once used their powers standing up against and beating seasoned combat veterans?  And lasty my favourite, her superhero outfit that was inspired by a Madonna 80s music video.

Honestly this is one of the most unoriginal books to have been made, most of it is was has my puberty, sorry I meant powers set in yet?

Starfire and Nightwing havin' a child together, two people with incredible skills, attributes, and metabolisms, would not make such a failure of a normie. Not sorry, but like, a cottonball in every way, shape, and form, even for a half-breed, has less than a 1% chance of being created between these two.

This self-insert is so dissatisfyingly disappointing that it makes me wonder if the comic artist even knows anything about these characters. Seems like they just didn't even care to figure out the proper lore. I mean, if you're gonna write 150+ pages of a comic, and not even get into what you advertise as a clash between Blackfire and this character, that's just sad. Feels like false advertising, seems kinda sad that the artist knows next to nothing from the origins of their own self-inserted OC, and it seems like people think we're bashing on this comic for sexuality rather than lore inconsistency.

I don't mind LGBT heroes being made, hell, I don't even mind some cringe looking back at Jason Todd. I do mind when you take pre-established characters, make an OC child that's a self-insert, make them completely self-centered and absorbed, and also despise their parents for... being a hero...?
