Show Johnny,...her victim. Displaying her image in ANYTHING other than an inglorious light is to feed her ego. No matter what you SAY about her, to reflect/broadcast her image is for her to win. That's how these people play (bad press is good press/better than no press) and win,...and you're helping her/Marvel; to win.",2021-06-12T16:30:45Z,0

27,Ugx0s6dEePs22guqWkd4AaABAg,ALDC Brights,"@Juan Benito What job are you referring too? JD has been replaced from the FB3 movie, and I doubt he's going to be recasted for the next POTC movie. Nevertheless, Amber is still toxic. Have you seen the interviews when she rolled her eyes and smirked while she listened to the audio recording? She probably only shoved food in her mouth so she could think of a lie to tell. She even blatantly admitted that she hit JD in the recording, and then she was like ""I didn't even hurt you."" It's still PHYSICAL ABUSE!! You can see from the interviews that JD has severely struggled, and he genuinely looks so depressed and emotionally drained.",2021-06-13T02:42:59Z,1
