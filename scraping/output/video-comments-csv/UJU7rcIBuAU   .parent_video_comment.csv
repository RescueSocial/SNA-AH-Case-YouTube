Everybody has a past no one is perfect we all have to live our life with past experience that we regrets doing and saying but that doesn't mean that everything you read or what other people are saying is fact. Boycotting a film because of a court case that obviously both party suffered from one another and we shouldn't be judging who was to blame and who should be punished the most. I wonder how many of you how done something in your past and got away with it yet you all think your perfect and everyone else who gets found out or roamers start to go around and get twisted are bad people.

That being said the amount of good publicity they are missing on by kicking amber out is stupid amounts high, just fking kick her and instantly boom you can lay off your entire PR team (dont do that), so it boggles my mind how they are stuck with her and how bad is her contract written that its worth keeping her rather than kicking her.

JD haters got their respect from a false accusation, but we dont even after she admits to hitting him.? Sorry you cant have your cake and eat it too.. Life don't work that way
When there is a BAD actress/actor in a film and in real life an abuser a rapist etc, it ruins the film for those that watch it.. JD haters should know that before finding out the Truth... 
For myself I waited to find out the facts before disliking either one of them. Now I know the truth and i can't look at Turd's face without thinking about what she did to Johnny. what She actually admitted to doing.
Even if they made up, became friends and he supported her, I still couldn't watch a film with her in it unless she dies horrible in the very beginning of a film or wears make up/mask to where I cant tell it's her,. then I might watch it...other then that, there is No way in Hell...
She deliberately ruined JD's career just for Money, She stole money from children. She pretended to be an abuse victim, She stole the story of a rape victim used it as her own. She mocked All victims and made things much harder for true victims. How can anyone support any film she is in even if she wasn't married to JD??

I adore Jason Mamoa, so I'm torn on the subject,  but feel Warner doesn't value it's fans, having said as much in a statement.  Amber represents the worst kind of person to me.  No decent human being sets out to knowingly destroy someone else's entire life, or purposely make them suffer out of some sense of revenge, greed, fame, or all of these combined. Revenge never pays off in the end. Johnny's injuries were only defensive in nature, which should be in evidence.  She chopped his dang finger off!   WHO does that?!  Then she defiled their marital bed with...Ugh!  Then had her makeup person make a bruise on her face, after which she called a press conference, because apparently, that's a normal thing to do after being completely traumatized and beat up.  He's been so lovely and gracious, yet has been treated so horribly by the same industry that Johnny helped make very rich!  It's ice cold and greedy of Warner and a real stab in the back of justice that they kept her, instead.  It also disrespects the fans. Johnny may be okay with it all, because he's a super decent guy, but his fans are definitely NOT at all cool with it.",Marta Womack,0,2021-06-29T21:03:57Z

Honestly, if you're so childish that you won't see a movie just because one person you dislike is in it, well then go ahead and be that child, that's your call. Just remember that you're not just hurting AH, you're hurting every member of the cast. Plus, you need to explain why they should remove her, the only legal president out there is JD's loss in the UK lawsuit. You also need to understand that until there is something to go against that ruling, they aren't going to change a damned thing nor should they!

I find it hilarious that you think that what happens in the US is somehow going to have any impact on viewers outside of the US. Don't forget that JD LOST his lawsuit and the appeal in the UK and that is all the international folks will ever see because they do not watch out news. Once again, your boycott isn't going to affect AH in any way, the only thing it does is hurt the innocent people that are in the movie with her.

You do understand that the man doesn't know you, he has no idea that you exist, and he couldn't give a damn what people say on the internet.
