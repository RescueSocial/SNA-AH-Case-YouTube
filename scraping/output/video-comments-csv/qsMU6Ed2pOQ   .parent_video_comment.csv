285,UgzDfEgujGmlHo3QD0x4AaABAg,"This is sad but not even close to shocking. I said it before & I'll say it again:

These companies only care about their money. If something doesn't affect it, they don't give a fuck. The sad way I see this going is if Aquaman 2 drops & a fuckton of people actually don't go out to see it  & they cite her as the cause on social media.

Of course the sadder part will be that
1: mainstream media will run with the same old 'Mysoginists blah blah blah Abuser-Depp sympathisers blah blah'

& worse yet

2: If the film flops because of it, I don't think WB will replace her, given their business practices I feel they'll just can the Aquaman franchise altogether.

So truthfully I see this as a lose/lose situation. My belief was always that she would bot get recast unless society as a whole turned visciously against her (Which of course wouldn't happen because, you know she's a pretty woman who said she was abused, the bar of evidence will have to be monumental so they can't pretend it doesn't exist).

I'm still watching events to get the Full Truth as best we can get it, but as of now those tapes blatantly showed her to be a bald-faced liar that deliberately profiting off victomhood by lying that she wasn't an aggressor & yet mainstream media buried it by not saying a single peep about it, so that should let you know where things truly stand",ethanarc,0,2020-03-11T22:26:51Z

They have only just begun working on the script. So my question is, if the WB doesn't know who is directing, or what the story is going to be...why would they go out of their way to tell the public that has made it obvious they don't want her, that Amber Heard is definitely returning...especially when she may end up incarcerated--which would take the whole mess off of their hands? I DID notice that ""questionable media"" are running the story with the first line ""Warner Bros has confirmed that the sequel to the hugely successful Aquaman will be coming to theaters on December 16, 2022."" And that is ALL that they have confirmed. The media make it look as if the complete story is confirmed...but it isn't. Only the date has been confirmed. More Amber Heard shills giving stories to support her to the shill media. ""Most of the main cast is expected to return to the sequel"" is not the same as Warner Brothers has confirmed the story and director and Amber Heard will be returning to the sequel.""",NIBS,6,2020-03-11T20:05:32Z

Depp loses a role that is inherently his and no one could picture anyone else playing this character, however, Amber Heard is caught on a recording talking about getting away with abuse, and the studio looks the other way. Apparently, there's a double standard.  Benjamin's over morals.  Great message to send out to kids and adults alike. I loved Aquaman but not enough to compromise my beliefs to go and see Aquaman 2.  They should really re-think their decision because I believe it'll have larger repercussions than just Aquaman 2 box office draws. Do they really want their reputation or name linked to an abuser? I guarantee the closer to the release date of this movie, the more this issue will be discussed. People really do need to stick to their guns and not attend.

On the Aquaman 2 case, I won't watch it either if she's really coming back lol. DC had a choice, and if they're afraid of firing her just because they're worried about the backlash they'll get from ""woke"" people? Then they don't deserve my money.

It is about a system that has been in place. They were not protecting Amber ( she might have benefited)
But this was the protection of a system. Plus to replace at this point would cost them $$$.

Let's just hope Johnny gets with Tim Burton for something really good. Pirates has jumped the shark. Johnny is very talented and needs to venture out.
How about ( Tim you listening?)
H.G. Well's ""Food of the God's"" book accuracy. Tim Burton & Johnny would do a magical job.
Johnny as a nerdy scientist from the 1800's. Hmmmm...( I always Imagined Johnny as H.G. Wells)
Me likey this concept.
Also, what's up with Johnny's Barbie collection?
lol, not one GI Joe in that room...
I believe this stuff will motivate Johnny Depp to focus & work on his career. All guns blazing. Sometimes a man needs to get his heart stomped on and Hellraiser chain-hooked pulled apart.
It sucks but it will make him stronger.
I know exactly what my man has felt. Giving the wrong girl the world
and suffering for it. He is a good , strong and talented man.
