4,UgyjM20KuMmwH__09ul4AaABAg,christino gonzalez,"Fr. I think the biggest reasons for me is that the charming presence she brings to her roles would work really well for James‚Äô Aquaman. She also has worked with Jason before for a romantic role with him. Therefore, she would fit in well not just because of that fact alone but because even though she wouldn‚Äôt be Mera in the first movie she would still have some pent up chemistry with him instead of feeling completely unnatural.",2021-03-16T01:53:01Z,0

41,Ugx28OLP5adAiuxjRR94AaABAg,NeoFlite23,"@Y B Agreed.  Continuum I believe was stopped short with a partial 4th and final season solely because of the scandal (even though the production company involved will flat out deny it then and now).  Many people on the show got work after the show.  And when I say they got work I mean they got good work and a lot of it.  Victor Webster, Lexa Doig, Erik Knudsen, Magda Aponowicz, Roger Cross, Ryan Robbins and Michael Ekland are clear examples of that.  Rachel on the other hand?  Got very little good to do.  It started with a film called Pandemic that was a writeoff and then 2 recurring guest roles for arcs on Chicago Fire and The Librarians.  I don't know if she's had work since The Librarians but unfortunately I think her career is currently stalled.  Real shame too.  To have a career stall over something like The Fappening?  There's nothing right about it but at the same time: it's Hollywood.  It's what they've done for decades...and it's sad.  Out!",2021-02-27T02:48:48Z,0
42,Ugx28OLP5adAiuxjRR94AaABAg,Y B,"@NeoFlite23 The Fappening Scandal?  She was there?  That really sucks, and I think people shouldn't be penalized for that.  In fact, she should get more work instead to show that people are not put down due to other people taking advantage of them.  That's like kicking someone when they are down.   I didn't know that, and that is a real shame.",2021-02-27T02:37:52Z,0
43,Ugx28OLP5adAiuxjRR94AaABAg,TheKingOfRuckus,"@NeoFlite23 Yeah, I looked up her imdb and she's gotten work, but she definitely did not take off the way I thought she would after continuum.

54,UgwRstEU_-x3xk4eXWJ4AaABAg,Gamemediafan 17,@Cheezy McPardin just saying cause Emilia doesn't look anything like Amber. One of the most important things with recasting a role is to get someone who looks and sounds like the original actress to make it convincing to the audience. Emilia doesn't do that with AH. It would be like if you get Nic Cage to replace JD for POTC. Both are good actors but they don't look or sound anything like so it would be really distracting.,2021-02-28T06:23:38Z,0
