1,UgylIEQ_vm0I_MTUEsx4AaABAg,Depp is a pseudo eccentric and general creep.  He looks like he smells like the padding under a carpet the dog has been peeing and n for 10 years.,Bishopp's Chicken Biscuits,0,2021-11-20T08:43:28Z
2,Ugy93cgNuw55UnQc1eJ4AaABAg,"JM is the type of person to not get involved in the issues of other people unless it affects him, or his. That being said, if AH is being pleasant to work with (or as other's would call it, two-faced) and doing her job as her character is required, then he's not going to have issues with her as an ACTRESS.

This does not mean that he's going to side with her, or JD. He has his own family/friends to focus on and a movie to put out. Anyone who's put in even a little bit of effort on learning about him will know all this.

Unfortunately, this is the bullshit of the major companies like WB. Aquaman (1.3b) literally made twice as much as FB2 (650m), comparatively, so of course they'll keep AH on to make sure Aquaman 2 doesn't flop. Also, AH is clearly smart enough to not jeopardize her role in a large payout. At this point, WB dumped JD on accusations and continued FB3 without him. They're not going to put him back into the movie and Aquaman is going to bring all that money, even with people refusing to watch it. They don't give a damn about what we think when all they see is Green, and which production will bring in the most of it.",Seluecus1,0,2021-11-20T07:28:24Z

103,Ugw1VTSIAdoLHgXeq8x4AaABAg,"Make this make sense.

So back when the allegations were coming out that Johnny Depp was an abuser and beating his wife. Without any proof the music industry was blacklisting and removed Johnny Depp for making any new movies and destroying his career. A lot of people in society was willing to crush this man because the word of his wife. An of course the feminist s were locked and loaded to tear Johnny Depp apart.

Now of course we find out later that hey actually Johnny Depp wasn't doing none of this and wasn't the abuser, and actually it was his wife and lying an she was the abuser physically and mentally. An we have proof of this.

Now Aquaman 2 is coming out and guess who's in the movie,Fucking Amber Heard. The abuser the person that was beating on her husband  and lying to everyone playing the victim BUT yet this cunt still has a career!!!!???? Why wasn't she blacklisted,why would anyone support this woman cause if you do then your a piece of shit also !!!

Talk about fucking double standards!!

The movie industry was so willing to destroy Johnny Depp entire life with no proof but yet we have proof that Amber Heard is actually the abuser but she's still allowed to have a career.

But she's one of those rotten to the core ppl in real life who use and abuse ppl in order to get what they want.
It's really pissing me off that Johnny got canceled by WB and this manipulative beast got to continue on Aquaman.

585,UgxzL8TfJ2NOs0TEFU94AaABAg,"I look at this much like I do other things in my life. Same as was the expectation during primary/secondary school, politics, people in my community or any job I ever held......

What happens in a person's private and/or personal life is their personal business and as long as it doesn't affect their behavior at school or on the job no one but those directly involved have any say over what happens unless there is abuse taking place in where the abused person has no say or the ability to help themselves, such as a child, Britney, mentally disabled persons etc.!!!! In cases where a child or disable person is being abused, our ""business"" of it is to see to it that the abused person is protected from the abuser/s and the abuser/s is/are brought to justice.
Regardless of whether or not we agree with or disagree with something someone has done or said, we have ZERO right to demand they be fired and employers have ZERO right to fire someone simply based upon ANYTHING they do not related to work unless it meets the above mentioned criteria. Breaking the law would be the only exception and then it depends on the law, the job held, if it prevents one from keeping said job, etc. as to the only possible way someone could be fired for something done outside of work.
IF we do not agree with something someone has done then we can choose not to support that person a business and/or a product. That is our only option!!!!! PERIOD!!! 
IF we allow companies to fire someone because of private and/or personal issues or even publicly made comments(ALL of which are protected by GOD and The Constitution) Now, then we absolutely risk someone down the road/in the future potentially firing/canceling us for something in our private/personal lives they do not agree with!!! IF she is the best person for the job they cannot legally fire her. The same goes for his role which they have fired him from. He absolutely has a lawsuit against the company for that!!!!!!!!!

We don't have to like the personality, the gender, the religious beliefs or lack thereof, etc. but they are ABSOLUTELY entitled to the same rights and freedoms as the rest of us...or at least that is the way we should want to keep it in the US...and elsewhere!!!!!!!",The Duckling Homestead and Gardens,1,2021-07-12T20:07:29Z

I don‚Äôt know the details of her contract but in most cases there are clauses that state if either party breaks the contract they owe the second party X amount of money. Depending on how many movies she‚Äôs under contract for the studio could be looking at many times more than just a single movie‚Äôs contract fee. However if it turns out that an actor‚Äôs position negatively effects the studio and/or franchise they can be terminated without penalty to the studio, however there needs to be proof of their negative impact.

Why would WB fire a lead actor in the middle of filming a 200 million dollar picture because she's been going through a messy divorce from Johnny Depp?  And why would Jason Momoa comment publicly at all on the situation which does not involve him.  Imagine your spouses' coworker who does not know you commenting on your personal life in a public forum?  Do you really think the people who watch movies care about Amber Herd and Johnny Depp?  They do not know these people and they have no place putting judgement on either one of them.

714,UgzigXDpat0RS5CrU6p4AaABAg,"I really wish personal and business parts of celebrities lives could be kept separate, and that companies like Warner Brothers could just hire the actors they need for their movies they produce. None of this having to choose sides BS, and I wish their personal problems could remain personal and private, our opinions should not be what controls who gets to work in Hollywood. Then nobody would have to be canceled from the movies they've worked so hard on and they should continue to get to be apart of (Depp with his pirates series and fantastical beasts series, and Heard with the Aquaman series). They should be able to continue their series until they're completed or until their trial is over, then if Warner Brothers wants to choose a side at that point all the dirty laundry will be exposed and they can make a better decision with all the information at hand. This whole situation of going on Heards side first then going on Depps side after her being exposed as the abuser and a liar. If I was WB I'd fucking postpone all shoots for all movies both actors are in and wait for them to finish their trials, then make a decision on who should be backed by the company at that point. Obviously they wouldn't want to wait that long, but if that's  the case then they should have kept running with both actors doing there own movies and it should just be business as usual until the final result of the trial. I just think there are to many people with to many opinions about other people's lives that we have no right to impose on. Let them battle it out in court away from the public eye, get a speedy result and then go back to making movies. I really hate all this cancel culture crap, and women's movements that are meant to empower and help us feel that we can be honest about the traumas we've gone through.
