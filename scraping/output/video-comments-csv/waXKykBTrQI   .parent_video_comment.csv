I also think she thought holding up documenting would be forever.

If this is the newspaper appeal, isn't that over long ago? So how can there be another ruling? Which judge, in what court, for what offence? Some context please?

You can't appeal a ruling on press liable with information not relevant to the specific act of liable. You need another court case on some other offence. You can't just keep appealing the same case again and again when the underlying facts about what was printed have already been addressed.

Stop obfusticating criminal and civil action. Libel was a case against what was printed, not the criminal activity of assault or anything else. You can't appeal a libel case because the criminal case was or wasn't proven. All the newspaper has to prove is that it was true at the time of going to press and was adequately investigated to print what they did. If the facts change later the newspaper isn't to blame.

109,UgxaXJqlVtFx6RrP0W14AaABAg,"I have said from the beginning, both had there parts of a horrible relationship. I know JD is not innocent in all this nor is AH. My only thought was either they both get punished, take time away and get some help or neither do. They were both adults, and wealthy adults, each fully capable of leaving a bad situation without any of the worries most have. For example, a woman leaving a abusive relationship were the spouse is the bread winner so the choice to leave would be difficult without any back-up. Seeing how this played out i would think, JD could counter sue for her admitted abuse, and that charges could be picked up against AH for perjury. I can get how a judge wouldn't want to roll back a decision of another judge. Despite newfound evidence, both were at fault clearly in this relationship. I am still under the impression JD is paying for what he did and AH is not though. Personally, i own Aquaman 1, but im will not buy aqua2 until AH is taken out. Like i said both get punished for there part in it or neither.

Judge Nichols went to far in calling Johnny an abuser that is unjustice. All Nichols had to do was state that Johnny team did not prove Libel. 

In fact Nichols in his first paragraph did state Jonny legal team did proof libel but Amber was abused.

After this call of denying his appeal and seeing what reasons they appellant judges denied it, they're saying in the case of the Sun and Dan ""S-Predator"" Wooton's publication, there is nothing wrong because as the current ruling stands; JD is still pinned as an offending party to AH. If the lawsuit between JD and AH had occurred first and then had JD gone after the Sun and DW, then he would have over turned the charges and then their publication would be full of lies and his case would have gone through.

The unfortunate focus of the UK suit was whether or not the Sun and DW had defamed JD and written slanderous material about him. It was not JD vs AH over there. If it was, then this rejection would be a lot more devastating. But the UK Justices have realized that that judgement is beyond their jurisdiction and is beyond the contents of that case. I do really want JD to receive the justice and compensation he's over due for because AH is just absolute scum, but we've been demanding for a ""face-masking"" and ""pass interference"" call on a play while watching a game of Cricket. Those calls and that game don't match up. It sucks, but in turn the UK Justices have acknowledged out front that AH is absolutely sus. So don't f**k this up, US Justices.",Steeljaw XXI,0,2021-04-07T18:09:20Z

BTW local is after national and business but before sports and weather, so clearly more than 14 pages in.
