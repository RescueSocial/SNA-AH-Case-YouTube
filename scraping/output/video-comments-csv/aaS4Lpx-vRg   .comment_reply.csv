I mean that should‚Äôve been the most important trial to win and go forward with AFTER such trial is done. The main problem is that AH has lied and that issue was the root of everything that came after. Dismantling such a lie would have brought justice to any one even mentioning JD as an DV. Even all the jobs he‚Äôd lost prior to it would‚Äôve been a big foul play on contract. Anything based on lies should be salved from the root source, AH. JD went too personal on trying to go after the sun as they just report based on something that wasn‚Äôt considered  true nor false yet. Anything based on hearsay can be interpreted how a judge feel like to believe it or not. This is why it was crucial to actually dismantle AH accusations and therefor acquit the hearsay before even planing a trail against the sun or any other legal issue JD had to take to clear his name.",2021-04-03T15:57:31Z,1

I can't wait for this case to show the evidence. ps...I live in Malibu, many friends are in the industry and have all said the same, JD is known to be a kind  caring human being., and AH, just is a narcissist .
