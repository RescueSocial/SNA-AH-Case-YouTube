Everyone took upon face value because she was a woman and he was a man that ultimately he was guilty. He lost everything when our justice system is supposed to be ""Innocent until proven guilty"". He never once had a violent outburst towards a partner (maybe some hotel rooms but that was in the 80s and 90s) and she HAD. He paid the settlement with the understanding she was donating the ENTIRE thing.

63,UgzHSj2AmzBlrRa0NGd4AaABAg,Shifting Mercury,"@DeltaBleu There are text messages going back years talking about the abuse. So that was debunked long ago. You are twisting the information in the texts. That her parents said she needed a restraining order so that she could have time to figure out what to do. She didn‚Äôt want to just take off and hide from Johnny. She then dropped the request for the restraining order so he didn‚Äôt have to go to court and face criminal charges because he agreed to tell the truth. Which he did indirectly through the joint statement by saying that no one lied. He changed his story later on when he realized how damaged his career was. I wonder why nobody remembers that statement and what was said in the phone call between Amber and him when he says he didn‚Äôt call her a liar and promises to address the violence. She also lists off all the things he did to her and he doesn‚Äôt deny it once because he knows he can‚Äôt. He was trying to get her to have the charges dropped so he had to be honest. That conversation was quite telling. Along with the recording before where Amber admitted to hitting him that time but also accused him of abuse and he admitted that they were physical with each other. This was recorded way before she got that restraining order. Which also debunks your original conspiracy theory.

As for Rupert Murdoch, the UK‚Äôs libel laws make it quite easy for the media to lose because they have to prove what they said is true. Whereas in the states, it is the opposite and the accuser has to prove that it isn‚Äôt true. Lance Armstrong even won a libel case against a news company that said he was doping. Years later we find out they were right but because they couldn‚Äôt prove it, they list. There is a thing called libel tourism because of the UK libel laws. It‚Äôs easier for the accuser to win. That‚Äôs why he went to the U.K. and went after a British paper and also why it was shocking that Johnny lost. Which means the evidence against him was strong. I can‚Äôt see him winning the Virginia case unless the hurt is so fame struck that they simply favor Johnny over Amber. Which does happen. Like with OJ and with Michael Jackson.",2021-05-21T23:55:38Z,0
