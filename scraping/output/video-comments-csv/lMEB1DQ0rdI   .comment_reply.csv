151,Ugzo7SP4zNv7cMJyNh54AaABAg,Star Light,@OfGrain to be fair I actually saw the sequels without knowing anything else aside from original trilogy and I don't mean the comics novels or video games I mean specifically the first three movies and while I liked them well enough I wasn't really a hardcore fan or anything. That being said I also didn't understand why pepole were giving the sequels so much hate as I had seen and enjoyed the first  and though the second one was meh I thought pepole were over exaggerating. Than I saw the prequel trilogy along with the clone wars and learned a bit more about the original trilogy story wise and with all due respect I can't say I blame the og fanbase for being so pissed at the sequals. Not only did disny just throw out like 75% of the whole star wars but they weren't exactly consistent with the parts of the story they actually decided to keep and its fairly obvious that no one did there research on the story they were supposed to be writing about.,2020-10-14T12:43:22Z,0

He was kind and generous to all of the cast and crew..once spending 60.000 dollars on waterproof coats for them all after a scene in the water. His wine bill was also  due to him getting crates of it flown over and given out to cast and crew. The press have tried to disparage him in so many ways.

232,Ugxz8YkALObXegB5DtR4AaABAg,Loki For President,@J Force Broh he never was a main character mate you just thought of that because he's great at acting and almost at its every scene but most of the main character is mostly elizabeth and turner and turner's son and barbosa's daughter but its okay if you thought of it that way cause i did too now i admire depp because he was a side character but made us feel that he was the main character,2020-07-25T04:04:05Z,1
233,Ugxz8YkALObXegB5DtR4AaABAg,Justin Nguyen,"@Loki For President I watched the first didn't watch the second and the third cause I'm poor and watched the third and fourth movie. I agree that Johnny as a side Jack sparrow was good and I liked the 5th movie but after watching the 4th and 1st, yeah I think Johnny should be a side character and should instead focus on someone we know for so long that could or couldn't be female cause it'd be interesting to see a side character such as Gibbs be the main character or see how a female pirate could be different from a standard male pirate but if they were gonna make a 6th movie with a main female role then make her not captain jack sparrow and all the other side characters and not Rey who was a jedi, a pilot, etc giving everyone's trait to her making her Marry sue and instead make her fail the first few times, learn from the mistakes and keeps getting progressively and progressively better or if it is the final movie than kill her if she's not interesting.",2020-07-25T02:41:53Z,1
234,Ugxz8YkALObXegB5DtR4AaABAg,Blue Rose,I'm okay with Jack Sparrow being a side character. What I'm not okay is Capt. Jack Sparrow is being a side character TODAY because Disney might pull a Luke Skywalker and ruin his character.,2020-07-05T08:55:53Z,3
