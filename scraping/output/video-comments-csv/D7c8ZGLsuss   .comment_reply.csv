Maybe it's her niece and lying about it to get sympathy, but the dates are very suspicious and would have fallen in with the va dates. But can't also understand how she has kept that a secret for so long as she's all about attention and she only posted it when so much backlash all against her in aquaman 2 started filming and I really do think that she thought it would give her sympathy and good pr especially being a single mum but it backfired on her. Why has she not posted any natural looking photos with that child or videos, no one has seen her with a baby and she's in the UK when she should be with the baby which I highly doubt is in London with her, plus that would be very stupid and dangerous to fly a baby to another country during this pandemic.  A lot doesn't add up but maybe that's because everything that comes out of her mouth has been a lie. It wouldn't surprise me if it comes out that isn't her child and it was a lie.
