8,UgwOeOscTruD4VxBj9B4AaABAg,Maddie M,She should be fired. Stripped of any ongoing movie projects.  Find her disgusting.  I bet she wishes she could punch Johnny again for these leaked tapes that or cut another one of his body parts off.  She's a narcissist and a psycho.,2020-02-05T13:25:38Z,1
9,UgwOeOscTruD4VxBj9B4AaABAg,Super High,@Allen James i mean she should be arrested for domestic abuse. That'll get her fired anyway. This ain't just cancel culture,2020-02-05T09:18:45Z,2
10,UgwOeOscTruD4VxBj9B4AaABAg,Allen James,"I donâ€™t think he shouldâ€™ve lost his role. I donâ€™t think she should either. This cancel culture bullshit is absurd. If itâ€™s a serious enough incident then the authorities should do their job, but otherwise thatâ€™s their personal business no matter how the public views it. They are both alive and well, so I donâ€™t know why the public needs to be involved.",2020-02-05T02:06:35Z,3

15,UgyeFkKMhcCVYKg-1rp4AaABAg,The Fair Haired Boy With The Red Balloon,You are a scumbag. Your comment is mind blowing in itâ€™s idiocy.  So Johnny Depp is a Â¨pusÃ¿ for getting upset at being a victim of domestic abuse?  You are a moron and a domestic abuse apologist- You are disgusting.,2020-02-05T06:50:41Z,4
16,UgyeFkKMhcCVYKg-1rp4AaABAg,zhengyingli,CyanBlue How is Depp a pussy for crying about being hit by another person?,2020-02-05T01:24:00Z,2
17,UgyeFkKMhcCVYKg-1rp4AaABAg,Frank Merker,Except if you reversed the genders then his career would be over. The double standard is the issue here,2020-02-04T22:26:10Z,17
18,UgyeFkKMhcCVYKg-1rp4AaABAg,Timothy Mills,she threw vases at him and sliced off the tip of his finger which he got reconstructive surgery for. does that count as a weapon?,2020-02-04T22:24:49Z,13

23,UgwbnJ5MBmR2Mt_5PtJ4AaABAg,Denenterprieses or whats left of it,"@Frank Merker na but on the real this is getting alot of steam like the petition to remove her from the DCEU has over 2500000 signs in less than a week which is way more than the snydercut petition got during its whole 2 years 

my guess is they may replace her or x off her character cuze WB  and DC can't afford to have this kinda negative shit dragging down their new BO King",2020-02-09T06:16:21Z,0
