2,Ugx4opZaimGc7ytcT3x4AaABAg,Colonel Kurtz,I didn't remove it. Don't know what you're even talking about it. I never remove comments unless they are just disgusting or attacking another commenter unfairly.,2021-02-28T18:57:46Z,1
3,UgzZcSN18EwZfSMBvpJ4AaABAg,Joshua Scott Hotchkin,@Colonel Kurtz thank you. #groktheidiocracy,2021-02-11T05:45:06Z,1
4,UgzZcSN18EwZfSMBvpJ4AaABAg,Colonel Kurtz,This is an excellent sophisticated analysis.  totally agree,2021-02-11T05:27:48Z,3
5,UgxLq8VElWnYN7BkC7p4AaABAg,Alena Malecka,"@Colonel Kurtz well i think the judge couldnt rule against the sun because the sun didnt do anything ,,wrong,, from legal point because tabloit is entrtainment its like a firytale and that people take it seriously thats a different problem. Tabloit helps actually to make people famouse and the positive stories about stars in tabloit are mostly as well ,,fake,, and just marketing and they report them. if we make it the tabloits responsibility to inveatigate everything before they print there would be no tabloit and the stars would not be as notoriously famous..because its the part of the job..im more sad that the public sees this as a ruling in favour of AH or as a statement that its now proven  that JD did abuse her...since i study law for me it was clear that JD will probably  loose and i cant understand that lawyers even supported him in pressing this charges against the sun,because in a criminal charge the accuser has to prove the charge beyond resonable daubt in the law suit against the sun johnny had to prove his side and the judge didnt need to prove beyond resonable daubt just if at the time with the evidence that the sun had at the time of printing the article(before the tapes relase) if it did seam probable that he did attack her and that she was a victim of his abuse thats all...but i was not at the court hearing so this is still just speculation at the end...",2021-02-10T20:03:54Z,0
6,UgxLq8VElWnYN7BkC7p4AaABAg,Colonel Kurtz,"Good comments, thanks. These are important points, but I still think the judge's ruling was deeply flawed.",2021-02-10T19:25:28Z,1
7,UgxLq8VElWnYN7BkC7p4AaABAg,Alena Malecka,"The judge never ruled that JD abused AH and i think he didnt even care, he ruled in favour of THe Sun that they didnt do anything wrong or cause him harm by believing the story that AH said and that they did print it....its just not against the law...",2021-02-10T16:38:09Z,1
8,UgwsUvpbz4ztsLD2k7J4AaABAg,karismatica55,"@Colonel Kurtz Yeah, that's for sure! I know lots of ppl believe he reached his decision based on him being older & having that old outdated notion that women don't beat men, but I don't think so. He had way too many connections to the Turd and the Murdochs. I'm sure you've already read up on those....
BTW, I love your videos! I actually prefer it when you inject your personal opinions into the commentary... some of them drip of sarcasm which crack me up, because it's exactly how I feel! LOL...",2021-02-06T05:24:41Z,0

12,UgxD0E3B_r3NQzTwC2d4AaABAg,Quintessence,"It's particularly sick that she would lie to her mother about something like this. I wouldn't want to worry my mother if this was REALLY happening to me, much less if it wasn't! What a psychopath. Her mother died thinking that her daughter was being abused--how terrible! It's one thing to want revenge in a love affair, but to terrify your parents, too, is so sick.",2021-02-04T22:24:49Z,5

19,Ugy_p4YTy1raDFzEvOx4AaABAg,Kate Gould,"That pic of her laughing is revealing in more ways than the lack of the bruise. It's also Amber feeling compelled to show everyone how she is ""winning"". No DV survivor would be laughing manically like that, it doesn't make sense. What makes sense is that a dumped narcissistic person has schemed to strike back at the person that dumped them and has to show the world how she is the superior one.. In her twisted mind she thought she was back in control.",2021-02-07T12:22:19Z,6
20,Ugy_p4YTy1raDFzEvOx4AaABAg,petra r.,and you can see the redness from laughing. so there is no way she has makeup who covers a bruise but when she is laughing her face gets red ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è the judge was absolutely in her ass! otherwise there was no way she got away with this lie,2021-02-05T19:18:23Z,3
21,UgzRWRKvLSRr4AC01dt4AaABAg,Colonel Kurtz,"Exactly. People don't want to believe that a woman could be capable of an abuse hoax, but the truth is both sexes are capable of any and everything. What she has done is terrible for the many real victims of domestic violence who will now be less believed by some because of Amber's actions. On the upside, maybe now there will be more sympathy for the victims of female domestic violence because statistically men suffer domestic abuse as much as women, though you don't hear about it.",2021-01-12T16:35:02Z,4

23,Ugz03w_GBD6GOMA0DJJ4AaABAg,Alegna LaVieenRose,"The judge even helped add to her narrative, very very dangerous precedent. That judge isn‚Äôt worth his powdered wig. That verdict was a travesty for multiple reasons.",2021-02-14T14:00:32Z,3

34,UgzWUBK5P6WCvrETDBd4AaABAg,Eliza Winters,"@EAprima The Sun actually referred to her the other day in their title, saying new evidence is coming. It was their response to the donations documents. Could be publicity stunt or just another pack of lies.",2021-01-11T03:05:05Z,3

Ooo. When did she say that? I thought that was the photos of Johnny being drunk and passed out? The same photos she took of him where she planted poured ice-cream on him while he was passed out at his home, and another one when he was passed out in the toilet in a hotel/home.",2021-01-11T02:27:36Z,4
