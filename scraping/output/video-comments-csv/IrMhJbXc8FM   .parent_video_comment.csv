3,Ugw06hu7_gB_GdvntSp4AaABAg,"Love your Trini accent, Phoenix.  I have to agree with others in the comments section.  This wasn't a mutually abusive relationship. Amber is in recordings admitting to physically abusing Johnny, Johnny's body guards witnessed her throwing cans, purses, and other things at Johnny.  There are photos from his body guards of bruises and cigarette burns, and of course there was the incident in which she severed the top of his finger on his right hand (he's a guitarist so losing his finger is a big deal), crushed the bone and he contracted MRSA 3 times.  Amber's sister told her friends that Amber was the abuser and Amber was the one who pushed the sister down the stairs, not Johnny.  There is no real evidence that Johnny abused Amber.  Her ""evidence"" doesn't hold up to scrutiny; her stories aren't consistent - which is a major red flag.  Johnny may be at fault for not leaving the relationship earlier -- he left her after she pooped in his bed, she just got to court first because she expected him to file - but she is the one who told lies to the public to ruin his reputation which caused him to lose movies.  Frankly, as a victim of abuse myself, I am very angry that an abuser has stepped in the role of spokesperson for victims of abuse.  It is a very common tactic for abusers to step forward ahead of the victim and claim the victim role and that's what Amber did.  She glommed onto the metoo movement and now she speaks about DV when she was the abuser.  That all by itself makes her a con artist.  I don't want to be represented by an abuser.  She has nothing to say about abuse that any real victim of abuse wants to hear.  She is being used by organizations who want a ""victim"" to speak out, but it's false, phony and insincere to have a female abuser represent female victims.  Shame on the UN and the ACLU for using an abuser as a spokesperson.  Shame, shame, shame on them.",Been There,1,2021-07-03T13:21:01Z

6,UgwMXM_36_TgFS7iodR4AaABAg,"After the police body cam footage coming out, proving she totally lied on the stand in the Uk, as did some of her friends, the only way this is going to be settled is if Elon Musk pays Johnny Depp the $50million he is taking Amber to court over.  Thats the only way they will both come out ok, Johnny will get his vindication and compensation, Amber won't go bankrupt because Musk will settle her bills.",Kaytee,7,2021-04-17T16:01:26Z

10,UgwcocEwlEZt2B1XlPp4AaABAg,"Hey Guys! 👀💥👀💥Predictions I've made in this reading once again have come through👀💥👀💥 The UK High Court have overturned Johnny's Depp's appeal against the Sun Newspaper and Amber Heard. See link to article here 👉 https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/johnny-depp-loses-appeal-amber-heard-high-court-b926189.html  In addition, part of my reading has been corroborated by the fabulous Antphrodite 🤩. In his summation, Johnny Depp is not as innocent as he wants people to believe. (However, in my reading I channelled they'd both been abus!ve towards each other) You can see his reading here 👉 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjokWuzO7Go",Phoenix Spring Tarot,1,2021-03-29T22:16:05Z

Hi Guys - Thank you all for watching and taking time to leave feedback 🙋‍♀‍ I only read what the cards tell me and I do not insert my personal opinion. I also aim to give a nuanced view over and above what is delivered in the mainstream/social media not for the sake of being different but for the sake of making us think and question why situations occur so we can spot the signs and avoid toxic situations that I myself have fallen victim too often. 

I believe @PureSparkes22 was referring to the deposition tapes and audio recordings where she admits hitting Johnny. In my reading I point out that she got with Johnny to social climb and for her career. I try on my platform to avoid using labels such as ""narcissist"" where I can. This can often be a point of confusion for viewers who want me to ""call a thing, a thing"". 

There are also recordings and evidence of Johnny getting physical with Amber. It was on the basis of this evidence that the Sun newspaper in the UK was able to win its defamation case in which they called Johnny a ""wife be@ter"". 
The being made in this reading, when I said that both of them were at fault, is that they were not suited to each other (which I think we can all agree), they were both abusive to each other (there is proof for this) and their careers would not recover. Also, it was pointing out that Johnny is a sweet soul and was naïve when he met Amber. He saw the flags but ignored them at great cost to him. 

Therefore, I wanted the take away from this reading to be, don't avoid the signs and trust your gut instincts. Abuse is not perpetrated just by men but also women. You’re not just born an abuser but you can be pushed to the point where you do things out of character that you regret but by the time it happens it’s too late. This is meant to be a cautionary tale as opposed to who is right and who is wrong…..Let's learn from the mistakes of others , avoid toxic situations and be safe. Also, it's my wish that we keep our integrity in calling out situations that are not right to help those who can't help themselves w/out  vilification 🕊️",Phoenix Spring Tarot,4,2021-03-08T17:58:07Z
