But then again WB does like green lighting random DC movies that we donâ€™t want. But this is so badly timed itâ€™s not even funny.

And with the negative press theyâ€™re getting because of Ray Fisher and that whole ordeal, heâ€™s definitely not getting a movie now and might not even be able to reprise his role. If they do in fact give Cyborg his own movie they might re-cast. Hopefully not though because I like Fisher in the role and will probably like him even more once we see him (how we were intended to) in the Snyder Cut.",2020-11-25T22:15:50Z,0

24,UgwBHDuza9kGsWSjhQF4AaABAg,Luke Barber,"@Lexii Loo According to multiple media sources, she had images of bruising and domestic abuse related injuries. The weird thing for me is how extreme all this stuff seems that amber Heard did, I've seen many domestic abuse reports and none of them have even come close to how bad this is. It almost seems a bit comical with how random these events are. So do people believe that Depp is completely innocent or are people focusing all the attention on her not looking at what he might have done as well. 
Also the whole thing with her staying in roles is a bit odd, however her only role will probably be as mera now, everyone is saying that Depp had it worse (for receiving jobs), he will probably receive jobs in the future, it's just that he's no longer part of the harry potter thing. I wouldn't be surprised if amber Heard loses her job as mera but I can see how media is pissing people off by spreading rumours about her being even more successful now.",2020-11-24T22:54:47Z,0

He came back with none. Every person who he spoke to could only say nice things about him, how kind he is.

45,UgxerrnNwoDZR_TgDcl4AaABAg,Akil Brazier,"@Chadware Yes, I wouldâ€™ve loved to have a proper Birds of Prey movie because I like the group in the comics and it has potential for an actual good movie. Black Canary and Barbara Gordon (whether as Oracle or Batgirl) are actually my favorite female characters in DC comics. While it wouldâ€™ve probably benefitted from introducing a couple of the characters first, I think the only one that would absolutely NEED to be introduced prior would be Barbara. And then Canary, Huntress, and whoever else they wanted to add to the group could be introduced in that movie.",2020-11-27T22:52:01Z,1

But to be fair, Flash, Nightwing, and Green Lantern Corps have all been greenlit and Flash looks like it might actually be FINALLY happening and coming out in 2022. But yea either way, that superman sequel is past overdue. Donâ€™t get me started on that Turds of Prey movie though. I finally watched it a couple weeks ago, and while itâ€™s not QUITE as dogshit as I thought it was gonna be, it did a lot of things that I didnâ€™t like and knew I wasnâ€™t gonna like before I even watched it. So overall still not a good movie. Who knows though, maybe theyâ€™re gonna use Flashpoint to erase that shit and give us a proper slate of movies with a Man of Steel sequel as part of it.

But it's a movie that you need to build up to- you need to establish Babs as Batgirl, have her become Oracle, you need to introduce Dinah at the very least doing her own thing, probably establish Nightwing first too (as Dixon's runs on Nightwing and Birds were concurrent and intertwining)- and THEN you will have my permission to make a Birds of Prey movie.",2020-11-26T03:36:44Z,1

59,Ugx3JJAab-HnY40K1eN4AaABAg,Johnny,@Matthew Hall Fitzsimons Thanks buddy. I share your frustration with this whole situation as Johnny Depp deserves so much better and I really believe that he is innocent but the justice system has really failed him. I do have a good feeling though in time he will be one of the actors who will manage to recover from this as there are still many who believe that hes innocent of his allegations. I could be horribly wrong but I think Depp will eventually pick himself back up and on the map. Amber Heard got away with way too much and needs to be held accountable so we can only hope that things get better for Depp.,2020-12-14T11:50:00Z,2

61,Ugx3JJAab-HnY40K1eN4AaABAg,Johnny,@Matthew Hall Fitzsimons I couldn't agree more. I think this is one of double standard cases where the justice system only examines the man and not the woman which is honestly just a horrible system. I know domestic abuse cases are statistically higher with men being the aggressors but women are equally capable of the same crime even if statistics are lower for women committing them. Abuse is still abuse and Amber Heard has gotten away with it because she played her gender card which just goes to show that women are largely more protected in the justice system than men are. I guess at the end of the day the only people who know what really happened are the ones involved but I find it extremely hard to believe that Johnny Depp was the aggressor.,2020-12-14T11:33:45Z,2
