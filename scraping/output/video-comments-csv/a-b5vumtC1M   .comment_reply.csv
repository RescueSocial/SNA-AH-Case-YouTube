7,UgzZgFnYKzugbdFaUHt4AaABAg,Neener,Exactly.  Another side affect of accutane is violent outbursts.  That's why it must be closely monitored by a physician.  I wanted to try it for my daughter but they said it would be difficult with her ADHD meds.  Which Turd also abuses.  And of course she has the coke and schroom problem.  Both of which are mood altering.  JD didn't have a chance with this Barn Witch.  He was sober when they first got together.  She quickly changed that.,2021-06-20T17:50:52Z,4

9,Ugwtup-HpXhYnd31DMx4AaABAg,Queen Babylonia,"Also, JD had the finger injury and was wearing a sock, (which is soft, itâ€™s not a cast), he had also MRSA in it which gives excruciating pain. Which makes it all rubbish because whichever hand she says she was being head and face punched with, the other supposedly had such a strong grip it could hold onto her by her hair and drag her completely around apartment, and be pulling hair out in the process. And as Stevie says, she obviously has Wolverine healing powers.",2021-06-18T18:16:16Z,4

13,UgzAch5y8lMy00HIFVV4AaABAg,Queen Babylonia,"I think there was definitely some contrast bought in, etc and some fiddling in the colour contrasts, (saturation), and it looks like itâ€™s been done badly. The light above is definitely position to cast shadow under eyes, (something she would know from photographers when doing a shoot etc., as they are so fussy with lighting in studios, using reflectors and upward lighting to so that this does not happen. ).. they would say not to stand nearly under the light above because of this).",2021-06-18T18:05:36Z,3

16,Ugw8AQyK8u0yusR4SOR4AaABAg,Queen Babylonia,"I also think sheâ€™s had lots of fillers and Botox beside the cheek implants, if you look at Witney, she has naturally a trough below her eyes (on the bone). AH eye are I think is the same so she has treatments for this as her eyes  often change from no wrinkles and plump, to deflating, which is the time treatments are  done to fading and her â€˜topping upâ€™  treatmentsâ€¦",2021-06-18T17:14:33Z,2
17,UgxPyQ3G59fxYaLecrt4AaABAg,Christine Lloyd,She definitely had rhinoplasty. She used these photos after her plastic surgery. What a lowlife!,2021-07-01T12:06:29Z,0
18,UgxPyQ3G59fxYaLecrt4AaABAg,KANAN NAKUM,"Nose job or not above photos & Andy's analysis show she used makeup in these photos. She then looks perfect in the photo she took after Cordon show of her lip. Where are her black eye & nose ðŸ™„ Also bruises are never black hrs after initial injuries. They should be red/purple. She tried, but couldn't even do the makeup right. Lol.",2021-06-18T13:41:10Z,4

21,UgxeuYTIrcsNMBILwrR4AaABAg,CS,imo.....it belongs to one of her friends in one of the elevator videos. Not Rocky but the other blonde who is a makeup artist i think?,2021-06-18T00:01:15Z,2
22,UgxeuYTIrcsNMBILwrR4AaABAg,Jay A Errington,I'm a hairdresser those are not pulled from the root and the hair is not long enough to have been pulled out so she has long layers none that short and your hair does not snap off halfway down... Plus she showed pics of a red scalp that looked like make up meaning she was trying to say that short chunk of synthetic hair was from the scalp...,2021-06-17T22:59:49Z,5
