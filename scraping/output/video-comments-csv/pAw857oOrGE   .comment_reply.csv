18,Ugwm4gu8OSPvPAfRscx4AaABAg,Tonia Thraw,"@eHacker I actually gave this some more thought. Maybe it is scripted from a-to-z and the phone ringing is not an accident but a way to demonstrate how well she'd handle awkward situations like this. She picks up her story a bit too suave to be unrehearsed. No ""where was I?"" No flustered pauses.

I usually describe her with the ""You know she's lying because her lips are moving."" I do try to see the good in people but I may give ppl a bit too much credit sometimes.",2020-10-21T00:16:00Z,0

66,Ugy8mkug-SsWYJ47PWB4AaABAg,crazy4orlando2,"@eHacker I don't like her. I think she is a dishonest, manipulative selfish b!th but that doesn't mean everything she does is nefarious. 
She has created a world for herself where she is the center. She has no perspective other than her own. That is her own failure and the failure of those around her. She has no desire or incentive to change her thoughts or behavior. So she can do and say things that come off distasteful or bad to the rest of us with no ill intent. 
This clip shows her sustance dependency and reflects her willfully self centered mindset. 
She is a member of the lgbtq community and maybe when she was younger (or even then) she had thoughts of suicide. You don't typically become abusive and a drug/alcohol abuser because you have a happy wonderful life. 
So maybe this speech was harder for her than you might expect. People are multifaceted. She can be both a terrible person and a person that has experienced terrible things.
Although we know alot about her actions during her marriage to Johnny Depp we don't know why she is the way she is. Though it doesn't change what she did and is doing.  
If you look for the bad in someone you can find it. Johnny Depp is not angel but the evidence shows he's not a wife beater. They both have many flaws as do we all.
I'm not so quick to find a fault in everything she does. There is enough of her abuses, lies and duplicitous behavior out there you don't have to go looking for it.",2020-10-15T00:05:05Z,0

She is actively trying to do harm to people, and not just Johnny Depp. I don't feel bad about it, and I don't think anyone else should either. People shouldn't forget that there are people who have the power to hold her accountable for her actions, but they aren't. The mainstream media, her legal team, and her ridiculous supporters are not only enabling  her, but also joining in on her abusive behavior.

116,UgysAWPE4AMpWq_YNR14AaABAg,gaysy1st,"That's what I think. The first thing you would say to the audience is ""I'm so sorry about that interruption"". But she not only laughs, but makes the comment ""I so needed that"", clearly implying that she didn't want to be there. And then carries on joking that her friend did it on purpose. If my friend did that on purpose, she would no longer be my friend.",2020-11-07T18:38:11Z,1

121,UgxIxcTPtoJ5awGAWM14AaABAg,Ariel Cheyenne,"@Tammy Lockley quick question; do you think that saying her behavior is shameful has the same relevance as her wearing a skimpy dress ? I warned  against further using comments that could be called ""slut shaming "" and was told ; 
Behavior and clothing are the same thing

122,UgxIxcTPtoJ5awGAWM14AaABAg,Tammy Lockley,@Ariel Cheyenne that is what I was thinking! She acted like everyone was going to laugh with her.  It just shows how clueless she is to how you should behave in a moment like that.  She didn't care about what/who she was talking about she just wanted to look like she did. She is just trash and doesn't deserve to be applauded for anything unless she is being led in handcuffs for the abuse she has committed,2020-10-14T16:01:01Z,5
