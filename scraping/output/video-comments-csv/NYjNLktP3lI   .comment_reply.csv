This is a totally different situation to the building security video. Depp's lawyers visited the building, looked at video then listed the video they wanted which was saved to USB and the system overwrote the rest as normal process.
I don't believe that the LAPD provided the bodycam to Depp or Heard until it was court ordered. Recall LAPD objected to Heard's first VA subpoena which also wanted personnel records. There are privacy issues and the risk of someone saying they did not follow procedure.",2021-04-18T08:14:00Z,1
