He keeps saying that . She says I only just woke up and u were so sweet. And he says didn't anything happen to U this morning and she says no. Which to me just makes out he woke up sweetly to her and she no doubt beat him or something and ran downstairs to record his reaction. My god I hate her.

It is truly disturbing what this person has done, how mentally ill she is, and how much hurt and disruption she is causing others. Amber Heard is NOT a victim of anyone except herself. She could seek proper treatment and work on becoming a decent person, but instead chooses to abuse others. I hope the laws catch up to her and she is put somewhere she can no longer harm others.

I don‚Äôt want to speak for all woman, but speaking for me and the woman I know personally in my own life, there is no right way to act when you‚Äôre in an abusive relationship by any means. The very trauma itself that is being done to you by the person hurting you can set off an entire new bunch of symptoms in you. Especially when you live through that trauma and when you‚Äôre being called crazy by the man you do laugh when people try and tell you what happened to you when they weren‚Äôt even there and that smile or laughter or ability to go from laughing to crying to laughing in the same day doesn‚Äôt mean you aren‚Äôt enduring abuse, what it means is that you truly give up on trying to convince people, you laugh because now instead of crying when they don‚Äôt believe you, you find it funny that they have everyone fooled and only you can see who they truly are. I‚Äôll say it again to be clear. There is No Correct way to ACT or RESPOND to trauma. People have done and will always do the unthinkable when the mind and body are under that type of stress and laughing or being able to smile doesn‚Äôt take that trauma away from you. Abuse doesn‚Äôt cripple everyone in the same way, that‚Äôs why some people will come out and say their husband hits them and the people closest to them had no idea, it‚Äôs why a loved commits suicide and their best friends didn‚Äôt have a clue they were depressed because they were always the loudest laughing person in every room.

She needs to be held criminally responsible. The fact that Hollywood is turning on this iconic and beloved actor is just disgusting. I wish him all the best and my hope is that Hollywood and the legal system rights their wrongs and that the fact that someone so high profile was getting abused will shed light on that aspect of the domestic violence dynamic.

That's right: the answer is no one. Although Disney is trying to replace Johnny Depp with actress Margot Robbie, she won't be able to match Johnny. And it's not about the actress, but about Depp's talent. It was because of Johnny that most viewers watched the last installments of the franchise.

It is very interesting but a narcissist knows that he does not deserve love, so Johnny very pure soul, more he tries to help her and love her, more hateful and violent she can be.

ME. She who suffered for 20 years because she didn't want to abandon me, called me and asked if it was ok to divorce him. All she cared about by that point was leaving him. We didn't care about money or society, or what others would say. We just wanted out! And my mother who was supporting the whole household (he wasn't working), gave away almost 70% of her income and assets with nothing in return, just to have him get out of our lives.

Once you become isolated, and once your partner has you convinced you are always wrong, and you are stupid, and have no worth, it's just time for the fun to start.  When I left, taking my car and my dogs when I found out he'd been stalking a girl he worked with, and he'd even been put on suspension for sexual harassment-- when I left and wouldn't pick up the phone when he called, he added extra locks to the house, so I couldn't get inside the house while he was at work.  Despite everything that had been going on behind my back (I have severe, chronic illness) I was forced to drive for an hour to his workplace and wait for him to give me the key when he got around to it.  All done with a smirk like he'd played the best joke ever, and this was my punishment for not allowing him to control and manipulate my movements once his secret was out.  Over 300 texts in a matter of 2-3 days was on his cell phone.  He was the girls supervisor.  I don't know how he didn't get fired.

And I didn't see anything that made it seem as if Depp was in her vicinity of bad behavior. ...Now, are they both pretty screwed up: Yes. Her for being a flat out psycho. Him for choosing her and putting up with her. ...But to try to imply that HE ALSO was an abuser of HER: SO WRONG of people to imply this. And it's wrong for all victims of narcissistic abuse, until or unless there is actual evidence that both gave as good as they got. HERE that is not the case. I think some people struggle to grasp the complexity of these situations. And infact, I would go further and state that these same people think like a victim thinks: that Depp both conned himself and unwittingly let himself get conned by Amber into believing that they were somehow ""both to blame"" when SHE hit him. ...You even hear this perspective in the audio recordings of them fighting. It's what abusers want victims to believe:its how they get them to stay, to ""keep working"" for the ""relationship"", nevermind how one sided that ""relationship' is.",Lambchop,0,2021-05-13T10:10:35Z

On the other hand, despite overwhelming evidence against Amber, there's hardly any media coverage on it and the reports of her being fired from Aquaman 2 AREN'T CONFIRMED either. The double standards are disgusting.

But I still can't understand ""why"". Johnny is an extremely handsome, very wealthy and insanely talented actor + an incredibly kind, soft-spoken and caring human (from what I see/read about him).

What motives did Amber have for ruining the life of such a person? I have thought about it over and over but I can't seem to find any logical root cause of her mastermind scheme.

He treated her well, her career was booming because of him, he spent/allowed her to spend a lot of his money on herself, had her friends living in his penthouses... I feel that the list would go on but what else could she possibly need? I don't get it... If it was just money she was after, there are several younger/older rich people (because EARNING it would be downright impossible for Amber). She could've simply divorced Johnny and been with Elon - he's richer. What was the need of all this mess? To crush someone so badly? And with such a POORLY put together story/evidence/""acting""... It just feels so confusing, stupid, childish and unnecessary (not to mention evil, despicable, loathsome, shameless and foul).

Glad that Johnny is finally getting the support he deserves and hope that she gets her due 10x.",Priyanka Haridas,0,2021-04-18T21:42:58Z

That's what drives me crazy about Amber Heard. She was no WHERE NEAR this detailed. She can't be bothered to stage a hallway to look as trashed as she claimed it was, she can't be bothered to actually bruise herself or in the very least keep putting on the make-up that makes her look beaten, there are now tons of documents,  recordings,  articles and videos such as this one pointing out her lies and inconsistencies and yet she STILL seems to get the Amy Dunne ending.",PurpleNiobe,752,2021-04-18T17:51:10Z

For the August 13 2016, she's even dressed similarly to Andie (Nick's mistress) when she admits to having an affair with him during the conference scene and putting on that ""innocent"" persona. Except Amber couldn't help but crack smirk and roll her eyes during the recordings of her admitting to hitting Johnny. Yet there are plenty of those out there still proclaiming that she's the victim. She really went all out on emulating that Amy Dunne life. Although unlike Amy Dunne, Amber Heard isn't gonna get away with it.

Johnny Depp was framed. No question about it. But luckily, he became a legend long before this nonsense went down.  He will NEVER be canceled and he will NEVER truly die. Like James Dean, Marlon Brando, and others who have touched our lives so profoundly with their extraordinary talent, his star will continue to shine long after he departs the material world. The same can not be said about Amber Heard. She will be remembered only as the real-life Gone Girl who tried (and ultimately failed) to ruin JD.  #justiceforjohnnydepp",Monica C,722,2021-04-06T18:31:00Z
