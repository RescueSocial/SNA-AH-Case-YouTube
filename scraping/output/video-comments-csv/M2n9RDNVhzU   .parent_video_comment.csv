1,Ugym-DRlSiNwa0gBMB14AaABAg,"That's absolute bullshit. People get mad, people get aggressive, people lose their temper, people do things they might later regret. Every. Single. Day. Because they're people...Not these perfect little sterile robots modern society wants us all to at least pretend to be. Just as one swallow does not spring make, so doesn't one headbutt turn someone into a ""wife beater"". I mean ffs, do you even know what a wife beater is? Just look at the mere grammar of the phrasing, it might give you a hint.",Ivana Plavsic,0,2021-10-12T18:57:18Z

3,Ugy1ectUHaCeZ79MeYd4AaABAg,"The one thing I disagree on is, it actually does sound to me as if the headbutting was an accident. It's at the very least plausible. Still, for the purposes of the court case, I would've told him not to do it if I knew him. Not one leg to stand on. 

Some people should just never be anywhere near each other and need to figure that out in therapy.",WynneL,1,2021-09-04T00:22:46Z
4,Ugz1VzXKiTimIN_Zr2N4AaABAg,but look they had a fucked up relationship that's the undenieble truth both of them were terrible against each other. But now Amber teaching women how to survive ambusive relationships Johnny got a vacation from acting maybe for life. That's even more fucked up then their relationship.,JasonL,0,2021-06-30T18:20:14Z

6,UgzZZI0JGQVKv5SOX9h4AaABAg,I completely understood what the case was about. I didn't/don't think he is a wife beater and giving his childhood I could understand why it he was so upset about being called one. Totally f-ed up relationship.,Wolf Girl,1,2021-06-08T23:33:03Z

13,UgwCxCpWdJRmVeLhWcR4AaABAg,"It sickens me that she used something as harrowing as domestic violence to gain fame and money, I do like Johnny but he‚Äôs a train wreck, I hate the footage of her in that hearing where she‚Äôs eating pretzels üò° I think they‚Äôre both toxic when they were together",ZaraBee28,0,2021-05-17T00:51:32Z
14,UgxKCaurZCAomrwKGd54AaABAg,"Hahahahahaha..... given the new evidence that has been coming out since that joke of a trial, I totally want to see a second video about this.

You have a calmer demeanor than most people do about this case and while I am 100% on Johnny's side, I think The Sun were idiots and hope they get their arses handed to them.

Johnny Depp, in my opinion, did have every right to bring it to court. He's lost thousands due to AH's insanity, meanwhile she's gained thousands...

Also, it was 7 million, not 5 million, and she didn't donate it to charity. Now the FBI is even getting into things.

IF I may be so bold and insanely controversial..... this is bringing into account how the Me Too movement is corrupt. It also falls into the Counter Cancel Culture category with Gina Carano and others.",Stories by Irish,0,2021-05-12T13:00:52Z
15,Ugxk-osgIYYz_Mko_Fh4AaABAg,"You have a very approachable face and demeanor, with a casual air and camera work. But I also see the efforts toward graphic and post-video editing work. And the topic is discussed well.

I'm on to you, Mister. ü§® You are not my friendly, neighbourhood Youtuber.

17,UgzN6a6DbNUwDPyclSd4AaABAg,"From what you've said they both seem as bad as one another, although who can really know the whole context of their story without intimately knowing them ourselves.

18,UgxxEK5FkIm6iGJIEUp4AaABAg,"How about this;
Hey Amber, don't use the MeToo trend to destroy a mans career and make a name for yourself as some sort of ""survivor"".
Hey Johnny, stop doing coke/drink benders and choose a partner that will help you. You're not a rock star or a pretty boy anymore.

Also, that footage of him that Amber recorded happened the same week his mother died. How would YOU react.",MrHEC381991,15,2021-01-26T06:45:16Z
19,Ugz5xRLn1AEC_8IIyGN4AaABAg,I want to say this ... You made good point on this 9:55 anything is possible but on Johnny depp recent Instagram post there must be more to it as he is not giving up? But let‚Äôs say if he is guilty surely Amber shouldn‚Äôt be on Aquaman 2 as it‚Äôs fair on both sides but if Johnny depp is innocent (which in my opinion I think he is but anything is possible) Disney/Warner bros/ Sun have to do the best and biggest sorry ever!,Marvin's Channel,1,2020-11-29T19:17:44Z
20,UgycUJziVR00ykGRaiR4AaABAg,Johnny was alright till AH came along. You don‚Äôt turn into a wife beater over night especially when you don‚Äôt have a criminal record of it . Check out Amber Heard she has a criminal record beating up her ex partner and being extremely violent to her sister and many others.  HELLO common sense.,Stanley Cooper,1,2020-11-22T00:58:43Z

23,Ugywywk4RWqOG1VhaS94AaABAg,"The actual bitch fight going on they're both as bad as one another trying to one up each other, if I were friends with either one of them I'd tell them to grow the f&^k up and be the bigger person and IGNORE the other no matter what they do or say.

24,Ugx6prbJRZUt8A9CfoR4AaABAg,"Finally a Youtube video that is reasonable about this case. I'm from Ecuador, South America and you would not believe the amount of hate they are spreading towards Amber Heard and how they're victimizing Jhonny Depp for this case. I have always said that was a serious toxic relationship and that this case wasn't about AH. Depp's lawyers could have shown all those evidences against AH but that wasn't the point here. Yes, when people love their celebrities they just don't want to see the facts. Now I think that a new trial is coming in USA and that one is going to be Amber vs Jhonny, right? What do you think could happen there? As I said, I think they had a terrible toxic relationship and now they're taking it to court. I see it as a waste of time for the court because these two spoiled celebrities just couldn't grow up emotionally. What do you think? Thanks for your video. Really good and straight to the point, more people should watch it.",Sof√≠a,3,2020-11-07T14:52:30Z
