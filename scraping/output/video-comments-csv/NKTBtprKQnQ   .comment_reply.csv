You can see there's no maternal instincts in her just by one of her pictures with the way AH is holding baby. Why would a mother have a 12week old sat facing forward on your lap with a counter top right in front. So at any point baby can't hold her own head yet and she could hit her head right on the edge of counter. I know you probably think I'm exaggerating but as a mother you do everything to minimize harm. That was blatantly a pose for a picture. How sad really. I feel so bad for baby.,2021-07-17T03:31:56Z,4

It seems that your on AH side or support her . You act like you know Johnny Depp personally. Yeah he does come out with his political views like he doesn‚Äôt think that trumps a good president that‚Äôs his opinion everybody has their own opinion you have no right to judge him on that OK and he did apologize and I will back him on that everybody has a right. Johnny Depp is winning right now . I would really like to know if your a journalist for some article paper . And be careful when it come to Famous people‚Äôs. BTW Johnny Depp career is coming back nexts year beware what you say . Maybe ü§î JD should speak out on domestic violence form in but that‚Äôs really up to him he just I think he doesn‚Äôt think things out before they fall out of his mouth and he doesn‚Äôt really think and I think that alcohol plays a big part in that but he has the right ?to have a voice on that .  Amber just flapping her gums at anything but somebody‚Äôs writing it for her OK nobody writes for him he just says what‚Äôs he feels inside of him .

Some point , but he did not deserve to be beaten. No Boby Deserves to be abuse man or women  it has been proven she try to kill him she even said that . But he does have Some Karma coming for hurting Vanessa and Kate moss Laura Greg they were hurt very Deeply . Now he know how it feel Wyona hurt Depp when he was young . The cycle gos on and on am sure he‚Äôs learn a hard lesson listen to your true friends . Also but drop his friends after he win this court case or when he‚Äôs start nexts year working on movies . Tim and jd have been long time friends so he will never dump on people where you got that I have no ideal. Alice cooper is a pastor in a church of God and he believes in Johnny Depp so does the whole band everybody say he kind as far as him being a pirate dress up for the sick kiddie I think that explain it . Johnny Depp I have never heard that he cancel out people he knows , and btw he is private what he does in his house or outside his house or on his jet has nothing to do with you or I and yes he is private until you really know him and has met him you need to keep your opinions elsewhere because everybody knows that he‚Äôs a kind person he gives money out and he doesn‚Äôt care . what he does with his money is his thing . some people like his management people ripped him off I don‚Äôt blame him  taking them to court to sued them they definitely deserved it. I am his supporter and I will always be there for him. There are people who work for jd and they are user . Some friend use him but JD deal with him the best way he doesn‚Äôt like to be alone. I don‚Äôt blame him . As far as amber she is a lousy actress user abuser stupid ti boot .

51,Ugxp8sfx-inpHyUSNHN4AaABAg,Carmen Castro,"Hi, I can fully understand your frustration because all our community is concerned about her sick behaviour and how she treats people as tools.
Our duty as humans is to be alert and report any kind of abuse.
I had a neighbour (fifth floor) that was always intimidating his two little sons and I felt afraid for the kids mental state. So I contacted the Social Security Assistence department here in Portugal and was informed that it's almost a crime NOT reporting these situations and that I should call the police the next time. And so I did and never heard this abusive father yelling so loud at that two little boys you could here it even on the street. The father turned his verbal violent behaviour on me, also turning my electricity and water supply counters (outside my apartment) off several times.
I handled his abusive behaviour towards me without probs, because I was relieved he wasn't focusing on his children anymore.
Resuming my long comment, ‚ÄúCPS‚Äù - Childrens' Protective Services essential function is enforcing rules to protect children from neglectful or abusive parents.
It's our duty to watch out fir children and elderly people besides (sometimes also very mistreated üòî).
