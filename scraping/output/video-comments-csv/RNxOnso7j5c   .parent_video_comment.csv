23,UgzxF1aRMTvxQrDuXvd4AaABAg,"1) she beat her sister
2) cut of Jds finger
3) beat her ex
4) when wrapping up the divorce, wasn't happy with what she was getting so sent an extortion letter to JD threatening to run this dv story if he doesn't give her more in the divorce. He said no. 
5) bodycam footage proves no abuse when she claims the biggest incident happened, but her friends can be seen over, colluding
6) passed off her previous self harm scars (pre-jd) as injuries caused by jd, confirmed by photo timelines
7) has a photoshoot where its boasted she is makeup free, and is frolicking on the beach, supposedly immediately after her ribs were broken and her face was supposedly busted up
8) admits on recording to beating him, and to go to the media because no one will believe him
10) seen at the publicised trial (where she's eating) to be smirking and basically rolling her eyes, when she's meant to be retelling the most ""harrowing moments of her life""
11) story keeps changing, can't remember any details
12) concierge at her building confirms no bruises on her while JD was around, especially during allegedly certain dv events took place, with footage to prove it. Bruises only are shown after rocket man has been visiting 
13) had an ongoing affair with rocket man
14) rocket man seen with a black eye after time spent with her
15) friend of the sister revealed the whole story is a hoax, real-time story told to her by ah sister reveals ah to be the Ambuser*
16) friend if the sister reveals battle with rocket man about fertilised embryos in ah's possession which rocket man wants destroyed
17) offered the mechanic sex as payment for her car being fixed, when it was revealed JD is no longer paying on her behalf. He filed a sexual misconduct complaint against her
18) Stole her assistant's S.A. story
19) smuggled dogs illegally into Australia, and perjured herself, and made others perjur themselves who have now come forward
20) is being investigated by the FBI
21) purposefully lied and misled about the $7mil donation that was meant to prove that she's not a vindictive gold digger, this is proven to be factually a huge lie
22) email proof that rocket man visited ACLU in relation to ah, which circumstantial confirms he was the source of the anonymous donation on her behalf.
23) flagrantly refuses to provide evidence to back up her side of the story despite multiple requests
24) has sued the police and tried to undermine the police officers because in their expert opinion the evidence did *NOT corroborate her version of events
25) sued twitter because of all her online hate, insisting it's Russian bots and wanting everyone's personal information to be given to her
26) has been harassing people personally
27) sued Disney because she wanted them to give her more information on jd during POTC
28) her own lawyer at the AGN case called ah abuse ""feisty"", confirming the abuse but also minimising it completely
29) is probably the most hated woman alive right now 

But JD is supposedly the one who did the dv even though he has no history of it previously, is loved by all including his exes and his colleagues, has cooperated fully with all evidence, and has bodycam footage, police testimony, ah friends turning on her and approaching him in the name of truth, concierge statements from the building corroborating his version of events, etc.

Also the ""Crimes Act"" is a fairly wide-ranging, ""catch-all"" piece of legislation and prosecutions under the terms of that Act can be pretty problematic and can have unusual and unexpected pathways; maybe this witness is wanted for at least discussion for something under its terms - but not specifically for this reason; I don't think the witness at the start gave specific reasons for her interest in this matter.

59,UgyFkheXIT0Bh7PigoB4AaABAg,"The thing about the perjury investigation in Australia is that:
(a) She could be denied entry to Australia or could be arrested on arrival to face perjury charges. 
(b) If she is charged and convicted on perjury charges then her visa can be revoked, and she would be deported.
If deported she would then automatically be denied entry to Australia for some years. 

This is a second offence for her. She broke biosecurity border laws by bring her dogs in. They went easy on her due to the claims she made. It turns out those claims were lies. Perjury. She made it even worse by the mocking of these biosecurity laws - which are taking very seriously in Australia. Which demonstrates that she just doesn't get it. Now they do have more important issues and would probably like to quietly forget about it, however;
(a)	her perjury became international news in her case in London
(b)	when it all happened she picked a verbal fight with the Minster. Which was an absolutely brainless thing to do. Plus the clip is of the Senate Committee so Amber has apparently created a lot more scrutiny from than just the Minister. 
It seems her own poor treatment of so many people has blown her chances of having this swept under the rug. What an idiot. 

If the FBI are in Australia it even raises the question if Australia would seek to extradite Amber. I think this is unlikely but now I don’t think it is as unlikely as I did previously. 

Now all this matters because Aquaman was filmed on the Gold Coast, Australia at the Movie World Studios. You would assume that Aquaman 2 would also be filmed at the same place. If Amber can not travel to and work in, Australia then you would think it would be an easy decision for the company to cancel her contract and drop her from Mera completely. 

So this is not just about some justice. It also potentially sinks her main acting contract.",Dave XB,0,2021-05-04T00:34:49Z

183,UgzJmhtpFVG6-hCWszJ4AaABAg,"I suspect that the Australian government takes this a lot more seriously than many imagine. They have a very painful history regarding unwise import of animals, resulting in heightened consciousness about it. They're also free of many animal borne diseases, such as rabies. Getting someone off lightly for smuggling in two dogs isn't easy. Some very powerful people bent over backwards to help Heard out. Now they find out that she lied to them, voters and colleagues think she played them for fools, and she tops it off with publicly mocking them. Worse yet, regular Australians feel like she's not taking them seriously as a country, meaning that there's no downside but considerable upside to going after her.

I am not sure what is so surprising about FBI and AFP sharing intel, I am sure the FBI also shares intel with other nations and certainly ""allied"" nations.  I mean we stand side by side with the USA fighting wars since WWI and our special forces paint targets for US air strikes...  So there is nothing surprising in the coordination.  The problem with evading customs in Australia is that actually our little island we have managed to eradicate the rabies virus entirely and so any animals that can potentially carry the virus being snuck in to Australia is indeed a very serious transgression and I imagine would be even worse had the animals brought that virus in with them, you would expect them to throw the entire book at you if that happened.  We also have very cautious agricultural industry standards to prevent non-native pests from invading and this is why the Australians customs control is one of the most rigorous in the world.  Bringing in any kind of virus by evading and not declaring at customs is considered an act of industrial sabotage against our farming and livestock industries.  But also mocking the government and making posts that show you purgered yourself in court which as mentioned is a criminal act, actually gives them just more reason to come get you.  PS we have extradition treaties with the USA also.",Golden Eagle,0,2021-05-01T17:56:53Z

Which it's really not, it's simply two domesticated K-9s being brought into a nation that already has domesticated animals including K-9s.
But what she is ignorant if is Governments across the entire world are serious about bringing in any animals of any species.  Because in world history new animal have been introduced to foreign nations, and the new animal mess up the eco-system and cause some serious problem.  It has cause imbalance and caused some animals to disappear from existing.
And that Australia has had this issue several times in their short history, and do not play when it comes to allowing foreigners to bring in their pets.
Amber has screwed up big time.
This could cause an international problem if the FBI decide not to extradite her for prosecution.

We Aussies would like to keep animal diseases out.  Diseases such as rabies (which dogs can carry asymptomatically) and literally hundreds of other exotic animal diseases.  Then to lie her ass off to try to avoid the well deserved fine for sneaking her dog into the country, that just confirms her complete lack of respect for anyone but herself.

I realized that when the LE bodycam footage was released. Not only is it damning on the surface but the timing of its release is extremely telling. The fact that it wasn't shown as evidence from the beginning (or shown to the public) tells me that JD's team is laying out a trap - and has been all along. JD and AH have very powerful allies and this case is actually about exposing misdeeds, cover-ups, and lies. I knew there was more going on beneath the surface issues but even that wasn't a big enough lens. We are talking about the Australian FBI, the CEO of Twitter, the Sun newspaper, the UK courts, the most influential attorney in Hollywood, Elon Musk, and who knows who else behind the scenes. Let's not forget that JD only married AH because AH threatened to expose JD's friendship with an undercover FBI agent (love how no one speaks on that anymore).

What insurance company will be willing to cover Amber Heard working on *ANY* film, with the Australian Authorities and the F.B.I. coordinating an investigation?  There are no guarantees that Authorities won't show up and arrest her on the spot.  I don't think ""Aquaman 2"", or any other film for that matter, want the publicity of Ms. Heard's criminal activities having come to light, and I can't see any company taking the risk of insuring that Ms. Heard will be available to finish any film that she starts!
