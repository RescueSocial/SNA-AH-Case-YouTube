16,UgzbcxZiHGrEopKInUx4AaABAg,Jayden Ball,but then she will also get paid. How about cast her as a character who explodes within the first 3 minutes of those films. At least she won't get paid much.,2021-06-15T13:45:20Z,0

23,UgzpK9c34bT-XUDZSD94AaABAg,Jan Price,@Jay A Errington that's what I would like to know. She gets away with more than anyone I've ever seen in my entire life. I think they do it politically. The ones who back her actually probably can't stand her either. Oh I hope Johnny wins!,2021-06-15T18:53:22Z,1
