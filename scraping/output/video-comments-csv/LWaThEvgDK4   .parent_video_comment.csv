3,UgzaaP7mstYIJT7ODep4AaABAg,"The specifics of the allegations, I can‚Äôt comment on, because I honestly haven‚Äôt been paying attention.  I dislike Johny Depp because his work has generally been awful for years, so him being in the Harry Potter films, or not, wasn‚Äôt going to mean much to me.  I wasn‚Äôt watching them anyway. 

I watched JL I watched Aquaman, I thought one was shit, the other was meh, as such whether Depp‚Äôs ex is hired or fired I don‚Äôt really care because I‚Äôm not watching the film at a cinema anyway. 

So to summarise, I don‚Äôt care if she‚Äôs in it or not.  Do I agree it‚Äôs hypocrisy to keep her and fire him, yes I do.  Sorry but both of them have court cases and allegations that affect their reputations and both have issues that make their continued presence in these franchises problematic.  But personally, if You were to ask would either of them appearing in the next HP or JL movie change my mind about watching the films, no it wouldn‚Äôt.

4,UgyilxhVlXvt_OuyIJl4AaABAg,"Just to start of with labels that poorly define: I‚Äôm a woman and a feminist, and I‚Äôm not going to watch any movie starring Amber Heard moving forward. I think it‚Äôs overdue that people dedicated to equality and human rights start making clear and bold stances for men suffering domestic abuse, sexual assault, and other acts of suppression and dehumanization. I always felt that the label of feminism should mean that one is dedicated to equality, and that means defending equally, when one partner is proven to have assaulted her spouse sending him to the ER, causing him to suffer antibiotic-resistant infections over several months, and admitting to throwing heavy projectiles at her spouse.",lunarsolstice83,0,2021-05-10T17:55:36Z

9,UgwLt2IUWOdx0AVPZoV4AaABAg,"You are 99% accurate. You are also missing one major thing which is behavior on set. Depp has a serious addiction that makes him occasionally impossible to work with sometimes. If Amber Heard failed her physical... I don't think it would be a weight problem. It's also addiction and probably a rule she agreed to follow but didn't. It comes down to cost and how much bullshit and money they are willing to put up with for a specific actor. Honestly for both of them at this point? I just want them to get the help they both clearly need. Working with an addict who refuses to get help causes delays in filming among multitudes of bad PR and set drama.  Sometimes the production crew can work around it... and sometimes it adds weeks to the shooting schedule. Honestly, I just want them both to get the help they desperately need and step away from acting for a while. Otherwise... god... its just going to destroy each of them.",Amanda B,0,2021-03-14T00:58:13Z
10,UgzAyNT_fM5IuG9N35N4AaABAg,"To me one of the key differences between Amber Heard and Johnny Depp is Star power, Amber isn‚Äôt really a draw. Even without knowing about what she did I have never once heard anyone say they were going to a movie just to see her, whereas I have heard that with Depp. So having them let go of Depp but drag their feet on Heard seems off. Also when they did finally let her go it was reported as being for an unrelated reason rather than troubling character flaws the way it was for Johnny Depp. 

With Gina there have been rumors circulating that her boss Kathleen Kennedy was looking for an excuse to fire her. In that light her inability to keep her nose clean was not smart. Also it came out that her putting an alternative gender in her bio was a response to months of targeted harassment by members of the trans activist community that included death threats, because she hadn‚Äôt listed her gender in her bio. First of all listing your bio isn‚Äôt required. Second one common thing about women who fall on the tomboy end of the spectrum is that they want you to assume their gender is female by default, doing anything else smells like being told they aren‚Äôt real women which a lot of them got regularly from bullies as kids. So asking such a woman what their gender is is the same as purposefully misgendering a trans person, it‚Äôs rude, you shouldn‚Äôt do it. And frankly between this and the whole JK Rowling thing the trans movement has a misogyny problem. And yes it is in fact misogynistic to go to the lengths the trans movement has gone to to try to ruin the lives of various women (and it always seems to be women) who cross them.",Cathy Grandstaff,1,2021-03-12T11:05:00Z

19,UgyGSsCBW7qVh76PvxB4AaABAg,"The thing I don‚Äôt get is that WB didn‚Äôt get rid of Depp back when the accusations were purely against him. And there was big backlash for that. At that time, he was seen as ‚Äúthe bad guy‚Äù, and she was seen as an innocent victim. 

But that had changed very dramatically by the time that Depp was actually let go.  Even though he lost his court case, a lot of people (myself included) disagreed with the decision, and saw it as rather weaselly. More a protection of conservative press than anything else. And I‚Äôd say that now, at least half of people are on Depp‚Äôs side now, even after his court loss. We‚Äôve heard the tapes. 

So it just doesn‚Äôt make sense to me that WB was happy to go against their ‚Äúliberal women‚Äù base for HP back when it looked like Depp was the only guilty party, but are paying attention to them now that the base is far more divided on the issue. 

I know that there could have been on set reasons for letting him go- he‚Äôs got addiction issues that have played with his ability to remain professional. But- none of this is new, and I know plenty of people are more willing to give him a bit of slack on that. Yes, he has addiction issues, but as a victim of domestic abuse, we are generally more likely to allow him a bit of grace, and time to recover. 

I‚Äôm not as willing to give any grace at all to Amber. And it does indeed look bad that they‚Äôve let Depp go, but not Heard. Like I said- we‚Äôve heard the tapes. It‚Äôs one of the reasons that those who support Depp still support him after that court loss. I don‚Äôt understand how anyone could say that she isn‚Äôt abusive after hearing those tapes. I get people saying that it was a mutually toxic relationship, but not that she was an innocent victim of violence. That‚Äôs just not a reasonable position to take. Which is one of the reasons why it looks so very bad for WB. We KNOW she‚Äôs abusive. We don‚Äôt know that he definitely is or isn‚Äôt. It does look extremely hypocritical and sexist. 

I just don‚Äôt get why they‚Äôd go out on this limb now. Maybe the HP dept thought to play it safe after Jo‚Äôs showing her whole arse, but I think it makes them look worse.",Katherine Morelle,0,2021-03-08T10:30:32Z

26,Ugzfn4cWfAJDrl8FGIx4AaABAg,"I respect that you are attempting to be unbiased to a degree however if you are going to talk about these kinds of things objectively you need to put everything out there which you did not, in fact I interpreted nearly everything you said aside from the stuff about Joss Whedon to be almost subjective considering you left quite a bit out like how you failed to mention that Gina's coworkers who are responsible for similar and actually worse behavior (like straight up directly attacking or mocking customers and fans and calling them phobes and more) got their contracts renewed despite their behavior and not only that but she was technically fired if they had already planned a spin off series specifically for her character, which they did and is now having to be completely reworked. And the bit about it being a money driven decision but in the sense that she was hurting their business isn't really correct either considering that her figures were some of the best selling Star Wars figures in years on top of her character being a significant reason for the resurgence of popularity in Star Wars overall, so no it can't reasonably be said that she was ""hurting"" business somehow, let alone that somehow her behavior warranted her firing because in the end at no point did she ever do or say anything that could've put her job in danger other than stating political opinions online and fighting back against people who attacked her because she exercised her rights and refused to put pronouns in her Twitter bio. At no point did she ever attack anyone back nor did she disrespect anyone or anything like that with her statements and although she used a very extreme comparison to the holocaust, the comparison she made was poignantly true and completely relevant considering she was then fired based off of the point she had made about political views. If you don't think that many of these issues you decided to speak about aren't motivated by politics and such then you probably should look into these issues more thoroughly before you try to talk about them because there is way more to it then you are attempting to say there is. The more that people don't educate themselves on these issues and try to stay neutral the more this kind of thing will happen because its not being stopped or fought against and nobody thinks it could ever happen to them but honestly it could happen to anyone.",TheThemasticator,1,2021-03-06T21:57:00Z

As for the Harry Potter vs DC reasons, the people that would be intolerant toward JD being in the movie are also likely the people that would be hesitant to supporting the franchise because of JK too, so they are likely screwed either way.

44,UgzKYjG6ToWALGT1VM94AaABAg,"So I believe there's another variable if we doing calculus, consider this:
For all well-liked JD was, his latest performances at the time of his firing had not been well received, Jack Sparrow had become quite insufferable, unfunny and since Pirates 4 people were kind sick of him, so imagine bringing him back for the 6th time.
As for Grindelwald, I'm sorry, he was never a good fit for the role. I'm not a super HP fan, yet there were three things I thought I knew about Mr. G, he was Dumbledore's boyfriend, he was evil, and he was Arian blonde. Of course, there's a lot of things that can be said about those points but, about the last one, they go ahead and cast JD, (note that there's nothing wrong about him being race ambiguous, but the man was playing a native American character like it was no big deal, its at least of putting) They give him contact lenses, a blond wig/hair die thing, throw so much pancake at his face that would make Willy-Wonka, Edward-Scissors-Hands and Sweeney all to run in horror. And surprise he can't act well in that Chimera of a movie. 
I'm not saying that those franchises fired Johny, because of his acting shortcomings, and not even saying that said shortcomings were entirely his fault, there's only so much one can stretch a washed-up rock star pirate before it became simply too old. But it appears a fact that a lot of the public just didn't want to see him there anymore, so when the time came that the heads had to make a decision whether to cut JD or not that may have facilitated a little bit. 
To conclude, I recently saw a rumor that Disney had brought JD back to the Pirates franchise, and all could think of was, ""Don't do it, it gonna be bad either way. Just give him another movie"".",Ta√≠s Nardy,1,2021-03-03T16:03:43Z

62,UgxIZ5t9_A7pma033ch4AaABAg,"i agree with most of this (except maybe the ""boycotts don't work"" bit... maybe true for movies/tv, but not for everything), though one thing i would also say re: why depp was fired while heard still has a job, i think it also has a lot to do with the fact that FB2 was widely panned, both by critics and audience-- in large part due to depp's plotline and performance-- and the franchise, even discounting the whole mess with JKR, is widely considered to be in a rut after that movie. so WB might have felt they could earn some goodwill by attempting to make some changes-- the ""we've hit rock bottom and we have nowhere to go but up"" kind of approach to it. whereas aquaman was fairly well received both critically and by the fans, so WB might be reluctant to make any drastic changes to a formula that apparently worked just fine the first time around. don't fix what isn't broken and such. regardless of my own personal feelings about the depp/heard conflict, i can see them taking that into account as another factor in the calculation you explained here.",FreakingNarnia.com,13,2021-03-02T12:02:33Z

64,Ugy_XZbDbWLHBX2HN8l4AaABAg,"@Coucil of Geeks I only got to 1:14 and BRAVO! WELL SAID! That is a whole different situation and one that is messy on its own... I recall asking you previously if you had any thoughts and you said even back then ""PLEASE... DO NOT ASK ME TO GIVE AN OPINION..."" I respected that... 

I have my own opinions, But I am also not judge, Jury and Executioner... YOU ARE SPOT ON! DEPP VS HERD IS NOT A SUBJECT FOR DISCUSSSION! NOT HERE!

*EDIT:* While I have never watched Fantastic Beasts, I think people tend to forget that Johnny Depp was let go by WB AT THE HIGHT of all the controversy of the court case -  The allegations made by Amber Herd to THE SUN (Used to be my favourite Comic... You cannot call it a newspaper!) were very serious allegations and could have seriously affected the brand and therefore the Income, And ANY HOLLYWOOD STUDIO - Warner Brothers, Sony, Universal, Disney... They are always going to be looking hard at the BOTTOM LINE of INCOME!

While there is obviously appeals now ongoing, and several that Depp has already won... There is NOTHING new... Nothing that paints Herd as the ANTAGONIST... To venture my own opinion, I personally feel this was merely a deeply toxic relationship with deep faults on both sides - There are no innocents. The question maybe then is should Herd have gone to the media? Probably not... But She is HUMAN... And we all CRAVE ATTENTION... Deny it all you like folks in teh comments - But we all venture our opinions because we want to be NOTICED!!!

Should Warner Brothers fire Amber Herd from Aquaman 2? Again... To venture a personal opinion... I AM NOT A FAN OF AMBER HERD - Followed her career from when she was young and doing bit parts, and she has had more than a few issues over the years... BUT, As an Actor / Actress (Choose which you prefer!), She does her job well! So I say ... NO! SHE SHOULD NOT BE FIRED UNLESS SHE ACTUALLY DOES SOMETHING DEFINITIVLY WRONG THAT IS NOT LINKED TO THE PAST HISTORY OF HER RELATIONSHIP WITH DEPP!

I do feel that Warner Brothers jumped the gun when they let go of Johnny Depp... However, And Depp fans must accept this a fact as there are NUMEROUS INCIDENTS AND REPORTS THAT CONFIRM IT... Depp can be a very difficult person to work with - He may be a great Character Actor, but he also tends to fall into ""Method Acting"" which studios can and often do express issues with... Not everyone is comfortable with this style of performance ‚Ä¶ Just look at Jared Leto among many others!

Depp is knowing to be a Nice Person in general but a very difficult actor to work with, due to his insistence of ""Method Acting"" - Long and the short, The studio was probably getting uncomfortable for some time anyway... yet kept him on teh books because he is and will remain a Money Magnet! The Liable Trial simply gave them a better excuse to ""Ease him out""

In an ideal world, Depp should never have been let go either... Its not an ideal world and Depp isn't without his own issues... And yes, I am a Depp fan - Which is why I am going to be critical, He has a reputation of being difficult to work with!

As with so much online these days though - A Neutral Perspective is just not acceptable anymore... You MUST PICK A SIDE! You are Either Pro-Depp or Pro-Herd... OTHERWISE YOU ARE THE ENEMY!

Well, NO... I am not going to play that game... As far as I am concerned, I believe Herd should remain in Aquaman 2... Because she is good at her job! THAT SIMPLE! Her personal life may be a damn mess but her acting is good! As long as that remains, and she is not involved in any further controversies - That is how it should be!",Warren Marris,0,2021-03-02T08:40:21Z

73,UgzVGzXIMrpxJTR-dbh4AaABAg,"I realize this was probably not your intention, but your entire video (and the one where you spoke of Depp's firing) felt very much like it was minimizing the issue of domestic violence. Heard and Depp didn't have a ""tumultuous"" or ""messy"" relationship; it was abusive. Abuse is a crime--a horrendously underreported one that destroys and even ends the lives of victims. If Heard IS a survivor of abuse and ends up being fired, her story will play out like that of many other survivors that I've worked with over the years. Please look up the statistics around survivors who lose their jobs, experience homelessness, etc; financial abuse is actually the main reason many survivors can't leave at all. WB is not the one in a tough position here; it's whichever partner is the survivor of abuse, who will suffer economic consequences on top of the trauma they've already been subjected to.

I won't comment directly on Heard's or Depp's guilt here, as we have been asked not to. What I will say, as a trained domestic violence advocate, is that there are clear patterns playing out in their story that I recognize--patterns in the courts, in the arena of public opinion, in the allegations themselves--patterns that tilt the evidence sharply toward one of them being the abuser and the other reacting to trauma in an untenable situation. If WB looked at that evidence and found it likely that Depp is the guilty party, it would be morally abhorrient to fire Heard. Domestic violence will not stop being an issue that plagues 1 in 4 women and 1 in 7 men until employers stop penalizing survivors for the actions of their abusers, which would include bad press in the case of celebrities. Your analysis of this issue, from the perspective of the studio, wasn't exactly wrong, because capitalism, but it felt very callous.",clogger h,0,2021-03-02T02:45:34Z

But to be frank I believe you showed maybe a little too much equivocacy here, at least for a first time approaching the situation. You weren't as shy in your handling of problematic figures in previous videos, the one about Joss Wheedon and the allegations against him for example.
I totally understand that it is never your goal to gossip pointlessly, and this specific topic isn't the easiest to condense in a way that wouldn't have drifted away from your point but I'm so used to see you speak up about things that I guess I was expecting the same attitude here.

Gosling as he tells it wanted to look the part so he gained weight to be the average looking dad and changed his appearance. He presented himself to Jackson excitedly and was met with crickets, according to Gosling, Jackson was upset as he hired Gosling for his good looks and so Gosling was dropped and the part was given to Mark Wahlberg instead. Jackson on the other hand if asked claims Gosling had told him he felt unsure about filling the role.

105,Ugylej5ksupnRpqdP094AaABAg,"From what I've observed, there is a strong political element to the push to remove Heard from , not only Aquaman, but from all future films.  A good deal of the anti-heard are crowd is made up of organized misogynists- MRAs, indeed, etc.  Who have a vested interested in pushing the narrative that Heard was the abuser in her marriage to Depp, and Depp, the victim.

 The reason for this is so they can have a high profile case that demonstrates that women are capable of  domestic abuse; A thing which no one doubts, but they believe the general public is unaware of.

   If they can convince enough of the public that not only was Heard physically and mentally abusive, and deserves punishment for that, then they can push the claim that abused men are ignored and disbelieved (which may or may not be the case) in most instances.

148,Ugz5GRvA-w3hcW7pA2V4AaABAg,"Here's my view on all of this:

There's a big difference between Marvel and DC films for me. Marvel has created a consistency of quality that I don't really process individual projects as isolated pieces from the greater brand. If Marvel Studeos puts out a new project, I'm going to watch because even though it might not be my particular taste, I can expect a baseline level of quality. DC hasn't built up that kind of rapport with me. I love DC comics characters (even more than Marvel characters in some cases), but the quality of their productions has been all over the map, so I process each project as an independant entity; even projects that are supposed to be directly connected. The only thing that connects DC films/TV/whatever in my mind is the people behind them. For example, Man of Steel and BvS are connected in my mind, and those are connected to the Watchmen film and Sucker Punch, but not the theatrical cut of Justice League. Because I don't see MoS and BvS as DC films, I see them as Zach Snyder films. The Dark Knight trilogy aren't DC films in my mind, they're Nolan films. 

What connects this to the issue at hand is this: when I'm deciding whether to see a DC film or not, the presence of the artists and their associated baggage is more front and center in my mind. I'm not blind to those kinds of issues when it comes to Marvel projects; but with DC, I don't have a track record of consistent quality and action to fall back on. With Marvel, these issues are considered after I've already decided to watch a thing, and then I consider whether these issues will change my mind. With DC, these issues come to the forefront before I've decided whether the project is even worth the time. Marvel already has a buffer of good will with me that they've earned by producing consistently decent content *and* by trying to keep their nose clean. They almost screwed it up with James Gunn, but otherwise they've done a good job of working with people who have pretty solid reputations. DC hasn't done any of that. They've had some spectacular successes, but also some dismal failures, and I'm constantly evaluating each individual project on whether WB's hiring practices, executive interferance, or (apparently nonexistant) HR department are going to result in another dismal or problematic film. In my opinion, that's why Marvel can have whatever ""controversy"" existed around Bree Larson and still make over a billion dollars on Captain Marvel, and DC can't seem to get a Snyder film to break a billion, even with all the promotion in the world.",prophetisaiah08,21,2021-03-01T16:03:13Z

The case is that Mera is incredibly favored character in Aquaman lore and she should be there. I wouldn't like to see Mera out of the movie because of a problematic actress.

151,UgzWwBhbf5J4_vowArl4AaABAg,"Warner has a very weird track record when it comes to their talent.

Ezra has still yet to apologize for that, he has yet to come out and talk about it, and Warner themselves seem to be taking the course of ""let's keep quiet and they'll all forget about it."" And for the most part they were right. People did forget and move on. And I would argue losing Depp is more of a loss than losing Ezra Miller. So I'm not surprised Amber Heard is still attached because looking at past situations with problem talent, Warner is not predictable at all. I believe they'll just keep quiet and see how this plays out. Depp has an american court case, if he wins I'm sure he'll be brought back.
