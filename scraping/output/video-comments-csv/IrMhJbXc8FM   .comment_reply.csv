2,Ugw06hu7_gB_GdvntSp4AaABAg,Phoenix Spring Tarot,"Hi  Been There. Thank you for taking the time to view this reading and comment. As I've repeated and iterated many times here, I am reading the cards and channelling the messages. Abuse can take many different forms - verbal, mental, emotional, financial, spiritual and of course physical. Some easier to prove than others. What I've iterated in the comments before and I'll iterate it again is the overall message of this reading which is, when you get caught in the web of a toxic person, in this case Amber and you don't pull yourself out early enough, they can take you down a road and a path that can cause you to act out of your character and in the worse way. Is Johnny's energy an abusive person? NO but every one has a dark side. He got with someone that lowered his energy vibration and pulled out the worse in him. That's why I say this is a very nuanced reading. This is the point of my channel. I want us to go beyond the headlines, to dig beneath the surface to give a spiritual perspective on the energies and intentions of what is taking place. You mentioned Johnny should have left earlier. So let's dig deeper into the consequences of what not leaving looks like?! Not leaving looks like the energy that Johnny is in and that's my point. This is the cautionary tale I want viewers to leave with - recognise toxic tricks and protect your energy or else.... Alot of this reading has been proven fact but the message of this reading is the reason why it's been proven fact. This is where your fantastic points come in. Firstly, on a personal note, from one abuse victim to another, I empathise with you as I myself have been through every form of abuse listed above and more to your point, have not been believed. People don't take the time to dig deeper into another's perspective or below the surface of a narrative as they don't like uncomfortable truths This in turn leads to abusers (as you rightly pointed out) being able to use convincing surface tactics such as reconstructing truths, moving the goal posts and as in the case of Amber, wearing the false cloak of victim. So how do we win?! How does the truth win? How do abusers such as ourselves finally win and get our voice heard? By sharing perspectives as we're doing here, having the courage to create space to heal and part of that healing looks like digging deeper into the spirit energy and psychi of the abuser to understand how they think, to recognise the red flags through the situations they perpetuate and to know what to avoid to protect your energy, spirit and light. I hope this makes sense. üïäÔ∏è",2021-07-03T15:14:46Z,0

4,UgwY-DBMb0v9co6bREp4AaABAg,Phoenix Spring Tarot,"Hi Lila. Thank you for watching my lovely.üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I'm not referring to just physical separation but emotional, mental and spiritual separation. They are investing their identity and validation in punishing the other but ultimately, they are only punishing themselves. What is needed here is the space to reflect and heal. I hope this answers your question üïäÔ∏è",2021-04-04T18:26:31Z,1

6,UgyHjCYo23t3B8Qe1314AaABAg,Phoenix Spring Tarot,"‚Äã @aileen E  Hiya hun how are you my lovely, thank you for taking the time to watch my reading, reply and give the insight to Amber. As stated in my clarifying comment, ""I only read what the cards tell me and I do not insert my personal opinion"". I've revisited this reading again and so far, it's fair, balanced and looks at the perspective of both sides. Everything I've predicted so far has come through. Even today the daily mail just came out about Johnny's paid campaigns and I predicted this would happen in my reading. However, there is a win for Johnny coming up besides the court of public opinion and this is the only other main prediction that has not come through yet. So not to worry, that wheel of fortune is coming round. Everything in the dark would be brought to light üïäÔ∏è",2021-04-18T09:55:54Z,0
7,UgyHjCYo23t3B8Qe1314AaABAg,"Well, well, well, how the turntables","I respect your opinions but with the uk trial the judge was biased. His wife had dinner parties with amber and her lawyer and the lawyer co wrote a book with judge nicol. Johnny sadly never had a chance. He was denied bringing up new evidence because it ""wasnt relevant"". Its sad that the media run stories to fit a narrative. Amber has many people who speak badly of her and her attitude. She is a bully and very rude. There is a clip of her beibg asked to speak on behalf of gay youth who committ suicide and to bring awareness. When she spoke about a families child she was very inappropriate and laughed. She even made the individual who spoke beside her on the topic uncomfortable. I understand not many people truly follow whats happening but i thought you should know just to give perspective.",2021-04-18T05:40:16Z,1

9,UgzqvdodITjy_uTGSk94AaABAg,Been There,"@H Ibrahim I think so too.  I don't think this is an accurate reading.  I think the only way Johnny is at fault is in not leaving her much, much sooner, especially after she cut off the tip of his finger and smashed the bone of his finger.  That should have been the moment he got the h3ll out of there.",2021-07-03T13:23:04Z,0
10,UgzqvdodITjy_uTGSk94AaABAg,H Ibrahim,"This reader is letting her own assumptions affect the reading. I trust Isobel Mitton, she predicted in march 2019 that Amber was the abuser. That was a whole year before the tapes were released.",2021-03-28T18:40:17Z,3
11,UgwyVjYVCHU5T83yQfV4AaABAg,Been There,"She was delusional if she thought he'd want her back after everything she did to him.  She was cheating on him repeatedly, she physically abused him, she blackmailed him to get a settlement in her favor, and she trashed his reputation.  In the audios, she was a nightmare to deal with - gaslighting, lying, blaming, and shaming. Once you get away from that kind of person, you don't want to get sucked in.",2021-07-03T13:31:43Z,0
