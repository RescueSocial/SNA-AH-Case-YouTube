Anyone following this story would empathise with Johnny Depp.

51,UgyCGifbZEW42lkemId4AaABAg,C R,"@FrealFreal it takes a lot for someone to reflect and change themselves. Luckily for me...my narc was able to understand what was going on and he was going to lose me if he didn't change. He still has narc qualities but they are subdued. Sometimes people can change but it takes a lot of work. A lot. and it takes patience on the part of their partner. I don't ever recommend someone stay in a relationship with someone with NPD unless they have  thick skin and a lot of time to kill arguing with a talking wall. I say he doesn't have NPD but does have the narc qualities. He is no longer a narcissist. That is how I know these people can change if they wanted to. 

Amber doesn't want to change.",2021-04-06T18:02:08Z,0
52,UgyCGifbZEW42lkemId4AaABAg,FrealFreal,@C R ohhh makes sense! It might've even been what attracted him in the first place thinking oh she's so feisty and passionate but now realizing not just the fun parts.  She does seem very one sided and can't seem to face up when called out.  Sorry u had to deal with someone like that by the way! Tough part seems to be that this kind of person will never think they're wrong and won't succumb to compromise or seek therapy. We're not docs and I know it's a serious subject but it's interesting to dissect and learn about. Thanks for sharing!,2021-04-02T08:18:38Z,0
53,UgyCGifbZEW42lkemId4AaABAg,C R,"She doesn't sound bipolar. It sounds like she has NPD. I'm not a doctor but I was in a relationship with a narcissist. They argue exactly like this. I even know the real meaning behind some of the things she says. About ""fighting for me"" that means ""if you walk away from a fight you aren't showing respect and love (like I am) so you don't love me.""

Anger level equals love level. Johnny is being a 2. That means to her he only loves at 2. She loves at a 10 so is passionate/angry/violent at  10. She loves him so much it makes her this way. 

Narcissists are awful to argue with. Their logic is their own.",2021-04-01T14:30:43Z,0

He has lost many career opportunities, endured physical and mental abuse for many years because of Amber. Meanwhile Amber probably suffered some stress, but she's still getting job opportunities and is being defended by the industry. Meanwhile Johnny's livelihood and image continues to suffer, still being called ""wife beater"" by mainstream media and losing several roles not limited to his cameos on the next Pirates films, and more recently his role in the Fantastic Beasts. His only, but significant win in all this debacle is that he will be paid a full salary for being involved in Fantastic Beasts.

Amber needs to fall in a ditch and be remembered for the lesson that abuse has more than one face.",2020-11-15T06:26:35Z,1

Hitting someone and pushing them away when they are the one hitting you are two different things.

As for your comment about the NYC incident, I never blamed Kate Moss for it. I just said she was unharmed, and based on her hotel habits, she could've been complicit. Could've been, not definitely.

Kate was uninjured; in fact, she was also known to be a person who loved trashing hotel rooms, like how she did so in Cannes in 1998. So, most likely Kate was complicit in trashing that room with him.

An ""aggressive, raging yeller"" and a ""calm and reasonable"" one. But it's not always the case that the yeller is the abusive one. I sadly grew up in a household of extremely passive aggressive, mental abusers that would go to any lengths to destroy your life, and funnily, I was the yeller. Which gave others the impression that I were the abusive one, when honestly, it was a result of my pent up frustrations of being constantly manipulated and gas lighted, doubting my own actions and sanity. And I was hit with the same responses as Johnny's - ""why are you here then?""Like Amber, I said, ""because I love you and we're a family and I dont quit when things get hard."" My point is, it's not always what it seems like, and not all of us that have different ways of expressing our frustrations are trying to take advantage of someone.",2020-08-02T11:56:58Z,6

It was so sad. He had to leave because he said he'd kill her in self-defense if he stayed given how violent she was. And my great-uncle was such a gentle soul that for him to say that meant he had no options.

And Amber's 'girlfriends'... jeez.. where to begin HAHAHAHAHAHA
Johnny is a fully grown man. Amber shouldn't be hitting him as that is assault, but don't come the 'oh poor baby victim' crap. Johnny isn't a whimpering, simpering 'victim', fearing for his personal safety, he's just a guy whose wife needs to stop lashing-out (and who probably needs to commit to resolving his issues with her instead of running away all of the time).
Victim, victim, victim!!!!!!!' they shout....pffffft.
'Abuse, abuse, abuuuuuuuuuse' they cry.
Fucksakes. They must just get some therapy and if she can't stop hitting him then Johnny has to make his own decision whether to stay or go.
Fucking 'victim'.......FFS
The only problem here is that TV has made women think they can go around fighting men, which simply isn't true. And men know that they could flatten their girlfriend at any time with one strike, but don't because they know they'd get crucified for doing so.

I've met people like this and once they're get angry, theyre completely closed off to reason and being empathetic to their partner. at that point theres no point on arguing or ""fighting for me and the relationship"" because no matter what angle you take to defuse the situation they'll continue to escalate, then blame you after because they got so angry they dont realise what they're doing. it's clear from the video shes doesnt respect him, doesnt trust him and has fallen in love with the idea of him. She obviously very angry and from the voice recording , I couldnt actually pin point what shes angry at, but at no point has Johnny done or said anything to warrant the multitude of mental and emotion abuse just from this voice recording alone. I can understand Johnny's frustrations damned if you do damned if you dont. If she gets this mad when talking about past arguments and previous fights, I would of hate to see how it got behind closed doors.

Even Kate Moss, who we all know had/has severe addiction problems. This isn‚Äôt a one off thing. Johnny Depp isn‚Äôt the first person, and he‚Äôs not the only testifying to her abusive behavior.

We all have different interest levels in different things.  Even so, thanks for your comment.  I also saw an allegation she made against him and a photo of a black eye.  There may be plenty of blame to go around.  I'm not really interested except from a legal standpoint.",2020-02-08T09:04:19Z,0
2045,UgwYO6K-_DPTp9nqSUZ4AaABAg,Godly,"Jane I agree. She actually brings up so many things that narcissistic abuse victims go through. Him leaving every argument is similar to ‚Äúsilent treatments‚Äù. It is denying her any communication of grievances, ever, and putting him in the position of power of controlling whether the communication happens or not. Nothing can ever get resolved if he always leaves. Him immediately bringing up Toronto when clearly that is an old argument, and it seems to be to fire her up and derail the conversation. The lack of trust and stability and commitment she feels, and feeling like there is no effort coming from his side to maintain the relationship. She may very well be driven to the point of crazy at this point out of absolute frustration. No one wants to be treated like their voice is not important, and he sounds like he just walks out every time she tries to communicate with him. Also if they can not reach a compromise in a conversation, of course it will turn into an argument. And as anyone that has been in a relationship with a narcissist knows every communication ends up an argument (because Narcs don‚Äôt compromise ever or see your side ever‚Äî-they lack true empathy completely) if they don‚Äôt run away or give you the silent treatment. Then they use that as the excuse (we always argue; I don‚Äôt want to argue) to ignore anything you may want or need to discuss in the future. The honeymoon discussion where he seemed to be completely ungrateful for the months she spent with him and wrote it off as she was supposed to do that, ‚Äúit was their honeymoon‚Äù...I am sure that makes her feel insignificant to him, and on his part that comes across as entitlement and ungratefulness. Let‚Äôs look at this straight forward, this older man is with this gorgeous 28 year old...she is his trophy wife to feed his ego and validate that he is still relevant and desired when it all comes down to it, based on what I‚Äôm hearing. He wants her there, but only to look pretty and when she doesn‚Äôt want to try to address issues and work through things like a true marriage/relationship. In this recording she sounded authentic and raw he sounded controlled, measured and chillingly calm. I am not condoning the physical violence... that‚Äôs another issue. On a side note I have been a big fan ofJohnny Depp since I was a teenager, but i feel like I can see some red flags here that might indicate he is the problem, the difficult, controlling person, if everything could be truly revealed.",2020-02-06T15:29:24Z,1
2046,UgwYO6K-_DPTp9nqSUZ4AaABAg,ravenzyblack,"Jane Nowak- I suggest you go check out the YouTube channel of Incredibly Average. We are made privy to a lot of things, people just don‚Äôt do the research. They‚Äôd rather bury their head in the sand but it‚Äôs been out there for years. Heard has a history of domestic violence, and people are just ignoring that. She literally assaulted her ex-girlfriend and spent the night in jail. She has a record, this isn‚Äôt just a one off thing. By the way, when she came out with these allegations nobody questioned her they just ‚Äúbelieved her,‚Äù but now that he comes out with evidence everybody‚Äôs all like ‚ÄúOh, wait we don‚Äôt know enough maybe they‚Äôre both at fault.‚Äù Johnny Depp was crucified in the ‚Äúcourt of public opinion.‚Äù His reputation and career was damaged because of her accusations, no evidence just accusations. That‚Äôs just fucked up. She straight up abused him, yet people are still taking her side. Imagine if it were a man who said what she said, on this video, ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt punching you.

That is what he is doing, and I have no issue w/that. I think he should walk away. I'm a woman, and I view Amber as the toxic person in this relationship. He does avoid her when she's freaking out b/c he's not trying to physically fight w/her. He's doing the right thing. Johnny had an abusive mother growing up, so I'm not saying he doesn't have issues, but Amber is clearly toxic and abusive. I'm glad the truth has been revealed, and that he is away from that psychotic woman. I think Amber thinks physically fighting proves your love. Johnny, rationally, doesn't think that's right or true. She needs a lot of anger management and counseling. Johnny could use some counseling too so he can identify why he stayed w/her for as long as he did.",2020-02-06T01:44:36Z,1

And she needs a whole lot of self development with her emotional busts of anger. She is punishing herself for his behavior and she needs to learn to love herself and not go back to such a person until he deals with his avoidance attitude. Both people need lots of help.
