52,UgzxB0KZOqowcKtk4Bh4AaABAg,Ryuk,"@Stephanie Jaboh While your reply is well written and polite it changes nothing in my response. What you are saying actually further supports my initial statements. 

Your reasoning if applied in anything leads to more abuse. If whenever I do not have absolute proof that you did nothting then you are also wrong. 

Using your logic, if someone breaks into your house and assaults you. Then both of you are equally wrong. 

We can always find something you could have done better and that should not be dismissed or put into practice. However the person that initiated the action is logically more wrong than the person who responded. 

Someone breaking into your house because you forgot to look the window once is more wrong. 

In life things are not equal. Equally blaming people for things other people did is wrong and generally just that alone gets abusive really fast. 

Try it out in a small group, the bad people will now have alot of power over the good people because everyone gets punished together equally(bad and good to make this simple). This is wrong and very dangerous when applied to criminal justice system. You can really prove with god level information that x did not do something negative at all to y. 

What we are looking for is did X start the negative or did this sufficiently negative thing to Y. (Did not actually mean to write this long).",2020-12-06T16:46:22Z,0
53,UgzxB0KZOqowcKtk4Bh4AaABAg,Stephanie Jaboh,"@Ryuk I am not saying Johnny was not abused or if Amber is innocent. Based on my research, I find that Johnny is more likely than not, a victim of DV but because I was not there during their entire relationship, I don't want to simply agree to something I didn't witness or to something even I am only 99%sure of. For me, there is a slight chance that he did put a hand on her as well but again, each time I look back at the evidence, it's very unlikely. Do not simply judge my comment because I didn't say what the majority is saying. If I want to believe evidence alone, I might as well believe evidence from both sides, that their evidence may have contradicted each other's story or may have been falsified. The only evidence that I am very sure of is the one where she said on tape that she start physical fights but wether he ever hit her back or not, that I'm not 100% sure.",2020-12-06T10:10:38Z,0

55,UgzxB0KZOqowcKtk4Bh4AaABAg,Ryuk,"This line of reasoning is dangerous and generally abusive. It forces people who are actually abused into corners. Why because if something bad happens to them they were equally at fault. One only needs to apply reason to see who is more at fault for abuse. Johnny was abused and almost lost a finger, his lively hood, etc. Amber does not have any serious injuries, cheated, destroyed his career vindictively and has only profited from being with Johnny Depp. Both are not equal, people doing this PC thing of trying to make both parties equal is actually worse than the act of initial abuser.",2020-12-04T17:36:30Z,2

Someone is trying really hard to make  him look bad, my best guess is that they don't have evidence so they want to tarnish his reputation even more before the trial üò™",2020-12-10T06:57:05Z,1
88,Ugzk5UqBBknLttO5Q7p4AaABAg,liamhain,"@Cathy He is special. ü•∞ And has great patience. What I believe is that if he ever hit her, even once, she would have solid evidence. Hospital records, high-quality photos, multiple witnesses, consistent pap photos. From what I've seen, she went to great lengths to protect herself by building this victim narrative supported by ""evidence"" so she'd have the upper hand. I can't imagine she'd be so careless to not gather real evidence if there was any. ü§î",2020-12-08T22:39:01Z,1
