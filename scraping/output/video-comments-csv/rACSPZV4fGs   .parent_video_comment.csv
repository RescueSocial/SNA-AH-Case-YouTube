75,UgxtQr_ST7muS4r6AUl4AaABAg,"Let's not sugar coat it. They should cast Johnny Depp as Mera in Aquaman, make heads really spin! Jk. 

In all seriousness, they will have no choice but to recast her. If they don't, it will most likely affect box office numbers, it will reflect poorly on them, let's not forget WB still needs Depp for future Fantastic beasts movies. 

Keeping Amber in AM2, would further expose the hypocrisy and huge double standards when it comes to men who are abused.  Believing all women is a bad idea, it's a simple fact that some women or men lie about abuse, sexual harassment, and even rape allegations. Why? To manipulate the system for financial gain, career-prospects, fame, or just plain old vindictive evil reasons. What's that saying? ""Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.""

In those tapes, you hear how Amber twisted her own abusive behavior around onto Johnny to save herself. She proved how her mind works with her lies and lack of care for the repercussions that were caused. Amber's arm is covered in what can only be described as self-harm scars, she hurts herself which many psychopathic abusers do. Psychopathic, adjective:¬†suffering from or constituting a chronic mental disorder with abnormal or violent social behavior.

There are vast quantities of photo/video graphic evidence and witness testimonies that prove she was uninjured during her alleged attacks. Her stories never seem to add up or make sense. Her bruise photos look fake, poorly drawn on,  look inconsistent at times, and they also even disappear in some cases, like the photos of Amber smiling the next day with no bruises after she got the restraining order which she apparently breached herself.

Johnny takes his frustration, pain, and anger he has over Amber onto inanimate objects, he abusive himself with drugs and alcohol to numb the phycological pain she causes him, he sends hypothetical situational fantasy texts to his friends even though he admits he could never bring himself to hitting her, he admits to running away to avoid Ambers confrontations which she admits to starting and she admits to hitting him, throwing things at him. ""The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.""

She's lied under oath, appears to have faked evidence, the legal system should make an example by showing equality through equal punishment regardless of gender, race, or wealth, even if that means jail time.",Rob,0,2020-05-14T04:34:25Z

108,Ugwti59qfAAOnre6dgN4AaABAg,"Johnny Depp has been flying off the rails for years now. For most of his career and adult life, you never saw him in the tabloids and you never heard too many crazy personal stories. Amber Heard and Depp should never have been a thing. If Amber Heard is going to court over the rollercoaster ride that was her relationship with Depp and potentially facing jail time, then I‚Äôm all for it. It sucks that WB/DC may have to recast her for Aquaman 2 but in the end I don‚Äôt feel as though it will make a big difference or impact the movie in anyway. Her performance was nothing memorable really. Whatever the case might be or whatever happens from all this bad press one thing is certain that no studio should be protecting her from her own crazy actions and decisions. Overall I‚Äôm definitely looking forward to hearing more about Aquaman 2 and I hope it‚Äôs just as good as the first film.",Arch Angel,0,2020-05-13T22:34:16Z
