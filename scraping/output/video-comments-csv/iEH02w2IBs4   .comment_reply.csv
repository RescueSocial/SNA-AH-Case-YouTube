There is a trend of younger generations being more concerned with a companies foot print, social policies, engagement with the community, treatment of employees and ethically sourced products. I think there is about to be a big shift in the way companies have to behave to sell. I personally have started to be fewer things at a better quality so they might be more expensive but they last longer and I don't feel the need to constantly replace things, like let's use the example of cheap clothing. I find I'm spending less money buying better quality from companies or locally sourced products because either a little goes a long way or it doesn't fall apart after the first wash.
