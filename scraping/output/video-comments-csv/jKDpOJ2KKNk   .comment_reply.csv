7,UgzTObK-OY4wEoUuPo14AaABAg,Kelly Hayward,"@Aelswith Haugen I agree with everything you said. It's nice to see someone else as well do the same thing. Some people can't read between the lines, use logic, or be critical thinkers. I know everyone has flaws, including Johnny Depp. I'm sure he can act a certain way when he's drunk or possibly say something mean or hurtful when they had arguments. Who hasn't done that before when arguing with another person and they continue to push your buttons? I think it's unfair to demonize him for being human just because he is a celebrity. I don't believe for one second that he physically beat Amber or caused the physical violence as she suggests. I'm sure he got heated but who wouldn't if you are arguing with a crazy narcissist? I'm sure his emotions ran high and she would push him to extreme anger. He probably didn't like who he was around her or how she made him feel. He obviously always tried to get away from her to keep things from escalating to physical violence. He knew she would keep going and arguing with him and knew she could or would get violent. He did try to do the right thing and then she tried to put him down for it. She tried to push him to physical violence and abuse and it didn't work. She had to have made his drinking worse. He was probably depressed a lot too toward the end. He does not deny self medicating. All of this has to be pretty embarrassing for him. But I really hope he gets the justice and the vindication that he deserves and that despite his flaws he has proven he does not beat or abuse women.",2020-07-27T06:49:08Z,1
8,UgzTObK-OY4wEoUuPo14AaABAg,Aelswith Haugen,"@Kelly Hayward there's texts of her making financial demands or it'll all be 'very public', knowing fine well that he likes his privacy.

Don't get me wrong, he's a drunken idiot but unlike amber, he doesn't appear to get kicks over being cruel.

There's too many incidences for it to not have been set up.

I'm sincerely hope she goes to jail to send a message to other people who like to lie just with the sole purpose being to defame them. Mud sticks and he's lost so much already.

Nice to see someone else on the mainstream videos correcting the blatant BS x",2020-07-27T06:12:29Z,1
9,UgzTObK-OY4wEoUuPo14AaABAg,Kelly Hayward,"Yea she was setting him up in that video. She upset him before she started filming to make him look like he was the aggressor. She purposely asked him if he drank that whole bottle to try to trap him with his answer. She knew she would use that video in court. She's a manipulative, scheming, lying, gold digging, crazy, narcissistic sociopath. He fills the glass and even says ""all your crazy."" Why isn't the media listening to him in these videos or recordings? They are totally ignoring the important things he says in recorded videos and audio recordings that justify his claims and give you a clearer more truthful insight into their relationship! He didn't even know he was being recorded at first in this video they show! Of course he's going to be pissed. Why not catch his actual abuse, supposed injuries, or more property damages on video if he is guilty? If you are being abused and want to prove it by video evidence, why not secretly record the actual abuse or injuries or damage he allegedly causes? Why only still photos? Why show so little that leaves it questionable? I think its clear she was always trying to set him up and he wasn't going along with her hoax like she planned. She had to start faking stuff and making up lies. She knew he was getting tired of her crap and was at the end of his rope. She knew he was going to divorce her eventually and she just wanted to cash out big. She did all this to beat him to the punch and because of her narcissism, wanted to destroy him just like he claims.",2020-07-27T06:01:20Z,1
10,Ugzqg9t2SpbvdyptXBh4AaABAg,Kelly Hayward,"Did you notice how they didn't really mention anything in support of Johnny? They were not objective at all whatsoever and said nothing about Johnny's evidence to refute her claims. Johnny is not a perfect person and has emotions like everyone else but he has no history of physical violence against women and he's dated many famous women over the years. His issues with drugs and alcohol have been in the media before many times so that is old news. He has always freely admitted it and everyone knows that drugs and alcohol are rampant in the entertainment industry. It's no secret or surprise. It's part of that scene. That doesn't mean he abuses women and should not be dragged through the mud or be labeled a wife beater because of it. He knew this was gonna look bad for him no matter what but wanted so badly to prove HE was the victim of violence and to clear his name of that false label. It is not easy for a man to say they are being abused by their wife. He tried to give her an out. She forced his hand to go to court. He HAD to defend himself and could not let these allegations stand even though it was still gonna hurt himself. He tried to protect her and himself and tried to tell her it would be bad to go to court. NGN should pay out the nose for running a story that calls him a wife beater without solid evidence. I'm sure he was not perfect in the relationship but I truly do not believe he ever physically abused her. I hope Amber gets blacklisted and does jail time. She was just trying to further her career and/or get at his money and level of fame. She belittled him because she was jealous of his talent, his fame, and because he is well liked. She's got WAY more mental issues and disorders than Johnny. You can hear it all in their recordings. He has done so many nice things for others and seems to truly appreciate his fans. Many people have nothing but nice things to say about him. In his heart I believe he is a truly good person and would never purposely physically hurt someone unless it was defensive. He deserves vindication and justice.",2020-07-27T05:33:48Z,0

13,UgzF30bt_Zn7lROTiGZ4AaABAg,Maaike R,@Pallas. Yeah but in general amber is a narc gaslighting people to abuse her victim some more. The Sun choose to become ambers co-conspirator in that abuse/blackmail. You can say they didn't know....eventhough it was their job to check if her claims were the truth and ask johnny for his side of the story. You can claim unprofessionalism and pure stupidity. But this show knows the truth and purposefully suppressed it to help the narc in her abuse/blackmail.....they know better. Not only is it unprofessional and means they have no credibility...but its unethical nasty behaviour to willingly help a monster gaslight the masses to cover up for the crimes they commited against johnny. If I were Johnny I'd sue them next.,2020-07-26T19:21:46Z,0
14,UgzF30bt_Zn7lROTiGZ4AaABAg,Maaike R,@Pallas.Thank you.  I don't think they are fooled. They choose to try to pass a lie off as reality cause it suits their narrative. Thats also what the sun did in the first place. They purposefully choose to not put the hard evidence discrediting amber in cause they know what it will prove. Johnny is suing the media. Media is on the side of media. Unfortunately for them the rest of us and the law is on the side of an actual abuse victim....not to mention whats the ethical thing to do. This wasn't journalism cause journalism is about reporting unbias facts and letting people get informed...this was about entertainment and propaganda...trying to steer the publics opinion without showing them the facts. They are just helping a narc manipulate and gaslight innocent people...which makes them just as bad as the narsisistic abuser herself. The sun purposefully choose to help an abuser destroy her victim. And these people (after damn well knowing the truth) feel the need to kick the victim some more when he dared to fight back against his abuserS.,2020-07-26T16:59:11Z,0

Narristic pyscho sounds like they will do any lie or abusive tactic to make it sound like they are the victim the whole time meansehile they are whacking people around still claim they are innocent but yet they are normally functional people. Or they did not get enough discipline in the home growing up just allowed to get away with anything there is no conscouis of truth thinking. You catch them in lie they just tell your another lie or mix truth in to throw you off.

Sadly they lack the awareness and emotional intelligence (as most people do in this area) to be able to pickup on as well as feel confident in calling out the bias in stories like these. This in turn allows the hypocritical feminist man haters a space to step in... Which is the reason for these man hating stories. The hypocrites tend to jump in quick and speak loudly and strongly. And others are too oblivious, unaware and otherwise intimidated that this is what happens, and so the hate and bias in stories like this one are left unchecked. And this sort of toxic one sidedness gets reinstated yet again. These sorts of opinions are by women who are as bad as the misogynistic patriarchy they are so avidly against. ...And sadly they speak loudly and are the quickest to express their opinions. ...in turn they do all of us harm.",2020-07-28T06:54:24Z,1

95,UgwgKY-cLsI7VL5pDJx4AaABAg,Baby Doll,Well every woman is a victim. Like Emma Roberts beat her boyfriend Evan and she was the victim. Bow wows ex girlfriend Leslie assaulted him and she was the victim. It doesn’t matter who it is the women are always the victims because they don’t acknowledge that women are violent and can be the abuser and not the man. Sometimes it’s both the men and women beating on each other. When a woman hits a man people will always say “he probably hit her that’s why she hit him”. Then you have women like amber who thinks she’s entitled to hit people (did it to an ex girlfriend too) especially a man and then cry if she gets hit. She’s an absolute disgrace. She ruins its for real victims.,2020-07-26T01:41:12Z,34
96,Ugwe7h9LNJCAjCgjKFh4AaABAg,Cassie Campbell,"I grew up with a narcissistic mother. I am currently still under her roof (I am 17) and unfortunately will never getaway. She says I will forever be in debt to her for her giving me life, not to mention, for ""not abandoning me in a dumpster"" as she said while we watched a horrific tv show where that happened. Every time I stand up to her abuse, she starts crying, locks herself in her room, and doesn't come out until I am on my knees begging for her forgiveness. She made me feel like a terrible person who doesn't deserve the kindness and things she provides for me. The worst part is, no one believed me when I finally reached out for help, cuz my mom puts up a facade (a really good one) to everyone else. Made me even question if I was just being too sensitive and ungrateful (like she has told me many times). Actually, I feel bad now. I portrayed her in such a bad light when she really is such a great loving mother. She deserves all my respect and I am such a bratty child who disrespects my mother, on the internet no less.

119,UgwHnpoS-EjVoGmbX5Z4AaABAg,Josey Strife,@Zulu Zeit ok maybe it's subjective but to me a wife beater is a man who is physically abusive and controlling Johnny has admitted that things did get physical however it's seems to me Amber was the aggressor and was the one who initiated the violence while Johnny seems to be the one who is trying to de escalate the situation which becomes obvious when you listen to the recordings however Court TV is saying none of that matters because the moment Johnny touches her for whatever reason he's a wife beater and it's obvious there bias because they show the TMZ recording which implies he did something to Amber but the full version shows that wasn't the case essentially Johnny is admitting that yes he was in a volatile relationship with Amber but that he isn't the violent abusive and controlling monster that the label wife beater brings to mind that essentially could've ruined his life and career which it nearly did and that is what the case is really about,2020-09-23T20:49:08Z,1

173,UgwXfi75dFdJV4BQR7Z4AaABAg,Kevin Hornbuckle,They manipulate the facts in much the same fashion as Amber Heard manipulates the facts. Amber Heard clearly has a personality disorder. What do you call a media operation that has a personality disorder?,2020-07-25T19:51:24Z,6

177,Ugye3eVe6iIKX337fot4AaABAg,Andrea G.,I hope the judge can see that too considering she 'cried' in court during her testimony. I really hope that Johnny can win this trial.,2020-07-25T19:15:14Z,3

180,Ugyr7KamOOWGxUwKl_94AaABAg,Izabella de la cruz,"@Katelyn L Wynonna made sure to say she's not going to call amber a liar.  If he was clean and sober with them, I don't doubt it. They should have testified so they could have been cross examined.",2020-07-25T20:04:08Z,0
181,Ugyr7KamOOWGxUwKl_94AaABAg,Izabella de la cruz,He was having blackouts and DTs requiring medical staff 24/7 it appears. And no one was getting him help? He had 2 many employees taking advantage of him.  Amber donated any money she got from the divorce. She dated Elon musk so why would she care about this dudes money.,2020-07-25T20:01:13Z,0
182,Ugyr7KamOOWGxUwKl_94AaABAg,Katelyn L,All of his ex wives said he would have never hurt them physically. She is the crazy one. All this proves is that she knows how to do makeup 😂,2020-07-25T19:09:54Z,9
183,UgztVFEupbWVJln_AZR4AaABAg,Jillian Joy,"@lina nicolia just because someone is ""full of booze and drugs"" doesn't mean they are abusive and beat their spouse. This case is not about if you morally agree with their lifestyle.",2020-07-27T17:03:15Z,3
184,UgztVFEupbWVJln_AZR4AaABAg,lina nicolia,"Depp is full of booze and drugs as all you have to do is look at his face. It shows. I think Amber was silly to marry him and it appears they had a complicated relationship. I think they both hit each other. If a man hits you, you leave, right there and then ; you do not hang around for more, so the fact she did is suspicious. They are both disgusting.",2020-07-27T12:37:02Z,0
185,UgztVFEupbWVJln_AZR4AaABAg,Jillian Joy,"When your assulted these physical injuries as well as just body stiffness just don't go away the next day or 3 days later. They stay for weeks. I speak from experience in DV. The emotional damage is lifelong. You don't go out partying and go on talk shows laughing after it the next day after you think your going to die. Your brain chemistry changes when you actually think this is it, I'm going to die. And it takes years to try to recover from that chemical imbalances from just that change in your brain. I speak on this with personal experience. Amber makes me sick nothing she's been saying has any proof  and actual DV is the easiest to show in thousands of pictures of the physical injuries, it's proving how they happened and who did it that's hard. Amber doesn't even have actual proper pictures to prove her body was ever even injured. other then what one or two weird pics that the Jodie hi self was verbally questioning??? Poor men I tell you. How is this happening.",2020-07-25T19:42:41Z,20

188,UgxzdpA8JCr4lOO6rNJ4AaABAg,Merlene Alt,Yeah her face looks bruised but where is the swelling that must accompany it?  Good makeup job is all it is.  Look at pictures of real abused women.  Even a child when it falls and gets hurt has swelling!,2020-07-25T19:51:52Z,20
