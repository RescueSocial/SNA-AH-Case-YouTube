2,UgwQG06PepuorYlC5Pl4AaABAg,‡ºíMysterious Watermelon‡ºí,"Exactly its everyone who knows the truth and sees how wrong this is with mountains of evidence against AH and still they continue to keep her and remove JD how wrong is this 
The victims are never the ones to get justice that's how the system is.
Also yeah I'm not a fan of JD or AH I just want the wrong to be punished and the right to be uphold",2021-08-02T03:35:38Z,0

4,UgwxgYlrDqjRq0czXZF4AaABAg,Jan Price,That sounds great after London! The thing is I saw a show where some analysts that supposedly knows says 97% of the planet is against her. Isn't there 7 billion on the planet or is it 7.5 now? That's a lot of people! And we didn't do it to be wrong to her or to hurt her. We all know that it's wrong to intentionally hurt someone & we're just standing up for justice for someone who's been treated inhumanely. Not to mention all the other male sufferers that have since decided not to get out of situations that could ultimately end their life. Perhaps the majority of people are for all DV victims and justice in general. Yeah we've got carried away here and there but nothing like her side has.,2021-08-01T22:33:12Z,5

14,UgxXWJNSyxWWSTTZ_KR4AaABAg,Kim Orris,"My prediction is they are secretly formatting the film with a way to cut her out at the last minute, depending on how the case develops... then they will cover their asses by saying, ""See? We were with JD all along, we prepared for this, we just had to stay quiet about it.""",2021-08-01T15:47:04Z,4
