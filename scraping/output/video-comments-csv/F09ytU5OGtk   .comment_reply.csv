Their main rule was to not take any pictures with people performing their cleansing ritual before prayer or people in prayer. She had a few images up with people praying in them.

98,UgzYgaB-fiwSAAO3zW54AaABAg,Krystal Rowan,"While there have been men who have deserved to have been brought down, Harvey Weinstein for example, Johnny is definitely not one of them. She has seriously ruined any chance of a career by exploiting MeToo to lie and gaslight others regarding her being a manipulative lowlife abuser.
I honestly hope that despite the disgusting incidents and abuse Johnny has gone through, that his experiences open the door to serious discussions and actions towards men who experience/d partner/spousal abuse. If this can happen to Johnny, it can happen to any man really who is not in the public eye.",2020-08-20T13:10:45Z,3

The best way to get her off Aquaman 2 is for her to serve jail time without bail. WB will have no choice.",2020-08-20T04:23:09Z,3
