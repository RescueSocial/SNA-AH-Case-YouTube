38,UgweJCezr6fal9dn5md4AaABAg,"Disgusting. Most domestic abuse goes unreported when the female is the abuser. Men do not want to be humiliated, and all too often they are shamed relentlessly if they speak out. Amber Heard is not a damsel in distress, she is a calculating, manipulative individual. She speaks to empowering women, but what she is doing isn't empowering, it is criminal. Everyone who prematurely ostracized Johnny Depp should be ashamed. She is guilty by her own admission. ANYONE reporting abuse should be taken seriously, in this time of Me Too etc, I think the emphasis is placed on women and we forget it is ALL of those who suffer. Shame on her, as well as WB and Loreal. It is my opinion that their rush to judgement has put them in a precarious situation.",Belle Acadien,0,2020-05-29T02:26:15Z

Sure she's not a rapist like Weinstein but she is still a terrible person.  You NEVER cry wolf like that, it takes away the legitimacy of anyone actually being abused.¬†
Not to mention severely ruining Depp's life.  I mean, he has kids that probably got some slack about their dad too.  It's just BS

And while she's not directly impacting her role, the movie should stand up against hiring such an unethical person.  I mean, in University we all had a code of contact. If something like that happened we'd get expelled.  Employers are allowed to fire people for unethical behaviour that may tarnish their reputations, it's part of the fine print.  And while it sounds like a complete fantasy that this would ever happen, I think that's why people need to really stop and refuse to work with people like her.  If Mamoa for instance refused to work with her she'd be recast, he's high enough up the chain that he could make an impact.

We all saw what happened to Depp without any audio recordings admitting to things, or photographs of disappearing ""bruises"".  He had his role as Jack Sparrow taken from him, among other things.

I honestly think that even if he is able to present further evidence of her attacking him, lying about him hurting her, etc., it won't matter.

319,UgysCL3sSwkQJIEN4Ox4AaABAg,"Unpopular opinion. I cannot stand her and will not support anything she is behind. However, I don't think an eye for an eye between what is happening to her and what she did to Johnny Depp is the right thing to do. Depp took the higher road, he, as a victim, simply wanted to get out of their toxic situation. He didn't wish ill upon her. I don't think she deserves to lose everything she still holds in her life. She deserves any rights to boast about being a 'survivor of domestic abuse' to be stripped from her and can no longer play pretend and say she is an advocate. Those are what should be taken away from her. As an abuser she does not have the right to say she is an advocate. 
People who know and care will not support what she is a part of if nothing further comes out in the situation, and right now that's a lot of people. If companies don't care about that or the situation she created/played a part in, then let them waste their money. 

That's my unpopular opinion but I have not been a victim of abuse.  I respect that the opinion of survivors who have lived through this kind of horror should be far valued over my own, so please don't misunderstand.",LouellaBelle,0,2020-02-29T02:42:49Z

They are not victims, if they were they had only to not accept the advances by Weinstein and others like him, instead they preferred to make films and earn a lot of money, they should be ashamed.
Johnny certainly has its flaws, drinking a lot and making use of prohibited substances doesn't help, but neither is it the monster they want to believe it is.
