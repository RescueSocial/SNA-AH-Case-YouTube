It was a woman to woman matter, while between her and JD, it's man against woman which is far worse.  
Second, she admitted/confessed nothing and you probably just said that. Okay, where's your proof?!
Third, JD's exes were not there at all personally to witness firsthand what truly happened, so what they say doesn't carry much weight at all!
And last but not least, what's your proof that her photos of her injuries are fake?!
