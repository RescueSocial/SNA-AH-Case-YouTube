26,Ugz8rj-hjaxnUyuRLsV4AaABAg,Disney Lady,"@Shifting Mercury I hope you never have to go through an experience with people spreading lies about you.  It sucks.  One of the reasons I stand behind Johnny is because from first hand experience I recognize when people are making up lies and when it affects things in your life such as your career and reputation the only thing you can do is fight back.  I have many other reasons to stand behind him,  but I really do feel he has been wrongfully accused over this.  Can't say for sure, but even the evidence has proven that she is lying.  He may not be perfect (who is), but I still think overall he is a good guy. Oh, and actuality it was the opposite and the make-up artist could NOT validate the injuries.",2021-05-31T05:47:56Z,1

The judge threw out all of JD's evidence and said all JD's witnesses where lying or irrelevant. (Didn't you just say you can't assume all witnesses are lying?)  AH has been caught in lie after lie and she has presented no credible evidence or proof. The tapes of their conversations proves she was abusive to him. She stated it numerous times, from her own mouth. This trial will be very different and be judge by a jury. Men can be victims of DV. Enough said!",2021-05-30T12:16:00Z,4

55,UgzxAbGqM2k-AL98OaB4AaABAg,Shifting Mercury,"@Louise Tapp You realize it is quite easy for lawyers to twist logic to cast doubt on an accuser and manipulate the narrative? That‚Äôs why the public fell for it but not the judge. The only time I noticed a significant change in her story is when she said she got the dates mixed up. In Australia, she said Johnny was throwing bottles and he cut his hand smashing a phone. When you smash things when you‚Äôre drunk, eventually you get cut. When you throw a bottle, it doesn‚Äôt smash in mid air and slice the tip of your finger off. üòÇ I don‚Äôt recall any witnesses to Amber being violent. Only to them arguing. Johnny only gave two instances himself. Besides the Australia thing which I think he might genuinely not remember anything. I mean he didn‚Äôt remember kicking him on the plane, as we saw in those texts from his assistant. Then he lied to the judge and said nothing happened on the plane but then there were apologetic texts he sent to Amber the following day. There were a few of those. Immediately after they had fought the day before. If Amber is the abuser, he wouldn‚Äôt be apologizing. What cctv footage? As for the body cam footage, it‚Äôs only the second set of cops that arrived after everything was cleaned up. We know they cleaned up because of Johnny‚Äôs friends testimony that there was wine on the walls when he got there and there were people sweeping up broken glass. That‚Äôs why he asked what the hell happened. That just shows how desperate Johnny‚Äôs legal team is. Telling the public one thing and hoping they didn‚Äôt actually read the court documents. She did have a witness to the violence. Her sister. It is very rare to have an actual witness to the abuse as in most cases, no one is around when it happens. As for the witnesses to her injuries being friends, of course they are her friends. She‚Äôs not going to parade her injuries in public. She‚Äôs going to use cover up. I‚Äôve done it before to hide bruises. It works. As for the donation, she should not have implied it was already donated but she is right to have held on to it in case of litigation.",2021-05-30T16:14:47Z,0
56,UgzxAbGqM2k-AL98OaB4AaABAg,Louise Tapp,"The so called evidence she had most of which now has been disproven. She has photos where the injuries don‚Äôt match up to what she claims. She also has many non existent injuries where she claimed she was brutally beaten as can be seen in a number of photos from after the events.She has about 12 different versions of what happened in Australia. She changed her story and broke 1 incident into 2 on the stand  when new evidence came to light just like her sister. Her only so called witnesses were her close friends all who depended on Johnny and his money for their lifestyles. None of them ever witnessed abuse just went off what Amber told them. Johnny has CCTV, body cam footage from LAPD and numerous witnesses who have seen Amber being violent towards him. She even lied in an interview on a national television show that she donated all her divorce settlement between 2 charities. That has since be proved a lie and now she is saying she claimed to pledge it over a certain amount of time. Every time she gets caught out in a lie she lies some more to cover it. She just loves to have adoration which unfortunately now the truth is out she is not. Yes I agree Johnny has had his problems with drugs etc but that by no means makes you an abusive person. At the time he was with Amber he was trying to get clean and had a few detox attempts one which she withheld his medication from him just so she had some control. All his ex partners have come out and submitted declarations stating what a kind, loving man he is. You don‚Äôt suddenly get to 50 and just become abusive! She is the only one out of the 2 of them that has a past of being abusive even getting arrested for it as a cop witnessed it.",2021-05-30T13:34:00Z,4

173,UgyVmGa9AXqGStVngQt4AaABAg,Shifting Mercury,"@Allyana 1971 I‚Äôm staring to think you‚Äôre just rude. She was probably being over dramatic when she said that. Which I think has worked against her obviously by casting doubt. However, even if she was exaggerating her injuries in that instance or being overly dramatic, it doesn‚Äôt change the fact that there was bruising on her face and the makeup artist would definitely have washed her face. It doesn‚Äôt change the fact that she was with Johnny when she got her injuries. It doesn‚Äôt change the fact that Johnny said she wasn‚Äôt a liar, or that she had a bruise on her face after the fight where the cops were called. In this case, there is so much evidence outside of her original testimony to back it up that you aren‚Äôt just going by her testimony alone. Which is often the case in many DV situations.  You also have to remember, Amber didn‚Äôt even make Johnny face criminal charges. She didn‚Äôt even call the cops on him. She made that decision to withdraw the restraining order. She didn‚Äôt go running to the media to trash him. She was reluctant to even go to the police for a very long time. But you guys think it‚Äôs this evil master plan. It‚Äôs a difficult case. I can understand why people are confused but when you strip it down to the most basic elements, reason shows that Johnny did assault Amber. 

I‚Äôm not even sure why you feel like you have to defend him in that way. You can still support him in other ways. Lord knows he needs it. But you don‚Äôt have to deny reality for him. He is afraid people won‚Äôt support him if they know the truth. There is a world of difference between condemning a person entirely and condemning their behavior. Especially when you know that the behavior is a result of his own personal battles. Domestic abuse must not be tolerated. In a situation like this where addiction plays a big role, you can encourage the person to seek help. If Johnny was clean and sober, he would likely say so since it would help his image right now. I really don‚Äôt think he is. He is probably in a really dark place. He‚Äôs probably scared that if he doesn‚Äôt manage to convince everyone of his absolute innocence, he will lose everything and the world will turn against him. If the public could be a little more empathic towards Johnny while not denying or enabling his actions, that would be the best for him. Enabling him will only help lead him on a path to self destruction.",2021-05-31T20:11:02Z,0

 AH is far enough down the scale of Cluster B personality disorders we can safely assume narcissism, Borderline Personality Disorder, Sociopathic with psychopathic tendencies....all of which she was diagnosed with (in Court documents). much love‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏èüåéüåé",2021-05-31T23:46:08Z,0
180,UgxB7_IxYvzbEc16Smx4AaABAg,Julie Lea,"@Artsy Forest She FORMALLY REPRESENTS THE LEFT! Are you kidding? Are you even aware of her  ACLU, L'oreal who supports a known female abuser, & the INTERNATIONAL organizations she represents ""abused women"" ....a insult to ALL DV victims? 
 Are you aware the Justice said "" She GAVE THE MONEY TO CHARITY, NOT THE ACTIONS OF A GOLDDIGGER"" IN THE VERDICT?
 THE VERDICT? That's BLATANTLY playing politics, as is  HER ATTORNEY'S FROM THE ACLU. 
 They are pushing their agenda. 
 Sorry for getting upset...I am APOLITICAL....they do want people arguing & so I'm not arguing...I'm just upset because this case goes to Prime Ministers & powerful corporations....& it's pushing a narrative as well as blacklisting JD. 
 I guarantee it. It will come out through me or someone else, I've been following the case since TMZ,  I've called everything that's happened before anyone. I no longer read documents. 
 This case started in 2007.",2021-05-31T23:35:19Z,0
