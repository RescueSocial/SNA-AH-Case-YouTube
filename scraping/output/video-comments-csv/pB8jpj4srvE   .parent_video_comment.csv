6,UgzpMVyRwZewZe0CS9R4AaABAg,This hurts so much because I thoroughly enjoyed the original Aquaman and mostly because of Jason Momoa. If this upcoming sequel gets favorable reviews I will be so tempted to see it but the thought of giving Amber Heard a cent of my money is far too troubling to ignore. There were numerous actresses who could have easily replaced her who do not have a history of domestic violence.,Ian Hampton,0,2021-08-28T23:15:22Z

10,UgzCY0VZf8J0gsr3dE54AaABAg,"this is just my take on the whole thing. fuck cancel culture in all forms. yes this is a form of  cancel culture. people are people no one is perfect. every one of us has people who love us and people who hate us. if each one of us had our personal lives put under the microscope of the ""press"" do you think everyone would condone each and every actin you do? no they wouldn't every one would be drug through the mud and some might even deserve it. in this case let the court of law sort it out not the court of public opinion. 
i see a lot of comments saying "" i wont watch this because of her"". that's like everybody causing a business to be shut down because of one employee's personal life that has not one thing to do with how they perform at work. so just because that one person you want everyone to suffer and lose money. imagine this, you are going through a divorce or break up and then you get fired because of it. how about this example you work the drive through at big business burgers, you are great at your job. you have made employee of the month 3 times in a row. now you lose your job because some one said blah blah blah. it gets in the local news goes viral every one boycotts the place you worked it goes under thousands of people lose their jobs. to beat it all when the incident happened you weren't even working for that place yet. 
smh. piss on this social credit shit. piss on all this sjw shit. piss on cancel culture. piss on communism and socialism. piss on those reporters who only seek the next big headline regardless of the truth. wait for the whole story to come out. dont let one individual's actions spoil something you might enjoy. for example,  zuckerfuck is a dillweed piece of shit in a lot of peoples eyes. a lot of people dont like him but they still have Facebook accounts. why? because Facebook is a pretty good product. ray kroc was a bit of a shit stain and done the McDonald's brothers kind of dirty but we made that bastard billions. why? because we enjoyed the product. gordon ramsay is an asshole but people still want to eat his food. why? because he is good at his job, even though he is a dick head. 
how many people still have r. kelly on their play list? 
hell i could go on and on but the point i'm trying to make is if the movie is good enjoy it. if not flame the ever loving hell out of it. just dont let one person who is portraying a fictional character ruin something hundreds of other people have put a lot of work into. btw i'm not defending any one in this. i'm defending what i hope will be a entertaining movie. 
peace and love to all.

By all means people have the right to either watch the movie o not watch it. But the actual point is that we send a strong and clear message that this is about having the oportunity in our hands to make justice for ACTUAL violence victims. Many unfair things happen daily. But in this, people do have a voice. People's opinion matter. Peter Safran says they wont react to fan preasure ,  no need to take it as gospel or accede to fam wishes. And this is not about Gospel or fan wishes it about doing whats right.

693,Ugz86vXavSeq5y2wrGB4AaABAg,"I think it was more the hypocrisy than supporting an abuser. I mean WB said they could not support Johnny Depp because he was abusing his innocent wife. Then we find out she cut his finger off and bragged about abusing him and that she thought he was a p**** because he wouldn't hit her.  
When let's be honest most of us would have beat the s*** out of it after she cut our finger off. 
Even some of his supporters most of his supporters said well it always takes two to start a fight. 
And we where like what the f*** happened? 
Then much later after WB finds out that the roles were completely reversed. That she was basically a sadistic bully who likes to lift weights and he was a 90 lb weakling 30 years older than her.. and that she did martial arts every day and went to the gym..
And it was total role reversal and she was the actual bully and a liar. 
WB was like you know her personal life has nothing to do with her job.. and yeah we are not rehiring Johnny! Too late too bad too sad. 

And we basically said f*** off WB.

If they had used that argument on both of them I don't think we would have had a problem. Hell I don't even think they'll be that big a problem if the uncounceled Johnny and apologized and just quietly continue to use the bimbo. But no they doubled down like true leftist woke retards because they believe Twitter. A community where most of the left members have 400 fake sock accounts each. And yeah that's not being hyperbolic that was actually proven. A lot of these little freaks are using multiple accounts. But it got so bad even they were like ""oh my god what the hell did this f****** freak do to that poor man!"" Woke Nazi feminists even they will like ""What the mother f****** hell uncancel him! ""
Because nobody not even woke loonies like being lied to.
I'm waiting for the reaction when they realize Joe Biden isn't a nice guy.
Besides the point but even Twitter hates her. But WB is standing by her.

But I will not spend my money watching a movie that glorifies a domestic abuser such as Amber Heard. They made Johnny Depp leave a franchise based on rumors and lies. But there is actual evidence that Amber Heard is the abuser yet she is still keeping her role and getting more roles from  WB. I didn't watch the first Aquaman because of her, I didn't even know that was her playing Mera. She is creating flops with everything she touches.  Check out the ratings for ""The Stand"" and ""Gully"" it's really hard to watch something and see her being the only one struggling to act. You want to see exactly how horrible her acting is? Watch her video in court giving her deposition. All of her acting is cringe worthy. Aquaman 2 is not going to take in the 1.1 billion like it did in the first one. Majority of the people who went to watch it knows everything Amber Heard has done to Johnny Depp and is boycotting the movie.
