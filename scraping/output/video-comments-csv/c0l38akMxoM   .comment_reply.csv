Because he would sue their asses. He did back in the 90s I can‚Äôt remember what happened but he got away with more than you 20-35 years olds remember.

17,Ugx_dhwZ0w94E6uOtBl4AaABAg,BJETNT,Somebody with a brain that works I completely agree with you. I might have been able to save several lives if I would have been legally married to the girl one time I would have been able to have her committed to get her off drugs and keep her from losing her children which were calling me daddy at the time but because I was not married to her and the legal father there was nothing I could do. She disappeared because I wanted to have her go to rehab and there was nothing I could do it destroyed her and a 7-year-old little boy not to mention what it did to me because I was with her for 4 years. I would have given anything for the laws to be different I might be happy with an 11-year-old boy in school right now and her with me. I loved her enough to rip the beating heart out of my chest for her and there was nothing I could do about it because of the laws. It's nice to see somebody out there actually thinks logically.

People like you are the problem with your ""Let's bury a story like this and ignore it and allow countless men to have their lives destroyed just to assure that all women are blindly believed in life"" way of thinking, what a crock of shit.
My best friend was shot in the back of the head by his trash girlfriend and his 19 year old daughter and myself watched him lay in a hospital bed with half a head for two months and die the most horrible death you could imagine.
And then we had to watch something far more horrible then that, her getting off because of idiots who think like you on the jury who had that ""Well, if she did do it then he MUST have had it coming"".
Well his daughter had a serious change of heart about how she operate's in life, she started coming clean about how her and her little ho-bag girlfriends would sit around and giggle about the kind of crap they pull on guys and get away with in life, now she goes around preaching to men not to trust today's ""modern women"" because they're a bunch of lying and scheming little tramps.",2020-06-30T03:10:22Z,0

When I look back at how the Me Too movement started, I see that it was never about justice for everyone how was victimized by violence in relationships. It was clearly a political weapon aimed by Leftist Extremists at Conservatives.

From the very beginning, they made their message clear: we must believe all ""women"" who accuse ""men"" of any type of assault, sexual, physical, it mental. There was never any question of verifying whether the allegations were true. It was simple: 

If  a woman accuses a man of anything, believe everything that she says. Immediately fire him from his job; arrest him; charge him with whatever fits the accusations; and after a quick kangaroo court; throw him in jail.

That's what ""Me Too"" was always about. Of course, that only applies to accusations against Conservative men, or Leftists for whom the DemoKKKrats can no longer sweep everything under the rug.

The truly sad part is that Leftists hijack every cause they can; and use them as weapons. The end result is the hardening of hearts for causes that were once viewed with high esteem.",2020-05-06T13:11:44Z,0

The non-existent wage gap, huh? Yikes. I'm sorry but.....did you really just take what some random dude said, not know better or even bother to look into it, and then try to use it as ammo? And I'M the sheep? Bro.....come on. At least the first guy who said it is just dumb and arrogant. You're dumb, arrogant, and also a hypocrite...because you called me a sheep, yet you're the one covered in wool. How fucking embarrassing.

Guys. White women are paid 82 cents to a man's dollar. Less if they're black, and even less if they're Latino. I think like, 50 something cents is it? Which, earning less throughout our lives in turn means that we get less social security during retirement. About 30% less, actually. Which...only being able to make 70% of what someone else makes for the same job when you're equally as adept, is quite a huge difference. It's not a myth. You have to be either a conspiracy theorist or just uneducated to deny it's existence. Y'all seem to be both. We didn't even ""earn"" the right to vote until 20 years before I was born, and I'm only in my 20's, so acting as if women are carefree (and evil, to boot) is a super weird hill to die on. It simply isn't true, and I'm not sure why you want it to be so badly. Who hurt you? Lol 

Women didn't abuse Johnny Depp, fellas. A manipulative sociopathic liar abused their significant other, which happens to countless people of both genders every day. People of all genders get away with countless crimes every day due to lack of evidence or faked evidence. Evil women often use emotional manipulation against their target, just like evil men use intimidation against theirs. Women had to develop a way of controlling the opposite sex that ended up having to be strategic, because we are much smarter than men but nowhere near as strong. You guys being fucked over a couple times by women YOU decided to spend all your money on is a small price to pay when you consider that NO woman feels safe doing such a simple thing as WALKING AT NIGHT. Come on dude. Blaming an evil female who abused every power within her reach on the entirety of feminism is super fucking weird, basic bitch behavior. And defending my gender isn't ""creepy"" and ""psychotic"". What in the fuck? LOL

Also; race sure as fuck DOES matter. If you think people believed everything she said just because she is a woman...and not a collective effort of her being a woman, and white, and famous, with money, and straight up falsifying evidence...? Then you're about as intelligent as a wet piece of carboard, and I'm sorry I even bothered opening a dialogue here, because I don't think your brain is capable of taking in new information.

The violence was a prelude to the sex. The second are those women whom you had better not dare come between her and her abuser lest you feel her unbridled wrath. So I'll amend my statement and say that if authorities checked to see if the bruises were real, and you determine if the violence was either mutual or a sex thing, then 90 percent of domestic abuse cases would disappear. True psychopathy is rare, and is nearly equal amongst men and woman. The man who manipulates his way into a relationship and then beats and terrorizes his partner into submission is also rare. That's not what's happening in the majority of the hundreds of thousands or millions of domestic abuse cases in front of the courts.

And yes adoption is another option for a kid that is being brought into a bad situation but look at how fucked foster homes orphanages and shit can be. 

Some people would rather abort a child then put it into the system. Cause some of them come from the system.

Can you honestly tell me that someone like my late grandmother wouldn't have had a right to feel that way? Her parents died when she was very very young. Put into the Quebec Catholic children's aid society. Numerous rapes. Told her just to be grateful she had a roof. 

She still raised her kids. But had she aborted one. Could you really blame her for not wanting to put a kid through a fucked up life like her. 

I know how you feel. But at the same time children aren't even fully emotionally aware till the age of 5 to 8. Child's likely not even conscious till a certain point in the pregnancy. Very few people claim to remember the womb. Not many more claim to remember being born. Only a few more are like me and have memories from a year old and I barely remember shit from that age and it's highly jumbled. 

It's sad but realistically up to a certain point it's not even gonna notice mentally. And likely wouldn't even comprehend it past that. And adoption is just another shitty way of dealing with shit that some women do. Know a bitch that's had 7 kids. Didn't keep one over a year. So where is it better? 

Human life is precious. But we all have to accept that it's also all worthless. Life has no intrinsic value. But at the same time it does. If you're willing to justify killing in any sense other than direct retaliatory self defense you must be able to justify it even if you don't fully agree with it in other objective situations. We must be objective.",2020-08-25T14:46:40Z,0
304,UgwUa6-jfSP_aFMzoKx4AaABAg,bmxriderforlife1234,"@kellogscornflakes24 why do ar15s need to be illegal. And while I agree with abortion and also trying to prevent school shootings. To a certain point some bitches do abuse abortions. And some chicks do use it as a weapon on guys. My friends unborn child was terminated by his ex fiancee after she wanted a new car and he just bought her a brand new Benz 2 years ago. For the purpose of the kid being planned. But she wanted the newest one. Stuck up rich bitch. Killed a child over a car. Tbf I Woulda said strap the bitch to a table make her pop it out with no pain killers strip rights from her completely including child support remove it and dad gets full rights. As punishment for trying to use abortion as a weapon. But nope no system to stop that. Probably not super common but still. 

As for ar 15s it is a civilian version of an assault rifle. An assault rifle has a specific definition. An ar15 is legally not an assault rifle. It is a semi automatic long gun. They can't be converted to full auto for good makes. Don't blame a tool slash a toy. Blame lack of mental health checks and responsible gun owners and everyone being dumb and trying to ban everything. The UK almost banned kitchen knives. Wanna not be able to cook anymore? Bans literally don't work. 

How about we take ex soldiers returning home. Give em training. Use em as security. Metal detectors and body scanners.",2020-08-25T14:28:42Z,0
305,UgwUa6-jfSP_aFMzoKx4AaABAg,bmxriderforlife1234,"@Mr.SteelinKeepit if you mean in America your left party isn't actually left and politically on a global scale still swings right of center but has some left ish ideas and then some shit taken from the right originally and turned into stupidity. 

Both sides have valid points. Both sides are also hilariously wrong. Centrism is the only way to make shit work plus a bit of economics thrown in. 

Capitalism can become corrupted and monopolized. Socialism can become a slow bleed on a country. Using a mix of both is always best. 

Also not sure how but right to own arms is actually a left idea. Now it's become a right idea. Gun control was originally right but is now left. 

So you gotta know the history and the current state. Politics is easily corruoted and shit gets twisted fast. Health care in Canada isn't actually a left wing idea came from a right minded individual. A compassionate one though. During a certain period of the early 20th century during the latter half of industrialization and modernization. Dude saw it as a basic need developed countries should have. A living standard. 

Social programs can help better a country as a whole. But can also be bad and bleed a country or make it easy for people to abuse shit. However there are ways to use capitalism to fix some flaws. Private prison industry generates alot or money. No reason governments can't run prisons similarly while also keeping standards up and using profits directly from prisons to fund programs to prevent some from ending up back in jail and providing them education and a chance. 

Let people own whatever guns they want. But prove you are responsible enough for certain types. Require specific safes like in Europe that reduce number of stolen guns but without going gung ho with bans. Require proper background checks and link them nation wide. This has two effects. You can now own guns anywhere once you clear. Meaning no hassle of trying to get multiple licenses if you have multiple properties. Actually jail people for not reporting stolen guns. Create gun safety culture like some European cultures while also creating an understanding outside the gun community to help let people know it's just a friggen hobby. And a useful tool in many situations. Self defense hunting deterant.
