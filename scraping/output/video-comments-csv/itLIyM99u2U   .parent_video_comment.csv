19,UgyXWt3leJn052l0FcN4AaABAg,"I am not an abusive person but I married one. Know that if you are in this kind of relationship, YOU will eventually match what you are given (as Sharon Osborn mentioned). It doesn‚Äôt matter what you do to try and avoid the wrath received by an abusive partner, it comes regardless. Amber may think she‚Äôs smart but I see right through her.

20,UgylkUIK8em6bgNPfj94AaABAg,"It never made sense to me and I Never believed it. My teenage  kids told me about it, what they heard üòÄ on the news, they were upset and conflicted because they loved Johnny so much. I asked them if it made any sense that the gentle soul we had seen in interviews etc, could be violent behind closed doors? I said, I see the entitlement in Ambers eyes, and it shows in the few interviews I had seen with her, she is definitely used to getting her way. My daughter, 18 at the time, was not happy with me and she asked loudly üòÄ why would she lie? I just said to her, don't turn your back on Johnny just yet, the truth has a funny way of coming out, and there is no way I can see him being the aggressor... But Amber? I can definitely see her throwing the first thing she can reach at someone's head if she doesn't get her own way üòÄüòÇ
I obviously don't remember my exact words, and there's a chance new facts influenced the words I chose this time in my retelling of what ended up in a fairly heated debate. She understood what I was saying about Johnny and agreed it was unlikely, but it turned out that she had loved the work she had seen from Amber, as had I, and she actually had a massive crush on her, as did I üòÇ I think I said something like, nah ahh I'll fight you for her, which lightened the mood ü§£ She was actually most upset that what looked like the Perfect couple, were now split and in this nasty public fight.
But it didn't take long, and it was an important lesson for her to realise that things aren't always as they are reported, that sometimes we need to Wait before we Crucify someone until we have more facts. I Never claimed that what I believed to be true was Fact, it was just my opinion, and I had told her, if I was wrong, I would step aside, so she could marry Amber üòÇ
Come to think of it, she never did apologise for yelling at me ü§îüòß oh well, at least I am now free to date Amber because my daughter is angry at her. Amber is just my kind of crazy...  so crazy beautiful it doesn't even make sense, crazy talented but probably unemployable, and also crazy spoiled brat. I'll do Whatever she tells me and she can beat me all she likes, I can take it.
I think I might actually be in with a chance here üòÄü§£üëçüëä and this is the perfect time for some long distance dating, I wonder what she is doing next week.....",bigdaddy741098,0,2021-03-02T12:25:02Z

Granted, women shall most likely always be the most commonly abused victims, however their potential for malevolence and powerful psychological abuse abilities fly way too far under the radar in all societies to be fully realized. I always feel the need to speak up in these venues, as I myself have been a victim of said exposure, because most of us males are too ashamed or too proud to admit such things publicly. But little ole me isn‚Äôt enough to spread that word. It would take someone of Depp‚Äôs popularity to make a difference.
