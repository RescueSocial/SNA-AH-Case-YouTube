22,UgxF6SwQWelSf7305Fx4AaABAg,THE FRUG,@Jay Vee no it’s great and honestly that’s why I love Angelina and Brad for being open with their children and allowing them to express themselves but I’m just pointing out that trans or not it shouldn’t matter and it’s honestly none of our business and videos like this shouldn’t even be made for children no matter their status in this world and also if she was transgender nothing is bizarre about it scientifically has already been proven that most transgender people know who they are from a very young age literally it has been proven that children can know their sexuality and gender identity typically around the age of 3 and this also comes from person experience I knew I was gay the second I looked at a boy the way I’m “suppose” to look at a girl when I was 6,2021-10-26T03:48:50Z,0
23,UgxF6SwQWelSf7305Fx4AaABAg,Jay Vee,"I think ppl just find the whole transgender thing bizarre in terms of intervening with a child’s gender at a young age. So many of us were non confirming in how we expressed ourselves with clothing, hair, etc growing up, but did that mean we didn’t want to be our gender? I think everyone’s sort of applauding the jolie-pitts for allowing their daughter to express herself in a fluid way and not putting a label on her from a young age. Also the entire video literally focuses on Shiloh so why wouldn’t the comments?",2021-10-26T03:15:53Z,0

28,UgwlBoFokEed1ovlk8x4AaABAg,Christy Shultz,Okay it's not transphobic or anything like that to let your child experiment with things. If the child believes for a while that they wanted to be a boy not that they were a boy and I would agree with you that that child is not transgender. Had a child always believe that they were a boy or meant to be boy then that would be different. It seems like she allowed her kids to express in any way that they saw fit and the media is making a big deal out of a small kid and their tomboyish ways because all little girls and little boys go through strange phases. I know I went through tomboy phase but I never wanted to be a boy.,2021-10-23T22:36:28Z,0

97,UgzatSMGMld-QJlLfb94AaABAg,Cryptic Cyclone,Children don't have as much control over their clothing. The parents choose to buy it. Most of the time it's an illusion of choice. For example a parent might show a child something and say 'do you like this?' It's unintentionally and some time intentionally biased by presenting certain things to a child.

It's also horrendous that it became normal for tabloids to gossip and photograph children of celebrities. It wasn't done before the 2000's. It should be illegal to publish because they're minors and their parents are famous, not them. People are vultures and this channel is pure trash.",2021-06-02T00:29:34Z,1
301,Ugz5Zhho0oupC7KPYY14AaABAg,Jack The Demiboy,"Exactly, that random and nosey lady (who is barely famous), is running around trying to label kids as trans.  It's not only none of her business, but she has no right to even post about somebody else's kid.

The kid's parents were just trying to let the kid wear and do what they want.  This company and many other tabloid papers should have never called this kid trans in the first place.  The parents obviously didn't think the kid was a boy cause they kept saying ""she"" and ""her,"" but these kinds of news companies like to jump to conclusions of views and reactions.  This video made a big deal out of a problem entirely made-up. 

People don't want to even think that breaking gender norms is just because each person is different.",2021-06-01T20:58:24Z,1
302,UgzTwblM1GTJ2LbM8Jl4AaABAg,Jack The Demiboy,"Because she wanted to??????? 

It's not like they forced her to wear jeans and a t-shirt.  The kid wanted to wear something and do something.  If later the child does want or think the same way, so-f*cking-what.  

Self-actualization is a part of growing up.  Also,  it's not like the kid is an older teen, they were an actual child.  By the time kids are in their mid to late teens, they have already developed a strong sense of self.  Children start trying to develop their sense of self between the ages of 3-5.  The kid is probably just figuring out the difference between gender identity and gender expression, nothing big.  

Clearly, the mom wasn't ""turning her kid into a boy"" or some crazy sh*t.  The mom continues to call the kid her ""daughter"" and refers to her as ""she"" and ""her.""  All the parents are guilty of is letting their kid figure themself out.  

The only person who tried to force a transgender label on the kid was some random lady that's only kinda famous. 

In the end, people are making a big deal out of nothing.  This video is just clickbait.  I thought it was something interesting like their kid grew up and is revealing some actually interesting stuff.  This is the whole video tho: a kid is still figuring themself out and their parent is letting them.  So what.",2021-06-01T20:36:03Z,0

Telling your parents they're hurting you is considered really INSOLENT. I mean the child dared tell papa "" it hurts"" "" It's wrong"" "" Dad/ Mom that's racist"" . Beating your children because they said something that slightly diverge from what their vision of religion is.
 When the kid who became a teen start cutting those tiny legs and arms it's either a dumb edgy teenager thing or ""why are you doing that to me"" reply. You can't tell them anything because you fear them. The first thing you did as a child after breaking something is shiver and cower up because you don't want to get hit.
When you just tell your dad to stop being toxic and he says he's sad while you're literally had panic attacks in your early childhood and still have them.
And when the child grow up to ressent them and confront them for the abuse suddenly they say it doesn't exist or you're making a fuss out of nothing.
Op and the kind people who agreed with them here will be better parents than you are. They're giving their children a choice, you aren't.

417,UgzeyvNhVK3rLpkp23t4AaABAg,Monah Zaini,"@Angelicwings1 No, children are not more capable of knowing who they are than adults. They're like sponges, they soak up what is in their environment and it shapes who they become. Who they are is not set in stone, but no one is forcing children into being a boy or girl, they are literally born as a boy or girl. That's not a choice. If I give birth to a child with female genitalia, that's a girl. Being a child is already confusing and difficult enough. When you teach them that they have the option to change genders, that complicates things further for a young mind. If my daughter wants to wear boys clothes, I'll allow it, but I'm not going to introduce the idea of transitioning to her because that is planting an idea in a child's mind that they wouldn't have had otherwise. Evidenced by the number of people who want to identify under the trans umbrella suddenly exploding in the past 5 years, just as this became more mainstream. As I'm typing this, my boyfriend just scrolled through facebook and saw a FTM transgender from his high school who was obviously a girl in high school. If you don't think there's a correlation between exposure to trans ideology and the increase in transgender-identifying people, you're insane. 

You were miserable in as a girl because most children are miserable in their bodies, and it's not because they want to be the other gender. I was miserable in my body because I wanted to be prettier. I wanted straight hair, I wanted a smaller nose. I wanted to look more white. I hated that I was half ethnic. I didn't iDeNtIfY with other people of my ethnicity. Yet now I'm comfortable with who I am, it's almost like it's normal for children to be unhappy with themselves. You genuinely sound mentally ill. Wanting to change genders is just a symptom of your mental illness. 

Also, if you really and truly hated these things about yourself, you wouldn't be so complacent. Boo hoo you live in a rural area, that sounds like an excuse. If you were genuinely experiencing true gender dysphoria, you'd feel compelled to go as far as necessary to validate your identity. ""Even if I transitioned now it still wouldn't work?"" well yeah, you'd never be a boy, but you could take steps towards looking more like one. There are buses and trains. In today's political climate, it shouldn't be hard to find one in your closest big city. Why wouldn't it work? It literally works for the tons of other FTM people. If it were truly distressing to you, you would find a way. But I guess just complain on the internet instead, that works too right?",2021-10-23T16:20:44Z,0

441,UgyPgM4v1rz4yiTSltd4AaABAg,Story Cloud,"Exactly. And when a 2 year old says I want to be a boy, I can promise you, after raising several children, they don't know what they're really saying. They are too young to make statements like that and grasp the meaning behind it. It is completely absurd that Angelina let her two-year-old dress like a boy just bc she said she wanted to be a boy at the age of 2. This is all driven by the mother, not by Shiloh. Once she started dressing her daughter like a boy, the little girl just went along with it because that's what small children do until they can connect the dots and make up their own mind, but when your lead in one direction or the other, it prolongs that timeline exponentially because after a while, the child is confused, so it's no wonder it lasted as long as it did. She had the approval and acceptance of her entire family and it's what gave her an identity and helped her feel accepted by others. My 2-year-old son wore pink tutus because his older sister wore them and he wanted to be a princess, but he didn't know what that really meant. If I had dressed him like a princess and let his hair grow long like a girl, he would have thought his he was supposed to look like a girl and it would have gone on and on for years. He would have wound up confused. Any child growing up in an abusive home will tell you they thought it was normal and all families were abusive until they got older and started noticing the difference between their family and others. And if you notice, Angelina was just fine dressing her daughter like a boy but then got upset when the grandmother bought girly clothes for her and dress up costumes. So why would she get upset if Shiloh really had a choice to wear whatever she wanted- boys and girls clothes? It shouldn't be a problem if Shiloh was REALLY in control over her own clothes, should it. I have no doubt Shiloh secretly questioned all along who she really was.",2021-05-25T16:31:42Z,1

482,UgzgGAuTayMV1U6qmi54AaABAg,iB cHEEL,"@ValeskaTwins I understand and I'm going to explain myself. However I definitely disagree with you. Every trans person I know, knew who they were when they were a child. Having to go through a horrible puberty made their life a living hell. I also lost some really good friends because ""children don't know who they are"".
 I recommend actually speaking with a real trans person and expressing opinions is fine but please do some research. Maybe watch Samantha Lux that's the name of her channel on YouTube as well. There's others as well, but she was the first one to come to mind. You may understand more of what I'm saying. 
 I don't think you're trying to be hurtful, but it was a little hurtful, especially when you say a child can't make a choice in who they are, when it's not a choice, it's identity.
I also understand that some people feel like Angi is pushing this on Shiloh. I don't see that, and those recent pictures she still looks very non-gender  conforming to me.
 Either way to each their own. If you don't like the way I feel, because this is my life, you don't have to like me. I have nothing against you, or anyone here, I do feel like you should educate yourself and like I said talk with a trans person, or watch one on YouTube, not Blair whatever her name is she's honestly not the nicest person, watch Samantha Lux, please.",2021-03-12T21:13:44Z,0
483,UgzgGAuTayMV1U6qmi54AaABAg,ValeskaTwins,"I may be misunderstanding the meaning of this comment but I think people are so mad because during Shiloh’s entire life she has been  basically the center of paparazzi, and they were calling her a ‘transgender male’ for a extremely long time just because she wears boyish clothes and has her hair cut short. (In my opinion kids can’t even be transgender since they are kids- ) but she was more than likely looking up to her brothers and wanted to be like them because that’s who she grew up with. I hope this isn’t insulting 😅😅 (I’ve recently gotten into 2 pretty pointless arguments- ) but I’m kinda tomboyish in some things, and then girly girl things- o.o most girls have gone through that stage and a lot of them don’t want to be a boy, but yes Shiloh does have a choice- but kids can’t be transgender (in my opinion, due to them still being young, and not necessarily knowing what they want I guess, like careers, most of the time it changes a lot of at least once or twice- just like the urge to become trans when they are older- so they can’t really identify themselves when they are still young because they may end up regretting it @-@) but I do just wanna day they aren’t transphobic, hope this doesn’t make you mad 😅😅 (and I don’t want to start an argument QwQ) anyway hope you have a good day ^-^",2021-03-11T14:35:25Z,0

539,UgwWKSj0iU3fxWsmZbJ4AaABAg,Carl Marks,"Definitely. We should apply this to everyone, because apparently trans people can't step outside of the expectations of their gender. For example, you see people supporting tomboy girls and pushing to start accepting girly guys who like dresses and skirts, but most times when a trans woman is tomboy-ish she's ""not a real trans girl because she's masculine and not trying hard enough"" and same goes for trans men but the other way around. It's sad, really, but I've seen trans folks be really pressured to fit inside a tiny box to be validated by society 😔

Your sexuality means nothing to me and I would never comment on some random lesbian I saw on the street.  But if you're going to dress like one then don't act surprised if people think you are. It's not rocket science.",2021-02-28T23:18:59Z,0

And excuse me, what do you mean by 'dress like one'? I go to the store a lot and I have never seen a clothing section tagged 'GARMENTS FOR LESBIANS' or a fashion book which states 'HOW LESBIANS SHOULD DRESS'. Your ignorant (yes hunny... Ignorant) comment exposes the judginess and outright finger pointing that the world needs to extract itself from.
My dressing does not define me... Just like my skin color does not define me. 
Get that dear. My dressing is my choice, not who I am.

I like to wear boys looking clothes and even got my hair so short, literally looks like a boy and even my aunt didn't recognize me and called me ""another boy"".
Look at me now, with longer hair and like wearing my skirts and heels!
Instead of labeling and specualating stuff, why don't they just leave Shiloh alone. She just being kid for now. At least let her talk into the media first.

Brad, in 2008, when she was 2, just told a funny story about shiloh asking to be called John because at the time she was obsessed with Peter pan and John was her favourite character, but it was just a childish thing and she grew out of that very quickly, yet many years later tabloids brought up that story as if it was a recent one, making people believe Shiloh changed her name, but it's a lie! Her family always referred and keep referring to her as shiloh, daughter, sister, little girl and use female pronouns..Angelina in recent interviews explicitly referred to shiloh as shiloh and as a girl, the most recent was published on British vogue, on February 5th 2021 and again, refers to shiloh as Shi, that is how family and friends call her, and as a girl!!!
