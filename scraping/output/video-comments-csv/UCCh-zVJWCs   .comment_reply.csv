In one moment says no one could possibly be planning a takedown like this throughout years, and in the same conversation, accuses Johnny of just that. She even admitted to Jerry that she hit him first. She needs to go to intensive therapy and she needs to not be in any more relationships. She is a danger to people around her. She also beat her sister, and there's video proof of her friends asking what happened with Amber ""Amber really beat your ass, didn't she?"".
