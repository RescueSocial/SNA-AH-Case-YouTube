2,Ugy-zfZq-BdEQb1NkEZ4AaABAg,NatalieJune,"I agree. When Johnny says, ""You never existed,"" he's absolutely right. The person he fell in love with doesn't exist and never will. It's heartbreaking and life altering to realize that the person you married and love so much doesn't exist and no matter what you do they never will. It was all an act. I actually said the same thing to my future ex-husband. Some parts of their audio tapes were hard to hear because it was like listening to my ex and I. It made me realize that I haven't recovered as much as I thought.  My ex used not just the same manipulative tactics as Amber, but literally some of the same verbiage. We had not only had similar arguments/discussions/battles, some parts were the exact same. In my opinion, Amber is a textbook Covert Narcissist and the Queen of Projection.  Suddenly a few years ago Johnny was barely recognizable. He was extremely thin, frail and looked like he was on his death bed. I think this was because she had drained the life out of him. He literally was a shell of the person he once was. I lost 40 pounds, without wanting to, in 3 months. I looked like I was dying and some days thought I was and my body was going to just shut down.

Like me for example I believed Johnny when he first denied the allegations and have never believed Amber herself since she made it obvious she was lying.  It just depends on who‚Äôs still believing her&protecting her to stop and take Johnny‚Äôs side and to see Amber‚Äôs lies as lies.

One day she was normal the next day she was out of control. She would make things up that didn‚Äôt happen and try to make me believe like their did. I then end no matter how much I did for her and try to make her happy it was never good enough like a bottomless pit.

16,UgzemghSNzClaufGfOZ4AaABAg,Korkun√ß TheTerrible,"@NatalieJune It's heartbreaking, yes.  But considerably older men should understand that a considerably younger woman will be with them only for the following reasons:

1. They have daddy issues. (And the only man that they think could love them permanently besides their father is the one that gets to fck them) 

2. They are after either the money, the success or the safety that comes with it. 

And older men look funny when they get to be the ones that are screwed by the very hierarchy and system that men have built fot 12k years. 

Amber should go to jail for perjury and slander.

I mean I am not saying she was right in any way. However, I also know that, if I am a woman who cannot walk the streets alone late at night because whatever justice I can get at best will only be after the fact if something bad happens,  then old guys like Johnny should realize that the disappointment in the discovery of not having been ever loved is also always going to be after the fact. 

We have ideas of what should be, and then we have reality. 

Many men have been feasting on Depp's ordeal just because they think it gave them the chance to discredit women's rights movements. 


Statistics say that 1% of accusations are false, 

Statistics also say that there's also a percentage of incidents that don't get reported at all, 

And from crime channel documentaries to hospital and police department staffs 
it is repeatedly being said that most rape kits that are used don't get processed at all and are just thrown away because there are so many. 

There's also that long part of history that until about a century ago kept selling women and children as slaves or property, let alone giving them the right to vote, 
Or denying access to education. And after the suffrage, this continued into the 70's as denying access to higher education except few fields where women were forced to reinforce and perpetuate their ""roles"" in society. (sociology, home ec etc) 

And when I see a redpiller cry incel tears while feeling a schadenfreude filled sympathy for Johnny, basically rejoicing in sweeping generalizations that women are opportunistic lowlives, hoes, etc who lie, cheat, stab in the back at every opportunity, I get impatient. 

Please beware those ""manly"" tears coming from a culture of abusers. It's not like women have designed this world. Oligarchs aren't women.",2021-06-10T13:45:01Z,0
