11,UgwWr8i4dk5D_ZZlBE54AaABAg,Ya Higher paid as in she ta** off her clothes and open her le* and let all those men do her😂and she get the higher paid for the movie role she want. She get the movie role and start to become famous not because of her hard work. Don't know how to act then don't become actress. So many rich sugar daddy out there  she can marry or join adu** flim company. One day she gonna mess and seduce the wrong woman men and get punch on the face or threatening the wrong rich men. Aquarman 2 movie better lose a lot of money. She and Jason in the first movie more look like brother and sister and when she look at camera she act sexy and also pretend to be a hard working and read the script. She think some people cannot see through her.

They are so unreliable, that they have *admitted* that they are unreliable. *TWO STORIES AGO* ""WGTC"" ran a story about how Daniel Richtman *DOESN'T KNOW WHAT HE IS TALKING ABOUT!*  So far, he has ""reliably"" informed us that AH is going to star in: Margot Robbie's Pirates of the Caribbean spinoff, the Fantastic Four (as Sue Storm), an unnamed Disney Princess (I'll name her for them), the Star Wars franchise, a solo Mera series, a Drive Angry sequel, The Fast and the Furious (Vin Diesel desperately wants her), the Harry potter Franchise (because Mr. Depp's good friend J. K. Rowling suddenly loves her), Marvel is seriously considering her for an MCU role, Netflix is developing a new movie for AH and Brie Larson, a new film with Zack Snyder, and one of my personal favorites, We Got This Covered reported that Jason Momoa's Aquaman was going to be *KILLED* in the Zack Snyder's Cut of Justice League, and Mera was going to replace him on the team.  If that last statement wasn't so obviously false, it would be funny.
