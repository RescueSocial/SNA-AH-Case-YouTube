_InternetAristocrat on SWJ's._

_A malady affecting a significant portion of the world's population wherein the afflicted will demand special treatment, conduct themselves with a ludicrous, unfounded sense of entitlement, and generally make the lives of everyone around them that much more miserable._

_The danger of this disease is that the sufferers rarely, if ever, know that they have contracted it, and continue about their merry way under the assumption that EVERYONE ELSE is the problem._

_This condition, if left untreated, can radically alter the carrier's demeanor, to include any of the following: a complete devolution to child-like behavior, temper tantrums, and/or fits of narcissistic rage._

_When confronted with an individual suspected of harboring Special Snowflake Syndrome, one's best course of action is to run away. Further attempts at educating the carrier on the reality of their condition (e.g., quoting Tyler Durden: ""You are not special. You are not a beautiful or unique snowflake. You're the same decaying organic matter as everything else."") will likely prove futile, and potentially hazardous to the informer._",2020-02-21T14:49:09Z,4

Anyone involved is either good intentioned but bought into the lies or full of hate.  I only ask one question and never get a good answer :.  What right do men have in today's society that women don't?  Since the answer is nothing , half truths need to be spun to spin up emotions and it truly blows my mind that most people can't see that it is one big lie , whose time has come and gone ...men are starting to catch on that although men stick up for women , women don't stick up for men . It's likely to get ugly , good job.   Men are also to blame . For letting this nonsense get this far and passively letting it damage birth rates , marriage , and relations between men and women ..there is no fixingit , women won't .  And as this happens the birth rate is already lower now than to sustain any culture (2.1 kids ) . So sit back for 20 -30 years as you and your ideas become minority.  And one more example that feminism is a big fake :. WHERE OR WHERE ARE YOU FEMENISTS AS OTHER CULTURES ARE CUTTING THE CLITORIS OFF THEIR GIRLS AND OPRESSING THEIR WOMEN ACTUALLY UNLIKE YOU , AND DOING IT IN YOUR BACKYARD?  PHONY FEMINISM.

Oh yeah, then there's that chunk of red lipstick on her lip! She has done a woeful job of putting this together and her deposition is the funniest thing I've seen in ages ... she can't act for shit and she talks like a child does when they're making up lie, you know? When it's so obvious it's funny! Also, I can't Believe they allowed her to munch on cookies during her deposition, it was either suggested to her so she could buy time on any tricky questions or it was her ... it shows how immature and disrespectful she is, in general, and towards authority. And as another youtuber pointed out, after each cookie she wipes the crumbs onto the fucking floor! She doesn't want her sleeves to get covered in crumbs ... that's all she's thinking! It's infuriating to watch, imagine being in a relationship with her? Torture! My sister has borderline personality disorder and bipolar and although I'm not saying everyone with those disorders are like this, many are ..
 I'm referring to the rage and reaction to perceived rejection. O think cluster b is the narcissistic type of borderline personality disorder, grandiose, overblown sense of self importance and to quote the symptoms online;

antisocial behaviour, compulsive behaviour, hostility, impulsivity, irritability, risk-taking behaviours, self-destructive behaviour, self-harm, social isolation, or lack of restraint

Mood:¬†anger, anxiety, general discontent, guilt, loneliness, mood swings, or sadness

Psychological:¬†depression, distorted self-image, grandiosity, or narcissism

My sister would fly into a fit of rage and apart from actual violence (two fisted punching, she punched my mum in the face and gave her a bloody nose!) She also hurled things and threw a really big vase at her boyfriend's car as he was speeding away from her. Arguments make no sense and you are in a constant state of nervousness because you get blindsided you are always defending yourself over ridiculous shit and the arguments or even just conversations last for hours and are so emotionally draining, if anyone sees these traits in a partner just be warned that this is a personality disorder and not easily treated, there needs to be self awareness (which is totally lacking) because their sense of self is fractured (due to abuse im childhood) and low self esteem (which is often over-compinsated with narcissism as a coping strategy) unfortunately it is very difficult for everyone involved. They are nasty traits, that doesn't mean I don't have some compassion on a deeper level ... I just know to stay the hell away from anyone displaying these types of behaviour. You can't fix it and it's unlikely that anyone can, it's possible with a professional help but often people with this disorder aren't aware that they have it in the first place. I have a friend who is a barrister and he said judges and people who work within the court system hate cases with borderline personality disorder because it's so difficult to interact with them and they know there is often no change in their behavior

Some feel like they may have done something to deserve it.  Usually they believe the person wants to get better and that convinces them to stay... if you read Ambers documents submitted to the court, you can see all those things were true. 

Why in the world would she need to do anything for publicity?
