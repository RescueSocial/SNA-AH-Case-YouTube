Johnny Depp reportedly drank heavily and was constantly late on the new 'Pirates' movie set

Johnny Depp‚Äôs unorthodox behavior has helped make him one of the biggest movie stars in the world, but it also appears to¬†be a serious risk to his career.

Often balancing outlandish roles ‚Äî as gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson in ‚ÄúFear and Loathing in Las Vegas,‚Äù in his numerous¬†Tim Burton movies ‚Äî with being the face of a giant blockbuster franchise in Disney‚Äôs ‚ÄúPirates of the Caribbean,‚Äù Depp has been seen as an A-list star who loves to take chances. And it made him beloved the world over.

In¬†the wake of his messy divorce from actress Amber Heard following her allegations that he abused her¬†and recent financial woes, however, Depp‚Äôs superstar status is now in jeopardy.

The¬†stories coming out about Depp‚Äôs behavior while making the latest ‚ÄúPirates‚Äù movie, ‚ÄúPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,‚Äù aren't going to help. They portray an actor in crisis mode.

The Hollywood Reporter¬†delved¬†deeper into the star‚Äôs reported reckless spending over the years and revealed allegations that he was constantly late to set and drank excessively while making ‚ÄúDead Men Tell No Tales‚Äù (opening in theaters May 26).

Not enough liquid money for '$2 million in monthly bills'

Depp is engaged in a legal battle with his former business managers at The Management Group, who claim that the star, despite earning more than $650 million in 13-plus years, there wasn't enough liquid cash to cover Depp's ""$2 million in monthly bills,"" according to The Hollywood Reporter.

The business managers say they confronted Depp about his spending habits, which included, they say, $30,000 a month on wine. Depp has also admitted to paying $5 million to shoot the ashes of his friend Hunter S. Thompson out of a cannon.

Depp has sued The Management Group on charges of fraud and mismanagement, and the company has countersued.

A 'Pirates' staffer was reportedly tasked with following Depp's every move

THR also unearthed unflattering stories about Depp's work on the set of ""Dead Men Tell No Tales"" from production sources.

Depp's lateness to the set of the movie on certain days reportedly led to hundreds of extras waiting hours for the star to show up, causing¬†the movie‚Äôs producer Jerry Bruckheimer and Disney production chief Sean Bailey to huddle to figure out how to shoot around him.

Though production staff raised the matter of Depp‚Äôs tardiness with the star, he reportedly never changed his habits.

""There were certainly days when our plans were challenged,"" Bailey said. ""But no one should underestimate Johnny's passion and commitment to this character and franchise.""

One source told THR that it got so bad that a production staffer was assigned to stake out Depp at the Coomera, Queensland, compound Depp rented while shooting the film. The staffer was stationed outside the house in an unmarked car and was told to alert his superiors of Depp‚Äôs movements, including¬†when a light was switched on in the morning (or in some cases the afternoon), signaling Depp was awake.

""When he got up, he'd turn on the light, and the moment the light went on they'd call the line producer, who would then call the directors [Joachim Ronning and Espen Sandberg]: 'He's up! He's getting ready!'"" a source from the set said. ""They even had a special code term, like 'The eagle has landed.' Johnny had no idea this was going on.""



Filming shut down after Depp injured himself by¬†seriously cutting his finger. According to numerous reports at the time, the injury occurred when Depp was inebriated and had a dispute with Heard. Bruckheimer told a different story to THR.

""We don't really know. He got it caught in a car door, or he got it caught in a sliding door. I've heard a couple of versions,‚Äù Bruckheimer said.

Depp‚Äôs reported drinking and lateness to set also caused an argument between Bruckheimer and Depp‚Äôs then-agent Tracey Jacobs on the ""Pirates"" set, according to a soruce.

‚ÄúShe went over to Jerry and said, 'You've got to do something! You're the producer.‚Äô He said, 'You do something. You're the agent,‚Äô‚Äù the source said.

‚ÄúEveryone was an innocent bystander watching this trainwreck,"" the source continued. ""But when Johnny came on set, he was charming, nice. He's yin and yang.""

Bruckheimer denied to THR that the spat took place.

The reporting is just the latest black eye for Depp, who for most of his career has been able to keep negative press about himself to a¬†minimum.

But so far, at least, it hasn‚Äôt hurt him from landing major roles. Following his cameo at the end of 2016‚Äôs ‚ÄúFantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,‚Äù he is set to star in the movie‚Äôs sequel coming out in 2018. He‚Äôs also wrapped on the highly anticipated ‚ÄúMurder on the Orient Express.‚Äù

Johnny Depp threatens to ‚Äòburn‚Äô and ‚Äòdrown‚Äô ex-wife Amber Heard

Johnny Depp threatens to ‚Äòburn‚Äô and ‚Äòdrown‚Äô ex-wife Amber Heard



MORE FROM:

EMILY SMITH



Raging Johnny Depp texted that he would ‚Äúburn‚Äù and ‚Äúdrown‚Äù ex-wife Amber Heard, then ‚Äúf‚Äìk her burnt corpse‚Äù during their volatile relationship, a court has heard.

Previously unseen 2013 messages alleged to have been sent by the ‚ÄúPirates of the Caribbean‚Äù star, 56, to actor friend Paul Bettany were read out in London‚Äôs High Court on Wednesday.

Depp, who attended the hearing, was in the room as his texts to Bettany were read aloud.

He allegedly wrote on Nov. 6, 2013, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs burn Amber,‚Äù the court heard.

The court was told he allegedly texted Bettany again that day to say, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs drown her before we burn her!!! I will f‚Äìk her burnt corpse afterwards to make sure she is dead.‚Äù

The court also heard further texts allegedly sent by Depp to Bettany in May 2014, which read: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna properly stop the booze thing, darling‚Ä¶ Drank all night before I picked Amber up to fly to LA, this past Sunday‚Ä¶Ugly, mate.

‚ÄúNo food for days‚Ä¶powders‚Ä¶half a bottle of whiskey, a thousand red bull and vodkas, pills, 2 bottles of Champers on plane and what do you get..???

‚ÄúAn angry, aggro Injun in a f‚Äìkin‚Äô blackout, screaming obscenities and insulting any f‚Äìk who got near‚Ä¶I‚Äôm done.

‚ÄúI am admittedly too f‚Äìked in the head to spray my rage at the one I love‚Ä¶For little reason, as well I‚Äôm too old to be that guy But, pills are fine!!!‚Äù

Depp is in court in London for a preliminary hearing in his libel suit against British newspaper the Sun over an article that alleged Depp had been abusive to Heard, 33.

His lawyer David Sherborne said the case would feature ‚Äúdiametrically opposed‚Äù versions of events from Depp and Heard.

‚ÄúOne person, one side, is lying, and one is not,‚Äù Sherborne said. ‚ÄúObviously, we say that it is Ms. Heard (who is lying), Mr. Depp is 100% clear about that.‚Äù

Sherborne claimed that Heard was not a victim but the ‚Äúaggressor‚Äù in the couple‚Äôs relationship, which ended in May 2016. Depp and Heard divorced in 2017.

Depp‚Äôs lawyer Adam Waldman said, ‚ÄúWhat does the Sun do to keep Amber Heard‚Äôs hoax alive? [Wednesday] in court we learned the answer ‚Äî cherry-picking a fragment of a single frustrated text message to a friend sent out of 500 gigabytes of text and email messages provided.



‚ÄúInconveniently for the Sun, here is what Mr. Depp actually said next in his text ‚Äì that he could never harm Amber: ‚ÄòI am admittedly too f‚Äìked in the head to spray my rage at the one I love‚Äô.‚Äù

The full hearing is due to start on March 23. Depp is also suing Heard for libel in the United States.

Adam Wolanski QC, representing the Sun, told the London court the May 2014 text to Bettany appeared to refer to an alleged ‚Äúaltercation‚Äù with Heard on a plane.

Wolanski said Depp is accused of ‚Äúscreaming obscenities‚Äù on the flight as he slapped Heard in the face, kicked her in the back and threw a boot at her, before allegedly ‚Äúpassing out‚Äù in the plane toilet. Depp denies he was drunk and abusive during the flight.

The texts were revealed in court after previous lawyers for Depp had accidentally shared 70,000 messages from and to the actor with the newspaper‚Äôs legal team

‚ÄúThese texts go to the very heart of the case, they are really very important and set out the claimant‚Äôs thinking in respect of a number of different incidents and his recollection,‚Äù Wolanski said.

Page Six has learned these texts have not been shared with Heard‚Äôs legal team in the US during the discovery process for their upcoming defamation trial.

Depp is suing Heard for $50 million in Northern Virginia, claiming he was defamed in an op-ed she wrote in the Washington Post in which she called for better support for domestic violence victims like herself, but without naming Depp in the piece.

In the US libel proceedings, Heard has previously alleged ‚Äúviolent‚Äù Depp became ‚Äúthe Monster‚Äù on drugs and booze, then beat, strangled and tormented her. She stated Depp repeatedly hit her, ripped out her hair, choked and nearly suffocated her in a Virginia court filing in response to his $50 million defamation lawsuit against her. He strongly denies her claims, arguing she was the aggressor.

In the US court filings Heard stated that she began dating Depp in early 2012 and ‚Äúabout a year into our relationship, I began to witness Johnny abusing drugs and alcohol ‚Ä¶ Whenever he was using, I worried for both of us. He would become a totally different person, often delusional and violent. We called that version of Johnny, ‚Äòthe Monster.‚Äô¬†Johnny often would not remember his delusional and violent conduct after he came out of his drunk or medicated states ‚Ä¶ Because I loved Johnny, I had believed his multiple promises that he could and would get better. I was wrong.‚Äù

On a private jet from Boston to Los Angeles in May 2014, Heard‚Äôs filing of Depp states: ‚ÄúOn the flight, Johnny ordered the flight attendants to give him an oxygen tank, and drank heavily. Johnny‚Äôs handlers told me that he was upset that I was filming a movie with a romantic scene with James Franco the day before. At some point, I stood up, and Johnny kicked me in the back, causing me to fall over. Johnny threw his boot at me while I was on the ground. Johnny continued to scream obscenities until he went into the plane bathroom and passed out, locked in the bathroom for the remainder of the flight.‚Äù



Depp allegedly apologized in a later text message, writing, ‚ÄúOnce again, I find myself in a place of shame and regret. Of course, I am sorry. I really don‚Äôt know why or what happened. But I will never do it again.‚Äù

Heard alleged in court filings that just a month into their marriage, in March 2015, Depp ‚Äî who was supposed to be clean at the time, but didn‚Äôt believe taking ecstasy broke his sobriety ‚Äî went on a three-day bender on MDMA/ecstasy in Australia.

‚ÄúJohnny told me that I had not explicitly forbidden him from taking ecstasy. The argument heated up, and Johnny pushed me, slapped me, and shoved me to the ground before I retreated to a locked bedroom.‚Äù

The next morning, ‚ÄúI went downstairs to find that Johnny was still awake, and that he had stayed up all night, having taken about eight MDMA pills. He was also drinking again. We got into a fight that Johnny made physical, and I barricaded myself in one of the rooms. That didn‚Äôt stop Johnny from busting through the door of the room I was in. By nightfall, Johnny had hit me multiple times, shoved and pushed me to the ground, choked me, and spit in my face.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat night, Johnny shoved me into a ping pong table that collapsed underneath me. Johnny threw bottles through the window panels of a glass door, breaking two panes, and leaving glass everywhere. Johnny then grabbed me, gripping my body and nightgown. He tore the nightgown off, and at some point, I was naked and barefoot, covered in alcohol and glass.‚Äù





She continued, ‚ÄúIn one of the most horrific and scariest moments of this three-day ordeal, Johnny grabbed me by the neck and collarbone and slammed me against the countertop. I struggled to stand up as he strangled me, but my arms and feet kept slipping and sliding on to the spilled alcohol and were dragged against the broken glass on the countertop and floor, which repeatedly slashed my feet and arms.‚Äù

Heard states that the actor was hospitalized, and she was left with ‚Äúa busted lip, a swollen nose, and cuts all over my body ‚Ä¶ to this day, I still have scars on my arms and feet from this incident.‚Äù

However US lawyers for Depp have stated, ‚ÄúMr. Depp never abused Ms. Heard. Her allegations against him were false when they were made in 2016. They were part of an elaborate hoax to generate positive publicity for Ms. Heard and advance her career.‚Äù

A series of recordings of Heard in 2015 allegedly admitting to ‚Äúhitting‚Äù Depp were recently been released to media outlets.

In the audio, the ‚ÄúAquaman‚Äù actress is heard saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry that I didn‚Äôt, uh, uh, hit you across the face in a proper slap, but I was hitting you, it was not punching you. Babe, you‚Äôre not punched ‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know what the motion of my actual hand was, but you‚Äôre fine, I did not hurt you, I did not punch you, I was hitting you. I can‚Äôt promise you I won‚Äôt get physical again. God I f‚Äìking sometimes get so mad I lose it.‚Äù

Depp is heard saying, ‚ÄúI left last night. Honestly, I swear to you because I just couldn‚Äôt take the idea of more physicality, more physical abuse on each other ‚Ä¶ Because had we continued it, it would have gotten f‚Äìking bad. And baby, I told you this once. I‚Äôm scared to death we are a f‚Äìking crime scene right now.‚Äù

He later states, ‚ÄúIf things get physical, we have to separate. We have to be apart from one another. Whether it‚Äôs for f‚Äìking an hour or 10 hours or f‚Äìking a day. We must, there can be no physical violence towards each other. All I‚Äôm saying is we need to take whatever time we need. You need, I need, to kind of let things settle for a minute. So that we don‚Äôt f‚Äìking kill each other or f‚Äìking worse, you know, f‚Äìking really kill each other or f‚Äìking break up or whatever.‚Äù

They reconcile in the recordings and vow to work on their marriage, but soon after Heard filed for divorce after 15 months of marriage. The estranged couple eventually agreed to a $7 million divorce settlement in August 2016.

AP

Facing legal action from ex-business managers ex-lawyers and ex-bodyguards¬†plus foreclosure filings and what could be an embarrassing trial later this summer, Johnny Depp has now been hit with an assault and battery lawsuit from the location manager of the upcoming City of Lies.

The actor allegedly hit Gregg ‚ÄúRocky‚Äù Brooks repeatedly on April 13, 2017 after being informed that DTLA filming on the Brad Furman helmed pic about the LAPD investigation into the 1997 murder of the Notorious B.I.G. was going to have to wrap up late that night. Hesitant to approach Depp after Furman told him to, the vet location manager went to speak instead to the on-set off duty LAPD officer about the matter. That conversation was seemingly cut short when the apparently booze on the breath¬†Pirates of the Caribbean star supposedly start screaming obscenities at Brooks and proceeded to strike him ‚Äútwice in the lower left side of his rib cage and causing pain.‚Äù

‚ÄúDespite having just been punched in the side, PLAINTIFF maintained his composure,‚Äù says the 10-claim complaint filed in LA Superior Court on July 6 (read it here). ‚ÄúWhen PLAINTIFF did not react to DEPP‚Äôs satisfaction after being punched, DEPP yelled ‚ÄúI WILL GIVE YOU ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS TO PUNCH ME IN THE FACE RIGHT NOW!‚Äù PLAINTIFF still did not react and DEPP continued to scream and berate him in front of a set full of people until DEPP‚Äôs own bodyguards physically removed DEPP from the scene.‚Äù

Brooks‚Äô filing from Glendale attorney Arbella Azizian of Baker Olson, LeCroy & Danielian seeks wide ranging but unspecified damages from Depp, Furmqn, producer Miriam Segal and the production. And it‚Äôs not just for the alleged assault but wrongful termination and retailation as well.

Co-starring Forest Whitaker, City of Lies is set to be released on September 7, which would have been the 46th birthday of B.I.G. AKA Christopher Wallace. That date is just over two weeks after the August 15 trial on Depp‚Äôs January 2017 filed $25 million fraud lawsuit against his former business managers The Management Group is scheduled to start. Having failed to pushed the matter back, which is unusual for a plaintiff, more stories of the actor‚Äôs excessive spending and empty accounts are expected to be on display.

With a countersuit from TMG also in play as well as a countersuit from the Hollywood Vampire bandmember‚Äôs former lawyer¬†Jacob Bloom¬†and his Bloom Hergott Diemer Rosenthal LaViolette Feldman Schenkman & Goodman LLP firm over Depp‚Äôs $30 million action against the attorneys, this latest action further portrays an individual sliding out of control. An impression certainly spotlighted by ex-bodyguards¬†Eugene Arreola and Miguel Sanchez‚Äôs May filed multi-claim lawsuit over unpaid wages and working conditions ‚Äì which claimed the use of¬† ‚Äúillegal substances‚Äù by Depp and ‚Äúbeing¬†forced to protect Defendant Depp from himself and his vices while in public.‚Äù

None of which can be pleasing to the now AT&T-owned Warner Bros, which has the Depp starring¬†Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald¬†coming out in November.

Former Pixar employee details how the company‚Äôs rampant sexism went far beyond John Lasseter



She says John Lasseter‚Äôs behavior was just one factor in an openly abusive culture

Disney purchased Pixar in 2006 at a valuation of $7.4 billion by converting each share of Pixar stock to 2.3 shares of Disney stock, a transaction that resulted in Jobs becoming Disney's largest single shareholder at the time.		=
When John Lasseter, Pixar‚Äôs former chief creative officer, left the esteemed animation studio in early June 2018, the public word on his transgressions were vague. Lasseter reportedly had ‚Äúmissteps‚Äù that made some people feel ‚Äúdisrespected and uncomfortable.‚Äù Today, a former Pixar employee has detailed how things at Pixar have been, and it‚Äôs much worse than Pixar had previously disclosed.

In a guest column for Variety, edited from a much lengthier original post on the Be Yourself vertical at Medium, graphic designer Cassandra Smolcic ‚Äî who spent her late twenties at Pixar, from 2009 to 2014 ‚Äî levels specific accusations about Lasseter and other men at the company. From the onset, she claims she was warned about the behavior Lasseter and other Pixar leaders displayed around women. It was bad enough that she says that she was banned from the weekly art meetings on the film she was assigned to because a superior told her that the COO ‚Äú‚Äòhas a hard time controlling himself‚Äô around young women.‚Äù Smolcic reportedly experienced this firsthand with Lasseter, who she says made a number of unwanted advances toward female staff.

‚ÄúHe would give me, and countless other women, lecherous up-and-down looks (or unwanted hugs and touches) almost every time we crossed his path on campus,‚Äù she writes. ‚ÄúThe entire Pixar workforce witnessed the sleazy spin that John brought to Pixar‚Äôs Halloween bash. If he found a woman attractive when she got on stage, he‚Äôd ask her to spin around while he made suggestive comments, turning the event into yet another lewd spectacle.‚Äù

‚Äú‚ÄúHE WOULD GIVE ME, AND COUNTLESS OTHER WOMEN, LECHEROUS UP-AND-DOWN LOOKS (OR UNWANTED HUGS AND TOUCHES) ALMOST EVERY TIME WE CROSSED HIS PATH ON CAMPUS.‚Äù

‚Äù
=
Smolcic‚Äôs descriptions of her personal experiences line up with The Hollywood Reporter‚Äôs investigation on Pixar, which stated Lasseter was well-known for ‚Äúgrabbing, kissing, [and] making comments about physical attributes.‚Äù

As the leadership at the studio violated their employees‚Äô boundaries, Smolcic says it created a feeling that such behavior was acceptable for the wider staff. She describes a culture where women were regularly groped, a company-wide meeting where a director compared his latest film to ‚Äúa big-titted blond who was difficult to nail down,‚Äù and an open environment of preferential treatment for men, who were given resources and opportunities not available to women.
-

‚ÄúA female lead in my department once begged her male bosses to support her with a team to complete a challenging production project,‚Äù Smolcic writes. ‚ÄúHer male superiors repeatedly ignored her requests, until the stress of the job led her into a state of psychological and physical breakdown. When she went into sabbatical to recover, her male replacement was given a team of half a dozen artists to help him complete the same task.‚Äù Similarly, she describes a performance review where she was accused of ‚Äútrying too hard,‚Äù ‚Äúasking too many questions,‚Äù and other things a male mentor said would be considered positives at Pixar, ‚Äúif you were a man.‚Äù

Smolcic says women at Pixar came together in solidarity, exchanging tips and support, but that any attempts to complain to management were ignored. ‚ÄúMany of us kept silent about these disheartening experiences, because we understood that the price for speaking out was high,‚Äù she wrote. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôd witnessed the fallout for women who questioned male leads ‚Äî who were branded ‚Äòdifficult,‚Äô had a hard time getting cast on subsequent projects, and were even laid off or demoted.‚Äù
=
‚Äú‚ÄúWE‚ÄôD WITNESSED THE FALLOUT FOR WOMEN WHO QUESTIONED MALE LEADS ‚Äî WHO WERE BRANDED ‚ÄòDIFFICULT,‚Äô HAD A HARD TIME GETTING CAST ON SUBSEQUENT PROJECTS, AND WERE EVEN LAID OFF OR DEMOTED.‚Äù
=
Smolcic‚Äôs longer original essay goes into far more detail about specific encounters she had at Pixar, including with an employee who grabbed and slapped her ass at an employee-run bar, and a supervisor who openly leered at her throughout her tenure, and looked her up and down, telling her ‚ÄúI‚Äôm reaallllly gonna miss the view,‚Äù when she gave notice. She also notes the negative reputations specific women in leadership positions got via the company ‚Äúwhisper network,‚Äù and contrasts those reputations with her actual experience with those leaders. Original Brave director Brenda Chapman, who was billed as Pixar‚Äôs first female director, but eventually pushed off the film in favor of a man, gets particular attention: Smolcic describes how Chapman was publicly dismissed as ‚Äúindecisive, unconfident and ineffective,‚Äù which her team fervently denies. Smolcic also addresses Rashida Jones‚Äô departure from the Toy Story 4 writing staff over inequality at Pixar, and how one co-worker dismissed Jones based on her looks and habit of showing up to work ‚Äúwith no makeup and her hair pulled back.‚Äù

Smolcic says eventually, the inequality at Pixar broke her down, and she had to leave. She also acknowledges that while Lasseter has already stepped down and Frozen director Jennifer Lee took his place, the studio must do more to undo Lasseter‚Äôs wider legacy.

‚ÄúDisney and Pixar must recognize that women and underrepresented minorities are just as capable, talented, complex, and dimensional as the white fraternity of men who have monopolized animation thus far,‚Äù she wrote. ‚ÄúFemale narratives are worthy of world-class storytellers, and women deserve to be treated as respected equals in any creative community.‚Äù

Pixar did not respond to a request for comment by The Verge.

Johnny Depp threatens to ‚Äòburn‚Äô and ‚Äòdrown‚Äô ex-wife Amber Heard

Johnny Depp threatens to ‚Äòburn‚Äô and ‚Äòdrown‚Äô ex-wife Amber Heard



MORE FROM:

EMILY SMITH



Raging Johnny Depp texted that he would ‚Äúburn‚Äù and ‚Äúdrown‚Äù ex-wife Amber Heard, then ‚Äúf‚Äìk her burnt corpse‚Äù during their volatile relationship, a court has heard.

Previously unseen 2013 messages alleged to have been sent by the ‚ÄúPirates of the Caribbean‚Äù star, 56, to actor friend Paul Bettany were read out in London‚Äôs High Court on Wednesday.

Depp, who attended the hearing, was in the room as his texts to Bettany were read aloud.

He allegedly wrote on Nov. 6, 2013, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs burn Amber,‚Äù the court heard.

The court was told he allegedly texted Bettany again that day to say, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs drown her before we burn her!!! I will f‚Äìk her burnt corpse afterwards to make sure she is dead.‚Äù

The court also heard further texts allegedly sent by Depp to Bettany in May 2014, which read: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna properly stop the booze thing, darling‚Ä¶ Drank all night before I picked Amber up to fly to LA, this past Sunday‚Ä¶Ugly, mate.

‚ÄúNo food for days‚Ä¶powders‚Ä¶half a bottle of whiskey, a thousand red bull and vodkas, pills, 2 bottles of Champers on plane and what do you get..???

‚ÄúAn angry, aggro Injun in a f‚Äìkin‚Äô blackout, screaming obscenities and insulting any f‚Äìk who got near‚Ä¶I‚Äôm done.

‚ÄúI am admittedly too f‚Äìked in the head to spray my rage at the one I love‚Ä¶For little reason, as well I‚Äôm too old to be that guy But, pills are fine!!!‚Äù

Depp is in court in London for a preliminary hearing in his libel suit against British newspaper the Sun over an article that alleged Depp had been abusive to Heard, 33.

His lawyer David Sherborne said the case would feature ‚Äúdiametrically opposed‚Äù versions of events from Depp and Heard.

‚ÄúOne person, one side, is lying, and one is not,‚Äù Sherborne said. ‚ÄúObviously, we say that it is Ms. Heard (who is lying), Mr. Depp is 100% clear about that.‚Äù

Sherborne claimed that Heard was not a victim but the ‚Äúaggressor‚Äù in the couple‚Äôs relationship, which ended in May 2016. Depp and Heard divorced in 2017.

Depp‚Äôs lawyer Adam Waldman said, ‚ÄúWhat does the Sun do to keep Amber Heard‚Äôs hoax alive? [Wednesday] in court we learned the answer ‚Äî cherry-picking a fragment of a single frustrated text message to a friend sent out of 500 gigabytes of text and email messages provided.



‚ÄúInconveniently for the Sun, here is what Mr. Depp actually said next in his text ‚Äì that he could never harm Amber: ‚ÄòI am admittedly too f‚Äìked in the head to spray my rage at the one I love‚Äô.‚Äù

The full hearing is due to start on March 23. Depp is also suing Heard for libel in the United States.

Adam Wolanski QC, representing the Sun, told the London court the May 2014 text to Bettany appeared to refer to an alleged ‚Äúaltercation‚Äù with Heard on a plane.

Wolanski said Depp is accused of ‚Äúscreaming obscenities‚Äù on the flight as he slapped Heard in the face, kicked her in the back and threw a boot at her, before allegedly ‚Äúpassing out‚Äù in the plane toilet. Depp denies he was drunk and abusive during the flight.

The texts were revealed in court after previous lawyers for Depp had accidentally shared 70,000 messages from and to the actor with the newspaper‚Äôs legal team

‚ÄúThese texts go to the very heart of the case, they are really very important and set out the claimant‚Äôs thinking in respect of a number of different incidents and his recollection,‚Äù Wolanski said.

Page Six has learned these texts have not been shared with Heard‚Äôs legal team in the US during the discovery process for their upcoming defamation trial.

Depp is suing Heard for $50 million in Northern Virginia, claiming he was defamed in an op-ed she wrote in the Washington Post in which she called for better support for domestic violence victims like herself, but without naming Depp in the piece.

In the US libel proceedings, Heard has previously alleged ‚Äúviolent‚Äù Depp became ‚Äúthe Monster‚Äù on drugs and booze, then beat, strangled and tormented her. She stated Depp repeatedly hit her, ripped out her hair, choked and nearly suffocated her in a Virginia court filing in response to his $50 million defamation lawsuit against her. He strongly denies her claims, arguing she was the aggressor.

In the US court filings Heard stated that she began dating Depp in early 2012 and ‚Äúabout a year into our relationship, I began to witness Johnny abusing drugs and alcohol ‚Ä¶ Whenever he was using, I worried for both of us. He would become a totally different person, often delusional and violent. We called that version of Johnny, ‚Äòthe Monster.‚Äô¬†Johnny often would not remember his delusional and violent conduct after he came out of his drunk or medicated states ‚Ä¶ Because I loved Johnny, I had believed his multiple promises that he could and would get better. I was wrong.‚Äù

On a private jet from Boston to Los Angeles in May 2014, Heard‚Äôs filing of Depp states: ‚ÄúOn the flight, Johnny ordered the flight attendants to give him an oxygen tank, and drank heavily. Johnny‚Äôs handlers told me that he was upset that I was filming a movie with a romantic scene with James Franco the day before. At some point, I stood up, and Johnny kicked me in the back, causing me to fall over. Johnny threw his boot at me while I was on the ground. Johnny continued to scream obscenities until he went into the plane bathroom and passed out, locked in the bathroom for the remainder of the flight.‚Äù



Depp allegedly apologized in a later text message, writing, ‚ÄúOnce again, I find myself in a place of shame and regret. Of course, I am sorry. I really don‚Äôt know why or what happened. But I will never do it again.‚Äù

Heard alleged in court filings that just a month into their marriage, in March 2015, Depp ‚Äî who was supposed to be clean at the time, but didn‚Äôt believe taking ecstasy broke his sobriety ‚Äî went on a three-day bender on MDMA/ecstasy in Australia.

‚ÄúJohnny told me that I had not explicitly forbidden him from taking ecstasy. The argument heated up, and Johnny pushed me, slapped me, and shoved me to the ground before I retreated to a locked bedroom.‚Äù

The next morning, ‚ÄúI went downstairs to find that Johnny was still awake, and that he had stayed up all night, having taken about eight MDMA pills. He was also drinking again. We got into a fight that Johnny made physical, and I barricaded myself in one of the rooms. That didn‚Äôt stop Johnny from busting through the door of the room I was in. By nightfall, Johnny had hit me multiple times, shoved and pushed me to the ground, choked me, and spit in my face.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat night, Johnny shoved me into a ping pong table that collapsed underneath me. Johnny threw bottles through the window panels of a glass door, breaking two panes, and leaving glass everywhere. Johnny then grabbed me, gripping my body and nightgown. He tore the nightgown off, and at some point, I was naked and barefoot, covered in alcohol and glass.‚Äù





She continued, ‚ÄúIn one of the most horrific and scariest moments of this three-day ordeal, Johnny grabbed me by the neck and collarbone and slammed me against the countertop. I struggled to stand up as he strangled me, but my arms and feet kept slipping and sliding on to the spilled alcohol and were dragged against the broken glass on the countertop and floor, which repeatedly slashed my feet and arms.‚Äù

Heard states that the actor was hospitalized, and she was left with ‚Äúa busted lip, a swollen nose, and cuts all over my body ‚Ä¶ to this day, I still have scars on my arms and feet from this incident.‚Äù

However US lawyers for Depp have stated, ‚ÄúMr. Depp never abused Ms. Heard. Her allegations against him were false when they were made in 2016. They were part of an elaborate hoax to generate positive publicity for Ms. Heard and advance her career.‚Äù

A series of recordings of Heard in 2015 allegedly admitting to ‚Äúhitting‚Äù Depp were recently been released to media outlets.

In the audio, the ‚ÄúAquaman‚Äù actress is heard saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry that I didn‚Äôt, uh, uh, hit you across the face in a proper slap, but I was hitting you, it was not punching you. Babe, you‚Äôre not punched ‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know what the motion of my actual hand was, but you‚Äôre fine, I did not hurt you, I did not punch you, I was hitting you. I can‚Äôt promise you I won‚Äôt get physical again. God I f‚Äìking sometimes get so mad I lose it.‚Äù

Depp is heard saying, ‚ÄúI left last night. Honestly, I swear to you because I just couldn‚Äôt take the idea of more physicality, more physical abuse on each other ‚Ä¶ Because had we continued it, it would have gotten f‚Äìking bad. And baby, I told you this once. I‚Äôm scared to death we are a f‚Äìking crime scene right now.‚Äù

He later states, ‚ÄúIf things get physical, we have to separate. We have to be apart from one another. Whether it‚Äôs for f‚Äìking an hour or 10 hours or f‚Äìking a day. We must, there can be no physical violence towards each other. All I‚Äôm saying is we need to take whatever time we need. You need, I need, to kind of let things settle for a minute. So that we don‚Äôt f‚Äìking kill each other or f‚Äìking worse, you know, f‚Äìking really kill each other or f‚Äìking break up or whatever.‚Äù

They reconcile in the recordings and vow to work on their marriage, but soon after Heard filed for divorce after 15 months of marriage. The estranged couple eventually agreed to a $7 million divorce settlement in August 2016.

Johnny Depp reportedly drank heavily and was constantly late on the new 'Pirates' movie set

Johnny Depp‚Äôs unorthodox behavior has helped make him one of the biggest movie stars in the world, but it also appears to¬†be a serious risk to his career.

Often balancing outlandish roles ‚Äî as gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson in ‚ÄúFear and Loathing in Las Vegas,‚Äù in his numerous¬†Tim Burton movies ‚Äî with being the face of a giant blockbuster franchise in Disney‚Äôs ‚ÄúPirates of the Caribbean,‚Äù Depp has been seen as an A-list star who loves to take chances. And it made him beloved the world over.

In¬†the wake of his messy divorce from actress Amber Heard following her allegations that he abused her¬†and recent financial woes, however, Depp‚Äôs superstar status is now in jeopardy.

The¬†stories coming out about Depp‚Äôs behavior while making the latest ‚ÄúPirates‚Äù movie, ‚ÄúPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,‚Äù aren't going to help. They portray an actor in crisis mode.

The Hollywood Reporter¬†delved¬†deeper into the star‚Äôs reported reckless spending over the years and revealed allegations that he was constantly late to set and drank excessively while making ‚ÄúDead Men Tell No Tales‚Äù (opening in theaters May 26).

Not enough liquid money for '$2 million in monthly bills'

Depp is engaged in a legal battle with his former business managers at The Management Group, who claim that the star, despite earning more than $650 million in 13-plus years, there wasn't enough liquid cash to cover Depp's ""$2 million in monthly bills,"" according to The Hollywood Reporter.

The business managers say they confronted Depp about his spending habits, which included, they say, $30,000 a month on wine. Depp has also admitted to paying $5 million to shoot the ashes of his friend Hunter S. Thompson out of a cannon.

Depp has sued The Management Group on charges of fraud and mismanagement, and the company has countersued.

A 'Pirates' staffer was reportedly tasked with following Depp's every move

THR also unearthed unflattering stories about Depp's work on the set of ""Dead Men Tell No Tales"" from production sources.

Depp's lateness to the set of the movie on certain days reportedly led to hundreds of extras waiting hours for the star to show up, causing¬†the movie‚Äôs producer Jerry Bruckheimer and Disney production chief Sean Bailey to huddle to figure out how to shoot around him.

Though production staff raised the matter of Depp‚Äôs tardiness with the star, he reportedly never changed his habits.

""There were certainly days when our plans were challenged,"" Bailey said. ""But no one should underestimate Johnny's passion and commitment to this character and franchise.""

One source told THR that it got so bad that a production staffer was assigned to stake out Depp at the Coomera, Queensland, compound Depp rented while shooting the film. The staffer was stationed outside the house in an unmarked car and was told to alert his superiors of Depp‚Äôs movements, including¬†when a light was switched on in the morning (or in some cases the afternoon), signaling Depp was awake.

""When he got up, he'd turn on the light, and the moment the light went on they'd call the line producer, who would then call the directors [Joachim Ronning and Espen Sandberg]: 'He's up! He's getting ready!'"" a source from the set said. ""They even had a special code term, like 'The eagle has landed.' Johnny had no idea this was going on.""



Filming shut down after Depp injured himself by¬†seriously cutting his finger. According to numerous reports at the time, the injury occurred when Depp was inebriated and had a dispute with Heard. Bruckheimer told a different story to THR.

""We don't really know. He got it caught in a car door, or he got it caught in a sliding door. I've heard a couple of versions,‚Äù Bruckheimer said.

Depp‚Äôs reported drinking and lateness to set also caused an argument between Bruckheimer and Depp‚Äôs then-agent Tracey Jacobs on the ""Pirates"" set, according to a soruce.

‚ÄúShe went over to Jerry and said, 'You've got to do something! You're the producer.‚Äô He said, 'You do something. You're the agent,‚Äô‚Äù the source said.

‚ÄúEveryone was an innocent bystander watching this trainwreck,"" the source continued. ""But when Johnny came on set, he was charming, nice. He's yin and yang.""

Bruckheimer denied to THR that the spat took place.

The reporting is just the latest black eye for Depp, who for most of his career has been able to keep negative press about himself to a¬†minimum.

But so far, at least, it hasn‚Äôt hurt him from landing major roles. Following his cameo at the end of 2016‚Äôs ‚ÄúFantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,‚Äù he is set to star in the movie‚Äôs sequel coming out in 2018. He‚Äôs also wrapped on the highly anticipated ‚ÄúMurder on the Orient Express.‚Äù

Johnny Depp reportedly drank heavily and was constantly late on the new 'Pirates' movie set

Johnny Depp‚Äôs unorthodox behavior has helped make him one of the biggest movie stars in the world, but it also appears to¬†be a serious risk to his career.

Often balancing outlandish roles ‚Äî as gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson in ‚ÄúFear and Loathing in Las Vegas,‚Äù in his numerous¬†Tim Burton movies ‚Äî with being the face of a giant blockbuster franchise in Disney‚Äôs ‚ÄúPirates of the Caribbean,‚Äù Depp has been seen as an A-list star who loves to take chances. And it made him beloved the world over.



In¬†the wake of his messy divorce from actress Amber Heard following her allegations that he abused her¬†and recent financial woes, however, Depp‚Äôs superstar status is now in jeopardy.

The¬†stories coming out about Depp‚Äôs behavior while making the latest ‚ÄúPirates‚Äù movie, ‚ÄúPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,‚Äù aren't going to help. They portray an actor in crisis mode.

The Hollywood Reporter¬†delved¬†deeper into the star‚Äôs reported reckless spending over the years and revealed allegations that he was constantly late to set and drank excessively while making ‚ÄúDead Men Tell No Tales‚Äù (opening in theaters May 26).

Not enough liquid money for '$2 million in monthly bills'

Depp is engaged in a legal battle with his former business managers at The Management Group, who claim that the star, despite earning more than $650 million in 13-plus years, there wasn't enough liquid cash to cover Depp's ""$2 million in monthly bills,"" according to The Hollywood Reporter.





The business managers say they confronted Depp about his spending habits, which included, they say, $30,000 a month on wine. Depp has also admitted to paying $5 million to shoot the ashes of his friend Hunter S. Thompson out of a cannon.

Depp has sued The Management Group on charges of fraud and mismanagement, and the company has countersued.

A 'Pirates' staffer was reportedly tasked with following Depp's every move



THR also unearthed unflattering stories about Depp's work on the set of ""Dead Men Tell No Tales"" from production sources.

Depp's lateness to the set of the movie on certain days reportedly led to hundreds of extras waiting hours for the star to show up, causing¬†the movie‚Äôs producer Jerry Bruckheimer and Disney production chief Sean Bailey to huddle to figure out how to shoot around him.



Though production staff raised the matter of Depp‚Äôs tardiness with the star, he reportedly never changed his habits.

""There were certainly days when our plans were challenged,"" Bailey said. ""But no one should underestimate Johnny's passion and commitment to this character and franchise.""

One source told THR that it got so bad that a production staffer was assigned to stake out Depp at the Coomera, Queensland, compound Depp rented while shooting the film. The staffer was stationed outside the house in an unmarked car and was told to alert his superiors of Depp‚Äôs movements, including¬†when a light was switched on in the morning (or in some cases the afternoon), signaling Depp was awake.

""When he got up, he'd turn on the light, and the moment the light went on they'd call the line producer, who would then call the directors [Joachim Ronning and Espen Sandberg]: 'He's up! He's getting ready!'"" a source from the set said. ""They even had a special code term, like 'The eagle has landed.' Johnny had no idea this was going on.""



Filming shut down after Depp injured himself by¬†seriously cutting his finger. According to numerous reports at the time, the injury occurred when Depp was inebriated and had a dispute with Heard. Bruckheimer told a different story to THR.

""We don't really know. He got it caught in a car door, or he got it caught in a sliding door. I've heard a couple of versions,‚Äù Bruckheimer said.

Depp‚Äôs reported drinking and lateness to set also caused an argument between Bruckheimer and Depp‚Äôs then-agent Tracey Jacobs on the ""Pirates"" set, according to a soruce.

‚ÄúShe went over to Jerry and said, 'You've got to do something! You're the producer.‚Äô He said, 'You do something. You're the agent,‚Äô‚Äù the source said.

‚ÄúEveryone was an innocent bystander watching this trainwreck,"" the source continued. ""But when Johnny came on set, he was charming, nice. He's yin and yang.""

Bruckheimer denied to THR that the spat took place.

The reporting is just the latest black eye for Depp, who for most of his career has been able to keep negative press about himself to a¬†minimum.

But so far, at least, it hasn‚Äôt hurt him from landing major roles. Following his cameo at the end of 2016‚Äôs ‚ÄúFantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,‚Äù he is set to star in the movie‚Äôs sequel coming out in 2018. He‚Äôs also wrapped on the highly anticipated ‚ÄúMurder on the Orient Express.‚Äù

Johnny Depp threatens to ‚Äòburn‚Äô and ‚Äòdrown‚Äô ex-wife Amber Heard

Johnny Depp threatens to ‚Äòburn‚Äô and ‚Äòdrown‚Äô ex-wife Amber Heard



MORE FROM:

EMILY SMITH



Raging Johnny Depp texted that he would ‚Äúburn‚Äù and ‚Äúdrown‚Äù ex-wife Amber Heard, then ‚Äúf‚Äìk her burnt corpse‚Äù during their volatile relationship, a court has heard.

Previously unseen 2013 messages alleged to have been sent by the ‚ÄúPirates of the Caribbean‚Äù star, 56, to actor friend Paul Bettany were read out in London‚Äôs High Court on Wednesday.

Depp, who attended the hearing, was in the room as his texts to Bettany were read aloud.

He allegedly wrote on Nov. 6, 2013, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs burn Amber,‚Äù the court heard.

The court was told he allegedly texted Bettany again that day to say, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs drown her before we burn her!!! I will f‚Äìk her burnt corpse afterwards to make sure she is dead.‚Äù

The court also heard further texts allegedly sent by Depp to Bettany in May 2014, which read: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna properly stop the booze thing, darling‚Ä¶ Drank all night before I picked Amber up to fly to LA, this past Sunday‚Ä¶Ugly, mate.

‚ÄúNo food for days‚Ä¶powders‚Ä¶half a bottle of whiskey, a thousand red bull and vodkas, pills, 2 bottles of Champers on plane and what do you get..???

‚ÄúAn angry, aggro Injun in a f‚Äìkin‚Äô blackout, screaming obscenities and insulting any f‚Äìk who got near‚Ä¶I‚Äôm done.

‚ÄúI am admittedly too f‚Äìked in the head to spray my rage at the one I love‚Ä¶For little reason, as well I‚Äôm too old to be that guy But, pills are fine!!!‚Äù

Depp is in court in London for a preliminary hearing in his libel suit against British newspaper the Sun over an article that alleged Depp had been abusive to Heard, 33.

His lawyer David Sherborne said the case would feature ‚Äúdiametrically opposed‚Äù versions of events from Depp and Heard.

‚ÄúOne person, one side, is lying, and one is not,‚Äù Sherborne said. ‚ÄúObviously, we say that it is Ms. Heard (who is lying), Mr. Depp is 100% clear about that.‚Äù

Sherborne claimed that Heard was not a victim but the ‚Äúaggressor‚Äù in the couple‚Äôs relationship, which ended in May 2016. Depp and Heard divorced in 2017.

Depp‚Äôs lawyer Adam Waldman said, ‚ÄúWhat does the Sun do to keep Amber Heard‚Äôs hoax alive? [Wednesday] in court we learned the answer ‚Äî cherry-picking a fragment of a single frustrated text message to a friend sent out of 500 gigabytes of text and email messages provided.



‚ÄúInconveniently for the Sun, here is what Mr. Depp actually said next in his text ‚Äì that he could never harm Amber: ‚ÄòI am admittedly too f‚Äìked in the head to spray my rage at the one I love‚Äô.‚Äù

The full hearing is due to start on March 23. Depp is also suing Heard for libel in the United States.

Adam Wolanski QC, representing the Sun, told the London court the May 2014 text to Bettany appeared to refer to an alleged ‚Äúaltercation‚Äù with Heard on a plane.

Wolanski said Depp is accused of ‚Äúscreaming obscenities‚Äù on the flight as he slapped Heard in the face, kicked her in the back and threw a boot at her, before allegedly ‚Äúpassing out‚Äù in the plane toilet. Depp denies he was drunk and abusive during the flight.

The texts were revealed in court after previous lawyers for Depp had accidentally shared 70,000 messages from and to the actor with the newspaper‚Äôs legal team

‚ÄúThese texts go to the very heart of the case, they are really very important and set out the claimant‚Äôs thinking in respect of a number of different incidents and his recollection,‚Äù Wolanski said.

Page Six has learned these texts have not been shared with Heard‚Äôs legal team in the US during the discovery process for their upcoming defamation trial.

Depp is suing Heard for $50 million in Northern Virginia, claiming he was defamed in an op-ed she wrote in the Washington Post in which she called for better support for domestic violence victims like herself, but without naming Depp in the piece.

In the US libel proceedings, Heard has previously alleged ‚Äúviolent‚Äù Depp became ‚Äúthe Monster‚Äù on drugs and booze, then beat, strangled and tormented her. She stated Depp repeatedly hit her, ripped out her hair, choked and nearly suffocated her in a Virginia court filing in response to his $50 million defamation lawsuit against her. He strongly denies her claims, arguing she was the aggressor.

In the US court filings Heard stated that she began dating Depp in early 2012 and ‚Äúabout a year into our relationship, I began to witness Johnny abusing drugs and alcohol ‚Ä¶ Whenever he was using, I worried for both of us. He would become a totally different person, often delusional and violent. We called that version of Johnny, ‚Äòthe Monster.‚Äô¬†Johnny often would not remember his delusional and violent conduct after he came out of his drunk or medicated states ‚Ä¶ Because I loved Johnny, I had believed his multiple promises that he could and would get better. I was wrong.‚Äù

On a private jet from Boston to Los Angeles in May 2014, Heard‚Äôs filing of Depp states: ‚ÄúOn the flight, Johnny ordered the flight attendants to give him an oxygen tank, and drank heavily. Johnny‚Äôs handlers told me that he was upset that I was filming a movie with a romantic scene with James Franco the day before. At some point, I stood up, and Johnny kicked me in the back, causing me to fall over. Johnny threw his boot at me while I was on the ground. Johnny continued to scream obscenities until he went into the plane bathroom and passed out, locked in the bathroom for the remainder of the flight.‚Äù



Depp allegedly apologized in a later text message, writing, ‚ÄúOnce again, I find myself in a place of shame and regret. Of course, I am sorry. I really don‚Äôt know why or what happened. But I will never do it again.‚Äù

Heard alleged in court filings that just a month into their marriage, in March 2015, Depp ‚Äî who was supposed to be clean at the time, but didn‚Äôt believe taking ecstasy broke his sobriety ‚Äî went on a three-day bender on MDMA/ecstasy in Australia.

‚ÄúJohnny told me that I had not explicitly forbidden him from taking ecstasy. The argument heated up, and Johnny pushed me, slapped me, and shoved me to the ground before I retreated to a locked bedroom.‚Äù

The next morning, ‚ÄúI went downstairs to find that Johnny was still awake, and that he had stayed up all night, having taken about eight MDMA pills. He was also drinking again. We got into a fight that Johnny made physical, and I barricaded myself in one of the rooms. That didn‚Äôt stop Johnny from busting through the door of the room I was in. By nightfall, Johnny had hit me multiple times, shoved and pushed me to the ground, choked me, and spit in my face.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat night, Johnny shoved me into a ping pong table that collapsed underneath me. Johnny threw bottles through the window panels of a glass door, breaking two panes, and leaving glass everywhere. Johnny then grabbed me, gripping my body and nightgown. He tore the nightgown off, and at some point, I was naked and barefoot, covered in alcohol and glass.‚Äù



She continued, ‚ÄúIn one of the most horrific and scariest moments of this three-day ordeal, Johnny grabbed me by the neck and collarbone and slammed me against the countertop. I struggled to stand up as he strangled me, but my arms and feet kept slipping and sliding on to the spilled alcohol and were dragged against the broken glass on the countertop and floor, which repeatedly slashed my feet and arms.‚Äù

Heard states that the actor was hospitalized, and she was left with ‚Äúa busted lip, a swollen nose, and cuts all over my body ‚Ä¶ to this day, I still have scars on my arms and feet from this incident.‚Äù

However US lawyers for Depp have stated, ‚ÄúMr. Depp never abused Ms. Heard. Her allegations against him were false when they were made in 2016. They were part of an elaborate hoax to generate positive publicity for Ms. Heard and advance her career.‚Äù

A series of recordings of Heard in 2015 allegedly admitting to ‚Äúhitting‚Äù Depp were recently been released to media outlets.

In the audio, the ‚ÄúAquaman‚Äù actress is heard saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry that I didn‚Äôt, uh, uh, hit you across the face in a proper slap, but I was hitting you, it was not punching you. Babe, you‚Äôre not punched ‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know what the motion of my actual hand was, but you‚Äôre fine, I did not hurt you, I did not punch you, I was hitting you. I can‚Äôt promise you I won‚Äôt get physical again. God I f‚Äìking sometimes get so mad I lose it.‚Äù

Depp is heard saying, ‚ÄúI left last night. Honestly, I swear to you because I just couldn‚Äôt take the idea of more physicality, more physical abuse on each other ‚Ä¶ Because had we continued it, it would have gotten f‚Äìking bad. And baby, I told you this once. I‚Äôm scared to death we are a f‚Äìking crime scene right now.‚Äù

He later states, ‚ÄúIf things get physical, we have to separate. We have to be apart from one another. Whether it‚Äôs for f‚Äìking an hour or 10 hours or f‚Äìking a day. We must, there can be no physical violence towards each other. All I‚Äôm saying is we need to take whatever time we need. You need, I need, to kind of let things settle for a minute. So that we don‚Äôt f‚Äìking kill each other or f‚Äìking worse, you know, f‚Äìking really kill each other or f‚Äìking break up or whatever.‚Äù

They reconcile in the recordings and vow to work on their marriage, but soon after Heard filed for divorce after 15 months of marriage. The estranged couple eventually agreed to a $7 million divorce settlement in August 2016.

Reps for Depp didn‚Äôt immediately get back to us.

Facing legal action from ex-business managers ex-lawyers and ex-bodyguards¬†plus foreclosure filings and what could be an embarrassing trial later this summer, Johnny Depp has now been hit with an assault and battery lawsuit from the location manager of the upcoming City of Lies.

The actor allegedly hit Gregg ‚ÄúRocky‚Äù Brooks repeatedly on April 13, 2017 after being informed that DTLA filming on the Brad Furman helmed pic about the LAPD investigation into the 1997 murder of the Notorious B.I.G. was going to have to wrap up late that night. Hesitant to approach Depp after Furman told him to, the vet location manager went to speak instead to the on-set off duty LAPD officer about the matter. That conversation was seemingly cut short when the apparently booze on the breath¬†Pirates of the Caribbean star supposedly start screaming obscenities at Brooks and proceeded to strike him ‚Äútwice in the lower left side of his rib cage and causing pain.‚Äù





‚ÄúDespite having just been punched in the side, PLAINTIFF maintained his composure,‚Äù says the 10-claim complaint filed in LA Superior Court on July 6 (read it here). ‚ÄúWhen PLAINTIFF did not react to DEPP‚Äôs satisfaction after being punched, DEPP yelled ‚ÄúI WILL GIVE YOU ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS TO PUNCH ME IN THE FACE RIGHT NOW!‚Äù PLAINTIFF still did not react and DEPP continued to scream and berate him in front of a set full of people until DEPP‚Äôs own bodyguards physically removed DEPP from the scene.‚Äù

Brooks‚Äô filing from Glendale attorney Arbella Azizian of Baker Olson, LeCroy & Danielian seeks wide ranging but unspecified damages from Depp, Furmqn, producer Miriam Segal and the production. And it‚Äôs not just for the alleged assault but wrongful termination and retailation as well.

‚Äú0n the Monday following the incident, April 16, 2017, PLAINTIFF returned to the production office to work on wrapping out the show,‚Äù the 14-page filing adds damningly.‚ÄùUpon arrival, PLAINTIFF was informed that SEGAL wanted him to write and sign a declaration stating that he would not sue the PRODUCTION. When PLAINTIFF declined to write such a statement, his services were terminated immediately.‚Äù

‚ÄúMy client wants to make sure Mr. Depp is held accountable for his conduct on set so that, in the future, others will not be put in the same situation,‚Äù Azizian told Deadline today.



Co-starring Forest Whitaker, City of Lies is set to be released on September 7, which would have been the 46th birthday of B.I.G. AKA Christopher Wallace. That date is just over two weeks after the August 15 trial on Depp‚Äôs January 2017 filed $25 million fraud lawsuit against his former business managers The Management Group is scheduled to start. Having failed to pushed the matter back, which is unusual for a plaintiff, more stories of the actor‚Äôs excessive spending and empty accounts are expected to be on display.

With a countersuit from TMG also in play as well as a countersuit from the Hollywood Vampire bandmember‚Äôs former lawyer¬†Jacob Bloom¬†and his Bloom Hergott Diemer Rosenthal LaViolette Feldman Schenkman & Goodman LLP firm over Depp‚Äôs $30 million action against the attorneys, this latest action further portrays an individual sliding out of control. An impression certainly spotlighted by ex-bodyguards¬†Eugene Arreola and Miguel Sanchez‚Äôs May filed multi-claim lawsuit over unpaid wages and working conditions ‚Äì which claimed the use of¬† ‚Äúillegal substances‚Äù by Depp and ‚Äúbeing¬†forced to protect Defendant Depp from himself and his vices while in public.‚Äù

None of which can be pleasing to the now AT&T-owned Warner Bros, which has the Depp starring¬†Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald¬†coming out in November.

There are some advantages to be a middle-aged woman with Asperger‚Äôs syndrome, and one of those is that I lived through the 80s as a teen and remember it. And what I remember is that Johnny Depp was known as a ‚Äòbad boy‚Äô with a ‚Äòtemper‚Äô and a substance abuse problem prone to attacking people.¬†



The people who defend him online, which now tragically includes a woman I had hitherto had nothing but the utmost respect, JK Rowling, seem to have either forgotten or don‚Äôt know that the accusations of domestic abuse and assault against Depp by his ex-wife Amber Heard (which include pictures and video and a restraining order against Depp and a text from his manager admitting it and documents from other court cases involving Depp) are just the latest in a line of charges.

Johnny Depp is very pretty and (like Mel Gibson) seems to be very nice when he‚Äôs sober, but he‚Äôs also prone to getting wasted and hitting people who anger him. In 1989, Depp was arrested for assaulting a hotel security guard in Canada after the guard asked a drunken Depp and his friends to leave the premises. Charges against Deep were dropped after he promised a judge to be a good boy. (This works only if you are white or rich or preferably both.)



Then, in 1994, Depp was arrested again on charges of criminal mischief¬† when he destroyed a hotel room ‚Äì allegedly because he was having a fight with his girlfriend at the time, 20 year old supermodel Kate Moss. He had to pay almost $10,000 in damages, but again he got off. Likewise, in 1999, Depp was arrested for threatening the paparazzi in London. While it is easy to sympathize with a star threatening paparazzi, it still reveals Depp‚Äôs tendency toward violence when he‚Äôs hammered and annoyed.

Incidentally, he was involved with French model Vanessa Pradis at the time, and although Pradis has defended him as a ‚Äúsensitive, loving‚Äù man who never abused her, its obvious he was still capable of attacking OTHER people during their relationship. Bill Cosby didn‚Äôt rape every woman he met ‚Ä¶ it doesn‚Äôt mean he isn‚Äôt a rapist. Moreover, court documents by Depp‚Äôs former management allege ‚Äú[Depp was being] interviewed by public authorities relating to a serious and troubling issue involving his family ‚Ä¶ [Depp] knowingly lied to public authorities in several respects in connection with these matters‚Ä¶ [His actions] marked lack of concern for certain serious family issues.‚Äù So is Pradis lying for her children?



Johnny Depp was physically abusive to Amber Heard. People accuse his ex-wife for his actions by saying she ‚Äòegged him on‚Äô so they can still enjoy the fandom fantasy of who he is. Just like his friends and fans claimed his rages and assaults in the past were ‚Äújust Johnny being Johnny,‚Äù merely the kind of ‚Äúoutbursts they have come to expect on occasion from an actor who can be as otherworldly as the character he played in Edward Scissorhands.‚Äù

Just like people blamed Mel Gibson‚Äôs ex when he hit her, or the alcohol he drank when he called a cop ‚Äúsugar-tits‚Äù. Just like people claim Mia Farrow lied so they can still watch Woody Allen movies in the pleasant denial that he raped his adopted daughter. Just like people have always blamed the victim and given the abuser a pass.



As for me, I won‚Äôt be watching the Fantastic Beasts sequel. I don‚Äôt watch the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. I don‚Äôt listen to my old Bill Cosby comedy albums or watch his videos. I don‚Äôt watch Woody Allen films, and I am hesitant to watch films with actors who have even worked with him in the last 20 years. (Oscars are so much more important than raped little girls?) I eschew any former favorites with Mel Gibson in them.

I am torn about Miramax films ‚Ä¶ which ones were the result of Harvey Weinstein‚Äôs sexual abuse? I stopped watching How I Met Your Mother, even the reruns, when they had Mike Tyson, a convicted rapist, on the show as a ‚Äògood guy‚Äô. (Which was a good move because the last season was reportedly shit.) I try my best not to collude with or support abusers and rapists.



But what to do about actors or authors whom I otherwise like when they support or collude with rapists and abusers whom they insist are actually ‚Äògood people‚Äô? Do they get a little leeway for having the same delusions about their friends and family that all human beings are capable of? I still love Rowling‚Äôs books; am I hypocritical to do so or would I be throwing the baby out with the bathwater because she defended know abuser Johnny Depp?

Denial is certainly EASIER to live with than the complexity of dealing with the fall-out of sexual and domestic violence. I can see why people prefer denial to facing uncomfortable reality.",2020-06-19T20:14:52Z,0

Secondly, box office is only part of the story, movies have a long tail and money comes in for a long time from multiple  revenue streams. Pirates for instance helps drive business to disney theme parks and sell videos games, merch, blah blah blah.
As far as your budgets, they seem a little naive. where u get them from.
i get mine from the numbers, box office mojo, deadlne. Anyway, the point im making is when ur playing the international tentpole game as a studio, particularly one inside an entertainment conglomerate like disney   spending 1 - 1.5B on a franchise is alot but not astronomical. 
If they get to buy fox they are going to spend probably a billy on the avatar movies. Oh and lets not forget alot of these movies are co-financed so the studios arent standing all the risk.",2018-11-08T23:50:38Z,0
562,UgxUQ2ytmeOHOhSbfFl4AaABAg,scamrasc,"@Jamaica Monarchy Name them. And lets start with a correction - The Dark Knight had a production budget of 180m.......VERY VERY different from your 275m figure!!!
I literally just named you 6 off the top of my head which prove you wrong.  Go ahead and name yours and lets look at what their profit margins were. Because ""10 MOST EXPENSIVE"" is not the same thing as ""10 most successful"". Flops and disappointments are exactly that because they struggle to make back their investment. Idiotic decisions get made in all walks of life, and unless you have the firmly established basically fail-safe IP of the MCU or star wars (excepting solo - their only movie to under-perform) to guarantee massive returns, a production budget that size is a *DUMB DUMB* move.....and even the MCU avoid it as much as possible!
I'll name you some more;
avatar - 237m grossed 2.7 billion. An outlier, granted - it's excessive gross was due to extremely high ticket prices for the novelty of the visual spectacle.
ant man -130  g 520
mission impossible 5 - 178m g 790m
 mi 4 - 145m g 695m
cap america civil war - b 230m (a full 100m LESS than PotC!! And that's with a much MUCH stronger IP and about 10x the cast!) g 1.1b
cinderella 2015 - 100m g 543m
fast and furious 7 - 190m g 1.5b
fast and furious 6 - 160m g 790m
WWZ - 190m (a famously troubled production given they scrapped the entire 3rd act of the movie after fully completing it and going back to write a new one from scratch - their original budget before deciding to throw a third of their finished movie away was 125) g=540m
the meg - b around 150m g 530
jurassic world - 150m g 1.6billion
JW the fallen kingdom - 160m g 1.3 billion.
suicide squad - 175m g 745m

i haven't even begun to touch on the movies which make hundrends of millions on indie budgets;
a quiet place - 17m g 340m
get out - 4.5m g 255m
crazy rich asians - 30m g 235
the nun - 22m g 365m

nor have i even touched on the excessively expensive movies which are known flops DESPITE have made hundreds of millions....precisely for the reason they had a stupid fucking budget.
I could go all day on this continuing to list examples, but I feel I've already amply proven a production budget >300m is not the norm. Adding in marketing budgets, it sets a precedence that a movie must make in excess of around 8-900m just to break even, when you can make the same movie for half the cost......",2018-11-08T16:50:57Z,0
563,UgxUQ2ytmeOHOhSbfFl4AaABAg,Jamaica Monarchy,"scamrasc the 10 most expensive movies ever were made within the last decade, they all cost 300 or more to make with the exception of the dark knight at around 275.

Amber Heard said the backlash she received after levelling allegations of domestic violence against former husband, actor¬†Johnny Depp, resulted in her being dropped from many jobs.
Share Quote
In an op-ed for the Washington Post, the 32-year-old actor revealed that she lost out on a number of roles as a result of the ‚Äúfull force of our culture‚Äôs wrath for women who speak out‚Äù.

PHOTO: POPSUGAR
‚ÄúFriends and advisers told me I would never again work as an actress ‚Äî that I would be blacklisted. A movie I was attached to recast my role. I had just shot a two-year campaign as the face of a global fashion brand, and the company dropped me. Questions arose as to whether I would be able to keep my role of Mera in the movies Justice League and¬†Aquaman,‚Äù she wrote.
‚ÄúI had the rare vantage point of seeing, in real time, how institutions protect men accused of abuse,‚Äù she added. The actor did not mention Depp in the op-ed but made an apparent reference to his stature as grand as the Titanic ship.

Earlier, Heard was granted a restraining order of 100 yards.
PHOTO: POPSUGAR
‚ÄúImagine a powerful man as a ship, like the Titanic. That ship is a huge enterprise. When it strikes an iceberg, there are a lot of people on board desperate to patch up holes ‚Äî not because they believe in or even care about the ship, but because their own fates depend on the enterprise,‚Äù she wrote.
‚ÄúI want to ensure that women who come forward to talk about violence receive more support. We can work together to demand changes to laws and rules and social norms ‚Äî and to right the imbalances that have shaped our lives,‚Äù concluded Heard.

621,UgwBWseboS2Po81VF754AaABAg,J L,"The Logical One The Logical One Let me provide you with some more facts.  The Chinese Government already has a decades-long, all-encompassing plan to become the number one power in the world that does not the involve unnecessarily spending $700 billion per year to maintain it‚Äôs power.  

Firstly, they are using their wealth to invest heavily in Africa, to build their infrastructure to control their resources.  The U.S. would rather throw nearly a trillion dollars at the F-35 jet which will be an obsolete weapon by the time it is ready for an actual war.  

This is no different than when Gen. Billy Mitchell, during the period in between WWI and WWII, was ignored with his attempts to focus on the up and comping airplane as the the new method of war.   

Secondly, China is slowly building up its military, but not enough to worry anyone.  Yes, they‚Äôve been poking their nose in neighboring islands, but clearly, they are just testing the waters.  Within the next two decades, they will slowly increase, but significantly increase their military power, in order to control their interests in all of Southeast Asia and Africa.  

Thirdly, the are taking on interest-bearing debt for the US for decades in order to control the actions of our governmental officials.  Eventually, cutting off the faucet of money will have serious effects on our livelihood.

To sum up, while the American Military was important to maintain our power across the globe, its current budget will eventually cause its downfall.  Even General Dwight D. Eisenhower railed against the military industrial complex, but we did not listen.  

Now, we are burning through money, that we can‚Äôt afford, to maintain our so-called position as the world‚Äôs police.  

Congrats Military!!!  You are why the U.S. will slink down the latter of power because of your disgustingly over-bloated budget.",2018-11-16T02:35:56Z,1

""Libtardz Suk You are wrong.  If you are overtly patriotic, you are part of the problem.  Most likely, you lack empathy and your patriotism blinds you from the flaws of your home country.""


                           ""You are wrong""... this is an opinion & bares not merit in fact. Define ""Overtly"" as you use it. There is no problem with being patriotic & if you see that there is, please make your' case. That said, I prefer, facts, not your' opinion. You clearly don't comprehend the meaning of empathy or patriotism. You make a lot of unsubstantiated assumption & that is not the actions of the well informed. What flaws is it that you're speaking of?

""I am not saying you can‚Äôt have patriotism.""


                        Well of course you're not, that would be a dumb thing to say for a variety of reasons. 


            ""I‚Äôm from the U.S. and I‚Äôm constantly supporting many of our virtues.  Examples include that our violent crime levels are at their lowest since the late 50‚Äôs.  Murder rates have decreased dramatically since the early 1990‚Äôs.  Divorce rates, abortion rates, abuse rates, both child and spousal, have been on a decline in the same time period.  That‚Äôs just a brief synopsis of the amazing strides we‚Äôve made in the last couple of decades.""



                       These are all good things, I would agree. However these topics have nothing to do with patriotism or the reason for having it. You understand that right?

           ""All that said, we still have issues.""


                     Who is it that is arguing this point? We will always have issue & there is a lot of clear facts as to why as well as a variety of reasons for it.  An ever changing society, culture differences, lack of agreement on the cause or solution & these are just only a few legitimate reason. I want even go into all the dirty political reasons.


                  ""If you are placing love of country along with it‚Äôs representative symbols above the plight of actual people, you are missing the point of what makes America great.""


                   No sir, you are missing the point & making many false assumptions. Why do you assume that patriotism means you take pride of country over plight of people. I think you are making horrible comparisons & creating a false notion. Just the same as empathy & sympathy mean two different things, pride for ones country & the care of some of its less fortune people isn't a one or the other issue. The argument could easily be made that many have pride of their country because of their care of the less fortunate. You're are almost creating an argument of such that one must choose, care for the people or the country. Do you understand how easy the argument could be made, in addition to how many people actual believe that these two are one in the same. To suggest that pride shouldn't be if problems exists is also a very obtuse point of view. Again, the argument could be made that the very pride is not only in correlation with the corrections of past problems but also in relation to future solutions.


                 A good point to make on this issue is our immigration situation. Many believe this is a huge problem facing our country & while many my disagree. One thing is true & all to often overlooked. This issue even being a problem shows that our notion of being the ""shinning city on the hill"" is true & while we have our problems, we are doing much better then all the others. As Milton Friedman put it, people vote with their feet & we wouldn't have millions from all over the globe trying to come here if we were anything less then the best. The value of being the best has multiple factors & those factors are what creates patriotism. The fact that everybody wants in because we are great, creates patriotism. There are many whom have a tremendous amount of patriotism & want to let all immigrants in because that's who we are. These are people that are patriots because the care about the plights of others.

Since that part however was due to a dropped portion at donated at her request she now must pay taxes on the 7 million dollar donation and is continuing to say he is an abuser (even saying she should have asked for twice as much money). It is no secret Depp is an alcoholic. He has been one since the loss of his friend years ago and a key reason in the first divorce. But not for abuse, but because she and the kids didn't want to see him drink himself to death.

678,UgypfGRBoXhv4S4XRcd4AaABAg,Dalton Kellebrew,@Wimpher Im unsure if Charlie Sheen has aids or not. though it wouldnt surprise me as much as he sleeps around.

680,UgypfGRBoXhv4S4XRcd4AaABAg,Dalton Kellebrew,"@Wimpher Aids is untreatable at the current time yes. There are some drugs that can help with the pain and symptoms of aids. but bo Cure. However there are medicines thats can ""Treat"" HIV. It is not so much a cure as something that kills the virus but leaves it in your body. Unable to progress or spread and further. At which point someone becomes HIV Undetectable. Which is nearly the same as being Negative. yet the Virus is still in your body. just killed off. Which is why i stress the need for regular std testing at the local clinic, Hospital or planned parenthood (I know alot of people dont like planned parenthood. But they do offer std tests. usually for free depending on ones income) Because you can catch the disease before it progresses to aids. but once it has become aida there currently is no cure available for you.

Well since you shared I'll tell you a story about aliens. When I was 16 I woke up one morning paralyzed in my bed. As I looked around my room I could see a shadowy mass getting closer. As it got closer I could feel impending dread and something pushing me back asleep. I called out to Jesus help me help me... he didn't it got closer nothing happened. So I fought as hard as I could focused shear willpower everything I had. I broke free and instantly grabbed a baseball bat I had behind my bed. Looking in the corner the shadow was still there. I honestly expected it to dissappear as a figment... but it didn't. I stood on top of my bed clenching the bat heart pounding trying to make sense of it all. I thought about going for the lightswitch but it seemed risky. Then it moved and my heart sunk the shadow expanded almost to the ceiling. Then faster than I could react it flickered stepped out and forward. I could see it now in the dim light not four feet from me monstrous staring at me with giant black eyes. It tilted it's head at me and grinned showing off its shark like maw. That was enough to snap me into reality again. So I swung the bat straight at it's head. Right as it should have impacted it didn't poof into a gas cloud like casper the ghost. The backswing shattered the closet doors behind me. Meanwhile it went right through my solid wall and window. I looked out the window the sun was just under the horizon and it was gone fog was everywhere in sight. This is just the beginning of several nightmare events some of which others were witness to. No point in denying it happened now to others or myself. Ask yourself if perhaps they just want you to believe they are more demons and angels ghosts dead relatives animals or even Jesus. All the stories from all around the world and what's the constant of each ? There isn't one but if something could appear to be anything then it doesn't matter.",2018-12-29T09:14:38Z,0

The happiest I've been was when poor, because the simplest of things actually meant something. The more I got, the less everything ment. The best drink I've ever had was a first can of coke after three years of hardship, heavily in debt and surviving on water, far outweighing a rare 1000$ bottle of wine in my better days. If I were to hit true millions, chances are great I'll fill my life with ultimately meaningless luxuries and my enjoyment of life will get blunted. However; I can hit a 'reset' button and spent a month in the gutter by choice, after which I will re-enjoy everything I've got- and everybody can do that, instead of compensating with the pipe-dream of drug happiness.

Former Pixar employee details how the company‚Äôs rampant sexism went far beyond John Lasseter



She says John Lasseter‚Äôs behavior was just one factor in an openly abusive culture

By Patricia Hernandez@xpatriciah Jun 28, 2018, 5:08pm EDT

Disney purchased Pixar in 2006 at a valuation of $7.4 billion by converting each share of Pixar stock to 2.3 shares of Disney stock, a transaction that resulted in Jobs becoming Disney's largest single shareholder at the time.		



When John Lasseter, Pixar‚Äôs former chief creative officer, left the esteemed animation studio in early June 2018, the public word on his transgressions were vague. Lasseter reportedly had ‚Äúmissteps‚Äù that made some people feel ‚Äúdisrespected and uncomfortable.‚Äù Today, a former Pixar employee has detailed how things at Pixar have been, and it‚Äôs much worse than Pixar had previously disclosed.

In a guest column for Variety, edited from a much lengthier original post on the Be Yourself vertical at Medium, graphic designer Cassandra Smolcic ‚Äî who spent her late twenties at Pixar, from 2009 to 2014 ‚Äî levels specific accusations about Lasseter and other men at the company. From the onset, she claims she was warned about the behavior Lasseter and other Pixar leaders displayed around women. It was bad enough that she says that she was banned from the weekly art meetings on the film she was assigned to because a superior told her that the COO ‚Äú‚Äòhas a hard time controlling himself‚Äô around young women.‚Äù Smolcic reportedly experienced this firsthand with Lasseter, who she says made a number of unwanted advances toward female staff.

‚ÄúHe would give me, and countless other women, lecherous up-and-down looks (or unwanted hugs and touches) almost every time we crossed his path on campus,‚Äù she writes. ‚ÄúThe entire Pixar workforce witnessed the sleazy spin that John brought to Pixar‚Äôs Halloween bash. If he found a woman attractive when she got on stage, he‚Äôd ask her to spin around while he made suggestive comments, turning the event into yet another lewd spectacle.‚Äù

‚Äú‚ÄúHE WOULD GIVE ME, AND COUNTLESS OTHER WOMEN, LECHEROUS UP-AND-DOWN LOOKS (OR UNWANTED HUGS AND TOUCHES) ALMOST EVERY TIME WE CROSSED HIS PATH ON CAMPUS.‚Äù

‚Äù

Smolcic‚Äôs descriptions of her personal experiences line up with The Hollywood Reporter‚Äôs investigation on Pixar, which stated Lasseter was well-known for ‚Äúgrabbing, kissing, [and] making comments about physical attributes.‚Äù

As the leadership at the studio violated their employees‚Äô boundaries, Smolcic says it created a feeling that such behavior was acceptable for the wider staff. She describes a culture where women were regularly groped, a company-wide meeting where a director compared his latest film to ‚Äúa big-titted blond who was difficult to nail down,‚Äù and an open environment of preferential treatment for men, who were given resources and opportunities not available to women.




‚ÄúA female lead in my department once begged her male bosses to support her with a team to complete a challenging production project,‚Äù Smolcic writes. ‚ÄúHer male superiors repeatedly ignored her requests, until the stress of the job led her into a state of psychological and physical breakdown. When she went into sabbatical to recover, her male replacement was given a team of half a dozen artists to help him complete the same task.‚Äù Similarly, she describes a performance review where she was accused of ‚Äútrying too hard,‚Äù ‚Äúasking too many questions,‚Äù and other things a male mentor said would be considered positives at Pixar, ‚Äúif you were a man.‚Äù

Smolcic says women at Pixar came together in solidarity, exchanging tips and support, but that any attempts to complain to management were ignored. ‚ÄúMany of us kept silent about these disheartening experiences, because we understood that the price for speaking out was high,‚Äù she wrote. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôd witnessed the fallout for women who questioned male leads ‚Äî who were branded ‚Äòdifficult,‚Äô had a hard time getting cast on subsequent projects, and were even laid off or demoted.‚Äù

‚Äú‚ÄúWE‚ÄôD WITNESSED THE FALLOUT FOR WOMEN WHO QUESTIONED MALE LEADS ‚Äî WHO WERE BRANDED ‚ÄòDIFFICULT,‚Äô HAD A HARD TIME GETTING CAST ON SUBSEQUENT PROJECTS, AND WERE EVEN LAID OFF OR DEMOTED.‚Äù

‚Äù

Smolcic‚Äôs longer original essay goes into far more detail about specific encounters she had at Pixar, including with an employee who grabbed and slapped her ass at an employee-run bar, and a supervisor who openly leered at her throughout her tenure, and looked her up and down, telling her ‚ÄúI‚Äôm reaallllly gonna miss the view,‚Äù when she gave notice. She also notes the negative reputations specific women in leadership positions got via the company ‚Äúwhisper network,‚Äù and contrasts those reputations with her actual experience with those leaders. Original Brave director Brenda Chapman, who was billed as Pixar‚Äôs first female director, but eventually pushed off the film in favor of a man, gets particular attention: Smolcic describes how Chapman was publicly dismissed as ‚Äúindecisive, unconfident and ineffective,‚Äù which her team fervently denies. Smolcic also addresses Rashida Jones‚Äô departure from the Toy Story 4 writing staff over inequality at Pixar, and how one co-worker dismissed Jones based on her looks and habit of showing up to work ‚Äúwith no makeup and her hair pulled back.‚Äù

Smolcic says eventually, the inequality at Pixar broke her down, and she had to leave. She also acknowledges that while Lasseter has already stepped down and Frozen director Jennifer Lee took his place, the studio must do more to undo Lasseter‚Äôs wider legacy.

‚ÄúDisney and Pixar must recognize that women and underrepresented minorities are just as capable, talented, complex, and dimensional as the white fraternity of men who have monopolized animation thus far,‚Äù she wrote. ‚ÄúFemale narratives are worthy of world-class storytellers, and women deserve to be treated as respected equals in any creative community.‚Äù

Pixar did not respond to a request for comment by The Verge.

Edit: Not gonna lie, I'm still seeing Toy Story 4 first day... And can I at least point out, without Disney, a lot of movies would just be cash grabs. Movies would go the way of games, selling out because they don't know how to draw an audience in without a big name actor or book proving the story works (or in gaming's case, loot boxes and legal gambling. Can't spell gambling without gaming, am I right?). Irony is, when disney won't do it, someone else will. Remember Tarzan? No? Remember Jungle Book? Probably. Live action is a hit or miss, but Disney mostly hits. They have blunders, but that's not ruining franchises, that's finding a footing in that franchise. Might be unrelated, but Beauty and the Beast was mocked a lot and now Mulan was revealed to not be a musical.

Johnny Depp threatens to ‚Äòburn‚Äô and ‚Äòdrown‚Äô ex-wife Amber Heard

Johnny Depp threatens to ‚Äòburn‚Äô and ‚Äòdrown‚Äô ex-wife Amber Heard



MORE FROM:

EMILY SMITH



Raging Johnny Depp texted that he would ‚Äúburn‚Äù and ‚Äúdrown‚Äù ex-wife Amber Heard, then ‚Äúf‚Äìk her burnt corpse‚Äù during their volatile relationship, a court has heard.

Previously unseen 2013 messages alleged to have been sent by the ‚ÄúPirates of the Caribbean‚Äù star, 56, to actor friend Paul Bettany were read out in London‚Äôs High Court on Wednesday.

Depp, who attended the hearing, was in the room as his texts to Bettany were read aloud.

He allegedly wrote on Nov. 6, 2013, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs burn Amber,‚Äù the court heard.

The court was told he allegedly texted Bettany again that day to say, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs drown her before we burn her!!! I will f‚Äìk her burnt corpse afterwards to make sure she is dead.‚Äù

The court also heard further texts allegedly sent by Depp to Bettany in May 2014, which read: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna properly stop the booze thing, darling‚Ä¶ Drank all night before I picked Amber up to fly to LA, this past Sunday‚Ä¶Ugly, mate.

‚ÄúNo food for days‚Ä¶powders‚Ä¶half a bottle of whiskey, a thousand red bull and vodkas, pills, 2 bottles of Champers on plane and what do you get..???

‚ÄúAn angry, aggro Injun in a f‚Äìkin‚Äô blackout, screaming obscenities and insulting any f‚Äìk who got near‚Ä¶I‚Äôm done.

‚ÄúI am admittedly too f‚Äìked in the head to spray my rage at the one I love‚Ä¶For little reason, as well I‚Äôm too old to be that guy But, pills are fine!!!‚Äù

Depp is in court in London for a preliminary hearing in his libel suit against British newspaper the Sun over an article that alleged Depp had been abusive to Heard, 33.

His lawyer David Sherborne said the case would feature ‚Äúdiametrically opposed‚Äù versions of events from Depp and Heard.

‚ÄúOne person, one side, is lying, and one is not,‚Äù Sherborne said. ‚ÄúObviously, we say that it is Ms. Heard (who is lying), Mr. Depp is 100% clear about that.‚Äù

Sherborne claimed that Heard was not a victim but the ‚Äúaggressor‚Äù in the couple‚Äôs relationship, which ended in May 2016. Depp and Heard divorced in 2017.

Depp‚Äôs lawyer Adam Waldman said, ‚ÄúWhat does the Sun do to keep Amber Heard‚Äôs hoax alive? [Wednesday] in court we learned the answer ‚Äî cherry-picking a fragment of a single frustrated text message to a friend sent out of 500 gigabytes of text and email messages provided.



‚ÄúInconveniently for the Sun, here is what Mr. Depp actually said next in his text ‚Äì that he could never harm Amber: ‚ÄòI am admittedly too f‚Äìked in the head to spray my rage at the one I love‚Äô.‚Äù

The full hearing is due to start on March 23. Depp is also suing Heard for libel in the United States.

Adam Wolanski QC, representing the Sun, told the London court the May 2014 text to Bettany appeared to refer to an alleged ‚Äúaltercation‚Äù with Heard on a plane.

Wolanski said Depp is accused of ‚Äúscreaming obscenities‚Äù on the flight as he slapped Heard in the face, kicked her in the back and threw a boot at her, before allegedly ‚Äúpassing out‚Äù in the plane toilet. Depp denies he was drunk and abusive during the flight.

The texts were revealed in court after previous lawyers for Depp had accidentally shared 70,000 messages from and to the actor with the newspaper‚Äôs legal team

‚ÄúThese texts go to the very heart of the case, they are really very important and set out the claimant‚Äôs thinking in respect of a number of different incidents and his recollection,‚Äù Wolanski said.

Page Six has learned these texts have not been shared with Heard‚Äôs legal team in the US during the discovery process for their upcoming defamation trial.

Depp is suing Heard for $50 million in Northern Virginia, claiming he was defamed in an op-ed she wrote in the Washington Post in which she called for better support for domestic violence victims like herself, but without naming Depp in the piece.

In the US libel proceedings, Heard has previously alleged ‚Äúviolent‚Äù Depp became ‚Äúthe Monster‚Äù on drugs and booze, then beat, strangled and tormented her. She stated Depp repeatedly hit her, ripped out her hair, choked and nearly suffocated her in a Virginia court filing in response to his $50 million defamation lawsuit against her. He strongly denies her claims, arguing she was the aggressor.

In the US court filings Heard stated that she began dating Depp in early 2012 and ‚Äúabout a year into our relationship, I began to witness Johnny abusing drugs and alcohol ‚Ä¶ Whenever he was using, I worried for both of us. He would become a totally different person, often delusional and violent. We called that version of Johnny, ‚Äòthe Monster.‚Äô¬†Johnny often would not remember his delusional and violent conduct after he came out of his drunk or medicated states ‚Ä¶ Because I loved Johnny, I had believed his multiple promises that he could and would get better. I was wrong.‚Äù

On a private jet from Boston to Los Angeles in May 2014, Heard‚Äôs filing of Depp states: ‚ÄúOn the flight, Johnny ordered the flight attendants to give him an oxygen tank, and drank heavily. Johnny‚Äôs handlers told me that he was upset that I was filming a movie with a romantic scene with James Franco the day before. At some point, I stood up, and Johnny kicked me in the back, causing me to fall over. Johnny threw his boot at me while I was on the ground. Johnny continued to scream obscenities until he went into the plane bathroom and passed out, locked in the bathroom for the remainder of the flight.‚Äù



Depp allegedly apologized in a later text message, writing, ‚ÄúOnce again, I find myself in a place of shame and regret. Of course, I am sorry. I really don‚Äôt know why or what happened. But I will never do it again.‚Äù

Heard alleged in court filings that just a month into their marriage, in March 2015, Depp ‚Äî who was supposed to be clean at the time, but didn‚Äôt believe taking ecstasy broke his sobriety ‚Äî went on a three-day bender on MDMA/ecstasy in Australia.

‚ÄúJohnny told me that I had not explicitly forbidden him from taking ecstasy. The argument heated up, and Johnny pushed me, slapped me, and shoved me to the ground before I retreated to a locked bedroom.‚Äù

The next morning, ‚ÄúI went downstairs to find that Johnny was still awake, and that he had stayed up all night, having taken about eight MDMA pills. He was also drinking again. We got into a fight that Johnny made physical, and I barricaded myself in one of the rooms. That didn‚Äôt stop Johnny from busting through the door of the room I was in. By nightfall, Johnny had hit me multiple times, shoved and pushed me to the ground, choked me, and spit in my face.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat night, Johnny shoved me into a ping pong table that collapsed underneath me. Johnny threw bottles through the window panels of a glass door, breaking two panes, and leaving glass everywhere. Johnny then grabbed me, gripping my body and nightgown. He tore the nightgown off, and at some point, I was naked and barefoot, covered in alcohol and glass.‚Äù





She continued, ‚ÄúIn one of the most horrific and scariest moments of this three-day ordeal, Johnny grabbed me by the neck and collarbone and slammed me against the countertop. I struggled to stand up as he strangled me, but my arms and feet kept slipping and sliding on to the spilled alcohol and were dragged against the broken glass on the countertop and floor, which repeatedly slashed my feet and arms.‚Äù

Heard states that the actor was hospitalized, and she was left with ‚Äúa busted lip, a swollen nose, and cuts all over my body ‚Ä¶ to this day, I still have scars on my arms and feet from this incident.‚Äù

However US lawyers for Depp have stated, ‚ÄúMr. Depp never abused Ms. Heard. Her allegations against him were false when they were made in 2016. They were part of an elaborate hoax to generate positive publicity for Ms. Heard and advance her career.‚Äù

A series of recordings of Heard in 2015 allegedly admitting to ‚Äúhitting‚Äù Depp were recently been released to media outlets.

In the audio, the ‚ÄúAquaman‚Äù actress is heard saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry that I didn‚Äôt, uh, uh, hit you across the face in a proper slap, but I was hitting you, it was not punching you. Babe, you‚Äôre not punched ‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know what the motion of my actual hand was, but you‚Äôre fine, I did not hurt you, I did not punch you, I was hitting you. I can‚Äôt promise you I won‚Äôt get physical again. God I f‚Äìking sometimes get so mad I lose it.‚Äù

Depp is heard saying, ‚ÄúI left last night. Honestly, I swear to you because I just couldn‚Äôt take the idea of more physicality, more physical abuse on each other ‚Ä¶ Because had we continued it, it would have gotten f‚Äìking bad. And baby, I told you this once. I‚Äôm scared to death we are a f‚Äìking crime scene right now.‚Äù

He later states, ‚ÄúIf things get physical, we have to separate. We have to be apart from one another. Whether it‚Äôs for f‚Äìking an hour or 10 hours or f‚Äìking a day. We must, there can be no physical violence towards each other. All I‚Äôm saying is we need to take whatever time we need. You need, I need, to kind of let things settle for a minute. So that we don‚Äôt f‚Äìking kill each other or f‚Äìking worse, you know, f‚Äìking really kill each other or f‚Äìking break up or whatever.‚Äù

They reconcile in the recordings and vow to work on their marriage, but soon after Heard filed for divorce after 15 months of marriage. The estranged couple eventually agreed to a $7 million divorce settlement in August 2016.

Reps for Depp didn‚Äôt immediately get back to us.",2020-05-08T22:08:49Z,0
