And  yes she should definitely be held accountable for it.",2021-06-02T06:58:58Z,1
21,UgwOZU7YxwKI6DLCNzp4AaABAg,Madidi,"True. 
I sometimes have flashes of empathy for her because of the fact that she has to live like that and is always pushing people out of her life and such, but i have to admit that most of the time i can't help but to feel such rage for her actions and it probably is because of who she has done this all to.

JD has been such a big part of my life as i've grown up so it feels somehow almost personal on a level, this anger.
And somehow perhaps the fact that kind people keep getting effed over by people like her all the time, is also a cause to feel mad at everything that has been going on with this case, how people are not seeing all the webs of lies and are not kicking her off jobs and stuff when jd was laid off so quickly and people turned on him just like that. 

So i can't bring myself to be understanding of her for any significant time, they are justglimpses and then i hear of another thing she has done or lied about and that 'rage' at the injustice returns.

And yes somehow she took the fact that jd had decided that they should write that post marriage contract of keeping their own money and properties and what not (some words are really not coming to mind right now, but maybe you'll know what i mean), as a personal offence and that's where it all began, which really speaks for the fact that she was after money from the start, that it was all she wanted of the marriage. 

It feels awful to think about but she may have never had any love for him.
Also the fact that she kept feeding him all that xanax and probably other medicine as well. It feels like if jd hadn't left he would have been d**d by now. 
Also the fact that he once said that he feared for his life and that a.turd has said that (projecting herself onto her victim) and her legal team keep mentioning that, really does speak for there having been actual life threat there. 
I'm getting the cold shivers just thinking about it and how she keeps mocking his words in this way as well.

I do hope that she gets 'punished' for everything she has done but i also do hope that some day she will be able to get the help she needs and live a normal life out of any spotlights (because she doesn't deserve to be admired that way and also because that way she herself and others will be safer, because everything she has caused should not be forgotten even if she does get better, these are no small things anymore)",2021-06-02T05:44:01Z,1
22,UgwOZU7YxwKI6DLCNzp4AaABAg,Allyana 1971,"@Madidi I agree. I think that he wanted to leave her was enough for a possible revenge. She's a narc and that's enough, nobody leaves a narcissist / psychopath ... They lose control and they can't stand it
But mainly it was about the money..Imo
She really sees herself as a victim. I am convinced of that. She is unable to reflect on her own behavior and is unable to take responsibility for her own actions, Actually, we can only feel sorry for such a person.
An empty shell with no personality of its own, But unfortunately they are also often dangerous and uncontrollable. Know no borders and destroy others",2021-06-01T21:36:37Z,1
23,UgwOZU7YxwKI6DLCNzp4AaABAg,Madidi,"Funny thing is that the only thing A.turd might've wanted revenge for was the fact that jd wanted to keep what's his in the marriage.. (unless there's something we don't know about, which i somehow doubt to be the case, though imo nothing would be bad enough to justify this level of rapid vendetta, which seems to be here)

Also the fact that a.turd has been trying to get into pirates franchise and now the harry potter franchise just says that she's so sick in the head that she believes that everything jd had belongs to her.

Like she wants to keep spouting the narrative that nobody will believe him and she is somehow better than him because he lost his roles and she will be taking over them, sorta.

Who does that, it's so sickening and twisted especially since she  k n o w s  that she was the abuser (unless she is even more effed up in the head and really believes she was the victim, as in her memories take the form of her narrative and she has no clue what happened in reality, but idk she doesn't really give that vibe tbh) and this just shows that she wants to continue that abuse as long as she possibly can, because there is no way that these things don't hurt jd. 

This is just her continuing to mentally abuse and attempting to keep controlling and manipulating jd. 

It's so effed up and so fughing devastating.
And it's so frustrating to watch from the sidelines without being able to do anything to stop it.

I just hope that jd has a strong support system in his everyday life outside of everything legal, because this has to be so heartcrushing. 

It is a person who he loved at one point that's doing this to him, after all. He must be thinking over every situation and second guessing everything they've gone through.

Sigh

I hope he has people around him to keep him from delving into his thoughts too deep.

Fortunately he seems to be very strong in himself to have survived everything he's been through in his life.

Let's all continue to support him (and those who are on the side of true justice) as that's all we can do.",2021-06-01T20:54:48Z,1
