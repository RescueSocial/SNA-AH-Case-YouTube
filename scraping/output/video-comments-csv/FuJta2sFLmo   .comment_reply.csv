AP

Facing legal action from ex-business managers ex-lawyers and ex-bodyguards plus foreclosure filings and what could be an embarrassing trial later this summer, Johnny Depp has now been hit with an assault and battery lawsuit from the location manager of the upcoming City of Lies.

The actor allegedly hit Gregg “Rocky” Brooks repeatedly on April 13, 2017 after being informed that DTLA filming on the Brad Furman helmed pic about the LAPD investigation into the 1997 murder of the Notorious B.I.G. was going to have to wrap up late that night. Hesitant to approach Depp after Furman told him to, the vet location manager went to speak instead to the on-set off duty LAPD officer about the matter. That conversation was seemingly cut short when the apparently booze on the breath Pirates of the Caribbean star supposedly start screaming obscenities at Brooks and proceeded to strike him “twice in the lower left side of his rib cage and causing pain.”

Johnny Depp Loses Bid To Delay $25M Fraud Trial On Heels Of Train Wreck Rolling Stone Profile

“Despite having just been punched in the side, PLAINTIFF maintained his composure,” says the 10-claim complaint filed in LA Superior Court on July 6 (read it here). “When PLAINTIFF did not react to DEPP’s satisfaction after being punched, DEPP yelled “I WILL GIVE YOU ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS TO PUNCH ME IN THE FACE RIGHT NOW!” PLAINTIFF still did not react and DEPP continued to scream and berate him in front of a set full of people until DEPP’s own bodyguards physically removed DEPP from the scene.”

Brooks’ filing from Glendale attorney Arbella Azizian of Baker Olson, LeCroy & Danielian seeks wide ranging but unspecified damages from Depp, Furmqn, producer Miriam Segal and the production. And it’s not just for the alleged assault but wrongful termination and retailation as well.

“0n the Monday following the incident, April 16, 2017, PLAINTIFF returned to the production office to work on wrapping out the show,” the 14-page filing adds damningly.”Upon arrival, PLAINTIFF was informed that SEGAL wanted him to write and sign a declaration stating that he would not sue the PRODUCTION. When PLAINTIFF declined to write such a statement, his services were terminated immediately.”

“My client wants to make sure Mr. Depp is held accountable for his conduct on set so that, in the future, others will not be put in the same situation,” Azizian told Deadline today.

Co-starring Forest Whitaker, City of Lies is set to be released on September 7, which would have been the 46th birthday of B.I.G. AKA Christopher Wallace. That date is just over two weeks after the August 15 trial on Depp’s January 2017 filed $25 million fraud lawsuit against his former business managers The Management Group is scheduled to start. Having failed to pushed the matter back, which is unusual for a plaintiff, more stories of the actor’s excessive spending and empty accounts are expected to be on display.

With a countersuit from TMG also in play as well as a countersuit from the Hollywood Vampire bandmember’s former lawyer Jacob Bloom and his Bloom Hergott Diemer Rosenthal LaViolette Feldman Schenkman & Goodman LLP firm over Depp’s $30 million action against the attorneys, this latest action further portrays an individual sliding out of control. An impression certainly spotlighted by ex-bodyguards Eugene Arreola and Miguel Sanchez’s May filed multi-claim lawsuit over unpaid wages and working conditions – which claimed the use of  “illegal substances” by Depp and “being forced to protect Defendant Depp from himself and his vices while in public.”

None of which can be pleasing to the now AT&T-owned Warner Bros, which has the Depp. starring Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald coming out in November.

￼Johnny Depp lived a lavish lifestyle. Reuters/Chinese Stringer Network

In January 2017, Johnny Depp filed a $25 million lawsuit accusing his former business managers of fraud and mismanagement. 

His managers countersued, claiming that the actor led an ""extravagant and extreme"" lifestyle, which included buying 14 properties and a 156-foot yacht and spending $3.6 million a year to pay his 40-person staff.

The lawsuit was settled in July. No details were released at the time, but a spokesman for Depp said in a statement that the actor was ""pleased"" with the outcome.

Take a look at some of the insane real estate that he has loved, lost, and held on to over his career.

In January 2017, Johnny Depp filed a $25 million lawsuit against his former business managers, accusing them of fraud and mismanagement that has cost him millions of dollars. 

The ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" star was then hit by a countersuit from his managers, who claimed that the actor led an ""extravagant and extreme"" lifestyle.

His business managers, Joel and Robert Mandel of The Management Group, said that Depp made $650 million in the more than a decade they worked with him. But Depp reportedly splurged this money on a lavish lifestyle that included buying 14 properties and a 156-foot yacht and spending $3.6 million a year to pay his 40-person staff, The Hollywood Reporter wrote in May 2017.

The lawsuit was settled in July, but no details were released. At the time, a spokesman for Depp said in a statement that the actor was ""pleased"" with the outcome.

Take a look at some of the insane real estate that he has loved, lost, and held on to over his career:

Johnny Depp's business managers alleged that he spent over $75 million to ""acquire, improve and furnish 14 residences,"" according to the lawsuit.


His managers persuaded him to sell some of these properties to keep up with monthly bills that totaled $2 million. One of those monthly costs was upkeep for his 150-foot luxury yacht, ""Amphitrite,"" which he reportedly spent $18 million on.


His managers claimed that Depp would not be able to afford the $350,000 monthly upkeep he had laid out for this yacht. Joel Mandel, his accountant, convinced Depp to sell the yacht, and it was reportedly bought by JK Rowling in 2016.


JK Rowling reportedly put the yacht up for sale just eight months after she bought it. It was sold in July 2017.


A promotional video gives a look inside.
 

Some of Depp's other extravagant purchases have still not been sold. He owns a 37-acre village in the south of France, which was listed with Christie's last year. A spokesperson for Christie's told Business Insider that the property was taken off the market at the end of 2017.



The property is located outside the exclusive seaside town of Saint-Tropez.



When it was last listed, the price was available only upon request. However, in the past, it has been listed for $25 million. Depp invested about $11 million into restoring its 18th-century buildings.



The estate includes the main house, six guest cottages (one of which is a converted chapel), and a restaurant. There are 15 bedrooms and 14 bathrooms in total.



It also has two pools and a painter's studio, which, according to the previous listing, is a favorite room of Depp's.



Depp also owns a three-island property in the Bahamas, which he bought for $5.35 million, according to the Hollywood Reporter.



Known as ""Little Halls Pond Cay,"" it has six different beaches.


A neighboring island, Halls Pond Cay, is currently on the market with Chestertons International for $75 million.

But his most extravagant purchase was perhaps his five penthouses, which are all in the same building in Downtown Los Angeles.



The penthouses are in the landmark Art Deco-style Eastern Columbia Building.



Depp purchased the units for around $7.2 million between 2007 and 2008.



Originally, they were listed together for $12.78 million but were sold separately, bringing in a total of $10.88 million...


The last property was sold in November 2017 for $1.4 million.



And then there are the five houses that Depp still owns on a cul-de-sac in the Hollywood Hills, which are collectively worth $19 million, according to the Hollywood Reporter. According to US Weekly, Depp had considered building a tunnel between the homes.",2020-03-27T06:52:00Z,0

The stuff I’ve seen now about her just makes me so damn angry, I mean both his former ex wifes said he was always very giving and such, how does he randomly start abusing one random woman and nobody else that noticed any signs if Depp did such things? Seems pretty dumb to me honestly, because I also didn’t seem him be that chill eating, what seemed like, stress eating maybe since it were damn cookies and giving such vague answers even though there were recordings of something explained by Johnny and she was saying sorry a lot in it. No person says sorry like that so much unless they actually did it and want to maybe act like they’re actually sorry or actually feel bad but that probably isn’t the case since she hit him after kicking in the bathroom door into Johnny’s head or something",2020-03-28T08:32:48Z,1

What a cool Guy! 

This is what surfaced after AH hired private investigators to go in and look for dirt. They apart from finding out the obvious, also switched sides...lol..I kid you not.
His real name is Christian btw..if he had a jewish name, he would never in a billion years have been forced to endure what he did.

(Yeah she is an insufferable idiot, but when it came to calling her out people were pointing out how it was laughable that JK Rowling believe Johnny over Amber when it was something they could hold over Rowling's head) But now that they get it in their minds that Johnny is a representative of men being taken advantage of he's suddenly a baby angel saint who never did anything wrong?
