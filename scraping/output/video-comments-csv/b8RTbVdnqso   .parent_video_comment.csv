It surely takes a very special kind of evil to smile as you're going through this detail of your own hurtful actions? Like - while still abhorrent - it would make sense if she was anxious and defensive, her only thoughts self preservation so as not to go to jail... but she's smiling??

Yes, the complete truth about this relationship is unknown, no one of us will ever know the absolute dynamic between the two of them. But it is clear, that Amber has some serious psychotic issues and she carried them into the relationship, right from the start, where she is extremely calculated on how to win him over, and she has very disturbingly low moral standards. Not to mention the characteristics, which really remind me of narcissistic people I‚Äôve dealt with in my life..
And no one is responsible for a narcissist‚Äôs evil behaviors, not even when reacting on their emotional and mental manipulations and abuse. It‚Äôs also one of their tactics to act really badly and push the other to their limits and when that person defends him-/herself, to act the victim or making that person out as ‚Äúmentally unstable‚Äù.",Michaela Neumann,0,2021-05-22T17:28:36Z

31,UgyARM0KSZSaK9rRzSl4AaABAg,"Ms. Heard didn't ""win"" her divorce settlement, she was entitled to the approximately seven million dollar divorce settlement, simply because California has a No-fault Divorce Law.  You take the total money earned by both parties over the course of the marriage, and divide by two.  It was the smallest amount of money that she was legally able to collect, and far less than the thirty million that she originally wanted, along with $50,000 per month support payments, and three of the five Penthouse Apartments reportedly worth thirteen million at the time (if she had signed a pre-nup, or a post-nup while Mr. Depp was still in love with her, he would have settled on a considerably larger sum, as he is known for his generosity).  I'm confused by the fifty million dollar lawsuit, *that* lawsuit is *against Amber Heard* for *Defamation*.  Ms. Heard has ""slapped back"" with a hundred-million *Defamation* suit against Mr. Depp... but she will have to prove that she was going to be paid one-hundred-million dollars for a job, or series of jobs, and that she lost the contracts because of Mr. Depp.

Mr. Depp has never been arrested or charged with domestic abuse...much less taken to court over it.  When Ms. Heard obtained a TEMPORARY restraining order, she was not required to provide evidence or to inform Mr. Depp.  These are ""emergency"" orders, that are always granted, as a precaution.  The Judge sets a hearing date (usually in about two weeks), and both sides are able to present their evidence.  When the evidence was assembled, Ms. Heard had nothing but her stories, and a painted on bruise... SHE DID NOT HAVE: a doctor's affidavit, hospital records, x-rays, prescriptions, a nurse's affidavit (although she had a personal nurse, that nurse testified that she never witnessed any injuries from domestic abuse on Ms. Heard's person), a Police Report, the statement of Police Officers, and no witnesses who would testify that they had ever seen Mr. Depp hit her.  Mr. Depp had: several doctor's affidavits, hospital records, x-rays, prescriptions, nurse's affidavits, the sworn testimony of four Police Officers (one Officer having special Domestic Abuse Training), the sworn testimony of two Security Personnel, audio recordings, CCTV footage, various witness affidavits (including from Lawyers who live in the same building, to the Concierge's of the Eastern Columbia Building), and a photograph that was to be shown to *only* the Judge and the lawyers, as Mr. Depp felt that if it became public, it would damage Ms. Heard's career.  Rather than go through the hearing (it had taken FOUR attempts to simply get Ms. Heard's deposition), all parties and their counsel met with Superior Court Judge Carl H. Moor, who allowed Ms. Heard to drop her allegations of Domestic Abuse, but Judge Moor *DISMISSED the allegations WITH PREJUDICE.*  This means that he found Ms. Heard's case to be ""egregiously flawed, and without merit"", and *Ms. Heard CAN NEVER BRING THESE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST Mr. Depp IN THE FUTURE.* So... that was the end of that.  They also signed non-disclosure agreements not to talk about the divorce, but Ms. Heard ignored them from the start.  

It is Ms. Heard's constant need to talk about the abuse that she claims, but still has no evidence to prove, that has led to Mr. Depp suing her for Defamation.  Mr. Depp is the Plaintiff in the Defamation suit, and it is concerned with Ms. Heard's op-ed in the Washington Post.  If it is proven (and the evidence disclosed by the ACLU has made it quite conclusive) that Ms. Heard was writing about Mr. Depp, she will be guilty of Defamation, and will have to pay Mr. Depp restitution.  It is absolutely known from the Court Documents that Ms. Heard did not fulfill her contract to donate her divorce settlement to charity.  The Los Angeles Children's Hospital received nothing beyond the $100,000 that Mr. Depp donated on Ms. Heard's behalf (and she attempted to get this money BACK from them), and the ACLU has been so reluctant to release the information of how much money they received from Ms. Heard that Mr. Depp's Lawyers have turned to the Supreme Court of New York to compel them to turn over the information (if she HAD donated, they would be shouting it from the rooftops, so...)

Concerning the myth of ""Mutual Abuse"", before you make ANY statement you had better do some research.  I am a narcissistic abuse survivor, and I have spent many years counselling young people who are victims of abuse.  There is no such thing as ""Mutual Domestic Abuse"".  

Domestic Abuse is about control -- *the Abuser has control* and displays the *pattern of abusive tactics.*  
*Physical Abuse accompanied by Isolation* (""I didn't punch you.  I didn't punch you, by the way...I'm sorry that I didn't...Uh, Uh...hit you across the face in a proper slap... But I was hitting you.   *Bitc,* you're not punched."",  ""that's irrelevant, that's a non sequitur, just because I've thrown pots and pans does not mean that you can not come knock at the door."",  ""I'm sorry I hit you like this, but I did not punch you. I did not f-----g deck you. I F_____G WAS HITTING YOU!"",  ""But you're fine. I did not hurt you. I did not punch you. I was hitting you."",  ""YOU ARE SUCH A BABY!  Grow the f--k up, Johnny!"",  ""I know that I can change certain things that are...hurting you...but, I know I can't blame myself entirely for going straight to the f-----g finish line the first sign of stress yesterday.""), and the isolation  (Amber Heard had all of her best friends living in Mr. Depp's Penthouse Apartments free of charge, she even admits that they had the KEYS to Mr. Depp's main dwelling, and although she has attempted to claim that he isolated her, the fact that she was always accompanied by her close friends, was NEVER without her phone, and was constantly getting tickets while out driving dispels that fallacy), 
*Name Calling* (""Your a Coward!"",  ""You're old, and fat, and no one will hire you!"",  ""You get to be lazy, you get to be cowardly"",  ""You're going to die alone!"",  ""You go f-----g jerk...GO JERK HIM OFF!"",   ""You're a terrible father"", ""You're a baby. You're a hypocrite.""), 
*and Blaming the Victim for their behavior* (""My hand is forced in this by really aggressive moves made on your team's behalf"",  ""And I don't want to hurt you. I love you."",  ""if you split, and you go into a different room, and you don't actually leave that house, it does nothing but perpetuate the fight"",  "" You can't run away every fight"",  ""You make me do it by default"", "" you're trying to justify whether you come to the door based on whether I throw pots and pans. It's irrelevant."", ""Why are you trying to justify who throws things, basically whether or not you come knocking at the door?"",  ""I'm sorry you don't want to be held accountable"",  ""That's YOUR problem, that you created"",  ""You have created that, I have no part of that, I don't know what you're f-----g latched on to in your brain, what f-----g stray hairs have comingled and tangled in your brain, to make you think you've sort of figured some sort of thing out. But this is not unusual for you, every fight, I can pretty much guarantee you will find something"",  ""Oh, it was, I lied. I see the lie.  I see the lie. You really should run with this"",  ""It's you, every single time"").

I don't have to tell the survivors of abuse that ANY of aggressive things that Ms. Heard says, if she had said to an Abuser, would have ended with her being in hospital.  Amber Heard NEVER ended up in the hospital...Johnny Depp did.  This is not a matter of physical strength, it is a matter of moral conviction.  Mr. Depp believes that there is NEVER any excuse for a man becoming physically violent with a woman.  If a man truly believes that, a woman can do just about anything to him, and the only resort he will have, will be to leave.  That is what Ms. Heard accuses Mr. Depp of constantly doing (over and over and over on the tapes).  It is a testament to the character of Mr. Depp that Ms. Heard has no evidence (especially now that the documents where she was looking to bribe a veterinarian to forge papers to allow her dogs into Australia... so we know that she isn't above bribery), Ms. Heard has alleged that she has some injuries that would still show on an x-ray, and could even be dated to when she claims the assault happened...so, why doesn't she go and obtain the evidence?

*Domestic Violence is a pattern of coercive or violent behaviors* by *one partner* to gain and maintain power and control over the other.  *Both partners cannot have power over each other.*  The Victim is the person hiding in the bathroom, the Abuser is the person beating on the door, trying to get in.  The Victim is the one who flees, the Abuser is the one who is chasing.  When a Victim attempts to push the Abuser off, or deflect their blows, that is NOT ""Mutual Abuse"", even if a man holds a woman's arms in order to stop an attack.  If the objective is simply to stop from being hurt it is not abuse, it is defense.  *Domestic Abusers* have always attempted to convince the public that ""Mutual Abuse"" is real, because *that* would absolve *them* of responsibility.",NIBS,3,2021-05-21T18:27:10Z

When I divorced my first husband, we didn't even have a domestic violence petition, when you filed there was equal custody and visitation between both during a divorce.  Abusers used this to their benefit, the one partner would drop the kids off for visitation, then the abuser would run off with the kids or refuse to allow them to go back home and there wasn't anything could be done until you went to the first hearing. I was part of the movement to get the domestic violence petition to begin with.  This case has had me furious.  I remember how hard it was for me to be believed in a court of law, I had to document bruises, document incidents, usually abuse happens in private so there's that.  I supported the #metoo movement, then for her own selfish gain, to game the system, she comes forward with this crap.  Not only was she not abused, but she was the abuser, the same game my ex husband tried to pull.  Ill never watch another show with her in it. I think she should be blacklisted.

It's apparent that she was the aggressor in the physical abuse on Johnny, not the other way around.  The tapes have her gaslighting him after she attacked him, trying to convince him it didn't really happen the way he thought it did. But taking a dump on his bed, which is a display of contempt and a mental problem, seems so twisted it would take a team of Psychiatrists to deal with just that one disgusting act alone.  He deserves the truth to come out, all of his jobs back and she needs to give an 'actual' heartfelt apology to Johnny, all his family, friends, first, then his employers and fans. The ones for his employers should be in writing, since SHE was the cause of his losing work in the first place, depriving his fans of great movies.

52,UgzANvnKtwgLyPz6FKh4AaABAg,"Just my opinion... I didn't really care for the funeral music in the video.
 I think Amber should be fired from all her roles. She knew and knows exactly what she was and is doing.  Domestic Violence is not something to play around with. It is a very serious allegation. There are WOMEN & MEN who really do go through this and is scared of saying anything to anyone due to them not being believed.  And because of this woman's lies it makes it so much harder for people to out and speak because now their gonna have people saying.... Is this and Amber and Johnny situation.. 
 Its disgusting for her to use this as leverage against Johnny and then to find out she was the who was doing the abuse the whole time shows how much of an abuser she is.
 That is what the abuser does. They throw the punches and then blame the abused to keep them under control. This is wrong on so many levels. 
 And then for her to take her friend ( or maids) story of sexual abuse and spin it to make it her own is a whole new level of What the F*ck??? There is so much wrong with Amber Heard. She should not have any type of platform to speak at and spew all of her lies. 
 She has neighbors and penthouse employees speaking out against her lies. 
 That should be enough for her to lose everything she earned while she was with Johnny. Another 1 of my opinions is she only married Johnny because she knew how big he was and she would get somewhere using his coat tail. Its funny when the followers of Johnny started pointing out the flaws in her story. Now all she needs is to lose her roles like she did to Johnny. 
 I could go on and on and on but I don't have enough time to talk about everything this lady has done wrong. 
 I also want to point out. I am all for women to have powerful voices. (I am a woman myself) but when your voice is saying nothing but lies and there is actual proof out there that shows your a lier then you should use that voice to apologize and make right what you did wrong. 
 I see Amber never doing this and that is why she should lose her platform. This woman is not a Domestic Abuse survivor.  No one will change my mind on this. 
 I am a DV survivor myself. I know how that feel and what it looks like and Johnny was the abused.

It's like they are aware that there's no real proof against him but still refuse to admit they were wrong",areeana chowdhury,58,2021-05-21T13:12:56Z
