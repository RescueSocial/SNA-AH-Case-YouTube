1,UgwMZiWEeR10Lw03Fwt4AaABAg,Amber Heard can't be fired from Aquaman 2. She is perfect for Mera. If she fired from Aquaman 2 WB better fired Ezra Miller from The Flash movie,MR AC,1,2021-03-03T21:49:53Z

8,UgzIM7wPICSTfL1683B4AaABAg,Just because Heard's reps and managers say she isn't fired doesn't mean she isn't fired. Heard is probably doing this to cause confusion in the media pretending she's in Aquaman 2.,Electric Fire,0,2021-03-02T20:42:01Z
9,Ugw1S4OXBjpuP1-vo694AaABAg,I think Amber is hot but she's also not liked by most so if they think they can lose her without backlash they certainly will. I think fans would love Clark in the role for a reunion of sorts. Either way they go it probably impacts the box office very little.,Darth Storm,0,2021-03-02T19:05:32Z

29,UgwTSWclIyH-ooVYfD54AaABAg,"Emilia Clarke is the worst casting. The recasting these days is so far different to the original it's hard to watch...  Again another casting just based on being fanboys/girls or a big name. Oh doesn't matter who plays Reed Richards just get Dwayne The Rock. .  They don't value casting anymore... She does not resemble Amber Heard and to me I can't invest in her. It's an ongoing thing that's really put me off some movies. Maybe the reason why Hollywood is not a strong as it used to be....You tell me how Don Cheadle looks anything like Terrence Howard. 
I've tried but Terminator Genisys and Sin city 2 was the last straw. Who can we get to replace Clive Owen? Oh that guy Josh Brolin he's a spitting image... No he's not lol. I'm not asking for them to be twins but just a resemblance... How they can they get casting that doesn't resemble the originals is beyond me and it says to me that they just don't care...",Jamie Banner,0,2021-03-01T22:45:21Z

34,Ugxf1SwXG_9Bf2Su6Rp4AaABAg,When have WB ever made anything easy or the right decision for anyone.  So until I hear it from official WB or official trade like variety I will assume Amber Heard is still Mera and Ezra Miller is still the Flash and that is 2 more great reasons why I am not going to see any of there movies or get HBOMAX; glad nothing on that looks that good  to me worth the price at most get it for 1 month next year,Joshua Flask,0,2021-03-01T21:47:15Z

You're basically reporting contradictory gossip from a bunch of guys who could be literally anybody or nobody, or (most likely) just a bunch of nerds on the internet who know nothing but have opinions on everything.

48,UgwZZU1ByFjQZjkrUiV4AaABAg,It‚Äôs a business thing.  She appears in Zack Snyder‚Äôs Justice League. They won‚Äôt confirm or comment until after it‚Äôs released. They‚Äôve put a chunk of money behind the HBO Max release so my guess is that they‚Äôll save that as well as rebooting Superman until after it‚Äôs had it‚Äôs premiere.
