I know from a direct source that had a direct contact with her once in a plane that she was horrible and really arrogant and full of herself and didnt give a shit about ordinary people. She thought of herself to be something of a celebrity and she demanded she has the front seat in a plane, which is usually reserved for staff or sick people and there were sick people in that plane and she didn t care about them. She acted like she owned the plane and had no charity in her at that time. A fake. They only do some tricks for media publicty stunts and propaganda. And Michael Jackson when he came to Romania to a concert in 1992, he visited some orphanages first and he sat there and sang with the children, which is admirable but cringe. There was no need to visit them in their misery and pain and act like he made a difference.

The comment was actually about someone I know who reminds me of Jonny Depp and was really devoured by a Filipino, actually, he could even have started the COVID19(That is a joke, she just keeps her home like a pigsty), I wish I could rescue him from the depths of darkness (Maybe someday) :) But hay if the example applies then you two are closer than I thought :)...Now, who are you really?? In the unlikely event, it is Johnny Depp, hey, the drunken sailor comment was for the sparrow character, not you :)",2021-08-18T08:32:04Z,0

301,Ugxc1qCYiRXbJSzyFxx4AaABAg,Gre Bell,"Exactly. I'm shocked by the amount of people calling this woman names and saying she is an abuser. Wtf? Have you ever dated or married an alcoholic man? No? Then you have no idea what you are talking about. The fact that she is smiling all the time only shows that she is the one stepping on eggshells constantly around him. Alcoholic men have A LOT of anger within and they treat their girlfriends/wives terribly. He is drunk here. She tried to make a video at home when he was drunk once and having a rage (typical with these drunks). He caught the camera and broke the phone (I think on her face). Reading this comment section made really sad of how sexist the society is. Everything I see is a disturbed, drunk and probably drug addicted man, whose ego and anger issues spill on this gorgeous woman that he abused and tried to break her spirit. I know this type of guy well enough unfortunately. And those who have never lived through this type of relationship (alcoholic angry man) can't understand. For years I also walked around in events or family gatherings with a smile on my face while inside I was screaming for help from all the abuse my alcoholic husband was doing to me. She is trying to maintain the appearances while you can see he can't control himself. He is the one that looked at her with anger from the beginning of this video.

My point is, men should do whatever they want and most men don’t want to live alone forever. Most people. Being single isn’t freedom; being in control of all aspects of your life is freedom.

I am so sorry that you suffered abuse from someone you loved and trusted. It does not matter what gender.  Unfortunately, either gender can be abusive.

He seriously looks like he's uncomfortable standing next her and terrufjed of saying the tiniest thing to set her off. Yes, he's slurring his speech and unsteady...typical if you're drunk or high. But his obvious unease around her compared to the interviewer or anyone else is all to common among victims, whether they're sober or not. I'm not a huge fan of either actor. I really liked JD in his earlier years when I was really into cekebrities. But I don't follow celebrities as juch as I used to. So, my opinion on their case is not based so much on how I feel about either of them as a fan.  I just keep getting videos about them on my feed and get curious. So I watch the videos out of curiosity. From what I can gather from following them, this is seriously a case of the abuser playing victim. And since the abuser is a woman, she thinks she will get away with doing whatever she wants to him. It's sickening. I really do hope she is held fully accountible for her actions before she does anymore damage to him or others. I hooe too that he gets as far away from her as possible and is able to get help for his drug and alchol addiction and starts to truly heal from the abuse. 0",2021-02-10T16:11:03Z,0

1060,UgyB3Wwk0jaV2PoB6UJ4AaABAg,Gregory Sagegreene,"Yes, I think the classic societal form is of a man physically abusing a woman. And that is what the recent 'woke' mania uses to amplify this meme for that entire sex, drive men down, and split a wedge between the genders.

Yet there are tons of cases where, at the very minimum a woman manipulates a man through emotional abuse and mental torture - just because he is a devoted provider and pedestal worshipping doter. 

I myself, as a man, endured this
from a siren muse.

Not to say it's everyone's experience, but in my case particularly I pose the question: -

... 🎶""Who murdered 'Love'?
           - Not Me! ...

1134,UgwabhkFs-xSXHCZnWJ4AaABAg,Effy Wdnezday,"@TheMeaningOfWHY? My research does not include articles. It includes 8chan, deep web, reading a lot of wikileaks, independent research and digging for sites not biased (most are biased and controlled), going into a deep a*s rabbit hole, reading a 400 page BOOK on alchemy and the cabal. Watching documentaries which keep being censored, deleted, lost etc. Finding out Alex Jones is fake and it broke my heart lol. Commenting heavily on apps (insta, fb, yt, twitter etc.) only to be censored and deleted. Also being interviewed and recorded in real life by a news station during a protest which then censored, deleted, manipulated everything I said. Nationaly humiliated because they deleted the parts where I started spitting truth about Assange, wikileaks, our president Vucic working with the Clintons, George Soros etc. When I started that topic, the reporters RAN away because they didn't expect anyone knowing that much in our very uneducated, uninformed country where press and media freedom does not exist, and real reporters are killed and executed by high ranking officials. You can't make this sh*t up. Once they degraded me and censored me NATIONALY, that was when I knew, everything I have researched was TRUE, I may have been manipulated, but at least I knew it was finally official. But I still have no voice nor freedom of speech, especially in my country. My friend was in jail for an insta comment. No freedom of speech and if you dare to speak up you will be locked up or killed. Few people in my country know the truth, I know Americans are def waking up, there are protests all over Europe but media didn't say a thing about that as well. The WORLD is waking up and it's hella beautiful :') I loved Johnny, I was his biggest fan for a while, I also adored Jim Carrey and many others, but when I found out what I know now, everything changed.

The court ruled there was substantial proof to suggest the newspaper's - the fucking horrible Sun, which is garbage, and I was kinda rooting for Depp here - labelling of Depp to be a wife beater were true. Also, your response is probably the most intelligent one I've had on here. Kudos. That being said, it was only the tabloid case here in the UK. The case in Hollywood is yet to carry on, BUT it is not looking good for Johnny. I said from the start he should have stayed away from her. She is trouble.

Including here, he's drunk and high out of his mind. Quite likely she was simply concerned about him humiliating himself here; but of course since the title and description sets the context by which people view it, their perception is skewed.

He and the people he knows have literally said otherwise. They say he's shy, soft-spoken, jittery, and introverted. Tim Burton, his long time friend, said interviews make him very nervous, and Depp himself said during a Pirates of the Caribbean interview, ""I don't really take acting seriously, but I do enjoy being in character because -- as a shy person -- I feel more comfortable to hide behind a different identity."" He's so shy, in fact, he's almost always wearing sunglasses because he has trouble looking people in the eye. He also suffers from depression.",2020-08-30T08:00:51Z,0

I didn’t want to believe anything but I know how drugs and alcohol can affect ppl and since it it isn’t remembered it isn’t real. He just so so so many other cases of him assaulting people, destroying property (he was fined 10k during an argument with Kate Moss for trashing a hotel as he screamed at her while she was 10 years his junior and even younger than Winona) and several other charges as well. One thing all day police records had in common was the use of mind altering substances which means they may actually make him violent.

First she said to their manager that it was just a ""harmless prank"", but to their servant, she said there was no poop on their bed and accused her of lying to destroy their marriage. When she became aware that there are photographs of the poop, she accused her tiny little yorkshire dog. Explain to me, how that tiny dog produced a shit of this huge size?

Johnny was not there in the house when ""poop"" incident occurred, he got the news from his servant. And for the finger incident, do you know how may times amber changed the story of how his finger was served? First she said, it was served when johnny punched the wall, during her 2016 depo. Then said it was happened by striking a plastic phone against the wall. In her witness paper, she said she don't know how exactly, she was sleeping at that time. In the court, she again changed her story, a bakelite phone was responsible for the finger incident (because johnny's team presented crime scene photo in which plastic phone was intact) Tell me why she's changing her story again and again? I weren't there when it was happened, but i have read all court documents including his and her sides. Her story is always changing when johnny's team presented new evidences. Why it is changing again and again if she said was true? I'm sorry for what happened to you but that does not have to happen in this case.

Day 1-2 till today all she did was bitch and criticize and drive me out of my mind. I will never stay with her again. I wish I had $$ for a hotel room. I sincerely do.

She drove me nuts with her constant-and I do mean constant- bitching and bossing of the wilted veggies I brought over. She entertained herself by looking down her nose at it all. She bitched at me about me washing my hands, opening a door, wanting quiet at 12: 00 am midnight so I could sleep. She bitched at me about cooking, washing dishes, blinking a lash, where the cat went- Hello, a cat is fucking curious. That's normal. In fact, it was a fight to bring my cat over. I was supposed to act like Penny never existed. Aint' gonna fucking happen. We bitched and warred all week. Then she tried the bribes, gifts and guilt trips. Nope. Not having it. She bitched about Penny getting up on furniture- never mind that Penny is a cat and in a new home and therefore bound to be curious- but no, that's a crime. She bitched about cat hair being all over the house. She bitched at me about or rather forced me to eat the meals she prepared. She bitched at me about touching her food, touching anything in the garden, touching the raspberries, using her food, every little thing had to be done with her say about it.

And my bro? OH HE GOT AWAY WITH FUCKING MURDER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Finally I threatened to call the cops. I hoped that would shut her the fuck up. I brought her flowers, all my food, helped with the raspberries, tried to be my authentic self but oh that's a crime. She bitched about the cat getting on top of the fridge- but nothing was knocked over because cats ain't stupid like her. Meanwhile, Jesse- my brother- slammed doors at midnight, smoked his cigs and I had to breathe it in, talked as loudly as he fucking wanted. She lets her extremely muscled son hit me. Then denies it ever happened. To this day. 

I am home. I am never fucking staying there again. I would be crazy to. Oh yeah this is why the fuck I live on my own. Yeah no shit.",2020-08-06T01:43:15Z,2

Even his daughter's text suggested he was a shitty person/father up until he met Amber.

1501,UgzSz3HcR0a945T-A1d4AaABAg,Customer Service,"@Anna P. I posted my comment before expanding to see yours.  Agree 100%  I have seen so many women victims claiming the same thing.  They want to believe him and they sympathize with hi, but the fact is they are sympathizing with their own abuser and projecting that onto Johnny.  I admit that growing up I thought he was attractive and that continued into my adult life but once I was mature enough to see the character (or lack of) behind the man, I began to find him utterly repulsive.  It's not sexy to have such a poor self image that you have to drown your sorrows with drugs and alcohol..... it's cowardly.... just like hitting your wife when you aren't able to control her.  He obviously didn't want her working, and he thought he could persuade her, like he did with Vanessa, to give up her career and leave the spotlight to him.  When that failed and she kept going to rehearsals, he started acting out with his drinking and drugging so that she had no choice but to focus her full attention on him.  He used his addictions as a way to control her and make her feel guilty, as if she was making him drink (he was constantly gaslighting her and telling her it was her fault). This whole situation makes me sick.  She's being lambasted for handling a really ugly situation to the best of her ability and now she's being blamed for not having the experience (at 27!!) to know what to do.  IMO she was 100x stronger than the majority of women would be in that situation and for that she's being viciously attacked and held culpable for his lack of personal responsibility.  It's insane & reading the comments where everyone wants to hug the abuser, is literally making me feel ill.  Fortunately, I think the judge has no choice but to find in favor of the Sun due to the evidence presented to the court.  If that happens I think it will be justification for all women who have had men retaliate against them with vicious lies.",2020-08-01T06:22:02Z,0

Especially after hearing Waldman suggest that they needed to show she was a ""Gone Girl"" in order to win the case.  If you're not familiar with the movie, watch it.  It's clear they are trying to set her up to turn the tables.  The guy makes $30M a movie and was obviously ready to fire any of his employees who didn't jump whenever he asked.  His attorney coerced testimony out of those that he couldn't bribe with other incentives and promotions (his former personal assistant is now the president of one of his production companies).  There's just so much that stinks about his evidence, that I wouldn't doubt if he shit in his own bed just to try to pin in on her.  *The housekeeper said 1) it was fresh 'human' shit and 2) Amber hadn't been there for over 25 hours. All his witnesses lack credibility and many of their statements were contradicted by their own text communications.

I even grew up in a household where DV was a regular occurrence.  Don't judge a book by it's cover.  Things are not always what they appear on the surface.  Why would his attorney Adam Waldman suggest they had to make her appear like ""Gone Girl"" if their intention wasn't to frame her?

I simply commented that Johnny has deep issues that need fixing.  I never ever said I'm totally against drugs.  Do you know what an ADDICT is??? That's who I am talking about.  Johnny is an addict.  I can't tell you cuz I didn't birth the guy, but anyone who has addictive personality and self destruct has issues that substances subdue.  Stop pretending drugs and alcohol are the cure. Furthermore, you twisted my original comment. Which is, Amber didn't cause Johnny's addictions.  He had these addictions already.  Amber was just a toxic part of it that made it that much worse.   In this video, he is under the influence, and as I said, anyone who feels they NEED (as opposed to recreational use) a substance to live life is dis-eased.  Plain and simple.",2020-07-31T20:05:15Z,0

Mix that with the ego, entitlement and privilege of being a celebrity and you have tremendous toxicity. 
 Amber, who makes her living with her looks and is under 100 pounds, was supposedly abusing him, a man heavier and taller than her; a man who has been trained and doing choreographed fight scenes with men bigger than him for years.

With no smoking gun, it’s just AH’s word against Depp’s.   Lots of people will have a horse in the race.

I respect your view point.

It Maybe an opinion of mine  - maybe a gut feeling ? 
Altho Ive tried to be on the fence with it all - 
but having Followed the case so far- 

i just don’t buy into the majority of AH claims so far - in fact barely anyone does. 
There are too many arguments/facts to prove they aren’t accurate. 

Yes they may have argued/thrown things etc. What couples haven’t in the past? 
But from how it’s coming across is that amber is accusing depp of what she had physically done to him. 

However none of her stories are adding up- and she’s not coming across well at all- with her actions not only to depp but to others.

She is appearing to be the manipulative abuser-  both mental and physical in the relationship.
Which unfortunately is still taboo  these days. 

There are many witnesses coming forward to prove against her claims. 

But at the end of the day this case - Depp is attempting to sue the sun newspaper for libel. 
That’s the whole aim of this  case and to clear his name of sorts.

Overall I honestly don’t believe Depp would have chose such a public trial - airing out all this dirty laundrey- if he was guilty. 
He’s a smart guy- 
yes he maybe troubled- particular with substance abuse etc- but I just don’t think he would go through with it all otherwise 🤔",2020-07-18T01:00:23Z,0

I didn’t create this video - so I’m not alone to think this. 
From the facts coming out- it  seems she was quite manipulative and attention demanding . 
And just this footage of them together - it seems very clear in hindsight- that she isn’t a victimised person. That she made out to be.

The jury found the boys guilty, but, due to the help of Depp, and a few other pedohile buddies, they pulled some strings and the media and public allowed a retrial. Depp has a matching tattoo with the Echols boy. He also considered Hunter S. Thompson like family and was one of his role models and closet friends. Yes, the same Hunter S Thompson who got caught up and accused of partaking in snuff films. Let's touch on River Phoenix's death. Johnny Depp owned a club called the viper room, on sunset boulevard. Rivers died from drinking out of a styrofoam cup that he thought contained speed. It actually contained 8x the lethal dose of speed. Eye witness report johnny Depp and John frusciante hanging at the club together, with frusciante ordering rivers the drink. Rivers desperately sought for help, but died outside the entrance to the club. Depp never called the police, and to avoid any police questioning, he left the country that night. Come on Gambit, stop painting these celebs as these christ like figures. They are not. They are no better than you and me. These people are sick. Tim Burton, Winona Ryder, Hunter s. Thompson, marilyn manson etc. They are all his friends and they are all sickos. Once again, Depp is a greedy, narcissist, who should be in jail for his behavior.

2003,Ugw57nrYQM9Xpodm_Dl4AaABAg,Customer Service,"@卩丨尺卂ㄒ卂  The tapes were edited by Johnny's lawyers with parts of the conversation moved to make her sound guilty.  The edits are audible, but most of the pro-Depp sites used narration to hide the edits.  

She wasn't mocking him, she was calling his bluff when he told her he was going to accuse her of domestic violence IF SHE WENT PUBLIC.  If I told you I was going to accuse you of murdering my grandmother, wouldn't you respond with ""What? Well, no one will believe you!"" <<< (an example of critical thinking skills).

She didn't complain he left the room when she got violent.  For fucks sake, did you even actually listen to the tapes???  She claimed he ran out whenever they had a FIGHT.  A fight is an argument or a disagreement, and the word FIGHT is commonly used in their place.  Of course, a halfwit probably wouldn't have considered that... did you? 

His bodyguards lied.  They've committed multiple felonies on his behalf, regularly benefit from him paying for their supply of cocaine and clearly aren't very concerned over perjuring themselves either... have you considered that???

Well, if you actually did any research on DV, you'd know that it occurs much more frequently in relationships that involve a much younger woman married to an older man, so yes, it actually stands to reason that a male abuser wouldn't have prior incidents of domestic violence.  If you also understood that DV is just one form of domestic abuse and is usually preceded by other forms of abuse such as verbal and mental abuse, then you'd understand that it can take years or even decades to progress to the level of them assaulting their partner.  If you understood how few incidents of DV women actually report & that the majority never seek medical attention or file a police report, then you'd understand that it's very possible that Johnny has assaulted other women who just don't want to come forward after seeing the backlash that Amber has received.  No, not all of his former partners came to his defense, in fact, most have been silent.  Ellen Barkin stated he was violent & threw bottles at an assistant on the set of Fear & Loathing.  In the past, Winona was quoted as saying that she broke off her engagement to Johnny bc he was ""moody & extremely jealous"".  Following their breakup, Vanessa stated that she resented Johnny for having forced her to give up her career.  So, clearly they weren't completely forthcoming in their witness statements.",2020-12-05T20:50:47Z,0

2185,Ugy-24nNYt5X_mFMngF4AaABAg,voracious viewer,"@Some form of username I agree that this is a toxic relationship but I don't agree that this is what this clip demonstrates. I have not made any statements regarding your intellect or demand you do more research as you have suggested of me. And I really am not concerned with changing the opinion of anyone in this specific instance, there is more than enough objective evidence to support the predatory, abusive, vampiric nature of this relationship.

My concern and point of intended conveyance is that if you present a piece of evidence in court that is so subjectively interpreted you leave your entire case open to discrediting. A lawyer would only need to present several baseline physiological examples of Johnny's sober behavior on film as compared with the pupil dilation, maxillary tension and pallor demonstrated here, to invalidate the video with cause. While the niave, well-intentioned, little empaths of the internet see life in stark contrasts and triumphantly categorize this in the abuse column, your beleaguered elders with slightly more worn soles, have capacity for empathetic understanding in their ability to see the many human shades of gray between the tones. And if we have any experience with abuse ourselves studies show we are  8x more likely to have had a few illicit chemical encounters as well. You can present 6 weeks of valid argument but if you have one detail in there that can be disproven that's all the other side needs. They'll  spend the rest of their time rolling that morsel around in their mouth and seasoning every statement with its breath. Starve your opponent. Whether its Amber or not.",2020-07-10T17:49:05Z,0

2341,UgwbdgiQUDI_gUr4Sfd4AaABAg,Fernanda Godo,"@Margarita Diamond Hello Margarita!! hope you are having a great day! The thing is, we have confessions of her saying that she started the fights, she hot him and so many horrible things...and some things in these crazy puzzle does not add up, like for example, and this is what bugs me the most...in Australia she took so many pictures of the now called ""3 days hostage"", and if she was telling the truth, s she stated, "" I was covered in blood, glass and alcohol, she would be really really full of awful injuries and doctors would run with her to the hospital...and these picture would be a win for her, making everything she said more valid and trustworthy...but...nothing, I think that they relationship was far from health for both of them but we can see she was the Alpha on this relationship and the real evidences, not a she said he said but the prone calls, makes him trustworthy, and sure, there are some things she said that were true but I do not believe she suffered any abuse, but caused many, not only to Johnny as we can see now..."" and I do not believe that they both payed people, I know this case are like unreal and crazy but not to this point. Buts I truly respect you and your opinions, I am just saying what I believe that makes sense, but not trying to impose my view of the case, in case that it looks like this, you are so polite and never rude and it is nice to talk to someone like you, we can disagree and keep the respect for each other""Have a great weekend Margarita and Sofia!!",2020-08-08T16:33:22Z,0
2342,UgwbdgiQUDI_gUr4Sfd4AaABAg,Sofía,"@Margarita Diamond you know what? You're right. I don't have any proof more than those given by thr media, so yes, I don't know anything about them and I also believe that they abused each other now. Thanks for your question, now I know that just by seeing something in the media, that doesn't mean that's the absolute true, the only ones who know that ,are the ones involved in the process.",2020-08-08T07:44:07Z,0
2343,UgwbdgiQUDI_gUr4Sfd4AaABAg,Fernanda Godo,"@Sofía Hi Sofia, first of all, thank you so so much for being polite and kind, I really appreciate it :) I understand what you mean and agree that this video proves nothing about the case...I think she is uncomfortable, but this is my opinion, I would never claim that is a fact, or believe and agree with all I say, also, he is kind of corky, but I still see that there is more than that, in his eyes I see pain...again, only my opinion. But I got so interested in this case, that I am watching both sides, everything, because it just start to feel unreal, and listening to the records....those are facts, she admitted many things and all the proofs she told him she had, are nothing but what she and few people said, but not a single one saw Depp beating her....I never hated AH because I never knew about her until her lies started to be confronted with facts, real material....and I still have no hate for her, I think that what she is doing is really evil, but she needs help, she really needs help...she is destroying a mans life so so much, keep coming with new ""stories"", the video of her on the court, eating, laughing with satisfaction and rolling her eyes, tells me everything I need to believe that his addictions issues are not relevant and prove nothing...is just hurtful and demeaning to use this against a claim that has nothing to do with his personal issues, and I Stand by Johnny and still believe he never beat her, never caused her any harm...But I really appreciate you answer, i agree with many things you are pointing out, again thank you for being polite and kind!",2020-08-07T14:56:23Z,1
2344,UgwbdgiQUDI_gUr4Sfd4AaABAg,Sofía,"@Fernanda Godo I think that the problem here is that many people are saying that is so evident in this video that he's afraid and harassed by Amber, but probably many people are just biased for the love they have for Depp and the hate to Heard, but we really don't know anything about their lives apart from what the media is giving us, also this is not the first video in which Depp behaves kind of clumsy and drunk, there are so many other and he doesn't behave differently from what we get to see here. I know Heard lied so many times , but trying to use these videos to ""see things"" happening before is just people absolutely biased I think.",2020-08-07T14:33:21Z,1

I don’t think there’s a reason to pretend he wasn’t, he has the right to have a good time whenever he feels like it, or to cope with his problems by abusing alcohol/drugs. it does not make him any less of a human and therefore does not affect the fact that he was a victim of domestic violence and slander. he’s an extraordinary actor, an extraordinary human being who lead an extraordinary life. he didn’t get to live an average life like most of us did and his substance abuse is no surprise. I do not support substance abuse, but I would never judge him for doing what he’s doing as long as he’s not harming anyone around him, because none of us know what it’s like to be the legendary Johnny Depp.",2020-05-13T00:14:56Z,1

I promise you watch any other interview before 2015 and even after 2016, you find him doing the same exact thing. he was just highly depressed and drained of life while married to her that he looked like he was drunk or on drugs but even in the sworn statement amber heard gave, she claims that in 2015 she was “stopping” him from getting drunk and/or intoxicated",2020-05-09T23:37:32Z,3
