That equates to a loss of 24,000,000 dollars minimum loss to a 40,000,000 dollar maximum loss. That is just the people hat signed.

First off, children (and that's what teenagers are) cannot boycott anything successfully. It's adults that spend the big money. Whether you want to call it boycotting, striking, protesting, ect their all ways to correct wrongs by the masses. That's  where good pay benefits, raises and more came from! I'm a union worker and what you just said is one of the stupidest statements I've heard in a long time. There are 1.6 million people that have pledged to boycott this film if Heards in it. And we will. So put that in your pipe and smoke it! Children! Stop talking about things you can't possibly understand.",2021-06-21T14:58:02Z,9

21,UgxXa27UbvbXV4YBPyx4AaABAg,Leeanne MAY,@jsjk I fully agree! It's a traumatic experience trust me! What I meant was AH ruined it for real woman who are being abused and top scared to come forward and she made it harder that way. No JD I think he will run after seeing a Red flag. 1% of the world are actual narrassists and she's definitely 1. And most professionals say not to even play their games back just walk away. I'm glad Depp had the balls to admit he was the that's the real victim and most men would never admit and he's got way more money than her and when he wins as I don't think it's about the money but being exonerated from being a AB and show how much of a true monster she is as she doesn't have 50 million to pay him anyways.... even the richest man in America Elon musk noticed the crazy side,2021-06-24T23:15:25Z,1
22,UgxXa27UbvbXV4YBPyx4AaABAg,jsjk,Not just that. She also makes man that are especially in a good standing in their life put a wall up for women. For example I doubt Depp will ever think of dating and relationships like he used too again. It's not just sad for whoever good woman that is actually interested in Depp but also extremely sad for Depp himself seeing how he might force himself to stick to loneliness and block out anyone that would actually genuinly love him. This man might be broken for life with the kind of trauma and damage this woman caused in his life.,2021-06-24T18:21:55Z,2

35,Ugw2X0s8mi8nYW2Nu614AaABAg,Toan.,"@BabbyFace Revocation They made so many bad decisons and went their way to change the view of the director, shaped it, changed the characters entirely to make the movie not R-rated to get some cash and not caring about the characters themselves. DC has so much potential and could have rivaled Marvel. They keep rebooting, what i love about Marvel is the consistency of it (except for rhodey and banner in the earlier movies tho still good)",2021-06-22T02:24:21Z,1
