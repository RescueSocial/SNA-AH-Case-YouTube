And if in his retort I can't even understand what he's saying other than having a tantrum because I called him out on being an ass then how can a conversation happen at all?

106,UgyYZd0NedDex9iKxcl4AaABAg,Dijon Volner,If these huge movie companies had any sense - this would be the most perfect time to put Depp into their films. Sales would be off the rhictascale!!!  Ghost rider excites me. Do it JD !!! üôåüôå,2020-08-29T04:22:57Z,4
107,UgyYZd0NedDex9iKxcl4AaABAg,Devon May,"Yeah, I felt the exact same. 

I don't think RDJ could in good conscience turn his back on Johnny. He knows what it's like to be cancelled by Hollywood and how his career was turned around by the MCU giving him a chance.

So it makes sense he try and do the same thing for Johnny. 

Plus they've been good friends for years, so he wouldn't believe AH's allegations or the tabloids, and we don't know what Johnny might have done for RDJ during his rough days",2020-08-29T01:23:59Z,14
