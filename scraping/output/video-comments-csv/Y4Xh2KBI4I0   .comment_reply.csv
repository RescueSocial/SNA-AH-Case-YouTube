27,Ugw2FGAwb9s6MlOVCDB4AaABAg,Yeah Okay,"@Dave Clark If you followed it closely then you would know that the judge went entirely off assumptions and not a single piece of clear cut evidence was put forward by Heard, it was all based solely off her testimony and word of mouth while the judge decided to ignore anything Depp and his team had to say, and if you're gonna say theres the picture of Heard with bruises thats been basically proven false by multiple sources (police officers and makeup artists with no connection to Depp have said its clearly faked and people who were with Heard at the time don't ever recall seeing her with bruises). Also I can't believe I have to say this but just because some abuses drugs doesn't instantly make them a wife beater. Same as how someone smashing inanimate objects when they're really upset doesn't automatically make them a wife beater too. 

Theres plenty of videos that you can find from actual lawyers who have gone through the case and pretty much all of them agree that Amber is far more in the wrong then Depp and that there is no sufficient evidence to prove that he's a wife beater. The judge who condemned him also has links to Amber Heards team and its clear he wasn't interested in justice since he was so blatantly biased and most likely paid off. Also if you think someone won't lie for someone because they're under oath then you are seriously naive.",2021-01-11T04:20:59Z,0

31,Ugw2FGAwb9s6MlOVCDB4AaABAg,Dave Clark,"@Storm  In Depp's U.K. trial, he admitted to the copious use of cocaine, alcohol, Xanax, Adderall, Roxicodone, magic mushrooms and ecstasy.
While shooting Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales in Australia, Depp swallowed eight ecstasy pills at once, according to testimony in the U.K. case, and embarked on a campaign of terror aimed at Heard. It culminated with the tip of his finger being sliced off, which resulted in his being flown back to Los Angeles for surgery. Depp's agent had to go back into Depp's home to look for the fingertip so it could be re-attached.
Pirates was forced to shut down production for two weeks, costing the studio some $350,000 a day. Depp claimed that Heard threw a bottle of alcohol at him, injuring his finger. A body guard said Depp told him he injured it in a car door.",2021-01-09T03:00:54Z,0

He was a great dad but the whole ""every woman is right"" narrative is toxic as fuck.  She had that kid taken away from her by social services because SHE neglected it. My friend would never have allowed that to happen.

People like you are the reason so many wonderful men are taken advantage of and arent taken seriously when they ask for help. Why alot will kill themselves and believe they deserve what happened to them.

People like you are hypocrites. You preach about not victim blaming women but as soon as a man talks about his traumas you tell them they dont matter and it was probably their own fault for ""not standing up for themselves"" yet if they had it would be all ""oh that poor woman! She needs all this free support and help because she is so fragile and weak!""

Not only did he waste an untold amount of tax payer money on his heavy handed witch hunt he also cost the celebs a lot of money and time. they had to fly a private jet back to Australia and get the dogs because he threatened to have them destroyed. you say that celebrity's aren't above the law? they come to our country to film movies ect that boosts our economy there is noting even relevant in this country except beaches reefs rocks and an ugly ass opera house in Sydney. we have no culture. people like you and barnaby joyce need to relax and give celebs some leniency or they will stop gracing our shores.
so here is a what if scenario.

if the queen or prince Charles had done the exact the same thing and smuggled an animal into the country. would barnaby joyce made an example of them publicly or would he have just swept it under the rug?

Quote:

The issue wasn't just that they breached Australian quarantine regulations by bringing a couple of small dogs into the country. Heard also falsely declared on her arrival card that she was NOT bringing any live animals into Australia. Making a false customs/quarantine declaration is a serious offence for which the law provides the possibility of a prison sentence. That's what motivated Depp and Heard to make their video, no matter that they obviously didn't believe a word that they were saying.

Is this view of granting forgiveness for wrongdoing the official stance of the Association under which this post is attributed or is it just the view of you, whoever you are, we have no way of knowing since no name is attached?  This attitude, be it personal or of the Association, should it apply to any transgressor providing it is attributed to an ""honest mistake"".  Would you like to see the courtesy extended to anyone infringing the country`s laws providing they claim to have made an ""honest mistake""?  Do you foresee any difficulty distinguishing an honest from a dishonest mistake?  

The decision to offer amnesty, is it influenced by the fact the characters involved are significant celebrities in an industry not distant to your Association?

Do you have even a basic understanding of the importance of this countries Bio-security Laws and why strict adherence is of the utmost importance possibly more important than any other country on the planet simply because of it`s isolation?.  It is this isolation that allows our responsible authorities to have a fighting chance at keeping undesirable imports out.  Their task is difficult enough, it does not need to be exacerbated by recalcitrant travelers.

Have you any appreciation of the number of non native species, be they animal, vegetable or micro organisms that have been introduced whether by accident or by ill considered design, that are now deemed a significant problem?  Without performing any form of research, how many problem species, (non native), could you name in any life form?

Perhaps all this information can open your mind. Seeing how your worded that comment, however, does not seem to be the case.

Hey you don`t know shit!  You are too stupid to understand how important this is for this country`s future.  We have already allowed too much rubbish in that we will never be rid of.  The cost to try to keep it under some control is enormous, which if you are a taxpayer, it`s costing you.  To say they were ignorant of the rules re declaring goods on arrival is absurd, don`t they speak English?  

Assuming you live in this country, you should be grateful for the huge effort it takes to keep unwanted imports out, it`s to benefit every resident.  That the two dogs were free of disease is not reason enough for their free entry.  If we are to be fair dinkum about quarantine, then we must treat all cases with the same diligence.  Should the Queen Herself wish to enter one of her horses in the Melbourne Cup then that horse would be subjected to the same quarantine measures as a child`s pony coming from overseas.
