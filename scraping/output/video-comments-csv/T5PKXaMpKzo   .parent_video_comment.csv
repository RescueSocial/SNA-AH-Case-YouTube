Mad he always leave when they fight while he's trying to calm her down. Yeah it shows that she lied which she does a lot even in court for the sun case with Johnny. Her sister caught lying too. Like how they framed Johnny by staging a photo of a table with some of Johnny's belongings and a coke line on the table. And a tube part from a tampon. Then comes out it was her sisters coke and she uses tampon applicator to snort coke. They staged that picture and framed him many other ways too. Like the chipped bed frame.

Meanwhile Amber was only married for 15 months and all this disaster????!!!! Their is video evidence of Elon Musk and James Franco in Johnnys private penthouse elevator.. so she had other admirers and possible affairs. Second Johnny allowed a bunch of her friends live in his penthouse free from any rent why would he allow that if he wanted to isolate and abuse her.. he wouldn’t. Third, she lost the support of some of her lawyers and a women friend of hers who was part of the me “ Me Too” movement who withdrew their are text messages that show Heards mom and dad having private text messages saying how much they love Johnny and saying in the text that Amber was just being pressure from her lawyers to stay in the penthouse. Amber has a jail record of domestic violence getting physical in a airport with a woman Amber was in a relationship with in the past. Also Heards personal assistant of 3 years does not support heard and multiple people including makeup, and other people who worked for him saw no injuries. However, Deep has audio confessions or Amber, supporters, video evidence, a cigarette burn, partial finger missing, and that’s not enough???!! , who are not family supporting him. She is lying because she can’t afford to lose.. same way she smuggled her dogs into Australia .. there’s so much evidence.. she even mocks him , gaslights him, and makes him feel wrong for “ not fighting and running away. “ Thats not what a victim would want  that’s what abuser would say. A true victim would want there space and be grateful he left. The audio tapes show she is always the one fighting and he’s trying to escape when she throws things like “ pots, pans and vases. She gave him hell on her birthday for being late and I learned she threw his phone and a homeless man found it and Deeps guard had to bring him with money and food to get it back!!! She is always calling him a baby and she feels people won’t believe him ...she’s not innocent in this at all, she’s lying, manipulative and it’s unfair with the amount of evidence that more is needed. Most people would not have as much actual evidence as Johnny’s team has. I just hope justice prevails ..# justice for Johnny",Christina Stenstrom,3,2020-07-23T06:05:13Z

40,UgzaqsaDcqFiMeJHSiB4AaABAg,"This is so hard to listen to because it mirrors my experiences in many ways. Especially hearing her say that judges and juries won't believe him. But I didn't have the benefit of being rich and famous, of being able to afford expensive lawyers, or having the criminal justice system give me preferential treatment the way famous people do. I'm a man that endured long term physical, emotional, and psychological abuse, as well as being manipulated into keeping quiet through constant gaslighting, lies and exploitation of gender bias. There were times when I was so broken and confused that I actually started to believe I deserved it. I lived constantly under threat of being arrested for things I didn't do, while enduring the exact crimes that would be claimed against me if I asked for help. And my fear was justified. She finally followed through on all the threats, she lied, I was arrested, and the police didn't even try to listen. The courts didn't listen or care. They ASSUMED she was telling the truth, despite evidence, even video I tried to present. I spent weeks in jail, months in mental health wards, I have PTSD, and I was suicidal and deeply depressed for a long time after because it was unbearable to have everyone treat you like a monster when you were the victim. I didn't see my daughter for seven months. I was homeless. And I was almost kicked out of the military. All because she was able to get away with lying and have everyone blindly trust her. The crazy thing is, I had volunteered as a sexual assault victim advocate for nearly 10 years when it finally all went to hell. They won't let me volunteer anymore though, even after the truth has come out and been proven. I've been able to mostly clear my name and move on, but there were zero consequences for her. None. But I'm still an allie and advocate for victims of abuse. I don't blame or hate woman. I still consider myself a feminist. But I also work to shed light on the need for men's rights in these situations too. You can't BLINDLY trust anyone who makes an accusation, no matter what their sex or gender. Even now, Amber Heard is being defended by people. She lied and exaggerated and tried to ruin a man's life, and she is still being allowed to go around playing the victim and making money off of it. Woman are abusers in nearly equal numbers to men. The abuse just takes different forms. Stop treating abuse like a sex or gender issue. Men being  physically stronger on average means nothing if they have no power to be believed or trusted.",Jon Rowe,0,2020-05-29T17:03:45Z

Amber is not manipulative, she is actually way too honest for this world

I don't know how much education you have or if you like to know what you need to know or like to learn generally.  I used to 
(and let's not violate any agreements I signed) work in food research and development.  The human brain is just wildly overrated.  I think maybe other people believe something I think I must have assumed in the past, that the brain corrected and improved itself until it was about as good as it could get.  It actually is very flawed and its better to understand that so you don't take its screwups to be a good idea.  That leads to stuff like drug and alcohol abuse for example.  Like waiting the three years to sue.  Someplace I heard something like that is how long it takes until you can see something as clear as the fact that he beat her up and she got creamed for saying so, and see it differently in spite of the fact that it was just so plainly true three years ago.",The Amber Heard Playlist!!,0,2020-02-10T19:30:14Z

Another time, an old man went onto a bus somewhere in Florida (I don’t remember), a woman randomly told her boyfriend that the old man just touched her sexually, despite the fact that the cameras on the bus shows he never even got close to her.

of her admitting her violence towards Johnny Depp. Also, hearing how she was going to play the justice system, jury, and woke media 
to paint Depp as the villain, whilst all the playing the meek, innocent victim.
She has done a wonderful service for the Men's Rights Movement, this is a high profile case that was played out in the media and not
some unfortunate Joe Blogg that no one has ever heard of.

Amber Heard has provided proof to what many men have been saying for years, that the justice system and social attitudes, immediately
judge the man to be guilty, just on the word of a woman.


I hope that Depp instructs his lawyers should show no mercy and go for the JUGULAR!
Not only should he look to get the money back from the divorce settlement, but also seek compensation for monies lost due to cancelled
contracts.There are no doubt that out there, there will be some people who should say that Johnny Depp should not pursue her through the courts, as the
audio leaks would of  already ruined her reputation, I say 'NO FUCKING WAY!' 
He shouldn't let this slide. This would still lead to Femnazi and those woke journalist to look the other way and pretend that this
didn't happen or that it was 50/50!!!

Depp' voice was silenced by the media and by Hollywood and he must have been going through some kind of mental hell, when Heard dragged
his name and reputation through the legal system, through the court of public perception. 
Knowing that he was the victim in this affair, seeing how the media courted Amber Heard, presenting her as some kind of heroine and as a figurehead
to the female victims of domestic violence. 
She has made a mockery of the judiciary, a mug out of the jury and a mug out of the general public, not that it was too hard, for this

If amber heard was NOT abused and instead flipped the script on Depp as the abuser, not only does it take away from real FEMALE victims, it makes it so MALE victims will have a hard time getting help. It hurts so many people.

Mr. Depp has been raked over the coals repeatedly in the public domain based solely upon unsubstantiated accusations.

She admits over and over at throwing multiple items at Johnny as well as punching/slap punch (or whatever other violence she admits and inflicted on Johnny.  This recording is the classic abuser - not allowing him to talk, blaming him for walking away after being hit, come on guys, not once does Amber say that Johnny hit her, and she tries to download her obvious violence to Johnny.  Johnny is a part of the Me Too movement, not Amber.  Amber reminds me of the character that Sharon Stone played in Basic Instinct - the beguiling beautiful manipulative evil psychopath.  Any psychiatrist or psychologist that hear's the entire recording, knows absolutely that Johnny is innocent.  Men get abused too. Ive read all the messages between Ambers mother and father to Johnny and he remained the gentleman, and the parents of Amber telling him they love him.   But I guess that one too many punches to Johnny did it.  I dont believe a word of Amber Heard, she is a classic gas-lighting abuser",Kapow Bam Bam Splat,63,2020-02-05T14:10:02Z

But bcs I could never know wha tis the truth and what is not, I stayed quiet. First of all I was sad that he left his wife of so many years for a younger woman (whom for some reason I never really liked in movies, she has a strange vibe around her) and then when this whole story broke out....I was just thinking Depp will for sure go down now, he won't get any roles, he will start drinking even more and probably will die in a couple of years.

Hearing how the story unfolded now and what this woman has done....

Seriously, it would have been so much better if he had stayed in his marriage, even if it was not what it used to be. I wonder if he ever thinks of going back in time, he could have spared himself so much shit....damn...this manipulative woman. I donno why she is doing it. I am pretty sure she has a lot of trauma in her past, because only hurt people hurt people, but still...it's just sad that grown up people do this to each other.

686,UgxhIfhpIvtz59p3RkB4AaABAg,"I think we need to let the courts figure out what the heck is going on between Depp and Heard. If they're both abusing one another, they need to both have mandatory therapy. If Heard made up her abuse claim so that she could get revenge on Depp for wanting to leave her (or whatever Depp is claiming), then I hope she gets sentenced to community service, has to pay him the 50 million or whatever, and has to get therapy (and vice versa if it turns out he's the one lying). 


This whole thing is incredibly sad -- it's definitely true that women who fight back against their abusers often get labeled abusive themselves, even though their actions were in self-defense, or else are part of a more nuanced situation. I have to say, though, that that voice message didn't sound at all to me as if the situation were mutual in terms of abuse -- if he also hit her, why wouldn't she bring that up when he said he would have to leave if things got physical? Also, how is that recording from 2015 and it's just being released now? What is going onnnnnn???


In any case, to make up claims like this, if there is no truth to them, is vile. This not only effects Depp, but also our entire society -- and obviously makes it more difficult for victims of real abuse to come forward. What really angers me is that no matter what is going on here, at least one of them is trying to take advantage of power over the other, and making us all pawns in that. At least one of them is lying -- maybe both. 


Just a really sad, desperate situation. And I grew up watching Depp and he was always one of my favorite actors -- which is besides the point, but I guess watching all this go down feels a bit like watching insane extended family drama unfold.


Thoughts and prayers go out to whichever one of them is lying the least amount, I guess. And I hope they both get therapy and lots of it.

Hear ye, and hearken unto mine words, 
O ye children of the land. Bible prophesies are being fulfilled, the early birth pains are on the rise ""For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places. All these are the beginning of sorrows.” (Matthew 24:7-8). Christianity is being suppressed worldwide by the increasing number of new laws that oppose conservative christianity values. Self-deceived philosophers make no mention of Christ as the means for salvation; and New Age propaganda such as: spirituality, consciousness, chakras, meditation, enlightment, law of attraction, scientology, and prosperity preaching only corrupt the body, spirit, and soul. ""Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves"" (Matthew 7:15). ""And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light"" (2 Corinthians 11:14); he is a liar, and a murderer. Be not deceived, ""Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them"" (Matthew 7:20). For the Lord has said "" My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me: And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand"" (John 10:27-28). I encourage you friends to do some basic research, and you will see that a cashless society is at the horizon. And the microchipping of humans is already here, and sooner than later the following words shall come to pass ""And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name"" (Revelation 13:16-17). Ask yourself how much do you love money, ""For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows"" (1 Timothy 6:10). Now, who among you seeks after power and fame?, ""For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?""(Mark 8:36). Time to wake up friends, the world is not going to get any better, even if religious leaders try to unify and coexist; for Jesus said ""Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword"" (Matthew 10:34), to separate believers from the non believers. He also said, ""...I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me"" (John 14:6). Jesus is the the ONLY way to Heaven brothers, all other religions are false and will not save you from lake of fire, for what communion does Jesus have with Allah?, or what righteousness is there in Shiva or Belial? Nay', Isay. “Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.” (Acts 4:12). We need to encourage and persuade other faiths to embrace the good news of salvation that is through Christ. Do not be deceived friends, but rather examine yourself and see what is causing you to love the world, for it is written: ""Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world"" (1 John 2:15-1). Your life, my beloved, is but a mist ""Whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow. For what is your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away"" (James 4:14). Now Therefore, be ye not mockers of the truth, and purge out the unfruitful works of darkness that dwells in you. And again, Some of you have children and loved ones, think about their souls. Awaken my brothers, and call upon the LORD, that He may refresh your souls with living waters, arise from the shadows of darkness and sing to the LORD, be not ashame of righteousness, justice, and holiness. Strive ye to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. Behold!, now is the time of grace, Now is the time of salvation. Do not be deaf to the call, answer, while you still can.


To the believer:
""Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth."" (2 Timothy 2:15). And remember to pray for the lost souls, even as satan uses them to oppress and persecute us, ""For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.""(Ephesians6:12). Our commission, brethren, is to preach the Gospel of Christ. And let us also bring hope and comfort to the weak and destitute. Be wise therefore how you present the Gospel to different types of people, and do not compromise your purity.


To the spiritually lost:
Turn to God and ""If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness."" (1 John 1:9).
And ""...if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved."" (Romans 10:9) ""For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened."" (Luke 11:10)

There is a reason thr Chinese public all over China is panicing, streets in all cities in the country are empty. The virus is much worse than the Chinese government reports. Look reports by thr CDC and the Philippine and Japanese governments (you'll need to get most of that translated). China claims this corona string has an infection rate of 3-4, reports by Japanese and European disease controll bodies estimate 4,8 to be the rate. The flue has an infection rate of 1,3. So if you get the flue you will on average imfect 1,3 other people, while with the nCoV you will infect 4,8. Now that is why the US government acts like it does. My father is currently working as a medical researcher in Italy and worked on samples of the virus in Rome. From what he and the entire medical science community know, the entire world is not taking this serius enough and the Chinese government is 100% trying to cover up how bad it really is. They expect a 5-25% mortality rate to be more accurate. 5% for countries with proper medical care, 25% for countries who do not have that. A lot of people affected worldwide would not be able to survive without the proper medical care. If this virus manages to spread widely out of China we are looking at a situation worse than the spanish flue. For proper reporting on the story check out ""serpentza"", ""laowhy86"" or even ""China uncensored"" on the topic of this virus. You are presenting the ""facts"" the Chinese government wants you to see. The CCP does not want the full information on the virus out. On weibo and Wechat you get your account suspended if you leak real information, while fake news like ""you can cure yourself by drinking garlic water""or ""your pets can carry the disease you should let them free"" are promoted. There are people in China, quite more than ever before that are talking about that this is a sign the CCP has lost the mandate of heaven and is no longer the legitimate ruler of China. That is why the chinese government tries to suppress the information coming out even more. They cannot allow to lose face, they will not tell the truth about how bad the virus is. Any source of news from the WHO should be disregarded as they just echo what the Chinese government wants you to hear. The CDC is the only american instution you should listen to and can believe and if they agree with the travel restrictions (which they do) then it's very serious and dangerous. Also check the scientific medical infos shared by states that have coronavirus infected patients, they draw a much darker picture than what China or the mainstream media tell you. take it seriously cuz if that virus breaks out in the US like in China, US hospitals will be overwhelmed and it will be a disaster...",winnerxxl,0,2020-02-04T23:38:06Z

845,Ugx8P4QRzcuRpBKBLQF4AaABAg,"The simple fact here is Amber was the abuser, and she was able to game the system to further abuse Johnny Depp.

Abuse isn't even really the right word here, usually this kind of abuse might result in a false criminal charge or simple social ostracism, which are of course both awful in their own right. However, Depp lost a gig as Jack Sparrow on The Pirates of the Carribean movies... and a lot of other acting prospects. He can't get those back. That's millions of dollars.

And why did he lose those things? It's not because of her, by the way... although I think we would like to think so. It's because of us, collectively. It's because people rushed to judgement, because people demanded extrajudicial penalties without trial or investigation.

Well, we got exactly what we fucking asked for didn't we!?! And how did that work out?

Maybe. Just maybe, we might want to take this as a lesson. You see, in the old days, it's not that people didn't care about domestic violence. It's that, they recognized that they didn't know the situation, so they stayed out of it for fear that in intervening they might actually make it worse, like we all did in this case. Now, was that the ideal way to do it? No. Total inaction is not a good way to handle it either, however, obviously jumping the shark and rushing to judgement is clearly wrong too.

You want to take action, but you also don't want to do harm. The only reasonable course of action to accomplish both is to encourage legal action. That is where it will get investigated. That's where JUSTICE gets done, not this lynch mob bullshit.",Chris R,0,2020-02-04T23:14:31Z

1. Cancel Amber Heard as well (considering that everyone is telling the truth and also considering the fact that just because she abused him doesn't give him the right to abuse her back)
2. ""Uncancel"" Depp (this whole ""cancel culture"" is childish, let them solve their problems on their own)

926,UgxFJ7xjGeT1gvLq0jR4AaABAg,"Okay, here's my take. There was alot of funky shit happening between them. Nothing complicated in this. Two people might fight physically regardless of temperaments. Yes he is not innocent in some of his own actions in life but no he should not be victim to abuse either. In her case, she was trying to find an out to the relationship because something was going on for them to fight in the first place. It takes two for any fight to happen. Could have been something they both could resolve but this was also a defamation of his character that will follow him for life. Anyone would have believed either side. Amber played herself in some of these findings and it's a shame it came out like that because most will not even know if Johnny was still good or not or even Amber if things take a turn again. The fact that he admitted to love and not wanting this violence shows something of Depps thinking. So hopefully things get better from here cuz this is going to be a nasty one from how this is sounding. I don't agree with any violence to males and females in any fashion.

Also virus wise, people just need to chill, read and inform yourself calmly. Reacting won't help you stay safe. There will come and time where you cannot avoid what happens.

The Iowa caucus malfunctions and “quality control” jokes are fun and all, but I think we should use this moment as an opportunity to shine a light on just how problematic our archaic voting systems really are and the benefits behind alternative frameworks. 
Implementing a Ranked-Choice Voting system (RCV) and/or Approval Based Voting system (ABV) with a backup paper ballot solves for the issues we’re seeing here tonight and in this election cycle. RCV promotes the same values as caucusing, in that if your preferred candidate doesn’t meet the threshold of viability your vote is deferred to a secondary candidate and so on. It does this without the strain of corralling people for hours on end, making voting more accessible to the working class who can’t justify leaving the workplace or their homes for several hours to cast their vote. ABV takes the now infamous electability question off of the table. With the ability to cast a vote in favor of whichever candidates you are preferable towards there isn’t this anxiety of making sure your vote goes to The Best Candidate to Beat Donald Trump™, there is never any vote splitting or spoiler candidates, and there is never any doubt that whomever is nominated for the candidacy truly represents and has the approval/support of their party. ABV has the potential to cut through the immense political polarization we see in this country, as it disavows the notion that a voters power can only be meaningful when cast for one of two unrepresentative establishment parties and instead allows the voters to support a number of candidates who truly align with their interests.
Without even mentioning the other systemic inadequacies regarding democratic access (and there are plenty) it’s time we advocate for our representative democracy to function using election systems/frameworks that allow for actual representation to even be feasible. There are plenty of alternative methods to our current practices that can and should be implemented to ensure this, it’s just a matter of if we want it bad enough.",Parker Cellura,0,2020-02-04T20:03:40Z

He doesn't even necessarily come off as rude when he does it. 

I've heard he can be kind of high-strung and is a little energetic but being particular about how you like something and being excited and having fun is not the same as being aggressive.

Soon after I saw a clip made by a youtuber where she/he (can't remember who it was) analyzed both their behavior from all the clips found on the internet along with one where Amber was secretly pranked and she kept hitting Johnny in the arm. 
The video kept showing clips and analyzing their personalities, and it was very well put together. 
I think it said things about the line of ""although she is an actress, her depiction of an abuse victim is flawed"" and how ""she is the most likely abuser in the relationship"" and how ""people don't take men being abused seriously.""

1104,UgyDraGnZlfShTL0wZt4AaABAg,"12:05 The media likes to portray Andrew Yang as someone who is the least likely to win. I say, I really don't care if someone is not going to win. Voting should be based on who you want as President. Otherwise you're just a cog in the machine of propaganda. You're not thinking for yourself, and we're no longer a democracy. We're just idiots brainwashed to believe in voting for whoever is the most corrupt and affluent, who will always win, and continue to maintain the status quo (e.g. poverty and homelessness).

In order to see real change in the country we have to vote for the person the media (or rather those who control the media), don't want.

Now, consider what has happened to Andrew Yang. His mic was shut off during one of the debates. Then, he was given the least amount of time to speak by far, and called on last. Early polling in December was denied so he was not allowed to attend the last debate. In a graphic of presidential candidates, they replaced his face with another Chinese person. In every single interview, the interviewer always asks (or is required to), ""WHAT IF YOU DON'T WIN??""

All of this designed from the beginning to reinforce the fact that he's irrelevant, he doesn't matter. Only the popular people matter. But people need to learn, popular ≠ ""the best.""",Orion Xavier,0,2020-02-04T18:21:34Z

People do need to talk about abuse in general and how it does have an effect. But... here's my thing, when Amber Heard started to come out about the accusations of Johnny Depp something in my gut was telling me that all of her accusations are either a lie or very exaggerated. I've been a huge Johnny Depp fan, but I was also a big fan for Amber Heard. To me she was a rising actress to keep an eye on and I was so happy when they got together because she seemed wonderful and just nice. But as a kid to both manipulating parents, one a physical abuser and one a narcissistic who emotionally abused, I knew something seem off. It was very sad to see because no one believed Johnny Depp's side to things because he's the guy so he's automatically the aggressor, but I truly always thought she might have been the true aggressor and that audio provides that. Coming from personal experience I think Amber Heard is a narcissist and she's just really good at hiding it. A lot of people think I'm rude for disregarding or having as little respect for my mom because they only think of their own mom and in meeting my mom you wouldn't even suspect the things she's done to me, because narcissistic people are very good at hiding their bad side. That's all they know and in their mind they will do anything in their power to make everyone else seem like the bad guy. But when people do actually meet that side of my mom they finally understand and apologize for assuming any different. And I'm not saying I should assume differently with this situation as well, but when you do come from a family of abuse you can usually tell when people are straight with you and who's crying wolf. Abuse feels like a nightmare that you can't wake up from, you feel even ashamed of it at times. I've never felt that genuine emotion that comes with the abuse she claimed, so I could never had that connection to her accusations, and that voice recording proves why. I think Amber Heard is a genuinely sick person for using the word ""abusive"" to cover her own abuse, to try to destroy someone emotionally, physically, and career wise. And yes, I'm assuming all this, but it's from the best educated guess I could give. And for her to claim this makes everyone else's abuse story feel invalidated and like they are not going to be heard because she decided that's what it means to be ""abused."" As a public figure, she can have that power and it's very messed up and immature that that's how she decided to use her power for her own personal gain, to bully others, and destroy.",Isabella Jacqueline,0,2020-02-04T17:51:50Z

 Too many women have used the whole me too movement as a weapon. Plenty of real victims out there that wont be believed because of women like her. Too many men get abused and have no choice but to stand there and take it or just leave. If a women hits a man he cant hit her back or he goes to jail. If a man hits a woman he goes to jail.... But the women NEVER goes to jail. 


 The Democrats... Hard to support most of them. Warren that lies nonstop? Biden that is corrupt as hell? Bernie that the democrats will do everything to make sure he loses including cheating in every corrupt way they can?


 The Coronavirus blocking all travel is not overkill at all. a 1 in 50 death rate is horrible.  But the big issue isnt the virus itself but the fact that china is doing everything they can to hide a lot of information.  Governments around the world are not reacting enough. They are not doing nearly enough. It spreads too easy it spreads between people that dont even feel sick. That is the worst thing ever.  What happens when that hits poor areas where people dont have access to decent health care? Or people in the US that have no health insurance. Here people go bankrupt when they get a severe illness because of hospital bills. People lose homes.  Say it gets into a school with a few thousand people and spreads like crazy for a week before anyone even feels sick. suddenly you have hundreds of sick kids and a couple could die but also those sick kids spread it to families before anyone knows they are sick. Suddenly parents are starting to die and kids that go to other schools.  No blocking travel isnt overkill. It is the only answer. The only thing that can be done is to cut down the spread and let it burn itself out.  If that isnt done early on it will be too late.  China has hundreds of dead right now and its still getting worse It has only been going on for about a month. So what happens over the course of a year?  How many thousands of lives does it take to be worth cutting travel? And if it mutates and gets worse? Delayed action or not enough action now could lead to countless lives lost because people didnt want to delay travel. 


 Not to mention this is china we are talking about. Where they lie about absolutely everything. few hundred deaths reported from it but how many countless deaths from people that never got tested because they didnt have enough of the test kits?",plaid13,0,2020-02-04T16:50:58Z

1265,UgwHnqtY6DSbfxd3E7t4AaABAg,"(Christ Witnesses to Nicodemus on being born again and what it means. Continued (2):


Jesus answered,
Verily, verily, 
I say unto thee,


Except a man be born 
of water 
and of the Spirit,
he cannot enter
into the kingdom of God.


That which is born of the flesh 
is flesh;
and that which is born of the Spirit 
is spirit.


(John 3:5-6).


***There are several interpretations of the phrase, ""born of water and the Spirit.""


***(1): Jesus was referring to water baptism. (Acts 10:43-48)<---To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins. While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word. And they of the circumcision which believed were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost. For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then answered Peter, Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we? And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord).


***(2): Water is to be understood as a symbol for the Holy Spirit. Thus the phrase cold be translated ""born of water, even the Spirit.""


***(3): Water is to be understood as a symbol of the Word of God. (Ephesians 5:26)<---That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word). (1 Peter 1:23)<---Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever).


***(4): Jesus used the phrase ""born of water"" to refer to physical birth. He then used the contrasting phrase ""of the Spirit"" to refer to spiritual birth.


***(5): Jesus used the phrase ""born of water"" to refer to John the Baptist's baptism.


***(6): Jesus used the Old Testament imagery of ""water"" and ""wind"" to refer to the work of God from above. (Isaiah 44:3-5)<---For I will pour water upon him that is thirsty, and floods upon the dry ground: I will pour my (spirit) upon thy seed, and my (blessing) upon thine offspring: And they shall spring up as among the grass, as willows by the water courses. One shall say, I am the LORD'S; and another shall call himself by the name of Jacob; and another shall subscribe with his hand unto the LORD, and surname himself by the name of Israel.
(Ezekiel 37:9-10)<---Then said he unto me, Prophesy unto the wind, prophesy, son of man, and say to the wind, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live. So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the (breath) came (into them), and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army. (Wind) is an alternate translation of the term (Spirit) in verse 8.


***(1 Peter 3:21)<---The like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ:


***(Romans 8:9)<---But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.",mlzanercik,0,2020-02-04T15:45:22Z

I never believed men could be victims until I met a close friend of mine who opened up about how he was rapped by his then gf. It blew my mind and changed my whole view. He was so intimidating and masculine that I could never imagine he would have been a victim. When he broke down the story piece by piece and how he felt his hands were tied to truly defend himself eve with her coming at him with a knife, I was shocked. As a woman we kick and harm our attacker with no regard for their safety bc we feel like once we get help and ppl hear what happened, justice will be served against our attacker. To imagine trying to fight for your life while fearing to even laying a scratch against your attacker for fear of being framed, is just mind boggling to me. I feel for men in those situations.

But instead of recognizing her flaws as her problem, she puts the responsibility and blame on her significant other and then physically attacks him when he falls short of the unrealistic demands/requirements she has set for him.

The whole ""believe the wahmens"" BS movement is just another way that they want to reinforce that principle. They expect that men will take false allegations of physical or sexual abuse towards their partners, curl up in a ball, and die in their shame. And there's no length too far to achieve this. I mean, look at the hair photo that Amber hoped was ""incriminating evidence"". Who the hell takes a picture where they're pointing at a clump of hair on the ground? It's not that it's a picture of hair she clearly cut herself. It's that she's pointing at it like ""No! See! Look! There's no way I would have done this! It was him!"", but between her average length of hair and what typically happens when someone DOES get their hair ripped out by an abuser, it doesn't add up.

HOWEVER, if Heard is the aggressor in most arguments it doesnt immediately make it that Depp never abused Heard. Depp is a known drug and alcohol abuser. Who's to say that in one of his binges he didnt take out some pent up aggression on Heard or took a verbal argument to physical when he was fucked up? I dont think either of them are innocent. But I think Heard is definitely the bigger piece of shit because she tried to take the victim role and then took the ""I REPRESENT ALL VICTIMS"" stance to gain some clout and this definitely gives her a bigger black eye.

1422,UgzvReHcTSTyOuHrhK14AaABAg,"When Heard said he always responds to her physical attacks by ""running away"", she is admitting he wasn't attacking her. I thought originally that her grainy photos on a neighbor's phone and the ones the next day where she was out partying with friends were instant makeup bruising with no evidence the next day. The narrative given never added up and all support of her story was the neighbor and her significant other repeating the story they discussed after Depp left the apartment over a few hours before they called the cops.  The ""leaked"" video where he threw the glass was her phone (like she was using an ancient phone with a camera a decade old quality wise) started with her starting a fight. That was her goal, to enter the room, scream, yell, start a fight, and prove he had a temper. He said something about her starting a fight again that was just sick of the attacks, let her go until she moved a bit closer, turned away from her, threw the glass, and left. It felt like it supported his defense and her lying than her story. That audio, if not doctored, is no different. It didn't day she couldn't be a victim either, but it did not include her ever saying he hit her, just her admitting she hit him and he would leave. She sounds like the typical abuser using her prior to him experience as a victim to get the sympathy of fans to further her career. What better target than a big name with an alcohol problem? As much as victims need to be believed, we, as a people, need to look at what is provided rationally because liars exist too. They use movements to generate an emotional response and then slip in to avoid close detection. They use illogical ways of obtaining ""proof"" that reason says question while emotion says burn the s.o.b. People with the newest phones don't use the newest phone to record and get a grainy set of photos like the ones from 2015. Make sure the stories add up. Pay attention to the number of times ""witnesses"" say the victim told us it happened this way when saying they heard it. If they were told they heard it, but never actually say they heard any of the fights that well or the prior to talking to the victim part is just the slammed door on exit, they didn't hear anything. Their statement is not the evidence it is touted to be.",selbarton,113,2020-02-04T12:52:10Z

1495,UgxbpkWyN7r71E9jSpZ4AaABAg,"Omg wow that Johnny Depp thing...!!! It makes so much fuckin sense looking back. (Aside: yes, amber’s lawyer is correct and just because she may of admitted to hitting him doesn’t mean he never hit her...nevertheless...).  Abuse is about power which is why 9 out of 10 times you’ll see the accused trying to ‘scream louder than the accusations’ with all kinds of counterattacks and denials. Johnny never did that. He just...quietly, silently disappeared. Yes, that could be a tactic to avoid the spotlight and do damage control but now, hearing that, it was probably because he was fuckin freaking out as welll as hurt badly that someone he loved could be so willing to ruin his life so completely. I think that very fact that this tape was released so much later kinda proves this. I mean, hell, the year of #meetoo is prob the WORST time to say an alleged abuse victim ‘painted on bruises’ so why do it now if not that he’s needed this long to process and heal? I’d like to even think that he really didn’t even want to release the tape and had his career and rep either gotten better or not continued to decline from the lies this woman said about him that maybe he never would of released it and exposed her....but that’s entirely speculative & I’m probably making him out to be a better man than he might be (maybe I’m just too happy to be able to root for him again!).

Normally, I would be very careful in allowing one piece evidence sway me on such a serious issue (and I’d be very out spoken against the general public doing the same) but, as a victim of abuse several times over, there is just something so striking in BOTH of their voices that I’d be lying if I said I didn’t whole heartedly believe him. The way she spoke hurt my stomach and the way he spoke (even tho he was clearly drunk in the one part) hurt my heart. I know he’s facing a hell of a battle but I hope he at least gets a fair trial in the face of the public. NOTHING, absolutely NOTHING, hurts the #metoo movement like a woman who cries wolf about abuse. We ask that every woman is believed and listened to when they come forward and it’s women like Amber who make every legitimate abuse case look like an exaggerated grab for attention. The truth is there ARE plenty of women like Amber...the thing is most of them only pull these crazy stunts as teenagers and usually fess up under true police questioning...but even their cases are remembered by men in the community who keep it in the back of their heads, allowing themselves a reason to doubt the story of every other victim they may read about in the future. “Yea right, that b**** is fuckin lying to get attention and to cover her cheating ass cuz that’s exactly what Lauren What’s-her-name did back in senior year”.  Her and Jussie smolette need to go find a cave somewhere together to live out their lives. I won’t wish them death but i will wish them some dark, moldy, wet future in some cold sunless cave.

Has the protein sequence that's a dead giveaway of such. This is open source knowledge to ANY lab that can properly analyze the strain can see. But that information is being scrubbed from the news, and labs are being threatened to retract the findings and/or keep quiet about it, at the threat of loss of funding, being accused of fraud etc.

We need to process this, and ask WHY was this developed? Think for a minute... Was it seriously developed as a bio-weapon to use against people? Or was this an attempt to create a vaccine against SARS that got out of control after a bunch of people died after being given the vaccine, AND it somehow got loose and out of control?

Johnny: What are you doing?
Amber: I’m getting you a xanax; Seems like the last one has worn off.
Johnny (an admitted addict): Yeah, you’re probably right, ::takes it::
::twenty minutes later::
Johnny: I love you. I just want peace. (And that docile part at the end Phil played)

Why would you give someone who you claim is a violent drug addict who goes into blind rages a pill? It was so clear to me that she didn’t like how much sense he was making. He had a valid and clear response to every single thing she said before that, then he was just basically sitting there being berated. It was so sick. And as a recovery addict myself, let me say one thing... Amber may party, but if she isn’t an addict and she married an addict that means she’s a controlling monster. What do they call something that goes after the weak and injured? Oh right... a pr*dator.
Then when she said, “I worked so hard to make this marriage happen.” And he said “let’s not talk about how or why the marriage happened.” WHAT?! Then she goes, “I wanted that stability... I mean we we wanted stability right? that’s why we got married?” ::dead silence::

A video like this doesn't just get leaked without the person filming knowing it did. Amber had several people who knew her admit that she was a selfish and just overall piece of shit person. She treated others like trash and would use them to further her own career. This whole thing with Depp was just another way for her to further her career.

This should be taken seriously. 200,000 people fled Wuhan at notice of quarantine and these people have left the country and travelled internationally.

1884,UgzP-PvukfN0NycKlN54AaABAg,"Amber Heard: boo hoo hoo I came out with bullshit allegations of abuse and NO ONE believed me! No one EVER believes women!

Seriously? TONS of people, in the media and out, believed her. They were all super quick to paint Depp an abuser because believing everything women say is now the norm. His career was ruined because of it. I always had a gut feeling that something was wrong because it just doesn’t seem like something Depp would do. He’s been one of my favorite actors since I was a kid.",Madame Kateh,0,2020-02-04T05:29:56Z

1886,UgwdUbSJwpSoZbR07Sp4AaABAg,"Long comment short, both Depp and Heard are crazy, but something seems fishy about Amber's pictures. Victims usually don't document their abuse that perfectly because they don't want to believe they're being abused. I also have a hard time seeing Johnny with explosive rage, but who knows what he's like in private.",Sara P,0,2020-02-04T05:29:27Z
1887,Ugx4Vc65MvpYqlobm0R4AaABAg,"I am working on a domestic violence case in a divorce proceeding which is almost identical to the circumstances of this case. It’s terrible,",karmabrothercat,0,2020-02-04T05:27:41Z
1888,Ugz5zD6OrnyxJ4_-seJ4AaABAg,"Amber Heard was once accused of domestic violence against her photographer girlfriend of the time (2009). The girlfriend was the one that spoke on her behalf and defended her after she was arrested. I find this suspicious because victims of abuse defend their attackers more often than they confess the truth of their abuse. It's also suspicious because van Ree, the photographer, had claimed it was a misunderstanding and then went on to compliment and say how she still admired Amber and they were still close. It sounds like she was trying to fight for their relationship even after if got physically abusive. Not only that, but Johnny Depp was seen on a red carpet, being photographed by people at all angles, with bruises on his face that actually match up with his timeline of events. Amber Heard did not have those bruises until later when she needed people to side with her and the way the footage was staged and how she seemed to be pushing his buttons on purpose to get a reaction said the video was faked. Johnny also does in fact have a missing chunk of finger. 

""I was not hitting you."" ""I'm sorry it was not a proper slap."" ""You are such a baby. Grow the **ck up!"" ""When there's not a physical fight you'd still be admirable right? By running away?"" ""I can't promise you that I'll be perfect. I can't promise you that I won't get physical again."" ""I just get so mad I lose it."" —Amber Heard 2015 Confessional

That was all Amber Heard. Meanwhile, Johnny sounds like a victim who can't let go of their abuser and wants to stay with them despite everything. She very much took advantage of today's Me Too Movement, lied to real victims of abuse, and played her cards to seem more sympathetic. She did so get ahead of the story and even then people were calling her out on her bullshit.",Luckas Silver,0,2020-02-04T05:27:26Z

They are made fun of or even more abused and that the girl shouldn't be able to do that to them because they are the guys.

Ie... do they have systems in place to truly screen and be proactive about it.  Mexico being my closest concern. 5) They are adding all of those infected up to date and dividing that by the deaths... That's a bad percentage because this virus spreads so fast and the time to kill... at bare minimum is 28 days.  So take the infected 28 days PRIOR and divide that by the deaths today.  That's fucking alarming.  It's better math then what the media is showing but still not perfect...  SARS is easy because it's come and gone... infected to deaths and you have a true number...

The worst part is no matter what you do as a man you will always be seen as the aggressor.
Within the last 6 months I have been verbally and physically attacked.
She would often throw things at me and say ""I throw things because I can't hit you"" which always concerned me.
Recently an argument got so heated I asked her to leave my apartment and she refused. I asked her nicely and I asked her meanly. Nothing worked. As a man I am powerless because as soon as I put my hands on her, I am the bad guy. I am at fault. I told her if she didn't leave my apartment I would physically remove her and call the police. Oh boy she didn't like that. When I finally dialled 9-1-1 she flew into a rage. She smacked a collectors helmet off my living room side table so hard it flew across the room, bounced off the wall, and landed back on the other side. As I was on the phone with dispatch our eyes met, and she charged towards me punched my skull several times and even bit me. The woman on dispatch even said ""it sounds like the female is assaulting him now."" 
She then flipped the entire side table and threw a bar stool and slammed my apartment door shut.
Not 10 minutes later she started calling me and texting me saying she was sorry and half assed bullshit like she never meant for things to get that way. When I told her the police were getting involved she told me, IN CONFIDENCE, that she would press charges against me and win. She also happened to mention that she should have stabbed me instead of biting me.
I was an emotional and physical wreck. I didn't know what to do. My apartment was a mess, I had a slight concussion, and a bleeding bite wound on my back and the only thing I was worried about was getting arrested.
Me, the one who offered to talk things out at my apartment, but when I felt things were getting too heated I asked her to leave.
I have an Alexa in my bedroom (Alexa's are always recording and can be accessed for investigation purposes) so I made it very clear to her that if she even tries to pull anything that I have the recorded evidence of me asking her to leave my property, and on top of that the witness testimony of the officer that arrived and saw the scene, the recorded dispatch call of her assaulting me and the fact I was admitted to the hospital and given antibiotics for 10 days due to a human bite wound.

Men can be victims too. Women can be abusers. Women can be aggressors. Women can also be master manipulators because of the stigma around abuse in relationships.

2081,Ugzwe6sg-zqrgZ4Qktp4AaABAg,"If you look at the evidence, it is clear that Heard, not Depp, is the abuser. 

I’ve been in an actual abusive relationship. I was stalked and violently assaulted by an ex. I know what abuse looks like - and Heard is not a victim of abuse. I have looked into this case, including at the actual court documents, and have signed a petition in favour of Depp. We should not just believe all women - we should believe all victims who are credible. Heard is not credible - there is so much evidence that proves her wrong, and points to her being the actual abuser. Many victims, especially women, do receive vitriol and abuse when they speak out - that is true. That’s something that we need to change about our society and culture. However, Heard hasn’t received vitriol because she is a victim speaking out; she has been on the receiving end of public anger because she is an abuser who has tried to gaslight both her victim, and the public.

Make no mistake - Amber Heard doesn’t care about women. She cares about herself. She is the very reason why so many actual female victims aren’t believed. Her actions have hurt female victims of abuse, because she is someone people will point to in the future when actual victims come out and try to tell their stories. Actual victims will be dismissed because of her cruel actions. What she has done to Johnny, and to perpetuate the general culture of victim-blaming in our society, is unforgivable. I applaud JK Rowling for standing by Depp, and doing what is right. I certainly won’t see any movies that cast Heard. She doesn’t deserve to be rewarded for her actions. She doesn’t deserve to be attacked or threatened by anyone, but she absolutely deserves to be condemned by the public, and remembered as the abuser that she clearly is.

Yes, men are far more likely than women to be domestic abusers. However, women can still be abusers, and men can still be victims. Just because something is less common does not mean it doesn’t happen. We shouldn’t support all women, regardless of their actions - we should support all VICTIMS, regardless of their sex.

2104,Ugxkv3eWYyZCPHzsY794AaABAg,"I've had over a dozen MRI's. My advice is:  1) Don't opt for an open MRI because you're worried about being claustrophobic. Your health provider doesn't get as good as an image as with closed and you may to do it again anyway, 2) Go to a Lowes's and get a set of the blue plastic Christmas tree ear plugs. Ones that you scrunch up are worthless. Don't go into the MRI without ear protection or you will be miserable. 3) Ask, plead, or even beg for them to block/stabilize whatever they're trying to view. I had them put my head into a milk crate with the end cut out and then pile sandbags around my head to keep my head from moving when they MRI'd my neck and brain. Holding still for long passes over a 45 minute to 1-1/2 hour session is a bitch. It's better for them to fix/support what they want to image so you can relax. 4) If you have trouble lying on a flat/hard surface for long periods of time, bring a pillow for your lower back and/or something for under your knees to make it comfortable. Once they start they really can't give you a break. 5) Wear gym shorts with comfortable underwear and a plain (no designs/silkscreen/logo) T-shirt. That way you don't have to go naked in a hospital gown. If you can't tolerate 60 degrees then have a sweatshirt/sweatpants. NO METAL FASTERNERS. 6) Probably don't want to eat/drink anything for a few hours before so you dont need to go in the middle of the scan. 7) Ask if you can bring a CD or a thumb drive of music to listen to. Some places will play your tunes through the intercom for you. 8) If you're worried about freaking out being in a closed space for a long time, ask your doctor to prescribe something to calm you down. 9) Tell the technician not to talk to you unless you're doing something wrong or the building is on fire. With my neck/head blocked, a pillow under my lower back, and my knees raised I would get comfortable and fall asleep. They would have to come in the room and shake an ankle to get me to wake up so they could get me to prep before bringing me back out of the tunnel.

2159,UgyIWLkmNTLBbwjxQYh4AaABAg,"So here are some thoughts that I had. I am not super well-read on this Depp/Heard situation, so take my thoughts knowing this.

From what I *have* read, both Depp and Heard have had a somewhat recent history of accusing each other of abuse--well recent in that it's been off-and-on for five years. I don't trust Heard's word that she is the sole victim in this relationship. I do wonder if Depp has done more than minor pushing/self-defense maneuvers.


Depp was accused of abusing substances and assaulting a crew member on set a few years ago. His behavior has also been somewhat erratic. I personally have witnessed relationships/marriages where both partners were volatile and violent and explosive. And often, one was a bit more of each than the other.


Is it possible that both Depp and Heard abused each other? If Depp had fallen off the wagon, it could have made him uncharacteristically volatile and reactionary. He also could have been recording that audio intentionally, after provoking her into acting out violently and then talking sweetly while getting a ""confession"" (this is purely speculation).

This is just the perspective of someone who grew up around this, so I could be reading into crap that isn't there. But it's food for thought.",Regan,0,2020-02-04T03:21:53Z
2160,UgzAd9jkdnldY8_cnb14AaABAg,It’s Sad that when a women cries wolf she is supported blindly and not questioned or even halted about her accusations and claims and in doing so another #Cancel starts and then the man becomes labeled an abuser before any solid evidence is presented,Mr Taurus,0,2020-02-04T03:21:04Z
2161,UgyzuuWIRd4np_Vgqmd4AaABAg,"When the whole news years ago about ""Johnny Depp abusing his wife"" (didn't know Amber heard's name back then) seemed weird  to me. None of his other partners had come out and said he was abusive. Usually once a male abuser is outed it's like a flood of other women saying the same: which is usually a good thing, because an abuser usually repeats. But none of his past partners said that, in fact they said how unlike him that was. He was always gentle person. You know how hard it is for gentle people to be not treated as a doormat? It makes me sad that this just came to light and that Amber Heard was able to use this as a springboard into Hollywood. (I haven't known her in any roles except the love interest  from aquaman, so sorry if I'm wrong).
And I'm mad at myself. I saw signs that things were weird, and I never questioned because ""she was a woman  standing up to her abuser"" if we as feminists really want equality and not misandry: then we need to treat male accusations of female abuse just as seriously. Just because men are ""physically"" stronger, doesn't mean there aren't women out there willing to be physically abusive, or to use emotional manipulation to get what they want from their spouse. I'm mad at myself for just “believing it”.",Dani Setsuko,1209,2020-02-04T03:20:52Z

Why when he was bringing up her violence did she not mention any of his? she was trying to blame him for everything under the sun in that recording, she even said that she hits him because he runs away from arguments implying it was his fault she hits him.

why didn't she say she hits him because he hits her? why didn't she say he couldn't criticise her violent tendancies because he had some of his own?

craziest of all... Why did her parents say they knew the accusations were lies that were all crafted by lawyers, that amber had spoken to them for hours about not wanting to do it and that they loved and stood by him up until he had enough and told them he was done with her and the ring was coming off?
There's texts between Depp and her dad where depp says he told her he'd walk out the next time she hit him and the ring would be coming off, the dad had nothing to say to depp in these texts about his supposed violence and didn't try to refute hers.

I do not believe she is some angel. I don't think everything she said was a made up fantasy either, though, but it sure as hell doesn't look like she was some helpless victim all the time. It sounds like they had an incredibly unhealthy marriage with both parties going too far - something that does happen far too often - it DOESN'T sound like either of them are some horrible evil monster though.


I think askign for either of them to be removed from their movies or barred from their job is too much, I think either of them trying to claim complete innocence is too much. I think they both made mistakes and ultimately should have split, as they did.

She admitted in that clip that he didn't fight back and essentially called him a coward for not fighting back so how are people still defending her! He didn't fight back, he didn't abuse her, she abused him and we need to accept that it happens. Saying that women never abuse men is just as sexist as not listening to the women. We listen and gather proof to believe. How can your heart not break hearing how beat down he sounds while she sits there justifying herself and saying she can't stop herself!

The beating stopped, but she never respected me and it should've been obvious how things would go. She cheated on me when I was in the military and stole my money then left me.

My question is, who was recording the conversation? If it was Depp, then he knew to be careful about what he said, and if Amber knew about it, why incriminate herself? Was it a third person recording it? I lean more towards Depp, because I grew up with his movies, but at the end of the day these are public figures and we only know the image they present in public, we will never know who they really are, when it truly comes down to it. For all we know they are both horrible people and have been equally horrible towards each other. Also, sometimes a partner knows the other's trigger points. My dad would always know exactly what to say to anger my mom, and then we would just hear mom yelling at him and assume that she was the bad person. As we grew up, we learned that each had their own faults and each shared blame in the various fights they had.

An argument started and Depp always walked away. Being the ""better man"" as Heard said by mocking Depp. How is this not evidence enough that Heard is and always has been the perpetrator in this relationship?
It is quite clear that Depp is always trying to escape her violence, whether physical or emotional. Much to her disappointment. Depp is also trying to find ways of stopping the violence by trying to compromise with Heard by saying that if it becomes physical they need to be apart until things calm down.


Thankfully Depp is finally away from this cunt and finally the public sees that he was infact innocent all along. I hope he can finally start healing from all this abuse, both from Heard and the public, especially from the leftist SJW bunch and the feminists.

Like Depp, I repeatedly said, ""I don't want you out of my life.  I am in love with you.""  And of course meant it in the deepest way.  During the course of a few weeks I noticed the warmth disappear from the hallways around me and in a painfully slow and confusing manner a cold distance instead take its place.  Friends stopped calling, stopped listening, except a really great few.  Little did I know that in the midst of my frightened desperation this person was taking my story and turning it into her own.  I still have never hurt so bad as I did those years.


I am relieved to know that Johnny Depp's truth is going to make it out since it's very easy to see a pretty female and want to believe her instead of the male.

Growing up in that time Russia would rather kill any persons talking about an outbreak of Sars or Coronaviris. You may think this is an exaggeration but it is not.  If a Russian was ever visited by someone from the KGB, they had a good chance of disappearing.  KGB only visited you if you where a problem and they ended the problems.  Communist mentality is if we say things are fine, they are.  China has very much that mentality.  They fear what happened to the USSR will happen to them.  They cannot stop the flow of info like could in the past but they will lie to your face and not blink an eye.  People have known to disappear and China's social media shows people talking being arrested and doctors threatened and arrested for diagnising Coronaviris.  China would be on fire and the Communist government would tell you everything is fine while having people sing and dance behind them with panda bears doing circus tricks so you would not see the fire in the background.  They are lying by far on how bad it is.  You only close off cities and build hospitals to house the sick to stop a pandemic.  You do it to stop something uncontrollable and already out of hand.  Something that kills more people than what China is saying.  It is not a problem in other countries, so you should not go crazy with worry.

The best part of the caucus is that it's a head count. There were roughly 150 democrats that showed up in 2016 from my district, a slightly larger number of republicans sat on the other side of the gymnasium conducting their own slightly less chaotic primary. Trying to keep track of all those grumpy old farmers on our side of town during voting is impossible. With out fail every count must be done twice because someone's in the bathroom and the numbers don't add up. I sat with the O'Malley group but we only had half a dozen people. After the first count they give you a break to regroup and we got to argue with the local Hillary representative before sitting with Bernie. That next count took forever because some people had decided to leave but hadn't told the man with the clipboard so the numbers were off.

Down playing someone's emotion is a game narcissists play, and I have experienced that first hand. I stayed in an abusive relationship because I thought I was the one with the problem. I remember actually thinking to myself, ""well, if I hadn't yelled at him, he wouldn't have hit me. I deserved it."" Now, I'm no saint in that regard, either. I tried to force him to stay and talk to me, and got physical with him as well. I would grab him, I would push him, and I would also hit him. It wasn't until I got help that I realized that I wasn't just the victim, but also a perpetrator. Who's to say that he isn't guilty to a degree, either? I think this situation isn't for anyone to judge until we see all sides of the story. I am a huge fan of Depp, but I know everyone is human. I hope he isn't what she claims him to be, but I cannot say that he is entirely innocent, either because I lack the knowledge of thier intimate life. It's hard to recognize your own fault when you've been beaten down physically, emotionally, and mentally. I'm glad I was able to see my own faults and hold myself accountable.

2861,UgwvCb0Of2ZU2Vmh1Jh4AaABAg,"Nothing about the audio leads me to believe it's mutual abuse. There's a number of times she could dispute him being abusive, and she doesn't. She claims once that he hit her back, and he corrects her by saying ""I pushed you"" (he pushed her to get away from her repeatedly hitting him, as she admits to in the audio Phil played) and when talking about the fact she's thrown pots, pans, vases, cans, etc, he says the only time he ever threw something was a can she threw at him first; she doesn't dispute that it's the only time, and neither say whether or not the can actually hit her. There's surveillance footage of her without any marks on her face, her mood changing whether the case is in her favour or not, as well as sneaking James Franco up to their place to have an affair. He has a number of witnesses, and pieces of evidence. Recently, texts were also released that show Amber's mom and dad talking to Johnny post-divorce, saying they love him and miss him, and wish they could work things out. 
The audio clip is an hour of Amber manipulating, gaslighting, and abusing Johnny verbally. The way she speaks to him is not the way an abuse victim speaks to their abuser.

It's tragic that men who are abused are rarely believed... now there's always two sides to a story, but from what that tape sounds like... possible self-defense? Sounds like he had tried just leaving the situation (which tbh is a valid tactic if there is an argument, you can tell your partner that you'd like to continue the conversation once both of you have had a chance to cool off, regain rationality so you don't say or do anything hurtful. In the moment while you're having the argument and you're riled up and angry you don't think clearly but once you regain composure you're much more likely to be able to see where your partner is coming from/that you're being irrational/etc)
It's possible that it was mutual abuse too. But her admitting to hitting him, diminishing his pain saying a slap isn't as bad as a punch, calling him a baby for being upset/trying to leave... doesn't shine a very favorable light on her. Yeesh.

There are headlines from major organizations painting face masks as literally useless as protection from illness.

All medical face masks provide some form of protection. 100% fact. The difference is how effective they are, with generic surgical masks providing the least, while ones like the popular N95 masks providing much better protection. When headlines and opinion state that face masks are unhelpful or useless, they are literally trying to mislead you. What they are often actually saying is that compared to normal proper hygiene, it is not as effective. That is also (generally) a fact. That does not however mean that face masks are an ineffective measure to protect yourself, assuming you are using it correctly and effectively (e.g. not touching the main part of the mask, using it only for a short period of time, your nose/mouth does not make contact with the mask, etc).

2963,UgzozsO1-6uw-SH9NZF4AaABAg,"I went through something very similar to Depp. My first love was someone i thought i could spend my life with. But whenever things became tough and tensions were high, she became someone who was physically and verbally abusive. The further i tried to create space, the more vindictive she became. I once had to lock myself in my truck after a failed talk in an attempt to set in motion  a peaceful breakup. On the outside she SCREAMED the most vile things you could tell someone whom you knew their every weakness, their vulnerabilities, their fears. For me it was to tell me my father who commited suicide when i was 15 ""never loved me"". That i'd ""be a failure like him"". As she raged smashing the outside of my car with her fists and eventually a shoe and other objects.  I sat paralyzed in my seat. In the attemt to keep stockholm out of my head, i was immobilized by the fear of hurting her(emotionally) while wanting so bad to flea from the hurt that i was undergoing. To resist giving her everything she wanted just to make it all go away so that she could go back to loving me, to the good times.

Eventually the screaming caught the attention of a witnes. Someone who saw this in the parking lot and who contacted the police. It wasn't till after talking to a female officer that day that i realized i had never even thought of a man being a victim of abuse. This is what you're told as a man: you never hit a woman, i despise violence, check; you remain and take it like a man, okay i do nothing, its probably my fault even when its not, check... I didn't press charges because i loved that person, and i knew she could change if she truely tried. Update, she did for the most part. At least from what i can tell as somewhat distant friends who hardly ever talk. But ive heard good things from others so I'll give her the full benifit of the doubt.

But im saying this all in an effort to let people know that abuse occurs both ways. That from someone who's been on the end of conniving vindictiveness of what a broken person is capable of..  You shouldn't always just jump to believing someone because they're of a certain sex or because you have an affiliation to the team. Men have privilege, we certainly do. There are also privileges which women recieve. The system favors a woman in these instances, and as a society we need to be vigilant in ensuring that it's not being abused and used as a tool to hurt others. In somecases the men whom they perceive have wronged and hurt them. I've seen this in divorces and child custody of close guy friends more than once over the years. Its important to support victims, but its also and somewhay equally important to establish the truth before inadvertently creating another victim via public humiliation, exile, the figurative execution of ones personhood. If you're one of those people who jumps on the hype train, i beg you to reconsider your ways. The process at which you come to a conclusion could seriously hurt other people.

This evidence shows that it's very likely that his wife was the abuser. Though a court case should be fully heard. Whatever happens and whomever is at fault, people should have a chance to redeem themselves. To put forth an effort for change before being relegated to banishment from the public sphere. So no matter what happens i look forward to seeing Johnny in the next Grindelwald film. The Potter stories have served as an escape for me over the years and i think he has every right to be in those films.

Unless they had recorded the entirety of their relationship there's no way to definitively prove who did what. But from the evidence put forward thus far she sure seems to be the main abuser.  The relationship was clearly horrible and toxic. 


That audio recording is long and throughout she seems unhinged. She's manipulating him and trying to explain away her abuse in any way she can. In the video with the wine bottle he never actually threw it directly at her. While she has now repeatedly admitted to slapping him, punching him and throwing heavy dangerous objects directly at his person. And the horrible cut to his finger. 


Even if he did throw things back eventually and then got physical. It really doesn't seem like he was the instigator or had a pattern of abusing her like she did him. She even admits to doing these things. Because she was frustrated with him removing himself from these bad fights. And tells him he can't expect better. It's sickening.

Having heard the whole audio, it's heartbreaking. Heard continuously downplayed her physical abuse on Johnny, often mocking him, while also believing that 'fighting' was healthy. I'm just glad people are standing by Johnny now - notably women. The JusticeforJohnny hashtag on twitter was mostly spearheaded by women who believed in Johnny's innocence. Pay attention to that fine detail, as many social justice warriors out there will still have everyone believe this is a fight for 'women's rights' - it's not.

But we do know by this audio that Heard actively gets physical, is aware of it, and doesn't seem to show remorse for it by saying ""I cant promise I wont do it again."" Depp is the one who says if the relationship becomes physical, it needs to end, even though he loves her. Him giving her an inch and she's trying to take a mile, by my take on the convo.

Women try to be equal all the time saying that they want equality but then they cry wolf and play the victim whenever they get in trouble and try to push the blame off on the others.

These elongated “he said she said” arguments in public make me feel used as a consumer. With the clicks on articles, with the shares of articles and the tweets about a topic, the consumers shape an argument between two people and also their lives, creating and destroying career opportunities.

Yeah... I have always sided with Depp on this one. His family and past wives and girlfriends all came out as saying he was a gentle person as well. It was always clear that she was just using him for money, fame and when that ran out, she used him to be painted as some sort of ""symbol"" against domestic abuse. Glad to finally have the proof to back up my feelings on the matter. And not just because I was/am a fan of his movies either.

Edit: Look at past cases of sexual abuse or domestic abuse. Once one story comes out on a person, DOZENS of stories come out on that person. It's been YEARS and literally only ONE person, and her personal group of friends, have spoken against Depp. Everyone else that Depp has ever met and formed a relationship with has always supported him 100%. That is VERY telling in my book.

3303,Ugw7KcUb4Z8T2ilFY2t4AaABAg,"My thoughts: 


As a guy that's been abused, and couldn't speak out, I feel for Depp. I've been there. It's terrible. However, I'm not entirely sure what he was going to expect from someone nearly half his age... especially a girl that's grown up being spoiled, and literally only got into modeling because Daddy wouldn't pay for her to live in NYC any more. That's the entire reason why she's famous to begin with, she gets told ""No"", and because she's fairly attractive, someone else helps her get her way.
He knew these things and stayed, he was abused and he stuck around. At some point,  and this applies to any relationship, the abuser has to acknowledge that they are continuing to let it happen... they have to admit that they have some level of blame in the situation themselves. 


Another election story... here's a reminder that, especially when it comes to Presidential voting, YOUR VOTE DOESN'T MATTER. If it did, the Electoral College wouldn't exist. Yet, it does, because politicians don't want the input of the citizens. They want to govern without any interference.

3431,UgzE4C6eDC0_p2SjX4l4AaABAg,"I also think it’s important to mention, in the audio, Johnny Depp said how the only time he did anything besides push her off of him while she was abusing him was throwing cans back at her that she initially threw at him and she didn’t deny this. She didn’t fight him saying that he did more than that. This is the single biggest reason I believe her assault allegations are bs. Why wouldn’t she mention the physical abuse she was enduring if it was actually there at that point? It wasn’t like she couldn’t have interjected, after all the audio was mostly just her manipulating and emotionally abusing him. You also look at videos of them together during the marriage and she never looks bad while Johnny looks extremely depressed and scared of her always. At one point, she said she wanted to go wherever he went and she was so happy about that while Johnny literally looked so terrified and uncomfortable about it. She also went out the day after she was supposedly hit by Johnny and gotten the black eye and nothing was on her face that next day. Upon doing research, I genuinely believe Amber was the abuser, not Johnny. She was arrested before for abusing her ex girlfriend so this isn’t new either. She was viewed as “the perfect victim,” because she had “the perfect victim,” to take things from, I believe. No matter what, this is a shitty situation beyond belief, and I do side with Johnny, but I can’t say for sure as it wasn’t me in that relationship.",Claire Eileen,0,2020-02-03T23:34:34Z

When has China ever approved anything that the US has done? Never. So that automatically makes their opinion of our reaction worthless in my eyes. 

The virus can survive five days on a smooth surface. It's far more contagious than SARS and MERS. It can give you pneumonia. Yes the recovery rate is fine now because they're giving us the numbers they have, not the actual number of cases and deaths. China has yet to describe what ""recovered"" means. Does that mean the person doesn't have the virus in their system anymore? Or do they just feel good enough to leave the hospital?

I did some digging, and it appears that reasons why the amount of infected is way more than SARS in 2002 are a combination of factors:
a. the 2019-nCoV has a relatively longer incubation period (14 days) comparing to SARS (7 days), during which the virus can spread. A lot of people may spread it before the symptoms profess themselves.
b. the 2019-nCoV occurred during the Chinese New Year, when (according to some) as much as half of Chinese population would be traveling back and forth within China, increasing the probability of spreading the virus.
c. modes of transportation have significantly improved from 2003, making it easier for the virus to spread.
That being said, I heard there were also major government oversight from the officials in Wuhan. Word is the entire leadership in Wuhan was relieved of duty. 
As of now, there are 11 confirmed cases in the US. Considering the virus is now on everybody's radar, I'm optimistic that this wouldn't be an overwhelming problem for us to panic about, but still, BE CAUTIOUS!",Youyang Zhou,0,2020-02-03T23:31:40Z

3526,UgyfFZplAXoBSQr5ZvB4AaABAg,"Not gonna lie, tad bit disappointed with the coverage of the Heard/Depp situation. I understand needing to remain impartial, but there were so many more damning clips in that audio. Could've shaved down the sponsor or TIA if time was an issue.

In the audio, she admits to throwing all kinds of objects at him. Berates him nigh on constantly, calling him a ""baby"" and a ""coward"" for leaving when she starts becoming violent. Throws homophobic insults at him and his friend. Compares herself to a wild, uncontrollable animal being poked with a stick, which is a common comparison abusers like to make to blame their anger on their victim. Forced a bloody Xanax on the man. The audio is a goldmine of confessions from Heard, and all of those individual confessions needed to be showcased. There are people out there unwilling to listen to the audio at all, hence why it's so important to spread this.

It's important too, because the mainstream media seem to be shying the eff away from the story. So I thought, and was hoping, that you guys would go *all in* on it. No need for Philly D to take sides, even. Impartiality still in tact. Let Amber Heard speak for herself, because that content was entirely damning, and people needed to hear more of it.

If anyone happens to read my comment and hasn't yet listened to the audio in full, please go and do that. It's disturbing to listen to, but it paints a pretty clear picture of what went down, and the dynamics of their relationship. Amber Heard is awful, and I hope one day adequate justice is served.",Cosmic Owllie,1,2020-02-03T23:27:37Z

Johnny donated her divorce money to charity in her name since Amber kept saying ""i'll donate all the money to this charity!"" (I believe it was the ACLU?). When he did that, Amber flipped out and demanded more money so SHE could donate herself. She also sent Johnny a letter demanding three penthouses, the cars they owned, and $50k a month when they divorced - if he didn't do that, she said she would accuse him of abuse. Johnny also has multiple witness who saw her abusing him - she doesn't. She also refuses to give metadata over for her photos and her parents said to Johnny through texts (which have meta data) that Amber's lawyer told her to lie about abuse.


This whole situation is crazy and anyone who has been following it closely will know that Amber is almost 100% the sole abuser in this situation and lied for attention and fame and to spite Johnny for wanting to leave her (he left her and that prompted her to file for divorce)",Aerith Colfer,0,2020-02-03T23:20:47Z

3638,UgyqJqZt9N8WMpLuNEV4AaABAg,"The Johnny depp case is something that I’ve sat back on for awhile. There wasn’t enough evidence or information to know who was actually in the wrong, but you still saw people jumping to one side of the other usually to defend the person they already liked more. I still however don’t think there’s enough evidence to soundly make a call on what actually happened on this relationship. Clearly we know now that she was violent towards him, but we don’t really know how much of that was aggravated or if it was totally on her. 

As someone who’s been in an intense abusive situation, I know that you can only take so much. I eventually fought back, and when I did my abuser used that against me and had the police on his side. It would be great to have more audio and evidence released, to see if there’s any discussion about him starting physical fights. But from the clip we do have it definitely seems odd for them to discuss her physical violence without her mentioning his aggressions if there were any. So again for now I can’t “cancel” either of them or take a side here. I just think its sad that a personal relationship got so out of hand and is having to be released to the public like this. 

If someone is being mentally or physically abusive to you in a relationship you should take every step to get out as soon as possible no matter what. They’re unlikely to change, and you’re worth more than that.",anon,0,2020-02-03T23:19:23Z

We have a dangerous double standard in this country.  There are many places where women get the short end of the stick, for sure, but when it comes to things like domestic abuse, custody, child support, etc, women are often given preferential treatment or just given more credibility than men.

She said every argument made against me, especially everytime i broke down and cried from being beaten or emotionally abused.  

On the receiving end you never know what the hell they expect as a response to their actions but you sure as hell know that they will keep pushing you until they get it or grow bored / calm down. 


It's honestly the scariest time of my life. Frequently I would be reminded (after the same as what amber herd said or similar) of how she would dream of stabbing me or killing me in my sleep. 


I never want anybody to suffer that again. It has been years since but i had an awful flashback the other day when me and my new partner (who treats me insanely well who i am so glad for) were unsure as to where to eat, but with the ex who abused me it was a matter of if i didn't know or didn't decide before her then she would beat the shit out of me for indecisiveness.  This also extended to wanting something she didn't want and how i am the asshole who deserves to be beaten for not knowing what she wants. 


30mins later I need to stop crying to collect the delivery, and if i don't feel like eating then you know what happens next. 


Arguably the worst 5-6 years of my life. it broke me. Not only on the experience, but as a male for how you have absolutely nobody to talk to and the feeling that nobody will understand.",elboydo,1,2020-02-03T23:13:35Z

If someone is psychologically abusing you or abusing you with words and you leave, you remain the victim, if your psychological abuse makes you physically abusive you are no longer the victim, Physical Violence is not a proper response to verbal or psychological misdoings.

If you are being abused in any way regardless of what you and the person abusing you have between your legs, Get out, Get Help, there are fewer resources for men to get help in these cases but they do exist. Do not Suffer abuse, if someone is abusing you, they do not love you and you can not expect for them to change to love you, you may love them but it WILL be better for you to never see them, or hear from them ever again.


I know that the first bit of this comment sounds kind of Victim blaming, saying that a victim of one type of abuse lashing out physically then is no longer the victim, but the point is that you can HAVE been the victim of verbal or psychological abuse, but that is not an excuse for physical abuse in return. If you abuse your abuser you give them power, and it stops mattering who started it how, and starts mattering who did the most damage, and that is not what we should be seeking to find when dealing with abuse what we should be seeking to find is who is the abuser and preventing them from abusing their victim.",Phantombit,0,2020-02-03T23:09:11Z

3856,UgxI_RpAmvEEZr0zk2d4AaABAg,"Something people forget about the Depp/Heard issue is the age/power imbalance: while I personally have completely no idea what has gone down re the violence in their relationship, it cannot be denied that he was ALWAYS older, richer and more powerful than Amber, down to the fact that she is a woman and he is a man, and yes, men are usually going to be physically stronger than women. That is fact.

The problem with mutual relationship violence/in a marriage, is that yes, I think women DO abuse men probably nearly amount as the reverse, however when a man hits back it can do FAR more damage than a woman hitting a man can, in general broad strokes. Of course I am generalizing, and NO violence towards ANYONE is ok, but the odds are stacked against Depp and while again, I honestly don't know who did what, I still think it is marginally more likely that Depp hurt Amber more, in the short and long term--but I am open to this being disproven. 

Amber was a 23, 24 year old rising star.
Johnny was a super-famous established, respected actor. 

There was always a power imbalance in their relationship.

It's a he said/she said story. It's no different from when you stop a guy from hitting his girlfriend only for that same girl to turn around and curse you out for butting in. People are so backward. Going from one side to the other. If she were to upload a picture of a stab wound then would everyone suddenly be on her side again? If he uploads something about her will everyone then be on his side again? Stop being hypocritical. The truth is that no one but them knows what really went on.

3890,UgwCj2uLx9GzuX48Jr54AaABAg,"I know almost nothing about the Johnny Depp/ Amber Heard case, so I have no opinion about who is ""more"" right. However, as a woman who withstood significant emotional abuse for years, during which time I slapped my boyfriend three times and kicked him once, I sympathise with the idea that it's not a black and white situation. It is still something I would take back in a second, and I consider it the worst thing(s) I have ever done. However, it was definitely retaliatory. After 4 hours of an adult man literally screaming at you, trying to rip you apart and hurt you as much as possible, sometimes in a very physically threatening way, it can feel absolutely as if you are fighting for your life and you need to do whatever you can to fight back. I cannot stress enough how scary it is. It feels like there is just one hair trigger between him screaming how horrible you are and him deciding he needs to physically attack you. I was physically hurt a few times during this relationship, and once it has happened the emotional trigger is there and you are constantly terrified it will happen again. Hence the feeling of fighting ""back"" for your life. I do not in any way condone or legitimize these actions, and like I said I am extremely ashamed of them. I have been led to believe from research while trying to heal and from a therapist who used to be a police officer that woman very often are fighting BACK, and are not as often the initial aggressors. Again, often is not always and any physical assault is always wrong, but it is NOT a situation we can see clearly from the outside and judge with any accuracy.",Katherine P.,0,2020-02-03T23:05:04Z

2nd story: While I am a registered republican I think that the nominee will either be Bernie, Elizabeth or Biden. However if the democrats want to win they should have gone with Tulsi Gabbard. From what I hear she is a bit closer to the center then the other democrat candidates and that is what you need right now, your not going to take any votes away from Trump Supporters with Bernie or Warren. Tulsi is former military which nearly every republican loves, some of her gun restrictions policies while controversial with republicans I think are actually mostly supported by them, most likely a small majority or high minority.

3951,UgyZ0rEFhnJgz9hNDO54AaABAg,"Here are my thoughts on Heard and Depp. When something like this breaks out, there's usually a swarm of so called friends and employees and exes that jump at the chance to share their story of problems and trauma with an individual. Strength in numbers etc. With Depp not a single person outside of Heard's circle include his ex fucking wife had a bad thing to say about him. One of his best friends made a youtube video literally explaining everything she did to him that only now has surfaced. Heard fits the description of a narcissistic sociopath. Where they constantly lie non stop and play the victim and alway project onto others what they are doing themselves. ie. All the things Depp did to her, she actually did to him. I always backed Depp, and nothing to do with him being a man, just purely based on the stories of love and support and witness accounts that came out IN DROVES defending. 
Case in point, the same has not been said or done with regards to Casey Affleck, James Franco, and that comedian in Deadpool and Silicon Valley. A loooot of people and friends coming out confirming their shitty behaviour as well as actual evidence. 


I hope Heard gets taken to the cleaners. Given the volatile nature in Hollywood, sh'e done some damage for the metoo movement. Elon Musk even tweeted ""Dodged a bullet there"".",gingergreek,791,2020-02-03T23:01:42Z

3958,UgwR6nBl_rcMeo4mnwN4AaABAg,"Hey Phil, I’ve listened to the whole audio, and as a social worker who’s worked with both DV victims and perpetrators, I’m still not sure but I’m erring towards supporting Amber. I get the urge to want to protect our heroes, I loved Johnny Depp for so long but having worked in domestic and family violence for a long time, I feel he is clearly gas lighting her and setting her up. We need to remember that Amber is only in her 20s here, this is one of her first real relationships with someone she clearly adored, Johnny is in his 50s and has age, experience and Xanax on his side. Note that he repeatedly asks her to send him the tapes since they’re being recorded on her phone. When he talks about her violence he names exactly what it is and what happened: YOU threw cans at me in Australia, YOU threw pots and pans, YOU punched me last night, but then sometimes he’s super vague about random acts of violence like when he says “if you had spoken to me nicely it wouldn’t have gotten physical those times”. It’s likely that during those times he’s actually describing his own violence, not hers, he just knows well enough not to record himself admitting to something, whereas she is too gullible and naive.

When women are dragged into a DV relationship, they often do become violent themselves, whether it is in self defence or whether it is in an effort to just get the beating they know is coming over with. There is a lot of documented research about this phenomenon. Many women describe an intuitive feeling where they know an outburst is going to happen and so they subconsciously bring that about through their own actions in an effort to control their situation.

I think we need to be careful before taking a position here. He’s smart enough to play the game, she thinks she’s involved in a meaningful conversation to repair their relationship. That’s why she takes responsibility for her behaviour and he controls his delivery and hides his actions with vagueness. Note that he says she attacks him when he means she criticised him verbally and he doesn’t correct her when she points that out. Also when he calls her losing her marbles when he just means she’s stressing out about something. He overplays what she’s done and underplays his actions.

I ask not because I do or don't believe either of them as not all evidence has come out (as clearly has been shown), but because her lawyers pushed back suggesting that just because Depp was hit doesn't mean that she isn't also a victim. It may be telling if in a relatively long clip where Depp is bringing up physical violence with her and she admits to it that she would not also mention any potential physical violence that she may have sustained.  Of course, we don't know at what time during this relationship this occured (although it does not appear to be towards the beginning based on the language used) and that may impact the facts in the tape since the facts could have changed later on.  Whatever the case, I do hope the truth becomes known, not because I want to put my nose where it doesn't belong (especially since it's already a somewhat public matter), but because I do not want anyone else to be further hurt physically, mentally or yes, even in terms of ones career.

Worse part is even after it's proven that Amber was not just some victim but also an aggressor do we get an apology? Nope just more denial, the man is still bad and that's the narrative her team will run with. Congrats to these type of women, you are actively hurting women who are actual victims of abuse.

Mind you, I'm not saying don't believe women, I'm saying when someone claims abuse take the claim seriously, get authorities involved and investigate but do not immediately assume either party is guilty, there's a reason our court system is supposed to be always innocent until proven guilty, to avoid this exact shit.",DarkBunnyLord,0,2020-02-03T22:49:09Z

What Amber has done and admitted to in that audio is disturbing, disgusting, and disappointing because her actions directly hurt women who have actually been abused. I’m truly saddened for Depp. 

I’d also like to point out that abuse is not a just one time thing. Abusers dont stop at one person. Depp has never been accused of abuse by any oh his previous partners, on the other hand; Heard has.",Unlucky Benny,1730,2020-02-03T22:44:43Z

Awareness needs to be raised for physical abuse against men. So many people think men cant defend them selves. But that's not fair. Both women, and men should be able to openly defend themselfselves if they are being attacked without being criticized. The fact that shes lieing, or that she lied, takes time away from actual abuse cases that need to be handled. I hate Amber Heard. She's disgusting. As someone who has been hurt like this before, especially the gas lighting thing. I can say I confidently hate that women. His whole reputation has been tarnished  and I can only hope he will bounce back, and she will have her career tarnished. She doesnt deserve to have the career she does.
