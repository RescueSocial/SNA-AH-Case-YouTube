Mariah probably did a few people a favor by saying only  unattractive should apply , they'd not only be wasting her time but theirs as well. She could've said looking for someone closely resembling  Mrs Doubtfire.  As  an older lady I get it. I might've applied in my older age but when I was younger I had absolutely no trouble finding a date. I probably would've known not to waste my time had she said no attractive applicants will accepted.  But when she said only unattractive apply it certainly comes across as very shallow, snooty, uppity & almost to be expected from a rich arrogant person.   But I understand why she did it, she's insecure & blunt didn't want model types wasting their time or hers.  Still isn't right , horrible crazy thoughtless way to place a wanted add.

Part of it is a manipulation, to convince the narcissist he doesn‚Äôt need to be around other people. This type of person often even shames their target, when he wants to associate with other people.
She didn‚Äôt really love him, so she had to manipulate him.
Amber was trying to convince Johnny that she was just like him and that understood him, by pretending to be like him.
Johnny is a bit of an intellectual, so she pretended that she is into books.
She quickly scrambled a library together, and got rid of her trashy paperbacks when she got together with him.
She also bought a typewriter, because he had one.
Another example is that Amber dressed entirely straight and preppy before and after Johnny, but she began dressed BoHo when she was around him.
Despite her ‚Äústage props,‚Äù the truth was, that they were very different people.
Johnny wanted privacy, but she secretly called the paparazzi whenever she went out.
Being a narcissist, she had to have the constant attention.
Johnny is a bit of a hippie, into love and peace. Yet Amber wanted to fight and aggress.

106,UgzzJTueTZ-bgt0vKId4AaABAg,John Caccioppo,"@The Snowflake Diaries These are basic primate instincts.  ""Narcissism"" as most people think about it, is a product of fearing social isolation.  Nothing is more terrifying to a member of a collective species than being left alone to die violently, or with no sense of purpose, unloved.  

Some people become more psychotic the more they think they are alone, or unworthy of love, then they do horrible things to prove to themselves that they can still get love and be evil simultaneously... a ""wicked game"", so they don't have to live with the fear that others will prove them wrong, they fight constantly to terrify others and prove their power and status.  Many people even use the culture wars to do this which is the reason I think AH chose to become a ""Me Too"" advocate.  

To advise you: beware of beliefs that make you think you are unworthy of love.  They are fundamentally crippling to your mental, physical and social health in a knee-jerk response kind of way.  Narcissism isn't necessarily a bad thing... if it creates a resolvable conflict, if you can use a faux pas to educate others that you can be humble and caring, a mistake becomes a powerful tool.  

Even if it looks creepy, it's okay to love the way you want to love and to be loved, so long as you don't intrude on the comfort of others or let yourself be misunderstood.  You have the freedom to have your thoughts and feelings and you don't need to defend them... if you keep them private.  But remember it's also healthy to practice (warm) detachment.  Don't let your passions consume you, there is always uncomfortable work to be done and most of what true love is, is learning to do that dirty work so that others don't have to do it.  (That includes writing uncomfortably long explanations to strangers on the internet that they may never read, which I do a lot, because that's the kind of person I am.)

Narcissism is a fundamental part of the way our society communicates.  Even if you hate it, you better understand it and be willing to puppet and mirror those signals or you won't ever gain traction in any group.  Something I learned from Robin Williams was that it's a powerful thing if you make a joke out of it, while you are doing it.

That said, you need to learn to manipulate others or you will be manipulated.  Controlling others is a martial art: Do not look to begin conflicts, look to end them.  If you fear this and fail to act you may be enslaved by your fear and the reality that some people will seek to control you and, quite often, they don't even know that's what they are doing, or why.

109,UgzzJTueTZ-bgt0vKId4AaABAg,human,"your mother's favorite. I don‚Äôt think the presupposition assumes superiority, I believe people are capable of looking beyond the surface and seeing what‚Äôs real but most people don‚Äôt want to as they‚Äôre too distracted by (almost infinite) reasons.
Eg. My brother has been in a relationship with a girl for over three years who he doesn‚Äôt love and would not want to father her children yet they moved in together last year. It‚Äôs a relationship based purely on convenience, neither of them want to be alone, my brother physically can not function without a s/o, while she needs a relationship for status. They appreciate each other as friends and lovers since they have no one better, but they know they don‚Äôt want to stay together. He knows she‚Äôs a bad person and he doesn‚Äôt want to father her spawn but he ignores those instincts daily besides the occasional (not occasional) argument.
TLDR: I think we can all recognise authenticity, that‚Äôs not me being superior, it‚Äôs me believing in your capacity but also knowing that a lot gets in the way that can be distracting (money, status, family, clout, glossy hair, facial symmetry).
Regarding narcissists lack of empathy: this is also ‚Äòeasy‚Äô to spot based on whether or not someone asks you relevant follow up questions in a conversation and whether they express any compassionate emotion towards you in said conversation. There‚Äôs obviously more to it, but again, if you‚Äôre too distracted being impressed by someone you won‚Äôt realise how little they care about you.

How journalists covered colleagues' harassment scandals 01:26

Story highlights


		Roxanne Jones: Behind every sexual harasser likely stands a woman willing to excuse, cover up or feel sorry for him

		It's hard to deny the reward for silence, but it ensures continued inequality of women, she writes




‚ÄúRoxanne Jones, a founding editor of ESPN Magazine and former vice president at ESPN, has worked as a producer, reporter and editor at the New York Daily News and The Philadelphia Inquirer. Jones is co-author of ""Say it Loud: An Illustrated History of the Black Athlete."" She talks politics, sports and culture weekly on Philadelphia's Praise 107.9FM. The views expressed here are solely hers.

‚Äù

(CNN)Admit it.

Behind every sexual harasser, be he Matt Lauer or the man next door, likely stands a woman willing to excuse, cover up or feel ""heartbroken"" for the abuser once his lewd behavior is exposed. I've seen this time and time again and I know I'm not the only one.

You know these women. Maybe you are even one of them.



In some cases, these women are the personal assistants, executives and co-workers who have benefited from the harasser's success. They've gotten promotions, recognition and raises.

They may commiserate with other women in the ladies' room about the awful boys' club culture. But if you ever accuse a co-worker of sexual harassment or abuse, the last thing they will do is support you. If they have the power, these women may even fire you for causing a stir.



This week, NBC star Matt Lauer became the most recent man to fall amid sexual harassment allegations, which ranged from castigating a woman for not having sex with him after he dropped his pants in the office to sending women sex toys. On Thursday, Lauer apologized: ""... there is enough truth in these stories to make me feel embarrassed and ashamed,"" he wrote. ""I regret that my shame is now shared by the people I cherish dearly,"" his statement said.

When his ""Today"" show co-host Savannah Guthrie broke the news of Lauer's firing on air, she was clearly devastated.



""... I'm heartbroken for Matt. He is my dear, dear friend and my partner,"" Guthrie said on the show. ""He is beloved by many, many people here."" Guthrie added she also was heartbroken for the woman who came forward to tell her story and for those who might still come forward. Her fill-in co-host Hoda Kotb joined the Lauer lovefest.

Why would Guthrie and Kotb immediately rush in to praise Lauer before they even had details of the story? This type of selfish, blind loyalty is what enables these predators to reign with terror over working women in the first place. Must we always show this automatic sympathy for men we know who've shown such cruelty to women?

It's infuriating.

Rumors of their dear friend's womanizing ways were no secret in the media industry, according to Variety. Ann Curry was infamously ousted from the show as Lauer's co-host in 2012, in part allegedly because of her frosty relationship with Lauer, as noted by CNN's Brian Stelter and others. Curry always cited the boys' club environment at the Today's show, as Stelter noted.

The accusations against Lauer are increasing, and they are disturbing. In addition to the stories detailed in Variety, a different woman, who didn't want to be named, told the New York Times on Wednesday that Lauer had called her to his office back in 2001 to discuss a story. He locked the door, she said, bent her over a chair, pulled down her pants and had sex with her. She said she passed out and was taken to a nurse. She told The Times that she didn't report the assault at the time because she felt she didn't do enough to stop Lauer and was afraid she'd lose her job. She quit a year later.

Matt Lauer, Harvey Weinstein, Charlie Rose, Congressman John Conyers, Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore, even our ""grab 'em by the p***y"" President Trump -- all have had women eager to defend their honor, no matter how obscene the accusations of sexual harassment and abuse. Lauer, Rose, and Weinstein have apologized for at least some of the alleged behavior, with Weinstein denying anything non-consensual took place. One of Conyers' accusers is still asking for an apology. Moore has denied the allegations, as has President Trump -- who it was reported this week suggested the infamous Access Hollywood tape may have been a fake or altered, though he had apologized in the aftermath of its release to the press last fall.



The last place sexual harassers can get away with it

Yvette Vega, an executive producer with Charlie Rose since 1991, knew for decades about her boss' crude behavior -- which, according to allegations, include his walking around naked in front of young women who worked with him, and late night sexual fantasy calls. Rose has been accused of sexual harassment by eight women. Still, Vega did nothing for women who asked her for help.

""I explained (to Vega) how he inappropriately spoke to me during those times,"" Kyle Godfrey-Ryan, a 21-year-old Rose assistant in the mid-2000s told The Washington Post. ""She would just shrug and just say, 'That's just Charlie being Charlie.'"" Vega doesn't deny she covered for the predator. ""I should have stood up for them. I failed,"" she said in a statement. ""It is crushing. I deeply regret not helping them.""

Yes, Yvette. You did fail.

Another recent fail for women involves a not-as-famous but still powerful man, Mike Oreskes, who was recently forced to resign from his post as NPR's senior vice president of news after two women accused him of unwanted sexual contact. Oreskes admitted wrongdoing and apologized in an internal memo obtained by CNN. The alleged assaults happened when Oreskes was a Washington bureau chief for The New York Times. He also worked at the Associated Press. Decades later, women at NPR also complained about his alleged behavior.

Said Jill Abramson, who was Oreskes' deputy at The Times and eventually became the first female executive editor at paper: ""Maybe confronting him would have somehow stopped him from doing it to another woman. ... I don't really feel it was in a gray area in retrospect. I should have stopped him,"" she told the Washington Post. Abramson, who left the paper in 2014, is now a lecturer at Harvard.



It's hard to deny the reward for silence, for not supporting women who report harassment. Sadly, Vega and Abramson are examples of this. But silence like theirs ensures continued inequality of women in the workplace and puts women in danger.

It ruins the careers of countless talented, ambitious women. And that should be unacceptable. It's not enough to want full equality, or equal pay, or respect in the workplace if you are not willing to stand up and fight for it when it counts.

According to the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, ""anywhere from 25% to 85% of women report having experienced sexual harassment in the workplace."" That's a huge range, but even looking at 25% means 1 in 4 working women experience harassment. And the EEOC study also said that 75% of sexual harassment cases are never even reported.

I understand that these situations are complicated. Working relationships do sometimes grow into deep friendships, if you're lucky. And it's disheartening to find out that a male colleague you admire and respect, or even call a friend, may also be a sexist pig, or worse.
==
Firing the harasser is not always warranted -- although if reports are true, Lauer had to go. There have been times when I've reported sexual harassment for myself, or other women and men, but I didn't demand the harasser be terminated. I didn't hire a lawyer and try to sue for big bucks. However, I did call for accountability -- a demotion, a record of the harassment in his personnel file, a canceled bonus, mandatory counseling -- some sign that the company didn't condone this behavior. This was not always achievable. Sometimes it was impossible and the abusers were protected.

That's why it's crucial that we continue to speak up and out these sexual harassers. But we must also confront the women in the room who continue to fail us all.",2020-04-01T23:26:41Z,0

Johnny Depp threatens to ‚Äòburn‚Äô and ‚Äòdrown‚Äô ex-wife Amber Heard

By¬†Emily Smith

February 26, 2020 | 12:13pm

Raging¬†Johnny Depp¬†texted that he would ‚Äúburn‚Äù and ‚Äúdrown‚Äù ex-wife¬†Amber Heard, then ‚Äúf‚Äìk her burnt corpse‚Äù during their volatile relationship, a court has heard.

Previously unseen 2013 messages alleged to have been sent by the ‚ÄúPirates of the Caribbean‚Äù star, 56, to actor friend Paul Bettany were read out in London‚Äôs High Court on Wednesday.

Depp, who attended the hearing, was in the room as his texts to Bettany were read aloud.

He allegedly wrote on Nov. 6, 2013, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs burn Amber,‚Äù the court heard.

The court was told he allegedly texted Bettany again that day to say, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs drown her before we burn her!!! I will f‚Äìk her burnt corpse afterwards to make sure she is dead.‚Äù

The court also heard further texts allegedly sent by Depp to Bettany in May 2014, which read: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna properly stop the booze thing, darling‚Ä¶ Drank all night before I picked Amber up to fly to LA, this past Sunday‚Ä¶Ugly, mate.

‚ÄúNo food for days‚Ä¶powders‚Ä¶half a bottle of whiskey, a thousand red bull and vodkas, pills, 2 bottles of Champers on plane and what do you get..???

‚ÄúAn angry, aggro Injun in a f‚Äìkin‚Äô blackout, screaming obscenities and insulting any f‚Äìk who got near‚Ä¶I‚Äôm done.

‚ÄúI am admittedly too f‚Äìked in the head to spray my rage at the one I love‚Ä¶For little reason, as well I‚Äôm too old to be that guy But, pills are fine!!!‚Äù

Depp is in court in London for a preliminary hearing in his libel suit against British newspaper the Sun over an article that alleged Depp had been abusive to Heard, 33.

His lawyer David Sherborne said the case would feature ‚Äúdiametrically opposed‚Äù versions of events from Depp and Heard.

‚ÄúOne person, one side, is lying, and one is not,‚Äù Sherborne said. ‚ÄúObviously, we say that it is Ms. Heard (who is lying), Mr. Depp is 100% clear about that.‚Äù

Sherborne claimed that Heard was not a victim but the ‚Äúaggressor‚Äù in the couple‚Äôs relationship, which ended in May 2016. Depp and Heard divorced in 2017.

Depp‚Äôs lawyer Adam Waldman said, ‚ÄúWhat does the Sun do to keep Amber Heard‚Äôs hoax alive? [Wednesday] in court we learned the answer ‚Äî cherry-picking a fragment of a single frustrated text message to a friend sent out of 500 gigabytes of text and email messages provided.


‚ÄúInconveniently for the Sun, here is what Mr. Depp actually said next in his text ‚Äì that he could never harm Amber: ‚ÄòI am admittedly too f‚Äìked in the head to spray my rage at the one I love‚Äô.‚Äù

The full hearing is due to start on March 23. Depp is also suing Heard for libel in the United States.

Adam Wolanski QC, representing the Sun, told the London court the May 2014 text to Bettany appeared to refer to an alleged ‚Äúaltercation‚Äù with Heard on a plane.

Wolanski said Depp is accused of ‚Äúscreaming obscenities‚Äù on the flight as he slapped Heard in the face, kicked her in the back and threw a boot at her, before allegedly ‚Äúpassing out‚Äù in the plane toilet. Depp denies he was drunk and abusive during the flight.

The texts were revealed in court after previous lawyers for Depp had accidentally shared 70,000 messages from and to the actor with the newspaper‚Äôs legal team

‚ÄúThese texts go to the very heart of the case, they are really very important and set out the claimant‚Äôs thinking in respect of a number of different incidents and his recollection,‚Äù Wolanski said.

Page Six has learned these texts have not been shared with Heard‚Äôs legal team in the US during the discovery process for their¬†upcoming defamation trial.

Depp is suing Heard for $50 million in Northern Virginia, claiming he was defamed in¬†an op-ed she wrote in the Washington Post¬†in which she called for better support for domestic violence victims like herself, but without naming Depp in the piece.

In the US libel proceedings, Heard has previously alleged ‚Äúviolent‚Äù Depp became ‚Äúthe Monster‚Äù on drugs and booze, then beat, strangled and tormented her. She stated Depp repeatedly hit her, ripped out her hair, choked and nearly suffocated her in a Virginia court filing in response to his $50 million defamation lawsuit against her. He strongly denies her claims, arguing she was the aggressor.

In the US court filings Heard stated that she began dating Depp in early 2012 and ‚Äúabout a year into our relationship, I began to witness Johnny abusing drugs and alcohol ‚Ä¶ Whenever he was using, I worried for both of us. He would become a totally different person, often delusional and violent. We called that version of Johnny, ‚Äòthe Monster.‚Äô¬†Johnny often would not remember his delusional and violent conduct after he came out of his drunk or medicated states ‚Ä¶ Because I loved Johnny, I had believed his multiple promises that he could and would get better. I was wrong.‚Äù

On a private jet from Boston to Los Angeles in May 2014, Heard‚Äôs filing of Depp states: ‚ÄúOn the flight, Johnny ordered the flight attendants to give him an oxygen tank, and drank heavily. Johnny‚Äôs handlers told me that he was upset that I was filming a movie with a romantic scene with James Franco the day before. At some point, I stood up, and Johnny kicked me in the back, causing me to fall over. Johnny threw his boot at me while I was on the ground. Johnny continued to scream obscenities until he went into the plane bathroom and passed out, locked in the bathroom for the remainder of the flight.‚Äù

Depp allegedly apologized in a later text message, writing, ‚ÄúOnce again, I find myself in a place of shame and regret. Of course, I am sorry. I really don‚Äôt know why or what happened. But I will never do it again.‚Äù

Heard alleged in court filings that just a month into their marriage, in March 2015, Depp ‚Äî who was supposed to be clean at the time, but didn‚Äôt believe taking ecstasy broke his sobriety ‚Äî went on a three-day bender on MDMA/ecstasy in Australia.

‚ÄúJohnny told me that I had not explicitly forbidden him from taking ecstasy. The argument heated up, and Johnny pushed me, slapped me, and shoved me to the ground before I retreated to a locked bedroom.‚Äù

The next morning, ‚ÄúI went downstairs to find that Johnny was still awake, and that he had stayed up all night, having taken about eight MDMA pills. He was also drinking again. We got into a fight that Johnny made physical, and I barricaded myself in one of the rooms. That didn‚Äôt stop Johnny from busting through the door of the room I was in. By nightfall, Johnny had hit me multiple times, shoved and pushed me to the ground, choked me, and spit in my face.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat night, Johnny shoved me into a ping pong table that collapsed underneath me. Johnny threw bottles through the window panels of a glass door, breaking two panes, and leaving glass everywhere. Johnny then grabbed me, gripping my body and nightgown. He tore the nightgown off, and at some point, I was naked and barefoot, covered in alcohol and glass.‚Äù

She continued, ‚ÄúIn one of the most horrific and scariest moments of this three-day ordeal, Johnny grabbed me by the neck and collarbone and slammed me against the countertop. I struggled to stand up as he strangled me, but my arms and feet kept slipping and sliding on to the spilled alcohol and were dragged against the broken glass on the countertop and floor, which repeatedly slashed my feet and arms.‚Äù

Heard states that the actor was hospitalized, and she was left with ‚Äúa busted lip, a swollen nose, and cuts all over my body ‚Ä¶ to this day, I still have scars on my arms and feet from this incident.‚Äù

However US lawyers for Depp have stated, ‚ÄúMr. Depp never abused Ms. Heard. Her allegations against him were false when they were made in 2016. They were part of an elaborate hoax to generate positive publicity for Ms. Heard and advance her career.‚Äù

A series of recordings of Heard in 2015 allegedly admitting to ‚Äúhitting‚Äù Depp were recently been released to media outlets.

In the audio, the ‚ÄúAquaman‚Äù actress is heard saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry that I didn‚Äôt, uh, uh, hit you across the face in a proper slap, but I was hitting you, it was not punching you. Babe, you‚Äôre not punched ‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know what the motion of my actual hand was, but you‚Äôre fine, I did not hurt you, I did not punch you, I was hitting you. I can‚Äôt promise you I won‚Äôt get physical again. God I f‚Äìking sometimes get so mad I lose it.‚Äù

Depp is heard saying, ‚ÄúI left last night. Honestly, I swear to you because I just couldn‚Äôt take the idea of more physicality, more physical abuse on each other ‚Ä¶ Because had we continued it, it would have gotten f‚Äìking bad. And baby, I told you this once. I‚Äôm scared to death we are a f‚Äìking crime scene right now.‚Äù

He later states, ‚ÄúIf things get physical, we have to separate. We have to be apart from one another. Whether it‚Äôs for f‚Äìking an hour or 10 hours or f‚Äìking a day. We must, there can be no physical violence towards each other. All I‚Äôm saying is we need to take whatever time we need. You need, I need, to kind of let things settle for a minute. So that we don‚Äôt f‚Äìking kill each other or f‚Äìking worse, you know, f‚Äìking really kill each other or f‚Äìking break up or whatever.‚Äù

They reconcile in the recordings and vow to work on their marriage, but soon after Heard filed for divorce after 15 months of marriage. The estranged couple eventually agreed to a $7 million divorce settlement in August 2016.

Reps for Depp didn‚Äôt immediately get back to us.

Johnny Depp reportedly drank heavily and was constantly late on the new 'Pirates' movie set

Johnny Depp‚Äôs unorthodox behavior has helped make him one of the biggest movie stars in the world, but it also appears to¬†be a serious risk to his career.

Often balancing outlandish roles ‚Äî as gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson in ‚ÄúFear and Loathing in Las Vegas,‚Äù in his numerous¬†Tim Burton movies ‚Äî with being the face of a giant blockbuster franchise in Disney‚Äôs ‚ÄúPirates of the Caribbean,‚Äù Depp has been seen as an A-list star who loves to take chances. And it made him beloved the world over.

In¬†the wake of his messy divorce from actress Amber Heard following her allegations that he abused her¬†and recent financial woes, however, Depp‚Äôs superstar status is now in jeopardy.

The¬†stories coming out about Depp‚Äôs behavior while making the latest ‚ÄúPirates‚Äù movie, ‚ÄúPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,‚Äù aren't going to help. They portray an actor in crisis mode.

The Hollywood Reporter¬†delved¬†deeper into the star‚Äôs reported reckless spending over the years and revealed allegations that he was constantly late to set and drank excessively while making ‚ÄúDead Men Tell No Tales‚Äù (opening in theaters May 26).

Not enough liquid money for '$2 million in monthly bills'

Depp is engaged in a legal battle with his former business managers at The Management Group, who claim that the star, despite earning more than $650 million in 13-plus years, there wasn't enough liquid cash to cover Depp's ""$2 million in monthly bills,"" according to The Hollywood Reporter.

The business managers say they confronted Depp about his spending habits, which included, they say, $30,000 a month on wine. Depp has also admitted to paying $5 million to shoot the ashes of his friend Hunter S. Thompson out of a cannon.

Depp has sued The Management Group on charges of fraud and mismanagement, and the company has countersued.

A 'Pirates' staffer was reportedly tasked with following Depp's every move

THR also unearthed unflattering stories about Depp's work on the set of ""Dead Men Tell No Tales"" from production sources.

Depp's lateness to the set of the movie on certain days reportedly led to hundreds of extras waiting hours for the star to show up, causing¬†the movie‚Äôs producer Jerry Bruckheimer and Disney production chief Sean Bailey to huddle to figure out how to shoot around him.

Though production staff raised the matter of Depp‚Äôs tardiness with the star, he reportedly never changed his habits.

""There were certainly days when our plans were challenged,"" Bailey said. ""But no one should underestimate Johnny's passion and commitment to this character and franchise.""

One source told THR that it got so bad that a production staffer was assigned to stake out Depp at the Coomera, Queensland, compound Depp rented while shooting the film. The staffer was stationed outside the house in an unmarked car and was told to alert his superiors of Depp‚Äôs movements, including¬†when a light was switched on in the morning (or in some cases the afternoon), signaling Depp was awake.

""When he got up, he'd turn on the light, and the moment the light went on they'd call the line producer, who would then call the directors [Joachim Ronning and Espen Sandberg]: 'He's up! He's getting ready!'"" a source from the set said. ""They even had a special code term, like 'The eagle has landed.' Johnny had no idea this was going on.""



Filming shut down after Depp injured himself by¬†seriously cutting his finger. According to numerous reports at the time, the injury occurred when Depp was inebriated and had a dispute with Heard. Bruckheimer told a different story to THR.

""We don't really know. He got it caught in a car door, or he got it caught in a sliding door. I've heard a couple of versions,‚Äù Bruckheimer said.

Depp‚Äôs reported drinking and lateness to set also caused an argument between Bruckheimer and Depp‚Äôs then-agent Tracey Jacobs on the ""Pirates"" set, according to a soruce.

‚ÄúShe went over to Jerry and said, 'You've got to do something! You're the producer.‚Äô He said, 'You do something. You're the agent,‚Äô‚Äù the source said.

‚ÄúEveryone was an innocent bystander watching this trainwreck,"" the source continued. ""But when Johnny came on set, he was charming, nice. He's yin and yang.""

Bruckheimer denied to THR that the spat took place.

The reporting is just the latest black eye for Depp, who for most of his career has been able to keep negative press about himself to a¬†minimum.

But so far, at least, it hasn‚Äôt hurt him from landing major roles. Following his cameo at the end of 2016‚Äôs ‚ÄúFantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,‚Äù he is set to star in the movie‚Äôs sequel coming out in 2018. He‚Äôs also wrapped on the highly anticipated ‚ÄúMurder on the Orient Express.‚Äù
