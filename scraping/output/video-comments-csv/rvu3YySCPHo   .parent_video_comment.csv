I could be reading it wrong. 
 
It's really fascinating to look at an analysis from an attachment framework - I do think that would help other's understand themselves and their SOs needs/relationships. It does get complicated in this circumstance when abuse is involved though... because it feels unfair to tell the avoidant person to meet the other's needs when they're being insulted, screamed at and physically attacked. Very interesting to compare to another analysis I just watched though that was looking at the clip as a way to demonstrate techniques and traits of abusive narcissists and possible BDP traits. Your analysis really feels like comes from that place of unconditional positive regard that I think a lot of people really struggle to relate to. Complicated stuff. 

I don't think you came off as blaming the victim here though, and I think your perspective on perpatrators is actually something we can all appreciate because it means that change is possible which ultimately leads to less abuse... That's much more valuable than judging imo.",steph,19,2020-06-19T15:44:38Z

Me as a daughter of a well functioning alcoholic knows that you can't drink a little bit if you are an alcoholic. And I get really mad when I get sad when he says yes to free beer and wine by friends. I know I am aggressive about it. Call his friends enablers that only kills him slowly and that they don't care about him when they pay for his problem.. and I get from 0-100 when it comes to exactly that issue. And I yell, telling him he push my buttons and that's why I get mad. He says he's afraid of my anger even though I have never done anything else that yell and ripped a drawing he did of me. When I get mad he always go to my problems I can't to anything about.. like my MS. That I can't to things that other people can do.. that he deserves a healthy girlfriend.. and that really hurts me. I know I'm mean when it comes to his problem, but he is actively feeding it and he made it a problem. Not by issues in his childhood, but after 20 years of living like a young person and in the spotlight as an artist. All his relationship has ended because he didn't grow up.. and that makes me mad also. Because I have a child.

My guess is that he is pretty passive aggressive, which is equally controlling as a person who is more expressive and direct, but it might be easier to blame the person who is more expressive.  I agree with Kirk about how painful it is just knowing this is out there for everyone to judge.  I just think that‚Äôs terrible.  It‚Äôs kind of sleazy.  And I‚Äôm not saying she isn‚Äôt playing her part as well.  I just feel for both of them too - I don‚Äôt actually think this is such an unusual argument.  But it might be nicer in general if we all get better at understanding each other, if that means walking away from time to time, that‚Äôs actually a great solution to de intensify the situation.  These things take on a life of their own and become circular.  I think Amber might want to walk away more often.  For her sake, because she probably gets very caught up in fear as emotions intensify and it comes across more aggressively as a result.  Kirk, you may not have the entire story about Travis.

58,UgyG3-HQ0ZeuJ635Fvd4AaABAg,"Hello, thank you for sharing your opinion with us. I was in quite a similar situation when starting a relationship with my current boyfriend. I am an Anxious Attachment type and he is more on the Avoidant spectrum. This combination could potentially become quite toxic. We would trigger each a lot - especially the first year was extremely difficult. We both would bring out the worse in each other - he would become even more distant and I would become even more pushy and needy (even if I never have been like this in previous relationships). That caused a vicious cycle of ""pushing and pulling"" that would repeat itself all the time. However, after reading more on the attachment styles, I realized where our problem was. We just sat together and slowly started to work it out - finding compromises that would help us both. We are both very stable now and haven't argued at all for a long time, but it took a lot of patience on both sides. I can imagine it was painful for both of them. However, nothing justifies violence or throwing things at each other. Even more, what Amber did to Johnny when it comes to ruining his reputation and making him a monster - projecting what she has done herself on him is just unacceptable for a normal person (I truly believe she has some sort of a personality disorder - either Narcissist or Borderline).",Jane B,4,2020-02-18T15:41:45Z

60,Ugz-YBVVCIbe0AKI0S14AaABAg,"No matter what, people are always easier on women. Johnny wanted to handle this privately but Amber kept trying to ruin his life so this HAD to come out. I honestly don't see anything indicating Johnny Depp was the abuser. Pushing someone away who is attacking you is not abusive behavior, it's self defense. 

I don't understand how her allegations seemed credible when the police officers stated there was no altercation. The ""bruises"" on her face were only on her face during the short period she had to go to court so the press could see it. There are several witnesses and pictures showing no bruises. A womans word is not enough. Evidence is always important especially if it's someone famous who can get a boost to their career. Amber also has a friend who is at the head of the me too movement and that's why they are still writing articles claiming Johnny depp is the abuser and she is the victim. The me too movement is corrupt. I wish people would stop following all these movements created with a certain agenda in mind.

In addition there's the fact that she's clearly lied about the main perpetrator of the violence (if he occasionally responded that's still wrong, but it's clear that she is the one doing the assault).

67,UgyhjhgvjKRVuBpDQq94AaABAg,"Thanks for a great anylasis.  Pefectly explains personal history of abuse as a child, ties up some loose ends regarding parents and childhood, and that mess affecting  dysfunctional relationships.  Didn't see how avoidant I was.  Since re-evaluating the mess, giving up alcohol and other drugs, rediscovering compassion has helped avoid a path of distruction and selfishness.  It has to be the way out, and I am so thankful to hear the importance of that message.  Disagree with taking a side but agree that both are in the dance.  I made the mistake of saying it's Depp's responsibility to choose a better friend.  I can see now a clear bond and friendship that is also loving.  Mistake to comment about the depth of that friendship, rather the depth and health of that attachment toward each other.  Both are victims of being in an unhealthy relationship, which has and will cost them both emotionally and financially.   Useful understanding how the past comes to bear on the most unpleasant extremes in our relationships.  We are attracted to people for a reason.  My mistake to look for proof of the other's deficiency, when as a friend and partner you are not helping by being in a destructive pattern yourself.  Sadly, we don't see and understand that, very nicely explained by a distorted perception. Not only can I see my ex here, I can also see my father minimising his beating, strapping, smashing my head, when it happened all through my childhood.  His drinking to avoid his own situation.

71,Ugw_ReukYJzCbyfOPEB4AaABAg,"Thank you for being the only outlet I could trust and feel safe enough to listen to this audio. When I heard it came out I felt sick and frustrated. As a woman who was in an emotionally and verbally abusive marriage with a man, I get very triggered when people accuse women of lying about any kind of abuse and assault. I knew any other outlet would have had commentary espousing misogynistic and violent rhetoric toward Amber Heard (if not from the content creator directly but certainly from the subsequent online comments or even simply alluded to) and I simply am not strong or secure enough to handle that.

With that being said (and this is me projecting quite a bit) after listening to the audio, Amber's words reminded me a lot of my ex-husband's. There is no doubt she is showing abusive behaviors, but Johnny definitely, in my opinion, shows them as well. I don't think either of them have lied, I think both truly believe everything they have claimed. (I believe you mentioned this in either this video or another one.) The truth is they are both incredibly toxic as a couple. 

The other thing people need to take into account is the way we are socialized as men and women. Lundy Bancroft is really good at explaining the importance of this in his work. Amber certainly feels like the party in the dynamic who has less power and control because in essence, as a woman, she does. Women usually yell to be heard and men usually yell to show dominance. It's still not an excuse to be nasty and abusive, but it's something that needs to be taken into account.

I want to learn more about thse things. I have lots of girl friends who are preoccupied with their spouse or boyfriend and it drives me crazy. I'm wondering the same thing an avoident would say, they need more hobbies, more friends, and more things to do with their life. I hate the clingy types, I guess I'm an avoident too, but luckily for me I've never allowed myself to be in a relationship with a preoccupied man, but I feel I've been in friendships with preoccupied friends.

I got admit, when a woman is wailing on you, after screaming at you, it's pretty hard to keep calm. Try getting punched and keeping calm. It's not easy. Plus she just gets more worked up with like ANY stimulus. Hence I always walked away. Danger avoidance. 

I went to couples therapy, didn't help. She went to anger management, didn't help. I did try things like staying in the house, in another room etc (which required she acted less crazy). Which helped her in some weird way, but didn't stop the violence at all.

She also didn't let me have female friends. If you ever find this guys - just get out. Leave, don't look back. Her shit, is her problem (well, and her employers, friends, future ex's - but not yours)",Iris Dogma,90,2020-02-04T11:55:02Z

I think what bothers me the most isn't the possibility that both were toxic, it's that she pretended she was flawless and he was a monster for 4 years, leading to his life and career being destroyed while she gets to strive.


This signals either a completely delusional behavior (which does re-contextualizes every single one of her claims), or worse, a deceitful one, where she willingly lied knowing society would believe her.


This is unbelievable.

So why, after all the endless hours upon hours of self introspection and acting alongside a variety of people in emotionally demanding scenes and moments do world class actors not have an attuned capacity to have a greater capacity to help each other in this moment of crisis in a way they might with a theatrical scene? The fidelity needed for the stage or scene can be emotionally draining. What barriers and obstacles are thrown up in this private arena that a professional dimension allows? I'm baffled that they lack the insight needed to help each other.

He talks about throwing something once, in response to her throwing stuff at him (obviously still not ok√©). And she does not dispute that he only once  threw something. Neither does she dispute the push statement earlier. And it seems this was to get distance from her, to get away, because she was hitting him. Compare that to all pans, pots, vases, fists, hits etc she admitted to in this talk and the victim becomes pretty clear. Especially if you consider Ambers statements in which she said to had only once hit him in defence, and that she was never able so as challenge him without physical harm to come to her, this entire talk she is however challenging him......her statements are to easy to pick apart, make everything she said stand on very shaky legs.",Valauthiel,202,2020-02-04T00:14:34Z

I did want to say that lawyers on the case have confirmed these to be authentic tapes, but who knows? Most importantly, he doesn't admit to violence at any point. He said he chooses to leave an argument BEFORE it gets to the point that ""a man actually does pop the wife""...as in he's gotten angry enough, but leaves before reaching that point. We've all been angry enough to actually want to hit someone. That doesn't mean we do it.  (It's also noticeable that he won't say ""*I* actually pop the wife""...likely because he can't internalize the image of himself hitting her, even in the hypothetical.) The push that was mentioned was likely a reference to the incident on a plane in which she came at him and he pushed her off of him. There's a lot of evidence from the court site itself and other ""evidence"" collected by fans that really clear some of this up.

- If you're in a relationship with anyone,  personal, professional or romantic, and every time, you try to speak to them about your feelings, regarding their behavior, and they repeatedly default to running away,  and ignoring you, for so many days, weeks, months, because they KNOW, you need resolution, growth, ECT....and they are completely aware that if they allow enough time pass, that you will be forced to default to either, acting as though it never happened or accepting full responsibility for the whole thing - isn't this emotional neglect/abuse???",The Resistance,26,2020-02-03T17:23:55Z
