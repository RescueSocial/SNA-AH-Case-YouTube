Not only do you recover your identity you  discover aspects of yourself  that you didn't know existed.  And the pain disapates  with every tear shed along the way.

If it was some ones head tt the very least you are looking at a serious head injury possible skull fracture and quite possibly brain damage. Not to mention the fact blood loss and a spray patter of said blood because if she got up after it happened blood would possibly been sprayed and if she didn't surely blood would have pooled where she lay and covered her clothing. Why that compelling and damningly compelling evidence was not photographed I don't know not to mention the fact that it would of required treatment at a hospital surely. Then again what the fuck do I know I was not there or witness to any of it but it seems like she has Wolverines healing ability if she hit her head on that framework why was no wood residue or small splintered wood removed from her or any medical record/s pertaining to said injury? Every part of me is screaming liar at her and her for lack of a better term coconspirators because they have lost a rent free place to live and the perks that came with Mr Depp's life.

181,UgyOk03SeL_GMkp5-Qp4AaABAg,Sophia Jane Art,"@LunaMane  I don't think so. The turnaround and rethinking has long taken place. Women have also been considered serial killers and violent -for decades. There are some famous examples sitting in special escape-proof prisons. In this case, it is more a matter of believing a man who has openly admit his alcohol and drug use than of believing a woman who's pushing out crocodile tears and acting like she's a victim.

In fact, that she still talks about human rights, allegedly campaigns for children (because of her lust for fame, she takes the childs away for photos) and gives a disgusting speech on Women's Day; That still makes me puke when i think about.

She denied or downplayed her alcohol and drug use in court and under oath. It is up to the judge to judge the situation. Johnny was honest. Admitted everything he did. Amber lied and denied everything. Unfortunately for her, most of the recordings show something different.

And no matter how it is decided ... also later sometime in LA .. Amber's career is already over. And when I have to sign umpteen petitions that I don't want to see the stupid one in a movie. That was it with her. The other way around, I'll sign umpteen petitions that Johnny will be our Jack again. I do not care. I will do it. And when I have to write to -Disney, Marvel, DC and whatever their names are-  all of them individually, so I don't have to see Turd anymore: I will do it. Not only because I'm a Johnny fan, but because I think justice is good. And because of what she did to him. She deserves nothing but evil.

Ciao Amber. The best thing you can do is to buy a basement apartment and hide yourself.",2020-08-13T15:39:06Z,2

It would have been far better if they bought the property honestly, it was ostensibly for their son who was going to university in Bristol where the properties were. But the purchase made the Blairs money, ok buying property can do that but they were greedy is the lasting impression that I have. My opinion guys, I remember that it was a scandal back then. I guess it got explained away or something but there is a lasting impression....
Cherie could have been a role model like Michelle Obama, a wife of a world leader that was a success in her own right but I don't see her that way. 
And now she's supporting Amber? A woman who is independently wealthy? Ffs, what about people that are in debt, are caring for kids or parents and being abused by their spouse and trapped? Why is Cherie wasting her support on Amber? It blows my mind tbh.",2020-07-24T19:44:59Z,1
