0,UgzsIbsOmp04p8nOhMx4AaABAg,Nats Laurcan,DC should just kicked her out! This is why I prefer marvel movies than DC's movies ! I'm more loving the DC's villains than they're heroes in movies then Aquaman came and I like male lead and the antagonist but for some reason I don't like female lead .,2020-08-24T16:30:13Z,0

13,Ugwx5zElqjaXTKPI2Ol4AaABAg,Rebecca Vaughn,"Jessica Cox Yes, but she can be a terrible human being and give a great performance. They don’t correlate. My concern was over this mis information/assumption that people who like the Aquaman movie or the character of Mera do so Because of Amber and not in spite of Amber or regardless of Amber. Amber’s performance was fine. Not terrible and not incredible. Just fine. And if she’s recast, half the fans will be glad and the other half won’t notice.",2020-08-20T14:45:16Z,1
14,Ugwx5zElqjaXTKPI2Ol4AaABAg,Jessica Cox,If I may... It's not about any of those things! It's about double standers. All she had to do was open her mouth 👄& lie & Johnny lost everything. Your girl may get movie but she will also get what's coming to her! She's a disgusting human being.,2020-08-20T13:54:17Z,1

20,UgxNF8wmD53lvuWKjFR4AaABAg,Curtis Leeson,@Ann Zagarino hi thanks for reply and sorry to hear that..i was abused by my ex then i left her but found out she did same to my little girl and i now have full custody..my ex got away with it and this vile woman is doing the same with getting away with it its not fair on the genuine men that get abused..its getting a regular thing with men getting abused and people need to take notice more,2020-08-26T08:58:40Z,1
21,UgxNF8wmD53lvuWKjFR4AaABAg,Ann Zagarino,"What a shocker! NOT! As a DV survivor and a woman, I believe BOTH men and women can be abusers and abused! I can’t believe they took your comment down! They will probably take mine down too! Whatever happened to “freedom of speech “? I understand if someone says something threatening, totally disgusting and sick and twisted.. but it seems that all of these forums (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and this one) are just making their own rules up as they go along. It’s incredibly SAD. What that woman has done is beyond disgraceful! If a man did only ONE out of the God knows how many awful (and illegal) things she’s done, he’d be thrown in jail! And I was abused by a man! But abuse is abuse and people shouldn’t be able to get away with what she’s gotten away with. She also is making a mockery of all of the actual men and women who have REALLY been abused. I hope you see this comment before it is probably removed!✌️",2020-08-22T04:47:35Z,3
22,UgxNF8wmD53lvuWKjFR4AaABAg,missdimples1982,"I'm a woman, and I think both sexes are guilty of abuse, but statistics state men are more likely to abuse, but also statistically men are less likely to speak up.  I guess the answer to who gets abused more often won't be answered since its different world wide.  But the really important issue is who cares? All abusers men and women alike shouldn't get away with it",2020-08-19T23:22:22Z,4
23,Ugyf1_2zdwS6WaZaf-x4AaABAg,Holdmyweight35,Completely wrong. People watch the movie for Jason Mamoa as Aquaman... not for Amber,2020-08-25T16:30:50Z,0

26,UgwcqgBZfTgTrB-9dOR4AaABAg,Jacqueline Zubieta,"Francine Pullicino very well written!
Iam a female! My mom was in domestic violence situation for years! I fully agree with you! I support JD to the fullest! I grew up as a Child in a domestic violence home! I also did work shops as an adult. 💯‼️🎯❤️🙏🎸🧨 my hat goes off to you! 😘🥳 No one should laugh or minimize or play with this card! This is very clear and one who has been through this can see the colors at it’s darkest! 🙌🏻",2020-08-25T20:08:15Z,2
27,UgwcqgBZfTgTrB-9dOR4AaABAg,Francine Pullicino,"Holdmyweight35 Just my opinion!!!  Johnny & Amber have been all over the place and people are voicing their opinion I’m just one of the few!! Amber needs to pay for her actions you do not use domestic violence and call someone a Wife beater & think 🤔 that the other person is not going to stand up & defend them self’s! This is a very serious situation &  it should be taken as such!! 
It hits home for me because I am survivor To see this woman Amber heard use domestic violence to boost her career is absolutely disgusting... It’s women like her that make it hard for women like myself when it comes to defending themselves against domestic violence!!!! I am a survivor and that’s why I take it so Seriously 😒 You Should To! Again just my Opinion!!! ☮️ Justice for Johnny !! ♥️☮️",2020-08-25T19:37:59Z,3
