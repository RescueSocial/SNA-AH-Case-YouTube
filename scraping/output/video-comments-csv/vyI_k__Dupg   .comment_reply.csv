Are you being serious it happens all the time the women in these types of situations women are always believed. Johnny Depp was ridiculed by Feminist, it was seen as a break through for women as they had A high profile celebrity to guide the way to stop abuse on women. Amber Heard lied and stole the money from those same people who supported her and never gave anything to stop the abuse. 7million that woman stole and not a penny was seen to any charity. And all these people wanna talk about justice for women when the victim in this case is a man is just plain wrong. I ask anyone to name one case disregarding your own (if you have a story of abuse) where the man doesn‚Äôt come out worse than the woman even when or if she lied.",2021-06-03T23:02:09Z,1

34,Ugy7rqPb89RoH7_Bz814AaABAg,ShayTheSwift_ 432,What about fans who would have loved to see Johnny in any of the roles he was fired from due to amber?

55,UgxyRMcyzaoe9x8XR_B4AaABAg,Kymmberliestarr,@Day Dreamer it shouldn't matter if it was dropped. It shows intent and a pattern. They can use all kinds of records in the court especially when it's in all the paper's being reported. It would be hearsay and they'd have to call her to the stand and she'd have to tell the truth since they are not married or in a civil union at that point or she could be fined with contempt of court is she refused or if caught in a lie fined with perjury. All they'd have to do is get the people who witnessed the assault because I do believe one time it happened while flying. Johnny might have said no to even bringing that one into it if he felt he had enough for his case without getting her testimony.,2021-06-03T13:35:56Z,2
