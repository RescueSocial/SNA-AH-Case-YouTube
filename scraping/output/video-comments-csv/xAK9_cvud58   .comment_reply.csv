13,UgyPuOHayQOqmlYpM-94AaABAg,Mel Matthews,"Wow! You are absolutely correct. This is what happens when you cross paths with an absolute narcissist.
They are brilliant at launching smear campaigns against their victims way before they make their move to discard those unfortunate victims. They destroy your reputation and your credibility so when the unfortunate victims try to fight back nobody will believe them. The narcissist will be so believable that very often the victims don't succeed in showing the true nature of the narcissist in their lives. Perhaps now that a very famous and talented man such as Johnny Depp has somehow managed to win his case, other people who are suffering in silence at the evil behaviour of the narcissist in their lives might start to come forward and get the justice they deserve.
Narcissism is at epidemic levels yet few are fighting, or actually addressing, this horrible behaviour.

No, man. The crazies will accuse you of rape or similar years down the line.

Happened to Christopher Precopia, Andy Signore, Faizal, many more.

Christopher Precopia's ex-high school GF who he only dated for a few months accused him of breaking and entering into her home, assaulting her and carving an x into her chest with a box cutter... years after they ended their relationship. Police came to question him. His mom saved him by noticing her timeline of events is impossible since he was out with family, proven by a timestamped FaceBook selfie she took. 

Andy Signore was accused of SH and sexually predatory behaviour. The texts between the two proved he had a consensual affair with a fan of his, and the texts clearly show her excitement and glee at being involved with him. He was accused years after they started their affair. Cancelled, one of the men on the MeToo ""Shitty Men list,"" and had to spend money, energy, and time in the courts. Luckily he had solid evidence. 

Faizal married his wife and was in love, but after disagreements in their marriage, he finds himself arrested by police out of nowhere. She accused him of beating him and trashing the apartment in anger. CCTV footage inside their building's elevator shows she beat herself up to defraud him and set him up. Took his stuff and didn't give it back.",2021-02-09T21:17:38Z,0
