1,UgzMcCKl9PQCaw6OfsR4AaABAg,"Gotta say I would prefer Emelia Clarke in Aqua Man 2. Frankly, I didnt even know Amber was in the first one. She certainly didnt stand out and wouldnt be missed if replaced. Emelia would be memorable in the role. With that said, even if Amber returns in the role, I still wont know its her. She simply doesnt leave an impression and wont be remembered either way.",Bret Brown,1,2021-07-13T08:43:47Z
