113,Ugy6Wg-kod9MZdFGIVR4AaABAg,begone stink,"@Kastfilms I understand and empathize with Bam's situation, but people with addictions and mental illnesses can't always be helped if they aren't trying either. Only so much can be done with a support system alone, you have to want that change yourself. Unfortunately the producers had to do something before he hurt himself or hurt other members. It's not really their place either to try to help him, since they have a job to do and likely aren't involved closely with his personal life. Even if they were, it seems like the people close to him can't do anything to help, so it's likely they wouldn't have any luck either. 

I do, however, feel like mental illnesses and addictions should be taken seriously and shouldn't be frowned upon as much as it is in the industry, and wish there was more support to help those struggling. However, it may take longer for that to happen among celebrities since they are treated as objects instead of people.",2021-04-23T22:04:59Z,0
