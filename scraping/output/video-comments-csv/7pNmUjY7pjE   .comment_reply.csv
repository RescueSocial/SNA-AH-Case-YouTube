28,UgyBv0wRwJo8GNnjQNF4AaABAg,Frank Conley,@Mark Strange very true. But in the real world the man is guilty in the public forum and walking into trial. I've personally seen this twice with men I know. With zero evidence (physical or police reports) they both were forced to prove a negative in court. One found innocent one guilty. The guilty verdict on her statements alone. Zero past history of any abuse to her or previous relationships. On appeal but he's on bail and lost his job.,2021-05-23T18:18:35Z,1
29,UgyBv0wRwJo8GNnjQNF4AaABAg,Mark Strange,Presuming innocence does not make an excuse to not treat the accusation as if its real. That is a bastarization of whole consept. Yes in court it evidance must be presented to make the case against the accused. But to assume the victim is not telling the truth is not the same a presuming the innocence of the person on trial.,2021-05-13T04:07:43Z,0

Now just imagine having J.D. on Tape saying ""i just hit you but you're fine"" hmm i think his A$$ would be charged within 48h BUT SHE this 🤡 is hopping & mocking around and celebrates herself as ""Queen from the Ocean"" 🤦🏻‍♀️ ..but i've hope now bc of the Police Camera Footage 🍀🍀🍀",2021-05-15T16:03:07Z,3

57,UgxEkkpW9uMVar9bPCV4AaABAg,AeneasGemini,"The worst part about the Domestic abuse of men is that the women often falsely accuse *them* of being the abuser. If the dude goes off the rails and falls apart because of the abuse his GF will use that as proof of him being the abuser to outsiders. 

These women convince themselves of their own lies, in their heads they're the victim because he didn't give them everything they wanted, god forbid he tries to argue back against her or stand up for himself because she sees that as further 'proof' of his 'abuse'. If she pushes him to the point where he stands up for himself or protects himself physically she'll see that as yet more 'evidence' that he's the bad one. 

Everything that happens becomes 'proof' that she was in the right, justifying her further abuse by destroying his reputation,  and society supports it",2021-05-08T14:08:26Z,6
58,UgxEkkpW9uMVar9bPCV4AaABAg,Redman2220,I agree 💯 percent. One thing I noticed is that people haven’t noticed that Johnny is the person that has been domestic abused. When I say people I mean the courts AKA the system. This man loosing so much because this woman cried wolf. Now Johnny is proving he’s the abused and the system is not even recognizing that. It’s amazing to see all his ex wife’s standing for him. That speaks volumes.,2021-05-06T13:53:02Z,7

61,UgyOFpKT_HKuynx_ObZ4AaABAg,Gary Burner,"@Rubielayne Rawlings sorry but it's 2021. If woman want true equality, then you have to accept the fact that if a woman beats a man, it's only ok to hit her back. I'm not saying to beat her into a pulp. But if a woman is physically abusing me I'm not gonna just lay down with my tail between my legs. Best believe imma slap the 💩 outta her. If I'm not abusing you, you aren't gonna do it to me. 
Obviously you're entitled to your own opinion. But seriously. If you think it's not ok for a man to defend himself, you need to take a few steps back and rethink how you view equality.
Edit: just want to add, I've never put hands on a woman. Haven't dated in a while, but I've always got my partners back. I lost a friend of over 13 years when he kept trash talking my last ex while we were together. Honestly with the things he said... He's lucky The Purge is just a movie, because I wouldn't have just walked away from him. Dude would have been a smear on the sidewalk.
