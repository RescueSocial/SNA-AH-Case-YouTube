6,Ugx1NJGUhidaHpoUutp4AaABAg,"Or just don't see the films. I believe that Johnny was getting a salary + back end revenue. Of course he created the character himself and deserves making money from it's success. I just believe that Warner and Disney are facing financial problems and found an excuse to 'dump' him. Amber of course is a liar and an opportunist. If Johnny wins or looses these cases, he will win anyway because he is honest and fans believe him. I worked 20 years as an advocate for victims of dv / sa and am pretty sure l know who is the victim and who is the abuser. Amber is the abuser.
I would not pay or go to these movies. That is the only way not to  support 2 studios for trying to hurt one person's career, while promoting another's career. They have acted like judge and jury.",Linda Douglass,0,2021-01-03T21:31:34Z

Who and what does she have? Her friends and faked/angled/make up filled pictures, her friends (who never saw him be physical or psychologically abusive(!)) and pictures that are faked to look like something they aren‚Äôt! What does he have? Oh, pictures with no bruises when there should have been, video, witness statements from bodyguards, people who worked at the desk downstairs at their building, cops, doctors, audio tapes etc... if you can‚Äôt win with that, and get a ‚ÄúNo, everything points to you doing it‚Äù slapped in your face too, how the f can you win??? The judge is at least so close to the case because of his ex wife and son that he should have excused himself from being anywhere near the case too, not gonna say that it may have influenced his decision, I‚Äôm just saying... gah, this drives me up the wall! At least the judge in the US has admitted a lot more evidence, including more witnesses coming out of the woodwork after she continues to burn her bridges and HER substance abuse issues, which ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt relevant‚Äù in the British court...

If they don't believe the voices of the masses, let them go down with the ship.
WB will learn a very costly lesson, and Amber Heard will never work again because she's cinematic suicide.

Johnny has enough integrity that I'm positive once this is all over, he'll bounce back.
Amber heard was almost completely unknown after this, and she'll be forgotten once it's over as well, and will likely never get work again if anyone has any sense.

These companies may not listen to words, but they'll damn sure listen to dollars if they know what's good for them.
