3,Ugxi-XX6g7lPVKh4k8F4AaABAg,"Heard Mads Mikkelsen might play Grindenwald. Actually not so bad in my books. In Hollywood he has mainly played villains like most Scadinavians do. 

But he has a huge prestigious career behind him and one film in particular is something I recommend you to watch.

It is Jagten or The Hunt from 2013. It was Oscar nominated and the context between the story in Jagten and Depp's defamation is there. 

Jagten is possibly the best movie about slander/defamation ever made. I am 100% sure that Mikkelsen is in JD' support group. See the film. Very courageous but necessary.",Gunnar Freyr Valdimarsson,0,2020-11-27T18:37:41Z

8,UgwLOl8kGKOxc1EOm6x4AaABAg,One of the reasons I never saw Aquaman was because of the Amber  Heard Scandal. Honestly this is hypocritical of WB to even do this. They both deserve to be fired and replace as their personal business scandal is bad for business.,M567dk,0,2020-11-24T01:46:11Z

12,Ugx2Nn7n5hyECgmaYPl4AaABAg,Dude Johnny needs to be in these movies. HE IS captain jack sparrow. And he BELONGS in fantastic beasts. These movies will no longer get my money.,Wild Production's,13,2020-11-23T03:58:23Z
13,UgzbKT59_TG4AQBJdvt4AaABAg,"POTC without Johnny Depp is a HUGE mistake, I watched an interview the other day where he spoke about the character, he invented CJS, came up with all the characteristics and no one else will be able to reach his level. He said that CJS was born in a sauna (his words lol). He went into the sauna that was super hot, sat there for as long as he could to the point where he reached that mental state of madness, and that's how he came up with part of CJS. He also was watching a lot of kids shows due to Lily-Rose and wanted to make CJS fun for all ages. 

When the first movie was in production, the producers didn't like what Johnny did with CJS, Johnny then said that they could fire him if they wanted to, luckily they didn't because they did SO WELL and that's thanks to Johnny Depp!  Also the fact that he went to children's hospitals dressed as CJS to put a smile on kids/parents faces is just amazing, NO ONE can ever replace Johnny Depp in POTC!",Emma P,4,2020-11-23T03:53:36Z

15,UgwS1X5wGrTuzn3lBWF4AaABAg,The first blow to make WB pay attention is not bother with FB3 and then Aquaman 2 while on the Disney front don't bother with any of the pirates movies but then same can be said for Star Wars as their handling of the brand has been EXTREMELY bad but sadly Disney has gone bonkers in resent years and pretty much shut the door on original ideas relying heavily on remakes and sequels,superomegaprimemk2,1,2020-11-23T02:28:16Z

I do support depp for after hearing this case, I think AH is absolutely garbage, need to be dropped from WB and LOreal, and I will NOT pay for any of the movies. Some Feminist are supporting AH but don't they know she, figuratively, listened to a female rape survivor, stabbed her in the back and claimed & twisted her rape story to suit her against Johnny in court? They do know the original victim screamed at AH in court about this? They do know AH faked her victimhood then shouted along those feminist like an episode of Family Guy? If Feminist knew this then they CANNOT call themselves Feminist at all, they are nothing but garbage humans that doesn't support women victims, they just like to complain about things that twinkle on their personal interest - shameful people.",EAprima,2,2020-11-23T02:00:40Z
17,UgyS9z1Pql9yYh69eBp4AaABAg,"Please look at the statistics on domestic violence for 2020. By going to these movies and buying tickets it is essentially telling WB that DV doesn‚Äôt matter; the only thing that matters is making cheep entertainment and WB can keep making their $. There are people who are living in  DV relationships, people who have survived horrific ordeals, and many people who did not survive those relationships. This is an opportunity to bring awareness to  the problems of DV; but by purchasing WB movie tickets, you are drowning out that message. God forbid anyone sacrifice a little cheep entertainment and potential clicks for the benefit of someone else. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs selfish. You asked for comments‚Äîjust saying is all. 
Plus what if you like the movies, then you‚Äôll be giving positive reviews and encouraging people to see them so yah.",Victorious Gavi,4,2020-11-23T01:42:56Z

As for ,Mt. Depp this legendary and humanitarian he is entitled to an apology. We need to keep boycotting, sign partitions, more turn up every day.
