3,Ugz9t7pIsM1YKJjbO9Z4AaABAg,Yana Williams,"Yeah, and an abuser cannot just become an abuser suddenly. His ex's would have 100% mentioned any form of harm to them from Johnny. But they're not. He can't have become violent person all of the sudden. And even if drugs were involved, he can go to therapy or a rehabilitation center to get off those drugs. But again, AN PERSON CAN NOT BECOME AN ABUSER OUT OF THE BLUE!",2021-07-09T00:33:09Z,0
4,UgyVU-OO-3HcxtP4Cfh4AaABAg,Lisa Desouza,"@your average Jojofan 
Sadly, it seems like he has been replaced. The new actor seems to be Mads Mikkelsen (who is also amazing)
But, we will not be able to ever see what Johnny could have done with the character.",2021-02-25T06:55:50Z,1

6,Ugxu-jPXmfs1Tq2-ftJ4AaABAg,Debra Bader,"Ate detective to investigate Johnny Depp. The private Detective talked to 200 people who all said there is nothing to be found regarding Johnny Depp being a violent person. In fact he has been reviewed as a very kind humble person. I wish you all the Luck Johnny Depp. Best, Debra Bader",2020-08-06T22:46:02Z,2

10,UgwwGPhP-cRNccmR6IN4AaABAg,Silky Shish,"I really hope he will win.  I am nervous to about the verdict because there could be the off chance he will lose even though, we know he is innocent and  Amber was the true abuser in the relationship.",2020-07-24T21:01:07Z,1

12,Ugz6q4IsTBLzJEeJ7mh4AaABAg,Silky Shish,"So, what is your point?  You think Johnny is the abuser here even after listening to the audio tape?  If you do, you need to get educated on the behaviours of domestic abusers and physical abusers in general.",2020-07-24T21:03:33Z,2

17,UgxrmkJOaWBRYmHWHRh4AaABAg,L Mac,@Pantheus These leaked tapes were shown on youtube about 5 months back.  I still 5 months later get annoyed when I hear them.  Still the more they are shown the better.  Just need more tv and newspapers to  release rather than just repeating and sensationalising Ambers claims.  So fed up  with my country's media's reporting of this case.,2020-07-23T13:33:49Z,2
18,Ugwq13IXYzo_Sy9DbtR4AaABAg,Silky Shish,@Lexii Loo - Absolutely agree with you.  Guy is an uneducated moron for making a comment like this.,2020-07-24T21:08:31Z,1
19,Ugwq13IXYzo_Sy9DbtR4AaABAg,Silky Shish,"@KingLittle - Oh really?  If you smacked me, you would be in jail.  Try that with me sometime and we will see who the tough guy is.  You are an ignorant and extremely uneducated and low IQ person for making such an asinine statement like this.",2020-07-24T21:07:48Z,2
20,Ugwq13IXYzo_Sy9DbtR4AaABAg,Walter N.,"I disagree with you. But even if you think this, she accused him of abusing her. Thatâ€™s what this is about.",2020-07-23T16:38:24Z,0
21,Ugwq13IXYzo_Sy9DbtR4AaABAg,Aidtom,"Isn't she trying to say he was the abuser, doesn't how strong you are, you shouldn't be blamed on the wrong. His former partners backed him that says it all.",2020-07-23T11:49:04Z,1

23,UgxyMaH2hyakJoEm7A14AaABAg,Kara Wigley,Ok!!! In court she claimed Depp practically held her hostage but on the tapes she repeatedly complains about how abandoned she feels because he leaves during arguments & stays gone. Itâ€™s disturbing how confidently she will still lie even when thereâ€™s evidence that proves sheâ€™s lying.,2021-05-30T05:26:45Z,1
24,UgxyMaH2hyakJoEm7A14AaABAg,Kim S,"""I just reacted and hit you, I don't know what position my hand was in"" as if her hand is a separate entity from her brain/body that she's not responsible for ðŸ¤¦ that'll be her excuse for severing his finger ""I didn't know what position my hand was in or how much force I used when I released my grip on the bottle. I just reacted"". Scary that she's out in the public with absolutely no awareness of her violent actions",2021-05-07T21:27:27Z,1

27,UgxyMaH2hyakJoEm7A14AaABAg,Anny Bothe Ladyline Tattoo,@Thomas Cooney thank you for the comment. I believe this because I was in such a relationship and i can recognize this. She's the strong and powerful part. There is no doubt. Ask somebody who dont speak english to listen to it. You will be surprized what they think. ðŸ˜‰,2020-07-23T10:40:11Z,9
