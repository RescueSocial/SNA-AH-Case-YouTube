3,UgxHHkTR0ARZRbkrBUZ4AaABAg,Mimi B,"Don't worry. I'm almost certain they're not going to pick a side...I mean publicly pick a side till they get a ruling on the UK trial. Untill then everyone is going continue to milk this ""is she, isn't she"" thing till then.",2020-08-23T09:42:27Z,0
4,UgyFVHvj_cpkmY0z73x4AaABAg,Mimi B,"Thank You for this. I've been trying tell people this same thing. It makes perfect sense to me, and I don't blame them. They just want to be 100% certain it's the right thing to do. I mean look what's happening with Disney for picking a side before they had all the facts. But this ""is she, isn't she"" bs is driving me crazy!",2020-08-23T09:34:13Z,2
5,UgxfeOqpVHOsuG-35Et4AaABAg,Christian u,"The thing is, that in this case she should be arrested for everything she has done. If someone does a bad thing that someone needs punishment. And participating in films and gaining thousand of dollars is not something I would want for a liar, abuser and I don't know how much more. She doesn't deserve it",2020-08-19T18:09:30Z,0

11,Ugz1NoF4TOpYxwr_m3t4AaABAg,Geiger373,@Mark Glover It's soo much more convenient to be able to pause and rewind but I did make a point of going to watch the most recent Clint Eastwood movie. Gotta embrace the movie experience every now and then.,2020-08-20T06:22:32Z,1
