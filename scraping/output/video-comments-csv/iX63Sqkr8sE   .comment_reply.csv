8,Ugx3fXyfowlc-SgidIl4AaABAg,Pamela Tingle,"@JOHNNY DEPP youre so welcome. I realize that not every relationship is perfect, but to claim to be a victim when really you are not sends the wrong message. All true survivors would probably agree with me in that it is not something that we are proud of or was a just for fun experience. Most of us truly experience terrible truma at the hands of the person who was suppose to love & protect us. I have always been a supporter of yours - afterall us Kentucky peeps need to stick together. I really hope everything works out and in the most positive of ways. I do pray the light reveals all of Mis Heards lies. Peace, love & chicken grease. ✌️🤟😉",2021-09-23T15:53:45Z,0

My mother is BPD (untreated) with some narcissist characteristics and people who meet her are usually charmed by her, she is bubbly,  generous and talkative and  the fact that not all the good stuff is fake makes it harder to see how toxic she is (emotionally abusive, manipulative, some violent tendencies). But narcissists and sociopaths also haave this charming allure, the link between all these being- they do care about their image extremely, they do love the spotlight and attention so they know well how to trick people.

Not every false claim gets the attention thst Johnny has the fame to garner. So most of the wrongful accusations go unnoticed while someone is punished with 0 evidence. Just the accusation.
