6,Ugz82Ez7VeA68xQgbyd4AaABAg,A.A.,Exactly if he wanted the conservatorship to be over he could tell the judge his daughter does require a conservatorship. And they would work toward ending it. But because he doesn’t want this to be over he’s in court trying to hold on to everything he can. He’s contradicting himself and we can see it,2021-03-08T12:46:52Z,5

20,UgwSKdZavy1oAfA06iN4AaABAg,Jenna Johnson,"@Umme Army My apologies friend I am just seeing your response today. Thank you for clarifying not only your message but the truth to the story! IO seems to get the facts of their stories mixed up often. So I am not surprised at all that the Mr Potato Head story is exaggerated. I'm happy to hear it isn't as mad as it sounded. I think it's important to not only be able to share your opinion online, but be able to have these sort of conversations with others, so that you can get to the truth without vicious fights spiraling out of control and ending up nowhere. I appreciate you having patience to communicate like a normal human being and not losing your shit like many do, it's a sad thing to be thankful for, but I'm sure you can relate to how I feel in some way lol.

21,UgwSKdZavy1oAfA06iN4AaABAg,Umme Army,"@Jenna Johnson I completely understand, my comment wasn’t aimed at you at all. You even stated you weren’t mad just annoyed (which honestly I was/would be too, seriously who has ever been so affected by the gender of a toy that they petitioned to get it changed), I was referring to the people very offended by it, getting mad at trans activist for something they didn’t ask for, and using it as a reason to be transphobic. I only replied to you to let you know what the actual situation was because when I first heard the news out of context, like it has been framed here, I too thought “are your serious?? It’s a toy”. That being said, reading back my comment, I can see how it could easily be read as an angry retort aimed at you, I’m sorry for that, I didn’t intend for it to come across that way. The video did frame it badly, I wrote a response to the people intentionally making it seem as if the Potato Head were cancelled and pressured to make this decision as a general comment under the video. My comment towards you was for clarification purposes only. Thanks.",2021-03-06T21:37:26Z,1

Either way, I hope you're not coming for me for reacting the way I did.

73,Ugzb8xIkAMNoqSyVeFR4AaABAg,Petra Lazic,@Shayf I do get your point but every character has been written the way they were and people then look for someone that fits description they don't shape their characters around actors. Also if you want to do some stunts you should be in shape. Also it is unrealistic and rare that someone who is active all the time wouldn't be in shape. But also in other jobs if you are too short you can't walk on the fashion show or if you work in theatre you can't have face piercing or tattoo shown those are requirements that if you dont meet you can find another job they ain't sexist for they aply to both genders,2021-03-07T07:12:58Z,0

That’s why I, a woman, am pissed that amber did not receive punishment for the crimes she committed, likely because it’s atypical to hear stories about a women abusing a man. But it’s much more common then we know. That is one way inequality of genders and hurt a man. And is a feminist cause.

77,Ugzb8xIkAMNoqSyVeFR4AaABAg,EyeRoseUp,"Well they are required to stay in shape for the role. It’s in her contract. It’s not about equality it’s about a contract she signed willingly. That’s called job requirements and if you can’t fulfill those requirements then your gone. It’s nothing sexist because the other actors have the same requirements. I fully support it if this was the reason. Don’t go all girly and get pissy thinking it’s sexist or how dare them blah blah blah. Because that’s a complete cop out. We want equal rights then we need to be held to the same standards and not given a pass because it might hurt our delicate feelings lmfao. I have worked in a male dominant field as a firefighter for years and then as a physical therapist in sports medicine. It’s hard as hell as a woman in those fields and I never once let anyone give me a pass simply because I was a female. I worked my ass off at the fire department to earn my spot there and find where I could be most useful. I’m 5’2” 125lbs so it was a constant uphill battle and I had to train hard. If I didn’t meet the physical requirements I agreed to then I was not only in violation of my agreement but I was a danger to my crew. It wouldn’t be unfair for them to give me the boot for that. 
You have to stop thinking about what hurts feelings and start thinking about what’s right.
