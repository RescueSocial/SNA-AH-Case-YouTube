Please tell organizations (I contacted Ditch the Label again to stop the abuse against her) and post her evidence online, such as on medium, creating petitions to support on change . org, creating videos, etc. Thanks for supporting Amber Heard.
DtL: ""Yes, you’re absolutely right in that the abuse needs to be stopped. It is of such a high volume which must be so tough to deal for Ms Heard to deal with. I am hoping that we hear back on the progress of our reports soon. I will contact you when we know more. If you have any questions in the meantime, please do not hesitate to contact us via email.""
I really hope one of these reports will actually do something to remove the cyberabuse.
I reported a hate group on reddit which was removed earlier and 4 comments sections on petitions were closed.

I'm worried about her 2nd In-Person trial which is 20 miles from Washington DC, and we see that they refuse to stop hate online or toxicity, which causes violence like we saw in DC this month. The UK is safer than the USA.",2021-01-23T09:31:00Z,2
1,Ugy6qIbVDPUH-oPfqDd4AaABAg,Motivator Network,"Thank you for these great links and points! It's also discovered he left an abusive message to his first wife, Lori, who he settled with secretly for $1.25 million. It's sad how privileged rich men like him, Depp, can have long histories, yet, anything Amber does is looked at with a microscope. 
You're doing great work. There was a case this year in Turkey where a woman, Deniz Bulutsuz, filed a case against her partner who is a soap actor for violence and physical abuse. Then the retaliation against her, the woman, (likely online) has caused their women's shelters to 'no longer be safe.' https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2020/07/turkey-istanbul-convention-violence-against-women-on-rise.html
Sound like Amber? And Amber tried to do humanitarian work and was named a Champion for the United Nations Human Rights Office.
The way of looking at women over tiny issues, as well as making up lies on them, while ignoring what men do repeatedly needs to stop...",2020-12-31T17:44:12Z,4
2,UgxEL9mjZmNabF0BYA94AaABAg,Motivator Network,"@Unicorn Vic Happy New Years! Let's hope more can see Amber Heard's side. You're doing great work.
I had to tell an Tech Lead internally and also an DEI (Diversity, Equity, Inclusion) and another at Google about the repeated spam, dislike comments under Amber Heard's 2020 Takeaway: ""Adapt and Survive."" It's sad that we have to do it this way. The workers at these tech companies don't think saying 'she's not a victim' is abusive, but do agree about auto-posting in spam.... it's sad that 2021 is going backwards because of the tech industries...  They need more diversity, inclusion, and domestic abuse training in tech creation... :((
It is NOT her fault. She's fighting systems. Her friends and associates were also removed from IG.",2021-01-03T01:06:51Z,4

5,UgxEL9mjZmNabF0BYA94AaABAg,Motivator Network,"Yes! Amber Heard supports LGBT rights, women's rights/equality, and she tried to speak out to bring human rights to people, especially for women/lgbt. I'm so glad USA/Australia Netflix removed Depp's shows. I wish other places would not rationalize abuse or violence & remove any glorification of him. I hope they do see Amber is innocent and give her life back to her. 
These internet companies also are complicit to allow abuse against her. They think it's an attack against her, an individual, not a cumulative effect of 'violence against women.' They need diversity and inclusion training in their process making of tech and content review. She's fighting huge systems...",2020-12-31T17:52:03Z,4
6,UgwUW5BGebUhp11Qkfl4AaABAg,Motivator Network,"Thanks for supporting Melissa Benoist and being open to seeing Amber Heard's side too. It is a hateful ideology that is discriminatory. We need leaders like Melissa and Amber who will bring women who are abused out into the light, and out of the darkness.

Domestic violence is the most common incident experienced by 911 dispatchers in America, yet no one talks about this or tries to do anything about it. Then retaliation makes people too afraid to try to create change or to even speak about change.
It shouldn't be a 'hidden crime' - it's only that way because systems have told us to not help women who are domestic abuse victims publicly. Even women's shelters are hidden and they're not accepting volunteers... Yet 1/3 women have experienced domestic violence... What Melissa and Amber are doing is trying to change culture.",2020-12-06T09:15:17Z,6
7,UgwUW5BGebUhp11Qkfl4AaABAg,Kay GEe,"If you had asked me who I believe, Heard or Depp I couldn’t tell you because I don’t know, but male actors have more pull in the film industry then actresses, as the film industry is a literal boys club, so he is a huge name and should’ve destroyed Amber in the trial, as well as her career! And he’s a huge career for years, so with this kind of huge reputation he should’ve won. However, this isn’t happening, he’s fired from Fantastic Beasts and not doing well with the trial. This tells me that everything/ movie companies don’t support him anymore and what they’re saying is true : that he’s an abusive drunk on set that burnt bridges with important people.",2020-12-05T06:38:41Z,5
