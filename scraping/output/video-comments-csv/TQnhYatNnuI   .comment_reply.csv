24,UgzMNP0o4DhaSID5evB4AaABAg,linamarie,Wow. I am truly shocked. I literally said this last week! I didn't think I would see a comment like this at all! I completely agree! The fact they are even investing this much time after all of the evidence shown is absolutely asinine. I was stating in the comment I made a few days ago that if they invested as much time here in this case into working class situations the results would be a whole lot different as well as it isn't surprising because if they will do this to an individual on a much more Grand scale then what does that mean for the rest of us?

52,UgyASeG0kaHbuVrwyxF4AaABAg,A. Westenholz,"Because that isn't their fight- they aren't prosecuting the judge for misconduct, tempting as it is. They just need to prove that the case against the Sun was totally mishandled by him- and leave it to someone else to to decide whether he was grossly incompetent or corrupt. To JD's legal team the focus has to be on that in order to get the appeal- you need to prove that the original judgment was flawed- and why. It isn't enough to just say there was a conflict of interest- and something which can be far more difficult to prove how it affected the judgment. So why bother if you don't need to in order to get the appeal, and can in some cases become a liability if you really can't prove it?",2021-02-09T10:59:41Z,6

73,UgxMzazviFbWxobnlRl4AaABAg,MFlax,"@cheryl davison sadly - yes. In my country they say ""if you go to court, you don't get justice, you just get a sentence."" It is not the first and not the last incident of a ""mis-trial"". But those can get corrected. If the ""old boys club"" will get mixed up.
There are more jobs were ""colleagues"" decide upon possible mistakes. (In my country you have to complain to the doctor's club about a doctor.) That way it is hard to find good decisions. But for that reason lawmakers often instituted independent supervisory bodies. Government is really not the best answer, but sometimes it is needed. But we wanted the judiciary to be independent. Sometimes that is just not the case.
Nevertheless, justice and judges are being condemned right now (again), while Depp wins again in the ""public"" court and in the hearts of ""normies"" like me.

PR and fame, money, sympathy, tax deduction etc. To say she had no motive other than she is a good samaritan is naive beyond belief. What matters in this particular case: there is no evidence of Depp physically abusing her, which is the claim made by her and the newspaper. Her own makeup artist contradicted her story. She lied about her dogs in Australia. She lied about her makeup artist not working for her and lied to immigration authorities on a visa application. She lied about his finger injury.

If you are in the spotlight, there are a lot of traps and it is harder to avoid detection. And those guys are loaded, they can spend lots of money on lawyers and lawsuits.
