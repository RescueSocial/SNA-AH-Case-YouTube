If I was to walk into your home you would have to leave. An if you stayed there it would not be me to get into trouble it would be you. As the restraining order is against you. However I believe that needs to be changed. I believe if a person files a restraining order against someone that both parties should get into trouble if they are seen around each other. Just as when she used a friend to contact Johnny he could of got into some serious trouble for allowing a third party contact. What Johnny should of done as soon as his friend tried to make contact on AH behalf was to tell his friend please do not write, text, or call me on her belalf.",Christina Pitts,0,2021-11-14T07:15:21Z

Last couple of months my X verbally still hateful but not threatening my life so guess he wants something I own or whatever. I guess I should move out and look for a good place in my town or Florida to live. Heard many flocking to Florida because of the Virus and seem Flu is gone missing.

Therefore, in her mind, Elon did something wrong by dumping her.
Just like all the times that she was violent towards Johnny, but she got angry at him when he tried to protect himself, left the room or split:
She told my friends Carino all these excuses why he should message Johnny for her, for instance, that she didn’t know what to say,  that her text wouldn’t go through, and so forth,, because she did not want to be the one to violate the restraining order. 
She finally had to violate her own order, in attempt to pursue her manipulation.

Now Amber is with WME agency. The july 22nd was the secret san Francisco meeting Then by August Johnny moved onto a Russian woman. The San Fran meeting was the last straw for Johnny.

169,Ugzh61bKq0cdaC50Q7x4AaABAg,"All great points. I like your videos not only because they are evidential but also because you use lots of vocabularies that I don't know. Fun way to learn english and hear about the world😅 BTW I still think she broke up with elon and apparantly they've recently met each other in Mexico . Also, it would be so interesting if you could do such videos about Musky too. I can't say if he has been a narcissist or a victim in all of his relationships! And he and grimes seems to have a weird thing going on! I have seen mixed evidences that puzzled my brain. I'll be glad to share with you. I like the way you analyze stuff ❤",Shadow Girl,2,2021-02-04T16:17:13Z

172,UgxgNsrGchU3_zE3RJ54AaABAg,"This was a really good analysis of the SF meeting, what Amber was aiming for behind the scenes, and her extraordinary manipulation of Johnny.  I'm glad he's going after her.  She's a piece of work.

Abuse victims suffer from Stockholm Syndrome.  This is due to the sweet-mean cycle inside an abusive relationship.  The abuser love bombs the victim and then abuses the victim in a cycle.  The victim gets addicted to the love cycle, like a gambling addict gets addicted to the rush of a payout.  It creates a chemical bond to the abuser and makes it very difficult for the victim to see the abuser for what that person is and to leave the abuser.",Been There,29,2021-02-04T15:05:18Z

175,UgzcnVnuYovf7MMSEDV4AaABAg,"Johnny obviously was in love, it was obsessive, which is sad. In an abusive relationship it becomes a cycle. The victim gets love bombed and has hope, then the abuse begins, usually unsuspecting. Keeps the victim unstable and off kilter. Never knowing what to expect.
She gives every woman a bad name. She is hurting real victims. Making it harder to be heard and believed.",Linda Douglass,32,2021-02-04T14:47:20Z
176,UgxNA1vBRw9A7HSp85R4AaABAg,"Great analysis once again. EM dodged a bullet within this hollow woman. But, his continued support of AH is the reason she concocted this whole s***show against JD. None of it could have happened without ‘ole muskyballs. He’s been her ace in the hole since 2013. EM may have broken up with AH he didn't stop supporting her and has continued ‘till this day. He’s a true gentleman to women. I only hope and pray he comes to recognize the AH he cares for doesn’t exist just as JD did. She isn’t real. Let that illusion go.",Sandra Stone,4,2021-02-04T14:20:20Z
177,UgxueYiC2MDf06_DnpR4AaABAg,Thanks for going over these texts. It’s painfully clear regarding her manipulation tactics with him. He’s a softy and she knew how to get to his heart.

But even worse get evidence of him S assaul...g her, she tried to lure him into the bed with her. Why would she do that when none of her intentions to meet him were genuine about reconciling. God knows what evidence she would have faked up if he had gone near her in the bed. I see no other reason for her to want to get him in the bed. Luckily, he somehow didn't so that.

I do have to wonder if he had,  what she would have done . She already had said he was sexually violent towards her. Luckily he was seeing through her , this could have ended so badly. I fear for him, she really is deranged.  Great video .",Sheri bitton,30,2021-02-04T10:10:21Z

197,UgwUdi5UFDvcS0qO8uJ4AaABAg,"Another great video. The thing with abuse victims is that there is no right or wrong way to act. She was definitely grooming him with the meet and communications with the mutual friend. But the ace card she has is that it can be argued that victims may seek out their abusers and often break RO's. Its never a black and white situation so things can always be argued. Even if they went to press charges and decided not to prosecute, its not because the person is innocent.. its because they just cant prove it at this time. Getting accused of these crimes is almost impossible to fight. Plus when you have the RO the onus is one you not to break it, not the victim. So even if they reach out you cant do it. Poor JD didnt stand a chance against her, she is so manipulative",Sharon Lee,14,2021-02-04T09:03:14Z
