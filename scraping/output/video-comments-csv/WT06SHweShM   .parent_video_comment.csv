Also, I would have a conniption if Johnny was not Jack Sparrow or Gellert Grindelwald. JK Rowling has always in my opinion made amazing decisions with her films.

You get to destroy a man's reputation but when your ""star actress"" literally is proven to be an abuser and lied, shes still on. Look I dont necessarily agree with either option but you CANNOT HAVE IT BOTH WAYS. IT'S HYPOCRISY AT IT'S FINEST AND IT'S DISGUSTING. And YES if the issue isnt super serious I would agree to not fire or cancel, but when the issue is as serious as domestic abuse?  Whoever it is SHOULD loose opportunities to show that people dont tolerate that serious of an action. Domestic violence is extremely serious and I do believe action should ONLY be taken when the PROOF comes out which makes me so mad Johnny Depp was fired right away with JUST ACCUSATIONS NOT EVEN PROOF BECAUSE THE ""PROOF"" CAME PUT TO BE MOST LIKELY FAKED.

39,Ugw0u2VP3kSkhskKERx4AaABAg,"The thing is that Depp HASS NOT BEEN fired from the Caribbean any more than Heard has been fired from Aquaman. If you chase up the actual interviews of ""Disney confirming"", Disney hasn't confirmed anything. 

The writer was asked, ""is it POSSIBLE  that JD isn't returning.."" He says ""it's possible, I am not sure if I am returning to it, we're waiting for a decision"" or something to that effect. POSSIBLE, NOT confirmed. He wasn't even in the position of confirming a thing on behalf of Disney.

When the Disney executive was asked the same thing, he avoided the question and said JD has had great success in Pirates, and that will be his legacy, but he did not, AT ALL confirm that he'd been fired. In the next sentence, he confirms ""the reboot"" is going ahead WITH A NEW WRITING TEAM, in other words, the previously mentioned writer was fired or benched, not Depp. 

Next, they ran a story in which the NEW WRITING TEAM was fired, again, not Depp.

Now... If this was official, it would be difficult for Depp to prove Amber has in any way caused a slump in his income, which she has, but losing Pirates seems like the biggest problem she's created for him... But no. Disney hasn't confirmed a thing, any more than WB would do. However, it was probably best for Disney to also not confirm that they haven't fired Depp.",Tonia Thraw,0,2020-05-13T06:41:12Z
40,Ugxuyo6Edu-mzjcz2Jh4AaABAg,"Amber Heard would be much easier to replace than Johnny Depp as she played a fairly unimportant character whereas Johnny Depp was the main star.  Also, I am quite dubious about the claim of Heard's Mera being popular given that half a million people want to get rid of the actress.  As for canceling her, I am not about to spend money to support such a terrible person.  This is not about a mere political disagreement; she acted to destroy someone else's career just for her own selfish goals.",Brian McGuinness,0,2020-05-13T05:06:01Z
