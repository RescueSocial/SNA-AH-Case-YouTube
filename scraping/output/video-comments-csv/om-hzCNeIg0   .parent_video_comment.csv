74,UgxJ1GCWFIwEmPiJ_Jt4AaABAg,"I think it more likely that AH and Rocketman did have a brief association (most likely a flirtatious encounter going by how clear it is that AH is attracted to powerful men), which spurred Musk's attraction to AH. Here's why I think that: most guys will pay exorbitant sums or go to great lengths in order to impress the women they're interested in. Musk offering private security 24/7 is his way of seeking to woo AH. 
From what I imagine to be part of the female perspective, I think AH turning him down on that was the best option (because she could continue the charade of her being in the right all the time and not give Musk any red flags in the process, while also denying the social contract that his paying for her to have full time security would bring, which is the feeling and knowledge of being in Musk's debt. If you start a relationship off with being in the other person's debt it can drastically alter the control one feels they have in the relationship. As AH is clearly a control freak she'd not be able to handle that and I think even she would understand that.",Tay aka MC AF,0,2020-07-12T03:44:39Z

I, as a man, can relate to that, and regardles, she not being ""devorced"", I can put myself in that position, and think""Ok, she's devorcing, she's not happy, and needs help"". If it were in my hands and power to help someone in need,(And Elon most surely could help), I would do it. So I think Musk most have fall for the lies A.H. told, and tried his best to be the ""better man"". Cut him some slack, he is not a bad person, but got suck into this, thinking he was doing the right thing.  A.H. is a manipuling shrew who will not stop at nothing to get what she wants. She is the worst person there will ever be, and if she can drag you with her, she will. Only that this time, she won't be able, because she got sloppy. I just wonder how manny storys are out there, that are not being told on how someone did this to someonelse  , and got AWAY WITH THIS. This is not about Elon, is about A.H. 
And, I don't know why, I belive Elon will go out and say that he was told something else. YES he could have being with A.H. before J.D. devorced her, but he did it because he thought J.D. was being a bad person. And I can relate to that.

193,Ugz9K0w6sUcGINbuo7N4AaABAg,"WOW! Before this all happened, when I saw Amber on a TV interview, something about putting hearing aids on people who couldn't hear, and she was crying because she was so heartwarmed to help these people some of which were just kids. My thought was she is as phoney as a 3 dollar bill!! She was so phoney I couldn't even watch the whole segment.  Everything about her was fake. This is why I never believed her story. 

Anyway, how is she manipulating these men? Is it her beauty, her brains? From what I understand she is fluent in different languages and even knows sign language. I have met gorgeous smart men who are so phoney it's a turn off. Is it different with men towards females? Johnny knew what she was like before he married her. His kids and other loved ones hated her. But he wouldn't listen. I wonder what makes men ignore outright psychopaths. Maybe some woman do too, I don't know. Anyway, great video!!
