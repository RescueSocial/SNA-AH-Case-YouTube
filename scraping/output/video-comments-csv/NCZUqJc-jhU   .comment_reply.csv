Approx 1 in 6 people are Narcs. This should be taught in schools so we can identify these dangerous, emotionally compromised & manipulative individuals. What does this mean and how does it manifest in everyday life? They have the following behaviours/characteristics:

No emotional empathy
Sense of Entitlement 
Hyper-sensitivity to sense of control
No accountability / Blame shifting
Think in black and white, no compromises or shades of grey
Use Triangulation, objects and people, as a way of asserting control and manipulating
No boundary recognition 
No conscience, no sense of remorse or guilt
Dishonesty and lies to achieve control & fuel, ie positive and/or negative emotional responses
Future faking and re-writing history

You should believe all women, support them. But you should never blindly charge to the preperators without solid evidence and reason. Be it verbally or physically.

Amber is a shame to all assaulted victims. Women fought for decades, centuries even, to be heard, to let the world understand that they are not an object without feelings.

We should NOT undo all of these progress because of a stain like her. Sure, 1 in 10 women might be lying, but you should take into consideration of the remaining 9.

89,UgxzqBjbSqgegSkJjFt4AaABAg,Ducklord,"I'm almost 100% sure that in my country, the case with Johnny Depp would have gone the other way, due to how gender plays such a pivotal role in testimonies, court hearings, and how easily the lucky evidence that ultimately turned the tide, could have been dismissed. This then goes into statistical bases, which are further used to strengthen the idea that gender is somehow an indicator of truthfulness and/or violence.

As a person who has suffered some periodic domestic violence during a 7yr relationship there are many parallels I can see in this case. 
I however, never did go to court, I managed to end it before it became too much. I don't believe in badmouthing people and spreading rumours, and thus never told anyone except for one of my closest friends about it, someone who doesn't even know her or any of her friends.
We had tried relationship counselling earlier, and her reaction in those meetings beared many similarities to this womans deposition. The borderline psychotic smirks that came out when her part (in ordinary relationship difficulties) was brought into question were very similar, she expected it to all focus on why I wasn't bowing down to her every whim. Two different counsellors told us to end it after the first meeting, which is why we visited another one that basically said the same thing.

The biggest hurt came from the psychological abuse, not the physical abuse, and took years to work out.

127,UgxF8FSyokdj89nTkVF4AaABAg,Martyna (moonami),"​@Mahesh Wankhede actually as a psychology student I can say they don't. We had lectures specifically about lying and when there are some things (like what you wrote) that can indicate lying, it's not always the case. You have to know a person to tell if they are lying because people have their ticks, habits, mannerisms etc. Actor are all liars (at least the good ones :D) and we don't spot them looking on the right side, being sweaty etc. if it's not in a character specificaly. That doesn't mean that you can't that they - as a person - are lying, because they will each have their own behavioral signs. Things you mention can be an indicator but at the end of the day good liar can learn them and even overdo it while a very good liar will actually not give a fuck about them but just be very very self-aware on how they act when they tell the truth and they will know how to ""act"" themselves, just like actors act the character. The best advice for everyday life I can give you - true stories are usually medium detailed. 1. If a person doesn't seem to come up with any details or is remembering suspiciously big amount - the story is probably made up. 2. Ask to tell the story from the end to the beginning. If you're telling the truth, you won't have bigger problems with that - because they will mostly rely on their personal memory, emotional memory, sensual memory - they are all long term memories and it's much more easier to remember something from them that from a cognitive memory, usually short termed (if the story was just produced). Of course these are also not 100% fool proof (for example, someone may have really bad/really good memory overall or to some things; also when you have time to prepare you go over the story 100 times) but still better then behavioral signs. In everyday lying is actually easier to control your behavior (because you know basics of what to and what not to) than your own thought processes.",2021-02-13T15:24:34Z,6

490,Ugx8oUlxem_auz6Otht4AaABAg,NIBS,"The complete picture has become clear--with Josh Drew testifying that Raquel Pennington was NOT with him, in the apartment Mr. Depp allowed them to live in, but hiding in the hall closet of Mr. Depp's apartment.  Neither Ms. Heard or Ms. Pennington realized that Mr. Depp had brought two security guards with him, and they were listening at the apartment door.  These two guards have testified that Ms. Pennington did NOT pass them to enter the apartment...confirming that she was hiding in the closet, waiting to burst out to come to Ms. Heard's assistance...and, most importantly, to ""witness"" the ""attack"" that they intended to frame Mr. Depp with. 
 When Ms. Heard began to scream ""Stop hitting me!""  Ms. Pennington began screaming ""Leave her alone!""  The two co-conspirators realized the two security guards were in the room with them, and had noted Mr. Depp was on the far side of the room, in the kitchen, no where near the two women.  The co-conspirators then changed their screams to ""Don't hit me again!""  The guards saw Ms. Heard shouting into her phone, presumably to iO Tillett Wright, ""He's hitting me!"", when Mr. Depp was NOT hitting her, nor was he close enough TO hit her.  The guards then left with Mr. Depp, having witnessed that no assault occurred. 
 The co-conspirators communicated with Samantha Spector, Ms. Heard's lawyer, who apparently advised them to break the law by making TWO fake 911 calls, eliciting  TWO separate L.A.P.D. responses.  Isn't it against the law for your lawyer to advise you on how to frame your spouse for domestic violence?  Both sets of specially trained domestic abuse police officers insisted on entering and searching ALL of the penthouse apartments, and thoroughly examining Ms. Heard for signs of violence.  Both sets of Police Officers are testifying for Mr. Depp--that there was NO signs of a fight, NOTHING was broken, and Ms. Heard had NO signs of trauma anywhere on her person.
Now that Ms. Heard's ""MeToo"" Lawyers have cut her loose, and her ""MeToo"" activist friends are withdrawing their support...Ms. Heard's case is falling apart.  The day after the alleged assault, Ms. Heard attended a party thrown by Amanda de Cadenet.  Pictures were taken.  Ms. de Cadenet was supposed to testify that Ms. Heard had a bruise on her face.  She now feels that she was ""used and misled by Amber"", and will no longer testify on Ms. Heard's behalf.  That can only mean that there WAS no bruise on Ms. Heard's face, she simply TOLD Ms. de Cadenet what happened, she was believed, and Ms. de Cadaney was going to stretch the truth with her testimony to support her friend.  Thus, the deliberate framing of an innocent man began.  When a witness is willing to ""embellish"" what they saw, to support a ""friend"", justice starts to slide down a very steep slope.  Witnesses must confine themselves to exactly, and only what they experienced first hand.  Ms. Heard's friends are realizing that they will be committing perjury--a serious crime.  Josh Drew, once a co-conspirator, now has decided to tell the truth.  His November 2019 deposition was filled with many enlightening facts, that we are just learning about.  It will be interesting to see which other co-conspirators follow suit.",2020-07-03T08:59:21Z,0

541,UgwmWM9gqbdEGb9rS0p4AaABAg,Restin Walken,"Simply because a womans pyshical abuse isnt as pyshically damaging as a mans so people negate it.

Long version
 Especially if the pyshical abuse is directed at a man because he should be able to pyshically restrain this said woman from harming him. 

Which is stupidly flaud. Even the smallest woman who's not pyshical disabled has the strength of at least the average 10yr old child. A ten yr old child can cause bruising and damage with a punch. Size discrepancies matter but Johnny it's not that much larger then Amber. 3in in height. Age also matters 22 year difference between the 2 put them at a closer pyshical comparison to one another. As she the younger one. 

This completely negates the fact that most men wont pyshical hurt or strike a woman whos attacking them. Form the knowledge that he knows he can inflict more damage then she can. While if he does he will also majority of the time even if she instigated the assault. He will be seen as in the wrong for pyshically striking back.

The hypocrisy nd double standards erks me. It pisses me off. The whole #metoo movement. Believe women! I can not out right I support this logic. You cant condemn a person male of female without proof. My Uncle was pyshical and emotionally abused for decades by his ex wife because what was he supposed to do? Who would believe him.
