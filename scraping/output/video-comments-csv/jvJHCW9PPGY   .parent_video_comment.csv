5,UgwQzjJOFabMeqSxIGN4AaABAg,"For me, I think professional life vs private life are different things. You have brilliant actors who are massive aholes in real life. Personally I can appreciate their professional work, while disapproving of their personal actions. That said, from a PR standpoint private life can affect professional life. Everyone has the right to not support someone professionally for being a terrible human being. So, I also understand how the studios would want to fire actors who are in the news for the wrong reasons.",P. Nguyen,1,2020-08-17T04:46:08Z
