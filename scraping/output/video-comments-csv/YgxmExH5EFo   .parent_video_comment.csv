The previously unseen messages were from Depp to actor Paul Bettany. According to Page Six, the newspaper's legal team got ahold of 70,000 texts after they were accidentally shared by Depp's previous lawyers. Among the text messages is one from Nov. 6, 2013, where Depp allegedly wrote to Bettany, ""Let’s burn Amber."" The next day, Depp allegedly wrote, ""Let’s drown her before we burn her!!!"" along with an obscene line that won't be printed here.

Page Six reported Depp allegedly sent the following messages to Bettany in May 2014:

""I’m gonna properly stop the booze thing, darling… Drank all night before I picked Amber up to fly to LA, this past Sunday…Ugly, mate.""

""No food for days…powders…half a bottle of whiskey, a thousand red bull and vodkas, pills, 2 bottles of Champers on plane and what do you get..???""

""I am admittedly too f***** in the head to spray my rage at the one I love…For little reason, as well I’m too old to be that guy But, pills are fine!!!""",Tommy Grant,1,2020-02-28T16:52:38Z

33,Ugww7W4gj5jRHVPEsnJ4AaABAg,"I am a fan of Emilia Clarke. I loved her in Game of Thrones and Terminator Genisys. I thought she was an awesome Sarah Connor. She'd make a suitable replacement for Amber Heard. But, a petition to have Amber Heard fired from Aquaman 2 won't solve anything and why should Johnny Depp and Amber Heard's dispute and personal lives affect Aquaman 2? We don't know the real story and for all we know it could all be a publicity stunt. I love to see Emilia Clarke in DCU or MCU now she's done Game of Thrones, Terminator Genisys and Solo: A Star Wars Story. Emilia Clarke and Jason Momoa did have great chemistry.

If recasting Mera, don't take Emilia, take one that looks similar to Amber so the transfer get more realistic. I don't want idiotic Terrence Howard-recast with Don Cheadle like Iron Man 1 -> 2, that was extremely poorly done. NOTHING alike. Confusing...",TheSweboy,1,2020-02-26T00:23:21Z

Now I think that this idea of swapping actress (AMBER HEARD) with actress (EMILIA CLARKE) as the new face of the MERA character does sound like a interesting idea to do, and to add might be great to do.

But if (Emilia Clarke) does happen to become the new face of the MERA character; Than I wonder how might the writers for the (AQUA-MAN 2) movie storyline movie-script will properly explain the reason why the female character MERA’S facial looks have changed, and that was from her previous facial looks in the two movies of (JUSTICE LEAGUE) & (AQUA-MAN) to her different new facial looks?",Brian Daleske,1,2020-02-21T02:33:06Z
