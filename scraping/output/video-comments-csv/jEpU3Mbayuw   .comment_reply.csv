0,UgxPVuqzhS9doZlMw6N4AaABAg,Ashlie s. Christie,Not that it correlates...but...pretty sure Disney was full-blown anti-semite ... he was all about what happened to them in ww2...so...that happened. Maybe some of those sentiments still echo in the Disney chambers.,2021-06-17T20:07:16Z,0
1,UgxPVuqzhS9doZlMw6N4AaABAg,jim72068,"@Doctor Soup It was worse than that.  It was actually not a tweet that she shared - it was a meme that she shared in story section of her IG page. Somebody else wrote the meme and it has been shared thousands of times with no controversy.  When one shares a meme what you saying is ""This was interesting to me.. I found it thought provoking... what do you all think?""  That meme needed to be deliberately misinterpreted and twisted backwards to be considered anti-semitic in any way.  It appears Kathleen had some problem with or was jealous of the success of the show and simply used that meme as an excuse.",2021-06-12T00:07:46Z,3
2,UgxPVuqzhS9doZlMw6N4AaABAg,Commander Critic,"I‚Äôm in agreement, I never had the opportunity to read the tweet myself, but reading it now (I‚Äôve paused your vid to type this), and looking at it, okay yes, it‚Äôs describing something horrible, but it is by no means Anti-Semitic, it is simply describing WHAT happened, it‚Äôs stating a FACT that happened decades ago‚Ä¶ how exactly does this equate to what people said about the Actress after she posted this tweet!?

If anything, this tweet is going after the people who CAUSED the hatred and violence against J*** during the 1940‚Äôs, it‚Äôs speaking out AGAINST Anti-Semitic behaviour, not in favour of it, if anything I say this should be something Gina should be applauded for, and had this tweet come out ten to fifteen years earlier that may have been the case. Instead, people take one look at the words J*** and N*** being in the same sentence, and instantly switch into the mindset of ‚ÄúOh, this person hates J*** let‚Äôs RUIN their career!‚Äù

People are such F***ing idiots these days üò©.

(Post edit) I was not aware Amber was the poster of the first tweet, and Gina replied to it, THAT‚ÄôS MESSED UP, HOW DOES AMBER STILL HAVE A JOB!!!!!!!!!",2021-06-11T20:05:20Z,4
3,UgxPVuqzhS9doZlMw6N4AaABAg,Doctor Soup,"It was 100% blown out of proportion! I am with you Candy. Things have gotten overly politicized in this day and age, to the point that people want to be offended by anything. Great comment.",2021-06-11T18:27:29Z,9

11,Ugy5GUnzTwfi6a_NOS94AaABAg,Doctor Soup,"Good question. I would say it is likely Depp had something to do with her getting a shot at the job. Jason Momoa knew he was Aquaman since 2014, which I would assume would mean Heard knew she was going to be cast as Mera, not long after that, with Justice League hitting theaters in 2017.",2021-06-12T18:05:31Z,2
12,UgxozGf9NE1I8w2kXdl4AaABAg,Doctor Soup,"Very well said March. This is a very fair and unbiased, respectful comment. This is exactly what I think. It's not about pointing fingers at her politics, but trying to be understanding.",2021-06-12T19:56:27Z,0
