She wasn‚Äôt married before and there is no mention of common law marriage.  Wikipedia shows their relationship as lasting only 4 years total.  Also, Heard was arrested in Washington for domestic violence during that relationship.  I‚Äôm unaware if that‚Äôs where they lived but Washington is not a state that recognizes common law.

13,UgwU5mbTkCnBKGEFJBp4AaABAg,Twinkle Toes,"Also, real lawyers, smart lawyers who know their shit, lawyers who win a majority of their cases, would also know that Scamber Turd is NOT a strong or reliable witness......not even close, the exact opposite in fact!! That she doesn‚Äôt play well w the public, and therefore won‚Äôt w a jury, that she NEVER comes off as truthful, that her story ALWAYS CHANGES, that she CANNOT answer a question directly if her life depends on it (which in a US court she won‚Äôt be able to get away w what she did in the UK courts or even gets away w in depositions - which it‚Äôs clear that she thinks she can! She‚Äôs in for one hell of a surprise when she actually gets in the US court and in the witness stand bc she can be FORCED to reply w a direct answer, a ‚Äúyes‚Äù or ‚Äúno‚Äù answer and nothing else and that lawyers can even get permission from the judge to treat her as a hostile witness if she‚Äôs difficult!!). Which I don‚Äôt understand how her ‚Äúlawyers‚Äù haven‚Äôt sat down w her for some VERY serious discussions about how her not being able to directly, clearly, concisely and as briefly as possible answer questions is not going to bode well for them at all, it will actually HURT them/her/her case, that juries, judges, the public feel a witness is not being truthful, but are being deceptive and lying, when they don‚Äôt answer directly and answer questions the way she does.....& she already has issues w believability and ppl believing/feeling she‚Äôs being deceptive, lying & not truthful as is, so this just makes it even worse! Or how she gets an attitude when she‚Äôs answering questions, how she can‚Äôt do that bc how horrible that plays out for them & her, how it adds to how she comes across as unlikable, deceptive, not truthful & lying!! They would know all of these things and that as a result, claiming defense of counsel, all it would open them up to, leave them vulnerable to, all they‚Äôd have to prove, waiving attorney - client privilege and just what that would entail, the lines of questioning that would come from this defense, the evidence, how it would play out in court....in front of the judge, jury and public, how these things could end up actually hurting their case & defense as a whole.....how it could cause large and important parts of their claims, defense, arguments and case to crumble before their very eyes - weakening their case even more (which is what we‚Äôre starting to see play out right now!!), and much more, and would realize this is NOT the position they want to take at all, that they don‚Äôt want to open that can of worms.....hell, they don‚Äôt want to look at the can of worms, think about them or even talk about them bc it‚Äôs so bad!! Lol. 

They would STRONGLY advise Scamber Turd NOT to do this!! If she still wanted to do it, they‚Äôd fight her tooth and nail and let her know this could be VERY damaging to their case, detrimental to their case, honestly!! Not only is it clear they did NOT do that, it seems like they also INCORRECTLY THOUGHT it was a good idea, didn‚Äôt understand and weren‚Äôt prepared for what claiming that defense actually entails and meant going forward and have been acting all surprised and shocked about all of this, still pathetically desperate in trying to fight it very step of the way!! üôÑ I swear, the longer this goes on, the more skeptical I am of if her ‚Äúlawyers‚Äù are actually REAL lawyers at all....if they ever win any cases or are just the worlds shittiest lawyers who have no bloody clue in what they‚Äôre doing at all!!! Ugh. 

It‚Äôs like when Scamber Turd and her ‚Äúlawyers‚Äù decided to counter sue, also for defamation and decided to randomly pull $100 million out of their ass for how much they were suing for, boasting to the press that it was ‚Äútwice the amount Johnny Depp was suing Scamber Turd for!!‚Äù when they clearly had NO IDEA what they were doing!! They went from being on SOLEY the defense of Johnnys lawsuit and exactly what being solely on the defense would have them open to vs not, that their side really didn‚Äôt have anything to prove - Johnny was the one who had a shit load of burden of proof to meet for back up his claims and prove the defamation, what evidence would vs would not be allowed, what witnesses, etc! But the second they counter sued, for defamation at that, and then claimed $100 million in damages.....that then opened them up to a shit ton of things they otherwise wouldn‚Äôt have been!! That it made them more vulnerable, that it opened a crap load of new lines of questioning, that it opened them up to more evidence, that it meant they would need more witnesses to help them try to prove their claims - meaning those witnesses were now open to Team Depp, that Team Depp could call new additional witnesses he wouldn‚Äôt have been able to previously, that now her side wasn‚Äôt purely on the defense w nothing to prove.....that they now had to meet the burden of proof on numerous claims they were making, and how hard that would be considering just how ridiculously their claims are and how hard they‚Äôre reaching, how it made SO MUCH MORE work for them and just how they just made this case WAY, WAY, WAY MORE DIFFICULT for their side than it was before!! All of which, you would NOT want if you have someone like Scamber Turd as a client, who is NOT a strong and reliable client, witness or supposed ‚Äúvictim‚Äù, w a case as weak as they have, w as many holes and inconsistencies as they have, plagued w trouble, when Scamber Turd does NOT come off as believable or reliable, but rather deceptive, difficult, manipulative, not truthful - but as a liar, when she‚Äôs NOT likable and doesn‚Äôt play well for the public, judge and jury........all for a court case that will dramatically play out in the most public way, in front of a judge they‚Äôve pissed off, who‚Äôs lost all patience w them and has caught on to the games they‚Äôre playing and how they‚Äôre using the courts to do so, and have the case be decided by a JURY!! Phew!! 

They really fucked up big time w that one, and then went on to do it again w the whole defense of reliance on counsel! üôÑ It‚Äôs like her ‚Äúlawyers‚Äù don‚Äôt understand they have to prove the claims they‚Äôre making, that Johnny actually defamed Scamber Turd, that she‚Äôs even worth $100 million to begin w, let alone that Johnny caused $100 million in damages to her via his ‚Äúdefamation‚Äù!! It‚Äôs like they just thought they could claim whatever in their countersuit, claim whatever damages they wanted by just randomly picking out a number, that they wouldn‚Äôt have to prove any of this, back it up w evidence, proof and witnesses, that she could just give her testimony w her ever evolving and crazier claims, using her bullshit manipulated pictures as ‚Äúevidence‚Äù and that would be that! This is what I mean when I say I swear they‚Äôre not real lawyers, bc what in the hell?!? What real lawyers would do this kind of shit, think this way (or not think at all!), not understand some pretty basic law stuff & then act all shocked and surprised, like it‚Äôs unfair or wrong, and are battling it every step of the way?!?!?? I mean, make it make sense!!
