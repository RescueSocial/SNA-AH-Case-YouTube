0,UgwXV7TJBqzJHOAj4zl4AaABAg,NIBS,"@Aisha , in 2016, *BEFORE* the divorce, Amber Heard's allegations of Domestic Abuse that resulted in a *temporary* restraining order, was *dismissed with prejudice* by the Judge.  After a review of the evidence, the Judge found Ms. Heard's case to be ""egregiously flawed and without merit"", and as a result of this *dismissal with prejudice,* Ms. Heard is never allowed to bring these charges of abuse against Mr. Depp again.

The legal documentation of this is in the Public Domain, and you are free to review it on California's legal sites.

Amber Heard was also arrested for the domestic assault of her wife, Tasya van Ree, *at the request of her wife, Tasya van Ree* in 2009, at the Seattle/Tacoma International Airport.  When the press discovered the arrest, Ms. Heard attempted to manipulate the story in her favor, by alleging the Police Officer was a Homophobic Misogynist... unfortunately for Ms. Heard, the arresting officer was an openly gay woman, a supporter of gay rights, and a volunteer at Domestic Abuse Shelters.

It is the finding of the Appeal Judges that Ms. Heard *DID* commit perjury, lied about donating any money from her Divorce Settlement to Charity, and that she not only assaulted Mr. Depp on more than one occasion, but that, by her own admission, she instigated physical fights.

Today, the news is covering the release of the body-cam footage of the investigating police officers who examined the apartment and Ms. Heard for signs of domestic abuse.  It is irrefutable evidence that nothing took place the night Ms. Heard alleged Mr. Depp assaulted her.  ""Justice"" Nicole is exposed as a corrupt and biased Judge (Mr. Depp was suing the company that employs Judge Nicole's *SON* )!  Nicol dismissed the testimony of the *four* police officers and chose to believe Ms. Heard's story, because they hadn't taken notes, which American Police Officers don't take... and now that the footage of the apartment is out for the world to see -- Ms. Heard is exposed for yet more perjury, and the attempted fabrication of evidence to frame an innocent person.

You are mistaken in thinking that I have not been involved in this case from the moment that it began in 2016. I counsel survivors of Narcissistic Abuse, and I am well acquainted with the abusive and manipulative traits of Amber Heard.  All of her lies are being exposed, and the Virginia Trial will result in Ms. Heard being held accountable for her crimes.",2021-04-16T18:03:13Z,0

14,Ugz-xyafUz9_212XI3d4AaABAg,NIBS,"@Me Not , Mr. Depp can not go to jail for domestic abuse because the Judge, after reviewing Ms. Heard's ""evidence"", and the evidence provided by Mr. Depp, dismissed Ms. Heard's case, stemming from her *temporary* restraining order, *with prejudice* in 2016, just before the divorce.  The exact meaning of this verdict is that the Judge found Ms. Heard's case to be ""egregiously flawed and without merit"", and the result of this verdict is that Ms. Heard can never bring these charges against Mr. Depp anytime in the future.  The documentation is now available in the public domain, in the California Court System, for you to verify this dismissal verdict.

The recent acknowledgement by the United Kingdom High Court that Ms. Heard lied to the ""Judge"", that she committed perjury during the trial, that she failed to donate her divorce settlement to charity, and that she failed to disclose all evidence in the case, is a substantial blow to the case in Virginia.  The fact that Kevin Murphy is in the process of reversing his testimony in the Australian Dog Smuggling Case, and the Australian High Court intends to open a case against Ms. Heard for suborning perjury under the threat of being fired, which carries a thirteen year jail term (three years more than smuggling in her dogs would have carried), and that making a public statement that you are donating money to a charity is considered a legally binding contract in the State of California, as is giving interviews that state that the donation was completed (and issuing press releases that the donation was completed)... it appears that Ms. Heard will be spending a great deal more time in Court.  Kate James may also decide to sue Ms. Heard for appropriating her sexual abuse story (which was well documented at the time it occurred, in Police Reports).  These are the already pending cases.  After the Virginia Court weighs Mr. Depp's evidence, and it should be noted that American Courts don't dismiss the Police Reports of two separate sets of Specially Trained Domestic Abuse Police Officers, as well as ample physical and testimonial evidence, in favor of ""stories"" with no evidence of any kind to substantiate them, Ms. Heard is facing potentially an entirely new set of charges, stemming from attempted extortion, suborning perjury, and the fabrication of ""evidence"".  Even if Mr. Depp lost the defamation case, as unlikely as that may be, he is still not facing any jail time.

You should also take care in the language you use to harass the Survivors of Narcissistic Abuse who support Mr. Depp... as every comment is being reported and recorded in a central account to be used as evidence against Ms. Heard, for encouraging her fans to antagonize and threaten anyone who supports Mr. Depp.",2021-04-12T09:09:53Z,1
15,Ugz-xyafUz9_212XI3d4AaABAg,Me Not,Shut up. The one who is going to jail is johnny depp not amber heard. Period....,2021-04-12T07:59:09Z,1
16,Ugz-xyafUz9_212XI3d4AaABAg,NIBS,"@shreyan kanvinde , ""Aquaman"" made only $335,061,807 in it's American release...a very reputable sum, but not particularly remarkable.  The largest portion of ""Aquaman's"" worldwide gross of $1,148,485,886 was in the East, China providing the largest market.  Since the release of ""Aquaman"", relations between China and the United States have become less favorable, and American movies are not doing as well.  It is highly unlikely that any current movies will be received with as much enthusiasm in China again.  

Amber Heard is not just a ""bad person"", she is a criminal.  She has not done things that ""wrong"", she has committed crimes.  Australian Authorities have re-opened the Dog smuggling Case, because Kevin Murphy revealed, under oath in the Sun Defamation Trial, that Amber Heard is guilty of subornation of perjury.  Ms. Heard threatened to have him fired if he didn't lie to protect her.  He is in the process of changing his testimony, and Ms. Heard will be facing a potential seven year sentence in that country.  ""Aquaman 2"" is slated to film in Australia.

The Washington Post Defamation Trial will result in charges against Ms. Heard in the United States.  The list of crimes is much more extensive in this case.  Fabricating evidence and selling it to the tabloids for profit,  tampering with evidence and selling it to the tabloids for profit,  tampering with witnesses,  making an illegal heavily edited video of Mr. Depp without his knowledge or consent and selling it to TMZ for profit (TMZ cooperated with the Police investigation in this case), making an illegal recording of Laura Divenere without her knowledge or consent (her lawyer indicated that Ms. Divenere would like to proceed with charges), subornation of perjury, perjury to obtain a restraining order, perjury in the divorce deposition, perjury in the Sun Defamation Case deposition, perjury in the Sun Defamation Trial, perjury in the Washington Post Defamation deposition, perjury in the Washington Post Defamation Trial, assault causing bodily harm, attempted extortion (see the Spector letter listing Ms. Heard's financial and property demands *before* she made any allegations of abuse), and defamation.  Each one of these crimes has it's own sentence attached to it.  Ms. Heard is not looking at a misdemeanor sentence...she is looking at some serious hard time.

On top of all that, as Mr. Waldman has pointed out, the penalty for perjury in the United Kingdom is up to seven years imprisonment.  

Ms. Heard's crimes now span three different countries.  As a narcissistic abuse survivor and counselor, the repercussions of DCEU supporting Ms. Heard, in light of her crimes, would be devastating...but since Warner Brothers clearly stated in the Praecipe letter from Wayne M. Smith, Senior Vice President Corporate Legal,  that Warner Brothers *requires* Mr. Depp for ""Fantastic Beasts"", but makes no mention of Ms. Heard,  and Ms. Heard has not even been informed of when ""Aquaman 2"" is shooting...It appears the matter of whether she will be in ""Aquaman 2"" has already been settled.",2020-10-02T17:40:40Z,4

It's a matter of SELF CONTROL.

However, look at what is happening now with Depp: a real company has been started following his persecution. It is very easy to persecute a person so that he will consider his own life worse than the hell.
