Sure; most of the people doing this are men, but then: Most of the people working for money in the regions where human trafficking happens are men. You're looking at an entirely different dynamic where men are involved because men are supposed to make money for their families.

Who created the idea men should laugh at a man who has been injured by a woman? Who created this equality. As I recall, the system taught me in school that women had no rights for since before the Scarlet Letter. Isn't it logical that men set that up? I don't remember a time that men did not have the ultimate rights. All of a sudden men are being knocked out the system it seems. I guess all those years secret societies of women are at it working hard to make sure men are never at the top of humanity's food chain. No one should be harmed in any fashion. I just hope people remember that it wasn't that long ago women had no rights. I believe women's rights have gone too far but do not forget the birth of this current stance. Having no rights and now too extreme of an agenda and a deep sensitivity to the slights of women. This will move back to equality or near equality just like how the women's movement started. In my previous post I write about looking at people as people and treating an issue by facts and case by case scenario. We'll never make it that way by forgetting the past.

112,UgyAhPK51DZqXrTcm6d4AaABAg,P. E. R.,"@AmadeusA - No you wrote your thoughts out perfectly. And I highly agree with you. Which was why when this case first became public I didn't really pick a side, because I believe domestic violence cases are typically complicated. Which, makes the hypocrisy of Johnny Depp's situation sickening. 


They didn't even wait for his side of the story  in the court docs to come out before destroying his career and image. And if it wasn't for the audio we still would be left in the dark. I'm not saying that the recording tells the entire story.  However, the tape with all the other stuff certainly does give us some insight to what the relationship was like. And, to me at least, isn't that J.D. was the monstrous wife beater that she claimed he was. And the kicker in all this is, Amber Heard won't be acknowledged by a large group of people to be the abuser she clearly is. 


So, hopefully the court takes whatever evidence they have and genuinely makes the right decision.",2020-02-06T15:17:41Z,1
113,UgyAhPK51DZqXrTcm6d4AaABAg,AmadeusA,"@P. E. R. I understand where you're coming from. There are lots of example where people get wrongly punished. I can even think of one off the top of my head where a man wrongly got like eight years of prison for rape (and it was _only_ eight years because they found the actual guy). 

I guess my point is that I'm not going to claim I know exactly what happened between Depp and Heard (or any other controversies that has or will happen). And I expect almost everyone is on the same boat as me. We're all just viewers.

Yes, court of law may not come out with the right outcome. And they may just be as much as a viewer as we are. Not to say they can't do wrong; I just think the people whose job is to actively look at cases would do/know better than a public mob. And any form of consequences should be from the law (not people deciding the actor shouldn't be in the next movie). 

And if anyone is still reading, I guess my main, main point is that if you petitioned to get an actor removed, it would have been pointless if they were found not guilty.

114,UgyAhPK51DZqXrTcm6d4AaABAg,P. E. R.,"AmadeauA- I agree about the petition thing. I mean, it's silly in the sense to think the film makers either care or gonna listen. So unless these same people stick to their guns and just boycott the film so she becomes box office poison, nothings really gonna happen. However, how can you say a court of law decides the right outcome? Don't get me wrong, I believe in our justice system, but it still has hella lot problems, so Johnny Depp can still get screwed over. And we all know she's not gonna get jail time. So, maybe at worst for her she'll fade from the limelight. Johnny's rep still gonna be tarnished and people will forever defend her behavior.",2020-02-06T04:08:54Z,2
