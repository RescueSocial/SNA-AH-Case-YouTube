2,UgxvxwtHWq1eWU_CG5R4AaABAg,mary bodnar,"She doesn‚Äôt have any criminal cases against her. Only civil‚Ä¶if she loses the civil case, it‚Äôs money she‚Äôll lose, not her freedoms.  She‚Äôll appeal any decision made in Johnny‚Äôs favor.  This case will go on for years.  
      But this case isn‚Äôt about the Benjamin‚Äôs, it‚Äôs about Johnny clearing his name & exposing Amber Turd for the lying fraud she is.  It‚Äôs about getting Turd removed from movies.  Her mare presence is triggering for millions of DV & SA victims around the globe.  This case is about holding a vicious liar accountable.",2021-07-07T18:58:06Z,1

8,UgzVBBED1kAbY95EwA14AaABAg,L Peterson,Amber bought that whole baby thing...paid someone to carry it and see it through its first 3 months and she took possession of the final product.  Not an endeavor of love and not even being in the same country as the surrogate...way to bond.
