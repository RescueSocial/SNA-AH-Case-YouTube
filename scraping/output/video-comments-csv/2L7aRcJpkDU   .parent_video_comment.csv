The evidence is so telling; however the judge has connections to Amber so Johnny didn’t stand a chance of winning. Is Johnny imperfect? YES Absolutely—no argument there! But it is so clear from the evidence in the trial that he was the victim in that relationship. If people care about rights of men, they’ll look deeper at the evidence in the case.

Yet with all the evidence in Johnny's corner the judge sided with Amber without any proof of her allegations...the umbrella guy, ehacker, nerdettes newsstand, spiritually empowered have comprehensive playlists going over every single court document and witness statements as well as Turdburgers statements that don't add up at all.
