This rings true for anyone who's ever known, or been, a real victim of abuse that was not believed, where a case was even brought forth but the authorities ultimately decided ""he/she was probably making it up"" and their abuser gets off scot-free. That happens a lot more often than most people think, even in our ""post-MeToo"" world. That being said, Where is the precedent for someone ""probably making it up"" set? Women like Amber Heard. _Real_ cases get dismissed because a judge or jury know every alleged victim _could_ be another Amber Heard.

Her husband was fired from a lucrative franchise, Pirates of the Caribbean on false charges, yet Amber Turd gets to abuse people as she likes with impunity. It's not even the first person she abused. Back in 2009, she was arrested for abusing her then-girlfriend Tasya van Ree. And for similar reasons, Mel Gibson was blacklisted for years. Hell, Kevin Spacey was fired from House of Cards for sexually assaulting a teenage boy. Harvey Weinstein and Bill Cosby are both in jail for rapes.

Even before the me too movement, we've been conditioned by society to think of women as being more emotionally and physically vulnerable than most men.  Granted I don't agree with that as there have been cases of some women being stronger both emotionally and physically than most guys but still.  Generally speaking western society in the USA and various parts of the world were conditioned to think that way.  

A woman can ball her eyes out at a bar crying and chances are tons of guys will try to comfort her, even if she's only doing it for attention and possibly a free drink.  Whereas if a dude cries in a public place, we're taught that he's weak and should laugh at him.  Not saying it's right but it's just how society conditioned all of us to think",2020-09-02T16:52:35Z,5

It is always a question of one's own reality. Every person has his own perception based on his experiences and beliefs.
No one is born as a sociopath, a psychopath or a monster. Even Hitler or Stalin did not. This doesn't mean that their actions can be justified but external influences have manipulated their minds so that they can no longer act rationally.
It has been proven that sociopaths are sometimes unable to weigh the consequences of their actions due to the way their brains work.

Listen, I'm not telling anyone what they should believe.  I simply think we should handle this like we did 20 years ago: if you can't stand someone or something then don't pay them your money.  Our voice as consumers isn't to blast them on YouTube or Twitter, but to send our money where we want it.  It's the largest power in existence to affect real outcomes.

I'm not even a fan of Heard's acting, I just like how she looks in that outfit.

Did you actually think that she was cast for another reason, or that Jason Mamoa was for that matter?

I don't go to see films purely because I believe the actors or directors who made it are good people.

If you did you would have to stop watching a lot of Hollywood output - including basically anything Harvey Weinstein had his disgusting mitts on, or Bryan Singer for that matter

Considering that includes Kill Bill, most of X Men and every film that Kevin Spacey was ever in that simply isn't ever going to happen.

I'm more than marginally certain that James Cameron knew about Eliza Dushku being molested by a stunt director during the filming of True Lies, and that this is the reason it has never had a remaster for bluray or 4K.

127,UgwOVORXihv2TXqEQfR4AaABAg,Kenny Hill,"@Zeon Eons ""Depp is still paying for those false accusations.""

Define paying?

He has a net worth of $200 million - he could spend the rest of his entire life snorting cocaine every day and never have to get sober.

People really do need a reality check on exactly how these people live - they are all degrees of bad and seldom go out of their way to be nice without some kind of compensation or otherwise something in it for them.

Most actors that do good PR events like visiting hospitals and such do so for PR's sake and boosting their image, if not for the film production studio they commonly work with - as I have zero doubt all MCU actors that do so such things, it just plays well for everyone especially family conscious film companies like Disney.

Even Michael J Fox - despite all his philanthropy towards Parkinsons/dementia research organisations he does little else and has plenty of money to do so.

The average AAA pay grade actor gets more pay from a single film job and its associated PR events than the average lower level film crew member will make in their entire lifetime.

Let me make that clear in case you didn't quite read it right - THEIR ENTIRE LIFETIME.

That especially includes all the VFX studio people that work unpaid overtime constantly to get all of that work done that the actors never even touch yet covers for so much of the average AAA film these days.

My main point being that not a single actor in Hollywood needs your pity - they know that it is a cesspool, they do it anyways, and they and the higher level film crew are the only people involved in any production that actually gets well paid for it by Hollywood standards.

It's the rest of the crew that really deserve your pity - they do all the work, get all the shit, receive a piss poor wage compensation and none of the PR recognition from the studios, as far as the studios are concerned they are practically production props that get paid.",2020-09-04T01:13:29Z,0

158,Ugw2KbTz6bJ7x9hPG7F4AaABAg,Faylum1,"@Lassi Kinnunen what you fail to understand is that simps are men who are desperate and likely have no confidence or means to attract women. And in a generation where 100% of women are chasing the top 5% of men, the other 95% mixed with great and terrible men have only simping to find happiness in. I am by no means in support of simping and i really hate that it is predominantly men doing it. (Its a stain on my sex) but i can understand why simps exist. And if you think your average sado simp reads the news or gets eceleb gossip mags you are extremely mistaken. Most these people are weebs or moles. Completely withdrawn from reality. 
Pop-culture isnt something men of any kind follow. Personally i spend 99% of my free time either gaming with mates or reading about ancient history. This channel i follow for the controversial backdoor stuff going on in film. If they didn't cover this i would never know it. So my point is that simps are just oblivious. They may not know or understand the situation and those that do and don't care are also doing a very human a very male trait. 'Why should a man care about what some other man has suffered?' Men are not emotional. We don't feel something is wrong. And in most cases myself included think Johnny Depp is a fucking pussy who could easily have stopped the abuse if he wasnt popping pills and getting high. 
Again i don't think that means she is innocent and believe the law has no leniency amongst men and women. It is one law for all. 
So another point is that in the dating game/breeding/simping/sexual value and so on, when it comes to the attraction between men and women, men don't care what happens to other men. They care only about what they can conquer. 
Unfortunately for simps... they haven't figured out that they are neither conqueror or potential mate. But just a means to an end. A business deal.",2020-09-02T13:42:37Z,1
