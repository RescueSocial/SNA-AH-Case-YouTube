6,Ugz4W4PDHdR6Wy-rMpp4AaABAg,Josh Ridinger,"​@lovetoplayguitar lol 'hit dogs holler' is a common refrain among feminists, anti-racists, etc. whenever random men or white people or whatever complain about being lumped in with rapists, rapists, etc. what's good for the goose is good for the gander. oh, shit, i guess i just compared women to geese now, or something, because that's how metaphors work.

anyway, i didn't even address that metaphor to 'women', or even to the violently abusive individual woman in question. i don't think demonizing entire genders, or individuals based on their gender, is helpful; that's exactly what we have to move away from if we're going to seriously deal with abuse. to that end,  i addressed the criticism and metaphor to an ideology & movement that supports amber hjeard, which is to say that it supports abuse and that it supports false accusations to cover that abuse up, on the grounds that it's necessary to advance women's interests, and to a particular narrative that seeks to victim-blame johnny depp and other male victims for their 'toxic masculinity' instead of owning up to the ways that *they*, or their allies, are the ones who fight to silence us.",2021-10-11T18:16:57Z,1

How many times have you seen a guy get slapped in a movie and he rubs it and is fine? Its sorta normalized to some extent.

Punching somebody though? Thats always violent and only acceptable sometimes, even then its considered an extreme approach. She didn’t care about the legality of her maneuver but about convincing the public that Depp was a bastard and she “only” slapped him.

Yeah I bet he's having fun, manipulating those people, knowing someone will believe him! And see, he even jokes around, he's totally not taking it seriously"". Depends on whether you think they're lying, you can invent a possible thought process that would explain the actual behaviour. It's better to catch someone on a big lie - like the guy who killed his wife and children last year or the year before, at first he was like ""I don't know anything, it wasn't me"" and then ""oh yes I killed my wife but she killed the kids"" - big change, big possibility of other lies (although then they had so much evidence already anyway...).",2021-01-19T03:00:34Z,1

It’s about control and abuse of control. I do however think that they had a disgusting relationship just based on what they have both admitted themselves. I’m just not convinced that he is a victim nor she. I’ve seen male victims too and I don’t disregard that this happens, I have also seen women that have used their sex to lie to become the “victim” which is just as disgusting. 

I spent 8 years and had a child in a DV relationship and I see neither of these two people as victims, but I see them both as abusers. In any case, it will all play out in court I guess? I am not discounting anyone’s opinion on the matter, I just personally don’t see it like that. 

Put it this way, if there were children in that home, I wouldn’t see either of them as fit humans to raise children.",2021-01-18T14:09:26Z,1
33,UgyPyEixx-S2degoMI14AaABAg,REDinitial,"To reply to this I just want to point out a few things. 
According to Amber she has kept herself financially independent from him. While she might not have the hundreds of millions he once had she is a Hollywood actress who has had projects as big as Aquaman. Now, I am of the opinion she did use him financially, but according to her statements she has not and never needed to. She had her own staff, own assistants and team throughout their relationship in what concerned their life and careers, the only ""communal"" staff would be the household staff who are not in charge of their agendas.
While they did use his penthouses for accommodation, so did Amber's friends. Several of them lived rent free in JD's penthouses which were part of the same building, so while he had the advantage of owning their home, she also had her closest friends living with her essentially which I would say adds to the dynamic, by which I mean to say she was not alone and her support group nearby. Don't really understand the ""his country"" comment as they are both American?

And lastly, why is it that we think a person who could supposedly have the power you are describing in the relationship could not also be the victim of abuse?",2021-01-18T13:55:55Z,2

At most you can argue about the semantics of ""Men are often thought to be abusers but just as often it CAN be women"" - maybe you didn't like how I worded that.

I swear, I thought I was someone live streaming their own murder, I’m not joking. Then she disappeared for a couple days, just laying low, as it turns out; I was actually worried about what the next thing we’d heard about Rachel might be.

So in this case, the immediate danger had long since past; it really hasn’t a major focus since, and it seems very much like a Cold War has set in around the subject. Whether they’ve communicated or not during the time since upload or if that plays into how matters have been settled is not something we privy to, nor does it really matter. The next couple videos are her trying to keep a semi-regular upload schedule despite the circumstances.

She’s coping dude, I figure. Watch a few more videos, listen to her fine poetry; gauge for yourself as to where you figure her headspace is at.",2021-02-10T11:39:37Z,0

And then we need to take it a step further and truly consider whether you can stay with a person like that for the rest of your life, always be the one to ""compromise"" and bit by bit erase yourself, because a person like that will never change. I believe that when you think of it like that, it'll hit home a bit more as women often want to change the man by staying with them and pandering to their illness even though we know nothing will change about him because he doesn't consider it, or himself, as a problem.",2021-02-12T18:58:27Z,1
93,UgwwGNf2-xZu9AdQq3h4AaABAg,Loco Madman,"@VintageButterfly Thank you for making my point far more eloquently than I was able to make it, and for sharing. That’s not an easy thing to say because no one ever believes another female capable of being the abuser, be it in hetero or LBGQT+ relationships.

I know I was never confused about whether or not the black eyes & busted lips were a good thing. The just knew I wasn’t going to end up become my dad, no what the cost. Boxing champions don’t exactly make for strictly positive male role models. 

Never let another guy get away treating me like that. I can’t fairly claim to be an innocent; in fact I always taunted her that she hit like she was wearing pillows just to make her angry enough to do it again so she’d have do it again & she had to spend days, weeks forced to look at the results of those actions; what kind of reverse psychological torture is that? 

Fact was she couldn’t actually hurt me, bruises & abrasions fade; too much calloused scar tissue already for her to do anything more than superficial damage. Goading her into breaking her own hand during all this.. I can’t defend that as not being even more abusive to her, she actually felt bad about what she did.

That she was willing to fight also saved my life, literally & metaphorically; there’s definitely two sides to every story. We were both from the side of the tracks where you needed someone you could trust watching your back; violence is sometimes a necessary evil, but loyalty alone wasn’t a proper foundation to build a relationship to start out with. There was just levels of security I was prepared to do without in order to repay a life debt (doing neither of us any real favour).

I just don’t know why I didn’t end things until I felt I repaid the life I thought I owed to her simply because because she was there when no one else was.",2021-01-19T14:07:20Z,1
94,UgwwGNf2-xZu9AdQq3h4AaABAg,VintageButterfly,"I get the feeling (as someone who did see the red flags and reacted far too late) that a large part of the problem is the way we talk about abuse as a black and white issue, as if either you're a good person or you're the worst person ever and then you abuse people. But when you're in that situation, your abuser is not a bad person but a broken, pitiable creature. So you (or at least I) keep telling yourself that they can't be abusive because you know they're not evil but hurting. On the contrary you (or at least I) feel obligated to help them hurt less, and start to worry that if you're not helping them, if they feel abandoned, then you're the abuser. It gets even worse if you're so afraid of returning home that you stay out as long as possible, even knowing that they don't like that. Because doesn't that mean you hurt them too? (It didn't help that the person who terrified me was female. As soon as people realised that ""they"" are female, not male as they'd assumed, their advice changed from ""Leave him"" to ""Have you tried talking to her?"")

So maybe we need to stop talking about abuse as if it's one perfect person being hurt by Satan incarnate, and start acknowledging that its a relationship between imperfect human beings going very wrong, started acknowledging that you don't need to be perfect to be hurt or to deserve a better relationship, started acknowledging that you can be hurt by people, can leave people even if they aren't evil.",2021-01-19T10:56:01Z,2

104,UgybmYfxAhCy4TnHLkB4AaABAg,Tymon Dąbrowski,"​@James Edwards What are you talking about? Just because she is criticizing someone or something, it doesn't mean she's doing something wrong. Who are her victims and what did she do to them? I myself consider her one of the most considerate channels - see for example the Gay Girl Good God video, she was really empathizing with the person who wrote it while criticizing the book and the ideas that were written into it. On the other hand, you can see how some youtubers criticize Girl Defined just on the basis of them being ""cringe"" or how harsh criticism met people just Jeffrey Star, Onision or even Nicokado Avocado on other channels. Or you can see how Girl Defined dismisses God is Grey (""not a real Christian"" etc.). I do believe that looking from the other side is important, but I also believe that Rachel is doing her best already to put herself ""in the shoes of her *opponents*"" (or people she criticizes) and I don't think there is any need for her to try harder.
""X says Y is doing wrong things, that means X is mean so X is a bad person too"" is very flawed and simplified, in my opinion.
Talking about bad things is the only things we can (as a society) get better. And criticizing someone's words is something very different from criticizing someone as a whole, too.
(Just for the record - yes, it's good she edited the video the second time and reuploaded if she hasn't censored it properly the first time. But that's just technical issue).",2021-01-17T21:04:36Z,8
105,UgybmYfxAhCy4TnHLkB4AaABAg,James Edwards,"@Lillian Hazen She had to edit it and reuploaded it because she made a mistake and said something she shouldn't have in the previous video.  In a perfect world that should have resulted in a simple e-mail request asking for the video to be fixed instead of threats, calls to police, etc.  I'm guessing there are extremely bad feelings on both sides of the issue, ala Amber & Depp and the ex may have seen this as abusive behaviour by Rachel.  That certainly doesn't call for threats, the proper response should have been a quick note to you-tube or a lawyer, or both, rather then threats.

Keep in mind, a large part of the content of this channel is very negative, critical and given the repeat targetting of certain other you-tubers it could be considered harrasing and abusive.


Perhaps Rachel could use this incident to reflect back on some of her behaviours, videos and try putting herself in the shoes of her victems?

Maybe do more of the ositive videos I enjoy and less of the insults, harasment and abuseive videos that make me cringe because they remind me far to much of the bullys from my childhood?",2021-01-17T00:35:43Z,1
106,UgybmYfxAhCy4TnHLkB4AaABAg,Lillian Hazen,Also if you are a viewer and you watched the original let's help Rachel get the same views and likes on this video by letting it play on mute in a different tab - that abusive ex doesn't deserve the privilege of watching one of her videos do poorly just because she had to edit and reupload it due to his threats.,2021-01-16T19:26:56Z,25
