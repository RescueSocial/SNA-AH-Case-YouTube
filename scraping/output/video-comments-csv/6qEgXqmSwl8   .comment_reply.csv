248,UgzJ1a9nCFBHGK76-_R4AaABAg,Anna Ruby,@Silky Shish I also regret believing her. I didn't automatically believe her but she presented with fake evidence. Amber Heard appeared with bruises and a witness who claimed they were on call in the middle of it. Then donating her divorce settlement which was a lie. She got a VRO and fooled even fooled a UK judge who had all the evidence presented to her. It's made me question everything.,2021-10-11T13:58:38Z,0
249,UgzJ1a9nCFBHGK76-_R4AaABAg,Silky Shish,"@kssgpv  - Thank you for your point of view, but with all due respect I am going to have to correct you here.

I agree that when someone goes down the road of addiction, it does change a person and that person will do things they normally would not do when not under the influence.  For example, when it comes to violent behaviour they may get into a physical altercation with a stranger or rob someone for money to get money to fund their drug fix.

But, we are talking specifically about domestic abuse not just any other kind of violent acts.  For someone to actually have the ability and no filter to violently abuse someone they love and who is their partner takes a certain inherent propensity towards that.  So, simply just becoming an addict or alcoholic does not cause this if someone inherently is not a domestic abusive person to begin with.  It doesn't matter how addicted they are to substances.  

I worked with mental health and addiction patients and also, I actually worked in domestic violence for a government organization and also myself was a victim of abuse.  So, I have not only personal, but professional experience with this.  And for you or anyone to make s blanket statement that someone who does drugs and is addicted will become a domestic abuser is actually far from the fact.  

Also to add to this, a person does not suddenly become a domestic abuser when there has been no history of violence or abuse.  That is not a fact at all.  A domestic abuser usually has a history of some kind abuse towards others (animals or other people) either mentally, verbally or physically) and it is inherent in their chemical make-up and they possess psychological markers for this.  What does change is the frequency and intensity of this behaviour can increase over time.  But no, someone doesn't just suddenly out of nowhere become an abuser when they have no history of it especially, at such a late age.  Johnny was over 50 and then he suddenly becomes this crazy, raging, violent abusive man?  Nope..does not happen.",2020-04-21T00:17:49Z,0
250,UgzJ1a9nCFBHGK76-_R4AaABAg,kssgpv,"@Silky Shish personally i believed he was violent because he had issues with alcohol abuse , it made sense to me. And also because they had an age difference, i thought he might be over jealous of her.",2020-04-21T00:01:04Z,0
251,UgzJ1a9nCFBHGK76-_R4AaABAg,Silky Shish,"@Isaac S - I agree.  At least she changed her tune.  I have come across the few faithful Amber supporters across YouTube channels who CHOOSE to be ignorant and have not looked at the evidence or listened to the audio tapes so, they can continue the false narrative of Amber being a victim of domestic violence.  Makes me sick that anyone still blindly support her.",2020-04-19T21:56:39Z,1
252,UgzJ1a9nCFBHGK76-_R4AaABAg,Silky Shish,"@Cosmic Witch - Yes, I know about all the evidence showing she was actually the one who is guilty of being the abuser and not him.  But, before all the evidence started seeping in, why did you automatically believe he was guilty?  Again, I only ask because I am curious.  We live in a ""believe all women"" mentality.  So, if woman claim abuse against men; society tends to believe her.  I believe in evidence and don't automatically believe guilt based on gender.  So, why did you think he was automatically guilty?

377,UgxaXi1jMykFjy1xeWR4AaABAg,Silky Shish,"‚Äã@Mark Walker  - Thank you for your point of view, but with all due respect I am going to have to correct you here.

I agree that when someone goes down the road of addiction, it does change a person and that person will do things they normally would not do when not under the influence.  For example, when it comes to violent behaviour they may get into a physical altercation with a stranger or rob someone for money to get money to fund their drug fix.

But, we are talking specifically about domestic abuse not just any other kind of violent acts.  For someone to actually have the ability and no filter to violently abuse someone they love and who is their partner takes a certain inherent propensity towards that.  So, simply just becoming an addict or alcoholic does not cause this if someone inherently is not a domestic abusive person to begin with.  It doesn't matter how addicted they are to substances.  

I worked with mental health and addiction patients and also, I actually worked in domestic violence for a government organization and also myself was a victim of abuse.  So, I have not only personal, but professional experience with this.  And for you or anyone to make s blanket statement that someone who does drugs and is addicted will become a domestic abuser is actually far from the fact.  

Also to add to this, a person does not suddenly become a domestic abuser when there has been no history of violence or abuse.  That is not a fact at all.  A domestic abuser usually has a history of some kind abuse towards others (animals or other people) either mentally, verbally or physically) and it is inherent in their chemical make-up and they possess psychological markers for this.  What does change is the frequency and intensity of this behaviour can increase over time.  But no, someone doesn't just suddenly out of nowhere become an abuser when they have no history of it especially, at such a late age.  Johnny was over 50 and then he suddenly becomes this crazy, raging, violent abusive man?  Nope..does not happen.",2020-04-17T00:33:46Z,5

387,UgyZKT8BvQBi1UnM79N4AaABAg,Twinkle Toes,"Kanika Garal I would have been right there beside you, because I didn‚Äôt believe the accusations against him, I defended him & I was incredibly suspicious about her!! I am actually a survivor of domestic abuse myself, when I heard her stories in her claims, there were so many holes in them, so many things that didn‚Äôt add up or make sense and didn‚Äôt seem right to me. Sadly, I‚Äôve been bruised and battered enough in the past, that I know what those things look like! When she claimed he threw an iPhone at her and then showed a supposed picture of what her face looked like, the markings didn‚Äôt add up to how the phone would have actually marked up her face. Then, when she showed up at court for the restraining order, she had way less bruising on her face than she should have if the marks she claimed to have gotten in the first photo were real! Also, the bruising she did have was in a completely different spot on her face, a part that didn‚Äôt have any markings in her other photo, and was very small for what she claimed to have happened to her! The‚Äù bruise‚Äù was also not in the stage of bruising it should have been! The ‚Äúbruise‚Äù she had, was what a much older bruise would have looked like (if it were real), much lighter - not that of a bruise that was brand new and developed just the other day!! It‚Äôs sad that I would actually know these things from firsthand experience, but it was crystal clear to me then that she didn‚Äôt and was lying!! The bruise also wasn‚Äôt there, completely gone, in photos taken in the following days, which is impossible!!! ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I also knew that with the claims of abuse she was making, how often and how severe - on a regular basis, we would have seen evidence of that in all the photos and videos of them out and about at various functions and whatnot, but we didn‚Äôt - not a single speck, scratch, bruise, black eye, broken nose, busted lips, or marks anywhere on her body or injuries of any type! However, there is evidence of Johnny being abused in photos and videos!! ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Shes a complete bitch, and as a DV survivor, I don‚Äôt take kindly to someone lying about being abused, tarnishing an actually good mans name and reputation, causing him to lose jobs and have his career damaged, for her own messed up reasons! It‚Äôs like she‚Äôs belittling & demeaning what I and so many others have gone through, or are still going through, making a complete mockery of our suffering, and Johnny‚Äôs, with her disgusting hoax! I hope the bitch fries and loses everything - never to work in Hollywood again!! ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",2020-04-19T10:56:39Z,1
