99,UgzX1zrxq2j4wKevz-V4AaABAg,I’ve seen The Rum Diary twice now and I still don’t see any chemistry between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard during the film. He appears really shy of her and they appear quite distant. But then they were both with other partners at the time. I read that he tracked her down a few years later after he and Vanessa Paradis split. I’m guessing that she was quite charming and friendly on the set of the film and gave him the impression that she might like him at some point.,Sana Xx,46,2020-07-14T18:17:19Z

129,UgzydN0pIQlfkV2mMHB4AaABAg,"شاب أمريكي الهوية اشتغل في الصحافة، و التحق بصحيفة أمريكية معنية بأخبار إحدى دول أمريكا اللاتينية، و انتقل للعيش في البلد نفسه الذي يقع فيه مقر هذه الصحيفة الأمريكية و تعنى برصد أخباره، و كان الأمريكان في هذا البلد الأجنبي من التجار و السياح و شداة المآرب المختلفة بموقع تعجب له النفوس من كثرة العدد و تحقيق الحيوات المستقرة على هذه الأرض، و من البدهي أن تسلك إليهم الصحافة في هذا البلد سبيلاً تنتفع من ورائها، و تحقق بها خدمة رسالتها السامية حيثما نادى مناديها النصوح.

يعيش الشاب الأمريكي في البلد الأجنبي، و تنعقد عليه آمال رئيس تحرير الصحيفة في بعث روح تحيي موات الصحيفة و تشد بنيانها و تنهض بها أن تئول أنقاضاً مسوّاةً بسطح الأرض، و لكن الصحفي الأمريكي يجهل الخطوط الحمراء، و قواعد العمل الواقعية، و اعتبارات الظروف المحيطة المنافية لأصول الصنعة و أخلاق المهنة، و من هنا كانت خيبة آمال رئيس التحرير التي عقدها عليه، لا من قصور أدوات الصحفي الشاب، و لا من قلة وعيه و إيمانه بسمو الرسالة في مهنته، و لا من خبو جذوة الحماس في نفسه.

في البلد الأجنبي يحظى الشاب الأمريكي إلى جانب ما استفاده من تجربة عمله المريرة في الصحافة، بمشاهدات و رؤى و معايشات يومية للناس من حوله، تثير في نفسه أفكاراً و مشاعر و تزيده حكمة و فلسفة، منها ما يتعلق بالسياسة، و منها ما يتعلق بالمراهنات الرياضية، و منها ما يتعلق بالأحوال الاجتماعية، و يحظى الشاب الأمريكي أيضاً بتجربة عاطفية تذيق قلبه لواعج عشق امرأة من تلك الأوساط الاجتماعية التي يصله بها أسباب عمله في الصحيفة.

هذه المغامرة العجيبة التي يعيش أيامها الشاب الأمريكي تهبه أكثر مما يستوعبه عقله و وجدانه، و يستعصي عليه أن يجاري صروفها و مفاجآتها و غزارة مادتها في فكره و روحه، فلا يجد لنفسه معيناً على الصبر و احتمال المشقة إلا المدامة، و كذلك أضحت قوارير خمر (الرام) نديمه في سكره، و رفيقه في رحلته، و صاحبه في سفره، و أنيسه في وحشته، و ظهيره لمجابهة أهوال هذه المغامرة الجامحة.

شاهدوا الفيلم يا صحاب! فهو فيلم ماتع.. لكن إذا تطلب الأمر أن تشيحوا بأوجهكم و تغضوا أبصاركم عن بعض المشاهد فيه، فامتثلوا لما فيه زكاة نفوسكم و صلاح عملكم.",عطا الله المطيري,1,2020-04-05T12:00:17Z

194,Uggo8AW3UQ9zZXgCoAEC,"Johnny Depp knew Hunter S. Thompson. When Hunter shot himself, Depp searched around and found  his old novel rejected multiple times. After seeing the movie, it is no mystery it was rejected way back when. It is like reminiscing about my early 20s. Of course, I might change the title to Tequila Diary, the 487 proof rum would be JP5 jet fuel and Puerto Rico would be either Tijuana, Singapore, or Olongapo City in the Philipines. I have better stories to tell, but not as believeable as the one he tells.

222,UgxONXTdTTxJzafeXpN4AaABAg,"You all are silly. Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas was based on Hunter S. Thompson's novel of the same name published in 1971. Thompson wrote Rum Diary in 1960 (wasn't published until 1998) too. Since they're both the creations of the same author it's only natural there will be some similarities in plot, characters, tone, etc. Keep that in mind, then enjoy.",Erilis666,5,2011-08-29T22:28:11Z
