No, he see's the opportunity to cash in off of it.

I'm not hating on him. Make that money. I'm serious when I say I feel sorry for him. Either, he has talk about the same subject so much it's tiring OR he is actually this obsessed with celebrities backstabbing each other. Newsflash, that's what Hollywood is built on.",2021-03-22T20:29:48Z,0

And went on TV and said it had all been donated. As in past tense... she tried using the excuse he sued her at least two years later as to why she didn't donate anything. Liar she is. 

Johnny likely knew she wouldn't keep her word, so said he would donate it in its entirety. But she claimed it wasn't fair he would get the 'tax write off' so said it was only fair he would instead donate 14million!! 🙄

42,UgxxQT9rxFKH-_90oqZ4AaABAg,Christine Venner,"@GoodwillWright I'm not trying to diminish what she did to JD.
All I am trying to do is find a net positive if the appeal isn't granted. 
I truly believed JD should have won his liable case last year, and was shocked and saddened that he didn't. 
So now I'm much more skeptical about his success in this permission to appeal case.
And when a person as conditions of a divorce settlement is instructed to donate the settlement to charity, as Turd was, then she can't just decide to not donate it.
So it is akin to theft, as those charities were expecting that money, and had possibly budgeted with that money in mind.
So you can disagree with my opinion of whether it was theft or not, but don't try to tell me I'm in some way diminishing what she did to JD, just because I'm hesitant to believe he will get justice this time.",2021-03-22T22:23:05Z,7

Substantially, her crime is abuse towards JD and lying under oath. Not donating money she was never contractually obliged to donate is not a crime. Hell, if she just kept her mouth shut and quitted while she was ahead $7mil, she probably would've gotten away scot-free. If AH had never tried to push a false Samaritan, then no-one would feel she needed to make the donation. But she had to go for another win and JD had enough at that point.
