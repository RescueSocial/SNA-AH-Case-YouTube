Estas son algunas cosas que tal vez no sabías sobre la vida de Amber Heard.

Heard y su ahora ex-esposo Johnny Depp se conocieron en el 2012 en el set de Diario de un Seductor y se casaron en el 2015. En mayo del 2016, Heard solicitó el divorcio y lo acusó de abuso doméstico. Heard escribió en la declaración,

""Durante toda nuestra relación, Johnny fue verbal y físicamente abusivo conmigo. Soporté un excesivo abuso emocional, verbal y físico de Johnny, que ha incluido ataques furiosos, hostiles, humillantes y amenazantes hacia mí cada vez que yo cuestionaba su autoridad o no estaba de acuerdo con él.""

Heard también presentó una foto en donde aparece con la cara lastimada. Afirmó que la herida fue causada por un golpe de Depp con su teléfono. Ella le dijo al tribunal,

""Vivo con el temor de que Johnny vuelva a [nuestra casa] sin avisar para aterrorizarme, física y emocionalmente.""

Pero la policía no encontró pruebas de ninguna agresión cuando respondió a una llamada por pelea doméstica en la casa de la pareja en mayo del 2016, y Heard se negó a presentar una denuncia penal. El abogado de Depp le dijo a la corte,

""[Heard] está intentando asegurar una resolución financiera prematura alegando abuso. Johnny no puede protegerse a sí mismo ni a Amber del escrutinio de los medios.""

Mientras que Heard acusó a Depp de violencia doméstica, ella fue arrestada por presunta violencia doméstica contra su ex pareja, la fotógrafa Tasya van Ree, en septiembre del 2009. Según TMZ, Heard y van Ree discutieron en un aeropuerto, y Heard presuntamente golpeó a van Ree. Fue arrestada y fichada por un delito menor de violencia doméstica, pero el fiscal se negó a seguir adelante con el caso, porque ambas mujeres vivían en California.

Años después, van Ree dijo públicamente que el incidente fue ""sobresensacionalizado,"" y describió a los oficiales que hicieron el arresto como ""homofóbicos"" - pero en realidad la oficial es una mujer gay, y escribió en Facebook,

""¡No soy homofóbica en lo absoluto! [...] El arresto se hizo porque hubo una agresión (yo lo presencié) y las partes involucradas estaban en una relación doméstica.""

Van Ree también emitió una declaración cuando los informes del arresto resurgieron en el 2016, diciendo,

""Es desgarrador que la integridad y la historia de Amber sean cuestionadas una vez más. Amber es una mujer brillante, honesta y hermosa y tengo el mayor respeto por ella. Compartimos 5 maravillosos años juntas y mantenemos contacto hasta el día de hoy.""

Whereas, the once-famous actress is having a difficult time coping and contacting many of the Hollywood stars including one of her close friends Jason Momoa. Yes, mate it is what it is...

The Aquaman star, Jason eventually opened up on his relationship with Amber Heard and what he feels about her. Well, we all know how fun and interesting the kind of a guy Jason Momoa is. Jason is everyone's favourite (laughing)

Adding on a valuable tip for you, try to stay calm and patient around him, Jason really can't see anyone sitting calm, he's a real attention seeker. If the word ""attention seeker"" is given to someone ever in the future, I would request the officials to kindly give it to Jason Momoa. , 

Well as I already mentioned, Jason would never attempt any prank that can harm a person in any way. We must just agree that we adore and love him a lot. And on the other hand, Jason never forgets to charm ladies, with his hot looks and of course beautiful smile. Who called him Jason Momoa and not Jason the charmer? (laughing)
Speaking about Jason Momoa's and Amber Heard's bond, they really get along well together, but as you all know things never stay the same. Jason's and Amber's friendship bond was affected after Jason decided to play a master prank on Amber Heard.

Once while shooting for Aquaman, the charming yet playful Star  Jason Momoa, played a sick prank on Amber heard. Well, what he did was truly sad and tragic. It's like you have made a sandhill and out of nowhere a random person comes and destroys your sandhill. Did you feel that pain now?

Well, Jason didn't ruin Amber Heard's Sandhill (laughs jokingly) but did something the same that left Amber Heard sad all day long. Let me break this down for you, The Game of Thrones star, intentionally in the name of prank, tore the last ten pages of Amber Heard books that she regularly used to read in between shots and takes... Like, yes!!!

Shockingly Jason did that, I don't know why that doesn't sound like a Big deal to him, but it is...And guess what? Amber's a bookworm (oops Jason, you shouldn't have done that) But what's done is done (laughing nervously) We feel you, Amber!!

Amber Heard shared all the incident, where Jason went to keep her attention on set, she confessed, "" I love Jason we had so much fun together but he is allergic to being ignored and I'm a bookworm who loves to read the books, he adopted this method of ripping out the pages of my book so I would pay attention to him"". Poor Amber...

Whereas, the crew staff was helpful to Amber Heard, due to Jason's book ripping pranks the crew on the set of Aquaman designed a book bag out of green screen material so that Amber could carry her books on set with her and read between takes.

""I would feel so bad if someone was going out of  their way to throw her book to her but they could tell I was going crazy so the wardrobe built me a book bag"" Amber stated in the interview with Good Morning America...""

Delving into the history, Amber Heard's personal life problem which is no more limited to her speaks a lot about her behaviour and the kind of a person she is. As we all know that Amber Heard and Johnny Depp are hooked into the legal drama, things seem to slip out of Dear Amber's hand. 

Talking about the legal drama, the case eventually took a u-turn resulting in a case favouring Johnny Depp. The recent leaked audio call and bodycam footage revealed the true colours of Aquaman star Amber Heard. Accepting the fact that Johnny Depp was never the abuser it was Amber Heard who physically abused Johnny Depp celebrity news clevver news entertainment news information overload inform overload johnny depp appeal amber heard aquaman 2 informoverload amber heard petition

However, the Warner brothers never reacted to the demand of fans, asking to kick out Amber Heard from the Aquaman 2, while they had already kicked Johnny out of 'the pirates of Caribbean series. 

Johnny Depp fans tweeted in his favour and asked that Heard should be fired from Aquaman 2. While one of Johnny's fans tweeted writing "" I don't understand why Warner brothers fired Johnny Depp but not Amber Heard, they both have evidence of being abused by each other, and abusive women are rarely held to the same standard as abusive men"".

The Aquaman star, Jason eventually opened up on his relationship with Amber Heard and what he feels about her. Well, we all know how fun and interesting the kind of a guy Jason Momoa is. Jason is everyone's favourite (laughing)

Adding on a valuable tip for you, try to stay calm and patient around him, Jason really can't see anyone sitting calm, he's a real attention seeker. If the word ""attention seeker"" is given to someone ever in the future, I would request the officials to kindly give it to Jason Momoa. , 

Well as I already mentioned, Jason would never attempt any prank that can harm a person in any way. We must just agree that we adore and love him a lot. And on the other hand, Jason never forgets to charm ladies, with his hot looks and of course beautiful smile. Who called him Jason Momoa and not Jason the charmer? (laughing)
Speaking about Jason Momoa's and Amber Heard's bond, they really get along well together, but as you all know things never stay the same. Jason's and Amber's friendship bond was affected after Jason decided to play a master prank on Amber Heard.

Once while shooting for Aquaman, the charming yet playful Star  Jason Momoa, played a sick prank on Amber heard. Well, what he did was truly sad and tragic. It's like you have made a sandhill and out of nowhere a random person comes and destroys your sandhill. Did you feel that pain now?

Well, Jason didn't ruin Amber Heard's Sandhill (laughs jokingly) but did something the same that left Amber Heard sad all day long. Let me break this down for you, The Game of Thrones star, intentionally in the name of prank, tore the last ten pages of Amber Heard books that she regularly used to read in between shots and takes... Like, yes!!!

Shockingly Jason did that, I don't know why that doesn't sound like a Big deal to him, but it is...And guess what? Amber's a bookworm (oops Jason, you shouldn't have done that) But what's done is done (laughing nervously) We feel you, Amber!!

Amber Heard shared all the incident, where Jason went to keep her attention on set, she confessed, "" I love Jason we had so much fun together but he is allergic to being ignored and I'm a bookworm who loves to read the books, he adopted this method of ripping out the pages of my book so I would pay attention to him"". Poor Amber...

Whereas, the crew staff was helpful to Amber Heard, due to Jason's book ripping pranks the crew on the set of Aquaman designed a book bag out of green screen material so that Amber could carry her books on set with her and read between takes.

""I would feel so bad if someone was going out of  their way to throw her book to her but they could tell I was going crazy so the wardrobe built me a book bag"" Amber stated in the interview with Good Morning America...""

Delving into the history, Amber Heard's personal life problem which is no more limited to her speaks a lot about her behaviour and the kind of a person she is. As we all know that Amber Heard and Johnny Depp are hooked into the legal drama, things seem to slip out of Dear Amber's hand. 

Talking about the legal drama, the case eventually took a u-turn resulting in a case favouring Johnny Depp. The recent leaked audio call and bodycam footage revealed the true colours of Aquaman star Amber Heard. Accepting the fact that Johnny Depp was never the abuser it was Amber Heard who physically abused Johnny Depp celebrity news clevver news entertainment news information overload inform overload johnny depp appeal amber heard aquaman 2 informoverload amber heard petition

However, the Warner brothers never reacted to the demand of fans, asking to kick out Amber Heard from the Aquaman 2, while they had already kicked Johnny out of 'the pirates of Caribbean series. 

Johnny Depp fans tweeted in his favour and asked that Heard should be fired from Aquaman 2. While one of Johnny's fans tweeted writing "" I don't understand why Warner brothers fired Johnny Depp but not Amber Heard, they both have evidence of being abused by each other, and abusive women are rarely held to the same standard as abusive men"".

After being effectively ostracized from Hollywood, Johnny is now getting back on his feet and winning over public opinion.
In the meantime, Amber is losing jobs left and right, and the consensus among fans is that she orchestrated a hoax against Johnny in an attempt to ruin his career.
But it now looks like Amber’s plan is backfiring and instead of ruining Johnny’s career, she’s ruining her own.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

Now it turns out that Amber Heard may have not written the statement or OP ED in accusations against Johnny Depp. This could another case of defamation or fraud. Let's break it down in today's video.

Johnny Depp’s fans are once again rallying on social media to demand justice for Johnny after the star suffered yet another major setback in his ongoing legal battle against ex-wife Amber Heard and the British tabloid The Sun.

In the meantime, Amber Heard is shading Johnny on Instagram and the fans are absolutely furious.

So does this mean Johnny won’t be able to prove his innocence after all?

Johnny Depp’s defamation court case against Amber Heard just hit another snafu after briefly being held up due to global events, only recently getting the greenlight to go to trial. The new bump in the road is because Amber Heard’s legal team, headed up by Roberta Kaplan but also including John Quinn, Julie Fink, Davida Brook, have quit. Roberta Kaplan is a well-known lawyer. She’s associated with the Times Up movement in Los Angeles and co-founded that movement’s legal defense fund. However, the defamation case against Amber Heard isn’t happening in Los Angeles.

Per documents, Amber Heard signed off on and is fine with the change. Instead of being represented by Kaplan Hecker and Fink LL she will switch to local counsel. The organization cited “travel and logistics” becoming “more costly in light of the pandemic” as the reasons for bowing out. Make sure to watch the whole video and see why Amber Heard's lawyers quit and exposed her. In addition, do us a favor and like the video and subscribe and turn on the notification bell.

JOHNNY DEPP fans will not be successful in trying to ""pressure"" Aquaman 2 bosses into sacking the star's ex-wife, Amber Heard.

After Johnny Depp and Amber Heard clashed in a public court case over claims the Pirates of the Caribbean star was a ""wife-beater"", a petition was started. The online appeal was made by Depp's fans who called for Heard to be sacked from the upcoming DC Comics movie, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom. The petition, titled ""Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman 2"", has ​gained ​more than 1.85 million signatures at the time of writing.

In response to this petition Heard said last year: ""Paid rumours and paid campaigns on social media don’t dictate [casting decisions] because they have no basis in reality.

""Only the fans actually made Aquaman and Aquaman 2 happen. I’m excited to get started next year."" (Via Entertainment Weekly)

Now, the producer of Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom has responded to the popular petition.

Peter Safran ​said: ""I don’t think we’re ever going to react to, honestly, pure fan pressure."" (Via Deadline)

Safran went on: ""You gotta do what’s best for the movie.

""We felt that if it’s James Wan and Jason Momoa, it should be Amber Heard. That’s really what it was.""

Addressing the ongoing campaign against Heard led by Depp fans, the Hollywood executive added: ""One is not unaware of what is going on in the Twitter-verse.

""But that doesn’t mean you have to react to it or take it as gospel or accede to their wishes.""

Safran repeated: ""You have to do what’s right for the film, and that’s really where we landed on it.""

Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom is currently due out late next year, but it has already been granted a stunning cast of actors.

Not only are Momoa and Heard reprising their roles of Arthur Curry and Mera respectively, they will ​also ​be joined by a legendary Star Wars villain ​actor ​once again.

Boba Fett star Temuera Morrison will be reprising his role as Arthur's father, Thomas Curry.

Earlier this year Morrison exclusively gave​ Express.co.uk​ the first details about his Aquaman return​.​

He revealed: ""I'm coming out [to shoot] in September. I think they want to do another one... I think they start earlier.""

When pressed about his storyline, Temuera would only say: ""I'm not in it that long!""

The Mandalorian actor also recalled some fond memories of working on the first Aquaman movie.

Temuera said: ""Yes, they gave me a wig and made me look younger! James Wan was there.

""I think I got the part because Jason [Momoa] loved [1994 film] Once Were Warriors [which Temuera starred in].

""Jason was a big mover because he wanted me to play his dad and the studio got talking and I met the casting agent... and yeah next minute I'm there.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3gLxNtqhR18/default.jpg,120,90,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3gLxNtqhR18/mqdefault.jpg,320,180,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3gLxNtqhR18/hqdefault.jpg,480,360,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3gLxNtqhR18/sddefault.jpg,640.0,480.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3gLxNtqhR18/maxresdefault.jpg,1280.0,720.0,Nonstop News,"['Johnny Depp fans demand Amber Heard is sacked', 'from Aquaman - producer responds', 'magazine news', 'the producer of Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom', 'has responded to the popular petition', 'Not only are Momoa and Heard reprising their roles of Arthur Curry', 'and Mera respectively', 'they will \u200balso \u200bbe joined by a legendary Star', 'Wars villain \u200bactor \u200bonce again', 'I think I got the part because Jason Momoa loved 1994 film', 'Once Were Warriors which Temuera starred in']",25,none,Johnny Depp fans demand Amber Heard is sacked from Aquaman - producer responds ( Magazine News ),"Johnny Depp fans demand Amber Heard is sacked from Aquaman - producer responds ( Magazine News )

#8: The Divorce In 2016
The reasons she provided for her taking this decision involved her accusing Depp of being an abuser, which was in fact quite shocking to his fans as well as the people who worked with Depp, as this side of Johnny was never witnessed by them.  Initially, everyone was siding with Amber, but eventually, the truth about Heards violent nature came out. At the time of the divorce between the two celebs, Depp was hushed and his word meant nothing as opposed to Ambers. When Amber provided the court with such reasons, Depp denied these accusations and even stated that all this was being done by Amber in her best interests, and not his. 

#7: The Lawsuit In 2019
The messes the two of them were drowning in were further worsened by the onset of a lawsuit. And no, this time it wasn’t filed by Amber, but in fact against her! Amber Heard expressed her feelings about Johnny Depp, using explicit content in an article published by the Washington Post, injuring Depp’s reputation, which led to the beginning of the 50 million dollar suit against Amber Heard. 

#6: Leaks Of Audio 2015
The audio leaks seemed to be the turning point for Depp’s ill fate as this was one of the most solid forms of proof that helped enable him to be proved as the innocent in the messy trial.What did the leaked audio messages contain? The conversations between the two were as toxic as their marriage. It involved a lot of content that went along the lines of them being involved in domestic violence, her being the main abuser. 

#5: Severed Fingertip
If Amber truly was the one to have faced being physically harmed why was Depp’s finger left severed? According to various sources, including Johnny Depp himself, Amber Heard injured Depp’s finger due to a heated argument that broke out between the two of them, resulting in him having to rush to the emergency room to get it fixed. In an interview, she claims he was the one who would constantly hurl things at her, when in fact later on it was proved it was just quite the opposite that was happening behind closed doors. 

#4: Depp's Bruised Face 2020 & Amber's Fake Bruises
To what extent this woman went to prove her innocence is quite disgusting we must say. At one point, Amber had exposed her scarring and bruising on social media to damage Depp. On investigating further into Amber’s bruises, they seemed to be fake as the next day she made an appearance with no trace of even a single scratch on her. 

#3: Premiere of Alice Through The Looking Glass
Depp did a fabulous job in the movie Alice Through The Looking Glass. His fans were quite enlightened with his presence on the day of its premiere, but the same cannot be said about Johnny Depp! Unfortunately, we all assumed his speech to include his dark humor which he constantly brings out from time to time but indeed many believe it to be a cry for help. He mentioned being in pain, being tired, and wanting to go home.


#2: Career 2016 Onwards
It is quite a well-known fact that once someone is surrounded by constant negativity, this not only takes a toll on their mental health but also starts affecting their professional life too. Depp met Amber on the sets of The Rum Diary, and both were happily married then. Depp fell into Amber’s trap, both ending their marriages and marrying each other a few years later. Depp was quite a huge hit in Hollywood. Everyone wanted to hire him. The array of films he was getting by the year was massive and all he was doing at every award function was hoarding awards. It is quite evident that following 2016, things for him took a turn downhill professionally. 

#1: Mother
Depp’s mother was quite well known for her difficult nature. Apparently, it was said Johnny was the only person who could tolerate her cruel nature. It was till her very end that he stood by her side and tended to all of her needs. If Depp could respect such a woman till her last breath, why would he ever harm someone who he claimed to have loved? There is no answer to that question by anyone but stands as a self-explanatory form of evidence to prove Depp was not the kind of man to hurt any woman, especially Amber.

Did Amber Heard just get booted for Aquaman 2? This would be great news to Johnny Depp and Aquaman fans around the world. The #FireAmberHeard movement is going strong. It seems the Aquaman 2 director, James Wan, does not even want Amber Heard in the movie. 

It seems like everyone is turning against Amber Heard. Including the actors in the movie such as Jason Momoa, Nicole Kidman, William Dafoe, etc. The Johnny Depp Amber Heard legal battle is still at the forefront of celebrity news. 

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Celebrity breakups are a common occurrence, but the situation between Johnny Depp and his now ex-wife Amber Heard was messy to say the least. There have been some heavy accusations, and Amber was quick to label her ex “Mr. Monster.” But was using her divorce settlement to make a huge charity donation really a noble act or is this star not what she appears to be? We’ll talk about the true story of this couple who met on the set of The Rum Diary and seemed to be head over heels in love. In addition to the defamation lawsuit, she’s also gone to court over the movie London Fields and the surprising charge of. . .dog smuggling? New evidence has emerged in the form of a 911 call but instead of answering our many questions it’s just raised more of them since each celeb insists it corroborates their side of the story. Johnny Depp has no shortage of support from his family and ex-partners, including fellow star Winona Ryder, who has nothing but good things to say about her former boyfriend and co-star. 

They say there are three sides to every story: each person’s perspective and the truth. What do you think is really going on here and do you think either of these celebs deserved to be cancelled due to their actions?

Find out next.

Amber Heard is the now 34 year old Hollywood actress who played in The Rum Diary, The Ward, and how could any of us forget her smash hit I Do..Until I Don’t, and as you all know, the now 57 year old Johnny Depp is a pirate.

Amber and Johnny got married on February 3, 2015, Amber filed for divorce on May 23, 2016, and the divorce was finalized on January 13, 2017. However, both Johnny and Amber claimed spousal abuse during the divorce hearings and Depp is now suing gossip magazines for libel, slander, and defamation for perpetuating the story, which greatly negatively impact his acting career.  So we’re going to break down Amber Heard’s body language during her intense deposition, along with their recorded conversations, to find out whether these accusations against Johnny Depp appear to be true or false.

Give this video a thumbs up if you think Amber Heard was lying
Give this video a thumbs down if you think Amber Heard was very truthful

Now in the comments, what would you do if you were Johnny Depp or if someone fabricated terrible lies about you? Would you sue them, would you take that false accuser down? Let everyone know in the comments below.

Zach Snyder has announced that Amber Heard isn't going to be in any future DC movies because of her controversy with her ex husband Johnny Depp. Allegedly she has faked most of the accusations against Johnny, which has cost both of them a lot of both time, money and energy.
Many did not see Amber Heard in the new trailer for ""Justice League: The Snyder Cut"" and they were hyper-happy about it. 

HBO Max released the newest trailer for Zack Snyder's ""Justice League"" on Sunday March 14, 2020, and it received a lot of praises, with many saying it was better than what was released in 2017. However, many also noticed that Heard's name wasn't in the credits and they didn't see her in the trailer, making some wonder if Heard has been removed from the movie.

But fans got thunder-struck when they saw that Amber Heard is still part of Zack Snyder's ""Justice League'' 4 hours cut. What a trick there Snyder.

Zach Snyder has announced that Amber Heard isn't going to be in any future DC movies because of her controversy with her ex husband Johnny Depp. Allegedly she has faked most of the accusations against Johnny, which has cost both of them a lot of both time, money and energy.
Many did not see Amber Heard in the new trailer for ""Justice League: The Snyder Cut"" and they were hyper-happy about it. 

HBO Max released the newest trailer for Zack Snyder's ""Justice League"" on Sunday March 14, 2020, and it received a lot of praises, with many saying it was better than what was released in 2017. However, many also noticed that Heard's name wasn't in the credits and they didn't see her in the trailer, making some wonder if Heard has been removed from the movie.

But fans got thunder-struck when they saw that Amber Heard is still part of Zack Snyder's ""Justice League'' 4 hours cut. What a trick there Snyder.

Heard filed for divorce from Depp in May 2016 and even obtained a temporary restraining order against Depp. Even though Depp and Heard reached a settlement in August of 2016, a recent report by International Business Times has revealed that Heard could face three years behind bars.

This report comes after Depp sued Heard for defamation over abuse claims. We’ve made a video that looks into the real reason Amber Heard could end up behind bars. Watch the video to find out!

Will the Johnny Depp vs. Amber Heard saga EVER end?! Johnny’s $50 million defamation trial against his ex-wife has just been postponed AGAIN and is now scheduled for April 11, 2022!
This means we’ll be hearing about this celeb drama for at least another year!
But even though we’ll have to wait for a while to hear the final verdict on who lied about what, the fans have already made up their mind.
Even those who used to be Team Amber are now uniting behind the #JusticeforJohnny hashtag and accusing Amber of weaving a web of lies to ruin Johnny’s career.
So while we wait for the case to wrap up in court, let’s take a look at all the evidence pointing to Amber Heard lying about Johnny being the bad guy.

According to Jason Momoa, Amber Heard was fired from Aquaman 2 for a reason. For quite some time, Jason Mamoa has been creating waves in the entertainment business. Indeed, since the release of Aquaman earlier this year, he has been the buzz of Hollywood, and he has been cast in a variety of roles in a number of films, causing us to speculate. Due to Aquaman's tremendous success soon after its release, the next time we see this heartthrob on the big screen will be in 2022.

For quite some time, and I mean for several years, Johnny Depp has been fighting head to head against his ex-wife Amber Heard. Johnny Depp and his legal team have been moving mountains in order to provide the court with the evidence that they need in order to see that Amber Heard is not who she says she really is. The situation between these two movie stars is one that has constantly taken many turns for the worst, however it just may be that this case will be brought to justice soon. There are several different documentations that have assisted Johnny Depp in revealing many of Amber Heard’s lies, however it just may be that there are several other individuals stepping in to help him as well.

Amber Heard has been manipulating her fans to believe her lies for quite a while now, and it is crystal clear. In January of 2020, some call recordings between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard were released to the public that showed that it was actually Amber who was physically ab*sing[1]  Johnny Depp.[2]  Yeah, that was Johnny and Amber arguing if Amber had actually hit her or not, and it seemed pretty clear that she had, but she was arguing how hard or aggressive it was. I mean, this woman has had cases worth millions of dollars opened against Johnny Depp for enduring physical ab*se. But this seems to be the sick reality of that woman.

Amber Heard has been manipulating her fans to believe her lies for quite a while now, and it is crystal clear. In January of 2020, some call recordings between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard were released to the public that showed that it was actually Amber who was physically ab*sing[1]  Johnny Depp.[2]  Yeah, that was Johnny and Amber arguing if Amber had actually hit her or not, and it seemed pretty clear that she had, but she was arguing how hard or aggressive it was. I mean, this woman has had cases worth millions of dollars opened against Johnny Depp for enduring physical ab*se. But this seems to be the sick reality of that woman.

Ever since the Johnny Depp and Amber Heard scandal began, fans have been taking sides and choosing who they want to support in the legal battles. At first, everyone was on Ambers side, supporting her story but now it seems the tables have turned.

Fans of Johnny have started a change.org petition to have Amber Heard removed from her role as Mera in Aquaman 2 and over 1.8 million people have signed the petition and the number just keeps rising! However, after the pandemic started last year, many movies and releases have been postponed and filmings have been rescheduled due to their inability to play in theaters, comic book movies were particularly impacted by this. But it seems that things are looking better in 2021 and movies will go back to resume filming and appear in theaters this year. Which begs the question, who will play ""Mera"" in Aquaman? Will Amber continue her role, or will she be replaced by someone else?

But as it turned out, it was actually the opposite. Just a year after their private wedding ceremony, problems started spiraling in, and now, their divorce and lawsuits are even more excruciating and longer than the marriage itself. But how exactly did this happen? Well, let’s first go back to where the Johnny Depp - Amber Heard story started in the first place. 

Johnny and Amber first ignited a spark between them when they starred together in the 2011 comedy-drama film, The Rum Diary. Johnny portrayed a journalist who was immediately smitten with Amber’s character. However, this love story between the two quickly travelled from screen to real life. Amber Heard even told Vogue quickly after the release of the film that, “Working with Johnny was amazing. It was better than I ever imagined, which is really saying something.” Technically, hearing these words from the actress already hinted that the two really hit it off easily during their film taping, and even though the two of them did not quickly jump into a relationship right after the film shooting, the same year that the film was released, the relationships they both were in at the time fell apart, and that suggested quite a rare coincidence. Depp was with his then-partner Vanessa Paradis whom he lived with for 14 years and whom he had two kids with, while Heard was with her then-girlfriend Tasya van Ree. After the film, and the rumors circulating about Johnny and Amber’s involvement with each other, Johnny and Vanessa’s relationship ended, while Amber ended things too with Tasya van Ree. Then, in 2012, the two officially started dating. The couple showed everyone that they were deeply in love with each other. But now, their relationship has turned out to be one of the messiest in history, considering their year-long marriage. 

In 2014, after a couple of years dating each other, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard announced their engagement. Amber was spotted wearing an engagement ring, which quickly sparked rumors about an upcoming wedding between the couple. This rumored engagement did not stay secret long enough, as Johnny himself confirmed this in an interview after discussing wedding planning and pointing out that he was wearing ""a chick's ring"" on his finger. In 2015, after several years of dating, Johnny married Amber in a private ceremony in their home in LA. Johnny Depp is no amateur star, and neither is Amber Heard. So this wedding did not stay secret for too long. The marriage started how everyone expected it would be --near perfect and rich with love. They were both wealthy personalities after all. But there’s a saying that goes around that says, “you shouldn’t really believe everything you see on picture.” 

In 2017, the couple was officially divorced, but the war they were fighting was definitely far from over. In 2018, Amber wrote an op-ed to The Washington Post entitled “I spoke up – and faced our culture's wrath. That has to change,” where she explained that she was hurt, and in which she spoke about the treatment of women in these types of cases. Despite not involving Johnny’s name on her statement, Johnny’s team felt that it was pertained to him, having recently filed a complaint against him and, well, technically they just got out of their failed relationship. So, in March of 2019, the 57 year old actor took action and filed a lawsuit of $50 million against her, for defamation over the said article in the Washington Post. The suit said that Amber ""is not a victim of domestic abuse, she is a perpetrator,"" and denied that Johnny ever abused her. At the time, Depp's lawyer called the article an ""abuse of the #MeToo movement"" and claimed Heard ""masquerades as victim rather than abuser."" And instead, the suit said that her allegations were part of an ""elaborate hoax to generate positive publicity"" for the actress. Johnny also testified that he was actually the one being hurt by his wife before, which was proven through recorded phone calls. Johnny also brought up Amber’s alleged cheating acts and affairs with actor James Franco and multi-billionaire Elon Musk.

In July 2020, during his closing speech at Johnny Depp's libel suit against the British tabloid The Sun, Johnny's lawyer David Sherbourne called Amber Heard a compulsive liar with a propensity to abuse, he said “He has never hit a woman in his entire life period full stop nada” and explained how Amber was the one who physically attacked Johnny on multiple occasions. 

Since then several celebrities have chimed in with their statements supporting Johnny and accused Amber of being a liar and even some celebrities that supported Amber have switched sides to Johnny and apologized for taking her side in the first place! Which begs the question, who were these celebrities and what did they say to defend Amber which they are now sorry for?

When it comes to being a person in Hollywood, you always want to go and get that ""dream role"" that can elevate you to new heights. But, ask any major actor and they'll tell you that it's not just important to get that dream role, but to KEEP getting those kinds of roles as they'll prove just how good you are and show your range as an actor. For Amber Heard, she's had that ""dream role"" via Mera in Aquaman, but in terms of proving herself in other films...not as much. And apparently a new indie film she's in isn't doing her any favors. We'll break it down for you.

Do you feel happy knowing that she's not getting a lot of film love given all that's going on with her court case? Do you think that if Aquaman 2 goes well that she'll be able to elevate herself once again? Or do you think that she is slowly unraveling in Hollywood?

Amber Heard remains at the frontline of celebrity news due to his ongoing legal battles with ex husband Johnny Depp. The Johnny Depp Amber Heard court case has gotten ugly for many reasons.

While some celebrities prefer living a quiet life away from the public, others just have so many scandals following them. In this video, we are going to talk about Johnny Depp and Amber Heard, who have been on each other’s throats ever since they split up and how Amber Heard might be facing jail time for one mistake she made in all this.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

Amber Heard Faces 10 Years In Prison For Accusations Against Johnny Depp!!!

https://youtu.be/UvsHWTGHmts

Amber Heard and Johnny Depp have been involved in major legal battles for years now and
it seems that this drama is coming to an end now with new revelations and plot twists. It is
not easy to keep up with Johnny and Amber's case but what is most important here is that
Amber Heard is potentially facing jail time.
The court drama made a major plot twist when Johnny Depp filed a defamation lawsuit
against his ex-wife. He not only claimed that she lied in court, but also that she was abusive
toward him. However, the actors will need to wait even longer to get an official court ruling. If
the court rules in Johnny Depp’s favor, Amber Heard could be facing up to three years of jail
time.
Basically, Amber Heard claimed that Johnny Depp had physically and emotionally abused
her. Their original court drama in 2015 resulted in a restraining order against Johnny Depp,
but that’s also where the blurry lines began. Johnny claims that Amber had faked her black
eye seen at the court, and Amber Heard’s stylist corroborated this.
She stated, “Throughout the day of December 16, 2015, I could see clearly that Amber
Heard did not have any visible marks, bruises, cuts, or injuries to her face or any other part
of her body.”
But this was not the only time Amber Heard lied and was caught lying. Why would she do
that all the time? It was her strategy. She wanted to play a victim and she was good at it until
the truth came out. Even in 2017 she still managed to convince everyone that in this
situation she suffered from Johnny Depp's actions against her. Amber Heard made people
trust her and, moreover, she almost ruined Johnny Depp’s career, as the publicity called him
a ‘wife beater’ and supported Amber and sympathized with her.
While nothing could be proven, Amber Heard’s accusations against Johnny Depp were
enough to significantly damage Johnny’s reputation and acting career. The story also almost
derailed the latest Pirates of the Caribbean movie, Dead Men Tell No Tales, Johnny Depp
has faced significant levels of hate and ostracizing over the past five years. But then things
have changed.
The first thing which ruined Amber Heard's vicious plan was the leaked audio. And since the
audio leak, the internet has already returned to Johnny Depp's side of the issue. Johnny
Depp filed a defamation lawsuit against his ex-wife just over a year ago, and Amber Heard
attempted to get the case dismissed but her request was denied.
Johnny Depp initially filed the suit to sue Amber Heard for $50 million. But now it appears
that she could not only be forced to pay the sum, but she could also be facing jail time.
According to the International Business Times:
“If Heard will be proven guilty of faking her bruises, she could face three years of
imprisonment. According to the Wallin & Klarich Law Firm, the California Penal Code Section
141 PC stated that it is illegal to alter, modify, plant, place, conceal, manufacture or move
any physical matter with the intention of causing someone to be charged with a crime. Some
would face felony charges for this”.
But it doesn’t stop there. Amber Heard could also be charged with offering false evidence.
These are also considered felony crimes and each carry a maximum sentence of up to three
years.
And again, it doesn’t stop here. More and more evidence has come forward to showcase
that Amber Heard was the one who abused Johnny Depp and that she had a strategy of
making people think she was innocent. The number of times Amber lied is impressive: she
was caught lying in court (the audio recording situation), she asked or even forced people to
lie for her in court and she stole her assistant’s s*xual assault story and used it as her own.
Later it turned out that Amber Heard has a history of violence.
...
And now I want to know your opinion about this situation. Do you think Amber Heard is
facing jail time? And what’s gonna happen with Johnny Depp’s career? Let me know your
opinion in the comments section down below.

There are many tales in Hollywood about certain stars going and “ruining their own career”. Mainly because they go and do acts that ruin themselves by exposing their “true selves”. Like with Kevin Spacey and the nastiness that he partook in. In the case of Amber Heard though, her destruction has been much more of a “slow burn”, mainly because she’s tried to convince people she’s one thing, but got caught and revealed that she’s actually something else entirely.

There are many tales in Hollywood about certain stars going and “ruining their own career”. Mainly because they go and do acts that ruin themselves by exposing their “true selves”. Like with Kevin Spacey and the nastiness that he partook in. In the case of Amber Heard though, her destruction has been much more of a “slow burn”, mainly because she’s tried to convince people she’s one thing, but got caught and revealed that she’s actually something else entirely. Allow us to break it all down. Be sure to like the video and subscribe to the channel!

Just when you thought things could not get any worse for Johnny Depp. Pirates of the Caribbean and Disney have finally decided to move on from Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow. All this while the Amber Heard Johnny Depp headline celebrity news with their ongoing legal battles.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

Amber Heard Friends Testify AGAINST Her & Side With Johnny Depp

Amber Heard’s Lawyer QUITS & EXPOSES Amber For Ruining Johnny Depp!?

https://youtu.be/nEyBc2Ie2MU

Body Language Analyst REACTS to Amber Heard's CRINGE Deposition | Faces Episode 15

https://youtu.be/hQFFm_X2lps

Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been battling in court over the validity of
her accusations of domestic violence. However, this story took an even juicier
side when Amber Heard's friends started supporting Johnny Depp and testifying
against Amber Heard.
Make sure you stay till the end to see which Amber Heard’s friends sided with
Johnny Depp and what they have to say about Amber.
Despite the fact that Amber Heard’s vicious plan to ruin Johnny Depp’s career
was pretty successful lately, it seems like right now the tables have turned. As
you may already know, there have been several times when Amber Heard was
caught lying or using other people to stay in the driver's seat in this case. She
allegedly bribed her own sister, and used her assistant’s s*xual assault story.
Basically, things got very dirty and it seems like her fans, friends and some
other people don’t want to be linked to the perfect liar.
So, let’s start with Twitter and some fans’ thoughts on Amber Heard’s lies.
When Amber Heard said it out loud that Johnny Depp was an ab*ser and even
showed bruises, fans couldn’t help but bombarded Amber with tweets and
comments. Among the Twitter users was Adam Waldman - a former member of
Johnny's legal team - who tweeted a picture of the actress as he tried to discount
her allegations against her ex-husband.
Alongside the images he wrote: “12/15/15 allegation 'I had bruised ribs. Bruises
all over my body, bruises on my forearms from trying to defend the blows. I had
2 black eyes. I had a broken nose. I had a broken lip. Justice Nichols - I believe
her. UK Appeals Court - we believe him. But oops ... PHOTO SHOOT!”
Responding to the post, the actress said: “Yes Mr Waldman, I may be wearing
makeup on this occasion but on every occasion you will still be short.”
Then another Twitter user commented, “I'd rather be short than an abusive gold
digger Woman shrugging”, Amber hit back, “It's good to be realistic with your
goals”. Then, there was another tweet, written in Spanish that read, “Amber
Heard talking to Johnny Deep's lawyer regarding a set of photos where she
claims she was made wearing makeup to cover hit marks, a broken nostril,

bruises and more made by Johnny...but...”, the actress replied, “And so?” Looks
like Amber Heard is having fun and doesn't care what people say about her.
Amber Heard could expect such a reaction from people and, probably, that is
why she is so calm and confident. But what she did not expect was that her
friends sided with Johnny Depp. You have to wonder who and why betrayed
Amber Heard, and we are going to break it down for you in a minute.
Amber Heard was shocked when Laura Divenere (interior decorator to the stars)
and Amber’s former friend testified against her. Laura Divenere worked for
Johnny Depp and Amber Heard as their interior decorator in downtown LA in
the Eastern Columbia Building from July 2014 to sometime in 2016. And after
the pair splitted up Laura continued to work for Amber. She explains, ""I have
been and continue to consider myself a friend of Amber's. I remain in regular
contact with Amber. I have not communicated with Mr. Depp since 2016."" It is
an interesting ally in this case for Johnny Depp as she is the first person in the
case to identify as a friend of Amber Heard's but give testimony in support of
Johnny.

Plus I want to know your opinion about Amber Heard’s friends taking Johnny
Depp’s side. Do you think they just don’t want to be linked to Amber Heard
because she is a liar? Let me know your opinion in the comments section down
below. Thanks for watching this video and don’t forget to hit that subscribe

Your support on Patreon is much appreciated for the time-consuming task it is to make these analyses. Thank you for supporting for whatever amount of time you’re able to.

I’m a Danish linguist, educated in Statement Analysis (SA) & Conversation Analysis (CA). In these methods, it’s understood that people subconsciously want to tell the truth, which is why the truth is revealed in their language use.

Literature that I use in my job as external lecturer and that I recommend, if you want to know more about Conversation Analysis and Narrative Analysis:

Hutchby, Ian (2006): ‘Media Talk – Conversation Analysis and the Study of Broadcasting’. Maidenhead: Open University Press. (Basic Principles + Conversation Analysis of News Interviews)

Rowland, Robert (2009). “The narrative perspective”. Kuypers, Jim A. (ed.): ‘Rhetorical criticism – perspectives in action’. Plymouth, MA: Lexington Books, p. 117-141. (The Basics of Narrative Analysis)

As some like to say, things can turn around in an instant. Sometimes they refer to sports teams going and turning around a season with a good run. But for the court case concerning Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, there might just be a big swing a coming if the newest reports are to be believed. Why is that? Well, for the longest time the clear ""winner"" of the cases and verdicts between the two was Amber Heard. But now, based on the recently revealed body cam footage from LAPD, and her testimony on the matter, things might just be swinging against her and jail time may be the result.

Can Amber Heard do anything out of the kindness of her own heart? I guess not. Amber Heard is clearly up to her schemes again. Even when it comes to her newborn daughter. A daughter who maybe might have Elon Musk or Johnny Depp as the father.

Johnny Depp and Amber Heard are back on the frontlines of celebrity news. Amber Heard just had a baby girl and rumors are swirling on who the baby's father is. Many are saying it is Johnny Depp. But no public statements have been made in this regard by either Johnny Depp or Amber Heard. So no one knows for sure yet. In this video, we breakdown the story in detail. This celebrity drama goes down while the Johnny Depp Amber Heard civil court case rages on.  

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

For a marriage that ended just after a year, it is indeed quite a long and agonizing journey that the former couple took after that. Johnny and Amber have gone from obsessing over each other to hating one another in the blink of an eye, and now, their divorce has gone into a messy turn. When Johnny Depp and Amber Heard were first married, everyone thought they were very much in love, and maybe that was a fact for a short time, until the two decided to end their marriage in 2016. However, this divorce isn’t the end of the story, it is actually just the start of a tragic drama that is about to unfold. Along with the divorce, Amber filed for a restraining order against Johnny the same year, for reasons that the latter had allegedly hurt her during their marriage. This, however, was denied by Johnny countless times and the evidence supplied for this issue had also been proven to be fabricated. Not cool, Amber. But this still wasn’t the end of their fight.

Amber claimed that Johnny had been terrible with her at various points in their relationship. Because of these allegations, news publisher The Sun called Johnny a very bad name, and a term that obviously offended Johnny because he stays true to his statement that he never hurts anyone. Johnny filed a libel case against the news company but unfortunately, he lost on this one. But aside from this, another incident also ignited the feud between the former couple, when Amber Heard wrote an op-ed article in The Washington Post, where she claimed to be a victim of domestic maltreatment. The article was entitled “I spoke up – and faced our culture's wrath. That has to change.”  In the op-ed, she explained that she was maltreated, and she spoke about the treatment of women in the same domestic cases. Apart from this, she also became the face of the women empowerment movement, which many fans thought was the wrong place for Amber to publicly raise her case. For starters, she never really had a legitimate proof that she was hurt by Johnny Depp, and he even had evidence against her that she was stating her facts the other way. These sets of evidence include the phone call that Johnny made with Amber, where she admitted hitting JOhnny. And the list goes on, including the alleged affairs of Amber with actor James Franco and multi-billionaire Elon Musk, and the missing donations to charity that Amber claimed she would make after her $7 million dollar divorce settlement with Johnny. Despite not involving Johnny’s name on her statement, Johnny’s team felt that it was pertaining to him, having recently filed a complaint against him and, well, technically they just got out of their failed relationship.  So, triggered by this, Johnny filed for a $50 million dollar defamation lawsuit against Amber Heard. This lawsuit is still ongoing to this day, and the latest trial will be held in court by July of 2021. However, Amber had recently tried to dismiss this case for the second time, bringing up the lost libel case with The Sun as her back up defense. But, aside from millions of fans who support Johnny on this feat, countless friends, family, former lovers, colleagues, and other celebrities have stood up to defend Johnny against his ex wife. Who are they? And what lies did Amber say that they claimed to be false? Let’s find out in this video, but first, make sure to hit that subscribe button and smash that notification bell for more updates. Let’s dive in!

1. Winona Ryder
Winona Ryder is one of Johnny Depp’s former flames, and one that really ignited fans’ interest at that time. Winona and Johnny met in Tim Burton’s classic, Edward Scissorhaands, and dated for four years. 

2. Vanessa Paradis
Another celebrity and another one of Johnny’s ex flames, Vanessa Paradis also spoke up about the allegations. Johnny Depp has been involved with many actresses throughout his career, he is indeed a very handsome and career-driven man, but if there’s one woman who caught and kept his attention for a very long time, it’s Vanessa. 

3. Penelope Cruz
Perhaps in terms of a case of physical maltreatment against a woman, it is important to look at who defends who. In Johnny’s case, there are more women supporting and believing he is innocent than the women who take Amber’s side.

It seemed like the couple’s burning desire for each other turned into a burning dislike as quickly as it started. Five years after Amber Heard filed for divorce, the fight between the former couple is still ongoing. And even though the divorce had been finalized four years ago, the chaos that their marriage brought is far from over. But since the latest court hearing for the former couple’s defamation lawsuit will take place soon, there have been many major changes and happenings that just surfaced, and that includes a huge win for Johnny’s case. It seems like the Virginian judge handling their case is tired of Amber’s lies and is not willing to listen to her anymore. How did that happen? Well, it is a pretty detailed case but in this video, we’ll lay out everything you need to know. But before that, make sure to smash that subscribe button first and hit that notification bell for more updates. Let’s dive in!

Before everything else, let’s go back to the beginning of this case. Johnny and Amber first ignited a spark between them when they starred together at the 2011 comedy-drama film, The Rum Diary. This love story between the two had quickly travelled from screen to real life. Johnny was then sharing his life with partner Vanessa Paradis, a French actress and singer, whom he lived with for 14 years and whom he had two kids with, while Amber was with her then girlfriend Tasya van Ree. Shortly after the film’s release, the two broke off their current relationships and officially started dating. Their relationship was something you can describe as romantic and utterly beautiful. But today, it’s now one of the messiest in history. Amber Heard filed for divorce in 2016. Along the divorce filing was her request for a temporary restraining order against Johnny, accusing him of physically hurting her. Johnny, up to this day, vehemently denies the allegation. Even though the couple’s divorce was finalized in 2017, lawsuits have been made due to Amber’s concerning allegations against Depp. She also alleged that at the time of her filing for divorce, Johnny threw a phone at her which caused her to bruise her face, an accusation that Johnny denied, and investigators found false. Turns out, the photos were staged. Not so cool, Amber. Aside from this, the Aquaman actress also stressed that Johnny was hurtful towards his former lovers, which Johnny’s ex-wife and ex-fiancee proved false.

But despite the police’s information, news publication The Sun still called Johnny Depp a very bad name which angered the actor, causing him to file a libel lawsuit against the publication. Sadly enough, Johnny lost this lawsuit, which resulted in his career’s downfall as major production company Warner Bros. fired him from his role as Grindelwald in the upcoming third installment of the series Fantastic Beasts. Clearly, this broke Johnny’s heart. 

But even though her name became pretty big during this case, it is undeniable that Johnny’s name in the industry is a lot bigger. So, Amber started to lose her supporters’ trust, especially when more and more evidence against her was turning up, including the phone calls she made with Johnny admitting that she did hit him, her alleged affairs, and even her false claims that she donated her $7 million dollar divorce settlement to charity. Until now, Amber couldn’t provide any proof that she did donate her settlement money, which she publicly promised before. 

You might be wondering why Johnny Depp filed for a lawsuit in the state of Virginia when neither him nor Amber lives in the state. Virginia is one of just ten states that adhere to what’s known as the lex loci delicti rule, which is Latin for place of the wrong where the tort was committed. That’s defined as where the publication occurs. The Washington Post’s servers, the publication in which Amber released her Op Ed, are located in the state. Another reason why Johnny did not file his lawsuit in California is because of its strong Anti-SLAPP statute. Now, what is an anti-SLAPP law? These laws are intended to prevent people from using lawsuits, such as defamation suits, to intimidate people who are exercising their First Amendment rights.

So, Amber started to lose her supporters’ trust, especially when more and more evidence against her was turning up, including the phone calls she made with Johnny admitting that she did hit him, her alleged affairs, and even her false claims that she donated her $7 million dollar divorce settlement to charity. Until now, Amber couldn’t provide any proof that she did donate her settlement money, which she publicly promised before. 

You might be wondering why Johnny Depp filed for a lawsuit in the state of Virginia when neither him nor Amber lives in the state. Virginia is one of just ten states that adhere to what’s known as the lex loci delicti rule, which is Latin for place of the wrong where the tort was committed. That’s defined as where the publication occurs. The Washington Post’s servers, the publication in which Amber released her Op Ed, are located in the state. Another reason why Johnny did not file his lawsuit in California is because of its strong Anti-SLAPP statute. Now, what is an anti-SLAPP law? These laws are intended to prevent people from using lawsuits, such as defamation suits, to intimidate people who are exercising their First Amendment rights.

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard.

There was a time when Amber Heard was known for her work as an actress and activist, but that was before her marriage and divorce from Johnny Depp. How did all of this take place? We’ll take a look back at the true story of this star and see how she went from her childhood home in Texas to her career history in New York City. Long before her ex-husband promised her “global humiliation,” they were falling in love on the set of “The Rum Diaries,” but right from the beginning there were accusations of infidelity, some of which involved Elon Musk! Amber was once a contestant in beauty pageants, but dropped out of high school to pursue her career. But this isn’t the first time she’s had bad press with a partner; most fans have forgotten about an altercation between her and her then-girlfriend, Tasya van Ree. This also isn’t her first lawsuit, as things got unpleasant on the set of the film “London Fields.” It seems like everyone is turning against her, while her ex has support from his family and his other exes including Winona Ryder.

Amber Heard’s Lawyer EXPOSES Her For Ruining Johnny Depp

https://youtu.be/pZR2_v4UpgI

Amber Heard Officially FIRED From Aquaman 2 Role! (REACTIONS)

https://youtu.be/QBCEXSVjBrM

Amber Heard was extremely successful after divorcing Johnny Depp: she got cast in the
biggest movie franchise of her career - DC's 'Aquaman' - became the spokesperson of
cosmetics giant L'Oréal Paris, as well as American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) ambassador
for women's rights with a focus on gender-based violence.
So many people even claimed they have never heard about Amber until this infamous
divorce: “Had no idea who she was until that divorce. I didn’t even know that it was her who
played Mara!” - one fan said.
However, the tables have turned and now Amber Heard is finding that her career as an A-list
Hollywood actress might be over. She has reportedly been kicked from Aquaman 2 and she
is about to lose the contract with L'oreal Paris.
So what was the reason for all of these problematic events for Amber Heard? Apparently,
her well-planned strategy to ruin Johnny Depp’s life has been shattered. And now no one
believes that Amber is an innocent victim as Johnny showed in a court undeniable evidence
of Amber being an abuser (audio, text messages and so on).
Heard lost the appeal to dismiss Johnny Depp’s $50 million defamation lawsuit and we
learned that the Aquaman star could be facing up to 3 years of jail time if found guilty of
manipulating evidence against her then-husband. But even beyond the former couple’s
seemingly never-ending legal battle, Heard has come under a lot of fire after evidence
presented to the court as part of the lawsuit revealed that she’s physically and emotionally
harassed Depp while twisting the narrative in her favor and painting the Pirates of the
Caribbean actor as a domestic abuser.
In fact, the petition to remove her from Aquaman 2 recently reached a whopping 400,000
signatures and is on its way to passing the half-million threshold. This is essentially the same
kind of backlash and blacklisting that Depp had to endure a couple of years ago, so you can
see why fans of the legendary star are asking for justice with such fervency. And now,
according to a new report by Cosmic Book News, Warner Bros. has gone forward with firing
Heard from Aquaman 2 by buying out her contract.
Also there was one more petition against Amber Heard. “A liar and an abuser, a shame for
women,” begins one of two Change.org campaigns to remove Amber Heard, 33, from her
role as global spokesperson for cosmetics brand L’Oréal.
And yet, she has claimed in her court declaration countering ex-husband's $50 million
defamation suit against her that her career took a serious hit and she received death threats
that forced her to constantly keep on changing her contact details.
Here is what Amber declared in her motion to dismiss Johnny Depp’s lawsuit filed in Fairfax
County, Virginia Circuit Court:
""Following my highly-publicized separation from Johnny, I read accounts in the media
referring to me as a victim of domestic violence. In response, many people called me a liar

(without ever hearing my story). I was dropped from a global fashion brand's upcoming
campaign. I lost a part of a movie in which I had already been cast. People I have never met
or spoken to threatened me with violence. I received so many death threats I had to change
my phone number on a near-weekly basis.”
Isn’t it fair that her career might be over with Johnny as it started with him?
As reported by MEAWW earlier, although Heard's career in the entertainment industry began
in 2003 when she appeared in two music videos - Kenny Chesney's 'There Goes My Life'
and Eisley's 'I Wasn't Prepared,"" and went onto star in an array of TV shows and movies, her
career really took off in 2015 — the same year when she married Depp — when she had
prominent roles in four mainstream movies.


Now I want to know your opinion. Do you think Amber Heard’s career will be over soon as
she destroyed it on her own? Let me know what you think in the comments section down
below.

biggest movie franchise of her career - DC's 'Aquaman' - became the spokesperson of
cosmetics giant L'Oréal Paris, as well as American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) ambassador
for women's rights with a focus on gender-based violence.
So many people even claimed they have never heard about Amber until this infamous
divorce: “Had no idea who she was until that divorce. I didn’t even know that it was her who
played Mara!” - one fan said.
However, the tables have turned and now Amber Heard is finding that her career as an A-list
Hollywood actress might be over. She has reportedly been kicked from Aquaman 2 and she
is about to lose the contract with L'oreal Paris.
So what was the reason for all of these problematic events for Amber Heard? Apparently,
her well-planned strategy to ruin Johnny Depp’s life has been shattered. And now no one
believes that Amber is an innocent victim as Johnny showed in a court undeniable evidence
of Amber being an abuser (audio, text messages and so on).
Heard lost the appeal to dismiss Johnny Depp’s $50 million defamation lawsuit and we
learned that the Aquaman star could be facing up to 3 years of jail time if found guilty of
manipulating evidence against her then-husband. But even beyond the former couple’s
seemingly never-ending legal battle, Heard has come under a lot of fire after evidence
presented to the court as part of the lawsuit revealed that she’s physically and emotionally
harassed Depp while twisting the narrative in her favor and painting the Pirates of the
Caribbean actor as a domestic abuser.
In fact, the petition to remove her from Aquaman 2 recently reached a whopping 400,000
signatures and is on its way to passing the half-million threshold. This is essentially the same
kind of backlash and blacklisting that Depp had to endure a couple of years ago, so you can
see why fans of the legendary star are asking for justice with such fervency. And now,
according to a new report by Cosmic Book News, Warner Bros. has gone forward with firing
Heard from Aquaman 2 by buying out her contract.
Also there was one more petition against Amber Heard. “A liar and an abuser, a shame for
women,” begins one of two Change.org campaigns to remove Amber Heard, 33, from her
role as global spokesperson for cosmetics brand L’Oréal.
And yet, she has claimed in her court declaration countering ex-husband's $50 million
defamation suit against her that her career took a serious hit and she received death threats
that forced her to constantly keep on changing her contact details.
Here is what Amber declared in her motion to dismiss Johnny Depp’s lawsuit filed in Fairfax
County, Virginia Circuit Court:
""Following my highly-publicized separation from Johnny, I read accounts in the media
referring to me as a victim of domestic violence. In response, many people called me a liar

(without ever hearing my story). I was dropped from a global fashion brand's upcoming
campaign. I lost a part of a movie in which I had already been cast. People I have never met
or spoken to threatened me with violence. I received so many death threats I had to change
my phone number on a near-weekly basis.”
Isn’t it fair that her career might be over with Johnny as it started with him?
As reported by MEAWW earlier, although Heard's career in the entertainment industry began
in 2003 when she appeared in two music videos - Kenny Chesney's 'There Goes My Life'
and Eisley's 'I Wasn't Prepared,"" and went onto star in an array of TV shows and movies, her
career really took off in 2015 — the same year when she married Depp — when she had
prominent roles in four mainstream movies.


Now I want to know your opinion. Do you think Amber Heard’s career will be over soon as
she destroyed it on her own? Let me know what you think in the comments section down

To say that the case between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard is one of the most interesting cases thus far would be an understatement. It just so happens to be that as the days get closer to their court date that the news that gets brought to light happens to be more and more shocking. In more recent news, it was shared that Amber Heard had a baby, and no we are not saying that she was hiding her pregnancy all this time, but regardless of how it happened, Amber Heard has a baby girl. Now there are not many good things that people on social media have to say about this news and it seems that Amber Heard has come forward to address some questions in regard to the matter.

Amber Heard knows how to get that money. She remains in the celebrity news and headlines as Aquaman 2 is set to make Amber Heard one of the highest paid actresses in Hollywood today. The Johnny Depp Amber Heard Court case continues and remains at the top of celeb news. 

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

When they met, they claimed to have a very tight relationship and that they had finally moved on and left their separate companions for each other.

Amber Heard publicly made a promise to give her $7m divorce settlement from Johnny Depp to charity but nothing was ever confirmed. Well Johnny Depp isn’t one to give up and has been granted a partial petition by a judge in New York that has ordered the American Civil Liberties Union to release documents to confirm whether Heard donated the 2017 divorce payout. 

“Mr. Depp is most gratified by the Court’s decision,” Depp’s attorney Benhamin Chew told USA Today. 

His lawyers claim that Amber was lying about donating all of her divorce settlement to ACLU and the Children’s Hospital Los Angeles and may have cost him his libel case against a British newspaper in November 2020.

His attorney Andrew Caldecott claimed that Amber’s claim of donating money to charity was “calculated and manipulative lie” that “tipped the scales against Mr. Depp from the very beginning.”

Now, they are getting huge media backlash, thanks to the negative comments against one of their lead actresses, Amber Heard. Before the whole Aquaman 2 filming even began, we all knew, and if you didn’t then you should listen to this next fact, that millions of fans were against Amber’s role reprisal in the upcoming Aquaman second installment that stars Jason Momoa and other huge stars such as Nicole Kidman, Patrick Wilson, Willem Defoe, and Randall Park. Such a big cast ensemble, and that alone proves that Warner Bros. can pay huge stars for their roles. Now, what’s up with recasting Amber Heard? You may remember that a huge number of supporters filed for a petition to be signed with the aim to request Warner Brothers to fire Amber from her role as Queen Mera, the same way they forced Johnny to leave Fantastic Beasts. However, even after garnering more than 1.6 million signatures, Warner Brothers still pushed through, having Amber reprise her role. A lot of fans were upset by this, and we mean UPSET. Everywhere you look on social media, there were mean comments about Amber, and sadly, about the upcoming Aquaman film itself. There’s no doubt that the first Aquaman directed by James Wan was a huge hit, and it deserved every inch of success because it’s aesthetically and cinematically beautiful in many, many aspects. Yet, during the promotion period, it had been noticeable that people were planning to not watch the movie and even campaign for others to boycott it too, in honor of their support for Johnny Depp, who has been let go from his role as Grindelwald in the Fantastic Beasts film series. Both movies are set to premiere in 2022, and both movies are going to be under Warner Brothers.

But what is keeping Warner Bros. head over heels for this actress who is currently dealing with a huge lawsuit in front of her, and a number of pieces of evidence against her proving that she is not all that she claims to be? With everything that’s going on in Johnny and Amber’s post-divorce chaos, it is indeed safe to say that Amber’s name is in the hot seat, and not in a positive way. Well, it turns out they are obviously risking it. Several people are slowing turning to Johnny’s side. So, in the middle of this all, fans can’t help but make their own bets on who would be the suitable replacement for her cast as Queen Mera. There are tons of different actresses that would fit the role, but it seems like in the last few months while this situation against casting Amber is happening, fans’ eyes are falling on Emilia Clarke.

But why do we think Emilia would be the perfect person to play Queen Mera? Well, there’s a number of reasons, from rekindling her romance with Game of Thrones co-star Jason Momoa. Stay tuned because we are about to enumerate all the reasons for you. But first, make sure to hit that subscribe button and smash that notification bell for more updates. So, here are some of the biggest reasons why Emilia Clarke is the best female celeb to replace Amber Heard in Aquaman 2.

1. She is one of the biggest and most celebrated female stars today
Widely known as Daenerys Targaryen, 

2. Fans would love to see Jason Momoa and Emilia Clarke back as an on screen pair
It is never easy to replace a cast member, especially a well-loved cast member, in a film’s second installment. However, if Warner Bros. did this decision as easily with Johnny Depp, considering how it might agitate his fans, then it must also be an easy feat for the production company to replace Amber Heard as well especially in the midst of her. While it is never easy with the fans (but in this case of course it is) when an actor is replaced in a franchise, it may go down better with viewers when they see Jason and Emilia reunite as an on-screen pair. The biggest reason why Emilia Clarke is a good replacement for Amber Heard in ‘Aquaman 2’ is that she is a fan-favorite since her past role with Jason Momoa.

3. Emilia’s siren-like physique can surely rock the Queen Mera suit
Amidst this chaos between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard, fans are already eyeing Emilia Clarke as the latter’s replacement in Aquaman 2.

But given that all these will remain merely fantasies for fans, we’ll just wait for 2022 and see how Aquaman 2 goes. That’s all for today, we hope you enjoyed that video, and if you did, make sure you like, subscribe, and hit that notification bell for more videos like this.

Amber Heard went from being called a hero of the feminist movement to the most hated woman in showbiz.
After she first accused her former husband Johnny Depp of being physically aggressive towards her, few people dared to doubt her words.
Both fans and celebrities were racing to offer their support for Amber while at the same time calling for Johnny to be cancelled for good.
But over the past few years, evidence against Amber has piled mountain high and Amber has now completely lost the public support she once enjoyed.
The fans and many of Amber’s fellow celebrities are now convinced Amber fabricated her accusations against Johnny and orchestrated an elaborate hoax in an attempt to ruin his career.

Did Amber Heard just get booted for Aquaman 2? This would be great news to Johnny Depp and Aquaman fans around the world. The #FireAmberHeard movement is going strong. It seems the Aquaman 2 director, James Wan, does not even want Amber Heard in the movie. 

It seems like everyone is turning against Amber Heard. The Johnny Depp Amber Heard legal battle is still at the forefront of celebrity news. 

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

According to Amber Heard’s , Johnny Depp stateside 50 million defamation against Amber Heard should be dismissed. The UK judgment should be considered and regard should be given to the op-ed publications too, Depp did commit domestic violence against Heard repeatedly which resulted in Amber Heard threatened for her life and causing a huge trauma. 

This declares a supplemental plea. For the matter of , Johnny Depp cannot win on any of his claims, thereby Depp’s complaint against Heard should be dismissed as its whole.  This appeared in the Fairfax county docket in a filling on the 13th of April. 

Now, this matter has been brought forward from April 11, 2020, Amber Heard has apparently requested for the hearing which is to be held on the 28th of May, in front of Penney Azcarate. He was assigned the case by Chief judge Bruce White.

As Amber Heard was unsuccessful in shutting Johnny’s Depp’s suit in the past, this time she is trying to see far ahead with the new strategy. At the moment, Heard has nothing to lose and help her gain a sure-footed move in the US . 

Most of the factual information that was precluded cannot allow Johnny Depp to relitigate them. These statements cannot be claimed false either, nor can they be claimed actionable by Johnny Depp, this falls under the Virginia Defamation .  Therefore his claims are obstructed due to the and the plea filing states. 

In this case, both the cases were different, one was defamation and the other was a case. The main difference between the two is that of the written word and of the spoken word. When it comes to Amber Heard, she left no stone unturned to prove Johnny wrong, and that’s she has done both of them. She has also on many occasions spoken about Johnny and the domestic violence she faced because of him. 

One of the new pieces of evidence that were revealed later is the Bodycam footage from the cops that Amber Heard had called on Johnny Depp. This bodycam is from the rampage that occurred in May 2016. In the , many of Amber Heard’s allies and friends have given evidence from the incident. 

They said that Johnny Depp hurled a phone at her face and had also thrashed the penthouse’s kitchen. What Amber Heard’s have claimed to be depictions of the damage done by Johnny Depp are quite different from what the police had observed and addressed.

Amber Heard’s friends had dialed 9-1-1 mistakenly twice, the first cops to arrive have given some new depositions since the last month, claiming that they had seen no signs of vandalism, injuries, or crime scene. 

Johnny Depp’s attorney addressed this cover-up and countered Amber Heard’s allegation the night of the rampage, a chaotic, messy crime had been reported by Amber Heard and her allies although the LAPD’s bodycam proved the testimony wrong, he had stated. 

This leads us to another point which is that Amber Heard has made a lot of cover-ups. The rampage night was not the only cover-up by Amber Heard, she has exaggerated and on many occasions made false claims. 

The bodycam is the lead that tells us that Amber Heard has been provided by her team with all the stories.The UK case can be noted as having a few flawed logic in the verdict, the appeal had been denied partly, the reason being that Johnny’s team failed to present the evidence early.

According to Amber Heard’s , Johnny Depp stateside 50 million defamation against Amber Heard should be dismissed. The UK judgment should be considered and regard should be given to the op-ed publications too, Depp did commit domestic violence against Heard repeatedly which resulted in Amber Heard threatened for her life and causing a huge trauma. 

This declares a supplemental plea. For the matter of , Johnny Depp cannot win on any of his claims, thereby Depp’s complaint against Heard should be dismissed as its whole.  This appeared in the Fairfax county docket in a filling on the 13th of April. 

Now, this matter has been brought forward from April 11, 2020, Amber Heard has apparently requested for the hearing which is to be held on the 28th of May, in front of Penney Azcarate. He was assigned the case by Chief judge Bruce White.

As Amber Heard was unsuccessful in shutting Johnny’s Depp’s suit in the past, this time she is trying to see far ahead with the new strategy. At the moment, Heard has nothing to lose and help her gain a sure-footed move in the US . 

Most of the factual information that was precluded cannot allow Johnny Depp to relitigate them. These statements cannot be claimed false either, nor can they be claimed actionable by Johnny Depp, this falls under the Virginia Defamation .  Therefore his claims are obstructed due to the and the plea filing states. 

In this case, both the cases were different, one was defamation and the other was a case. The main difference between the two is that of the written word and of the spoken word. When it comes to Amber Heard, she left no stone unturned to prove Johnny wrong, and that’s she has done both of them. She has also on many occasions spoken about Johnny and the domestic violence she faced because of him. 

One of the new pieces of evidence that were revealed later is the Bodycam footage from the cops that Amber Heard had called on Johnny Depp. This bodycam is from the rampage that occurred in May 2016. In the , many of Amber Heard’s allies and friends have given evidence from the incident. 

They said that Johnny Depp hurled a phone at her face and had also thrashed the penthouse’s kitchen. What Amber Heard’s have claimed to be depictions of the damage done by Johnny Depp are quite different from what the police had observed and addressed.

Amber Heard’s friends had dialed 9-1-1 mistakenly twice, the first cops to arrive have given some new depositions since the last month, claiming that they had seen no signs of vandalism, injuries, or crime scene. 

Johnny Depp’s attorney addressed this cover-up and countered Amber Heard’s allegation the night of the rampage, a chaotic, messy crime had been reported by Amber Heard and her allies although the LAPD’s bodycam proved the testimony wrong, he had stated. 

This leads us to another point which is that Amber Heard has made a lot of cover-ups. The rampage night was not the only cover-up by Amber Heard, she has exaggerated and on many occasions made false claims. 

The bodycam is the lead that tells us that Amber Heard has been provided by her team with all the stories.The UK case can be noted as having a few flawed logic in the verdict, the appeal had been denied partly, the reason being that Johnny’s team failed to present the evidence early. 

This incident has always been highlighted by Amber Heard and she has voiced her views on the same, saying that Johnny Depp was in a rage, beat her, and tore the house apart. When the police arrived, she didn’t look like she was assaulted nor did the house look ‘torn apart. 

The dismissal is a possibility however shocking it is, however, Depp’s team can go about it with the new set of evidence to fight the .  

Whenever the audience speculates and forms their opinions on the legal battle between Amber Heard and Johnny Depp that’s when a twist hits, this seems like a loop.

But what did really go down over there? Are the Virginian judges actually considering this move by Amber’s legal team? Let’s find out in this video. But before anything else, make sure first to hit that subscribe button and smash that notification bell for more updates on this. So, let’s dive in! 

Being a celebrity is a tricky thing, as your personal relationships can become very public affairs. Amber Heard and Johnny Depp know this all too well, as the former couple is consistently making headlines due to their ongoing legal situation. Amber Heard and Johnny Depp have been duking it out in court for years, and are showing no signs of slowing down. It has been an excruciatingly long time since Johnny had filed a suit against Amber Heard’s team after his former wife wrote details about their previous and failed marriage in an Op Ed article at The Washington Post, which then ended Johnny’s chances of getting back on his most famous Disney film franchise, the Pirates of the Caribbean series, and basically ruined his entire career. Even though the article was not directly mentioning Johnny’s name in it, it was obviously pertaining to him as Amber said, detailed, and explained that she was physically maltreated, and in which she spoke about the treatment of women in cases such as hers. So, in March of 2019, the 57 year old actor took action and filed a lawsuit of $50 million against her, for things said over the aforementioned article in the Washington Post. The suit said that Amber ""is not a product of domestic maltreatment, she is a perpetrator,"" and denied that Johnny ever hurt her physically. At the time, Depp's lawyer called the article an ""overuse of the women empowerment movement"". And instead, the suit said that her words were part of an ""elaborate stunt to generate positive publicity"" for the actress. And then of course the #NeverForget $7 million dollar’s worth of divorce settlement she got from her wealthy ex husband, Johnny, which she vowed to donate to charity but who knows what really happened to it now? A Virginian judge scolded Amber Heard for quote “wasting the court’s time”. 

But anyway, after all these, you might think she's done. But nope, it seems like the end is a long way ahead yet for Amber’s eyes. For the second time a few months ago, Amber tried to have her case with Johnny dismissed, pulling out her “he lost the case with The Sun card”, which was honestly a little low. Not cool, Amber. You may remember that before this lawsuit with Amber, Johnny had already fought for a lawsuit against new publisher The Sun, after the company called him a very bad name. 

 And after that, she then surprised the whole world with her own baby! It was born out of surrogate, and yes, no one knows who the father is, but it may actually be an important twist in the hearings to come. For the third time! Wow, being inside Amber Heard’s head might be tough. 

This latest update comes to us from Court House News, which revealed how the proceedings in court went down yesterday. One of Amber Heard’s lawyers attempted to use the verdict in the U.K. as an indication that she shouldn’t be hit with a lawsuit. Obviously Depp’s team has clapped back, so it remains to be seen if the third attempt for the case to be dismissed is successful. According to the CourtHouse News, “An attorney for actress Amber Heard on Thursday asked a Virginia judge to embrace findings from a U.K. court that Johnny Depp, Heard's ex husband.

Johnny’s lawyers have challenged back, once again, stating that the cases cannot be connected. Depp's lawyer, Ben Chew of Brown Rudnick, characterized the motion for dismissal as futile and frivolous. However, after trying to dismiss her lawsuit one too many times, Ben Chow also called out for Amber Heard's legal team to halt before Johnny asks them to be abided by law, pushing for Heard and her team to receive consequences for their repeated claims in court. 

What upsets most fans is the fact that Amber will still star alongside Jason Momoa in the latest DCEU installment of Aquaman, despite many supporters’ request for Warner Brothers to do otherwise.

What about you? Will you be watching Aquaman 2? Do you think it's fair for Johnny’s famous case to be dismissed because of the lost libel case years ago in a different continent?  See you next time!

As the seas are starting to calm down after the dubious Johnny Depp vs Amber Heard trial from 2020, it is now clear to see that Johnny Depp was the victim and big studios are reportedly interested in the actor once again. Disney might have just rehired Johnny Depp to return as Jack Sparrow in Pirates of the Caribbean 6 movie. It is alleged that Walt Disney is standing firmly behind Johnny Depp in his legal battle against his ex-wife Amber Heard despite the company distancing themselves from the actor last year and “blocking him” from returning as a cameo in The Pirates of The Caribbean reboot starring none other than Margot Robbie. But is Johnny actually going to be rehired, or is it all just speculation?

As the seas are starting to calm down after the dubious Johnny Depp vs Amber Heard trial from 2020, it is now clear to see that Johnny Depp was the victim and big studios are reportedly interested in the actor once again. Disney might have just rehired Johnny Depp to return as Jack Sparrow in Pirates of the Caribbean 6 movie. It is alleged that Walt Disney is standing firmly behind Johnny Depp in his legal battle against his ex-wife Amber Heard despite the company distancing themselves from the actor last year and “blocking him” from returning as a cameo in The Pirates of The Caribbean reboot starring none other than Margot Robbie. But is Johnny actually going to be rehired, or is it all just speculation? And will Johnny's life be back to normal once the whole Amber Heard lawsuit blows over or will this be stuck on him and affect his career until he retires?

Amber Heard remains at the frontline of celebrity news due to his ongoing legal battles with ex husband Johnny Depp. The Johnny Depp Amber Heard court case has gotten ugly for many reasons.

While some celebrities prefer living a quiet life away from the public, others just have so many scandals following them. In this video, we are going to talk about Johnny Depp and Amber Heard, who have been on each other’s throats ever since they split up and how Amber Heard might be facing jail time for one mistake she made in all this.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

Depp claimed The Sun's article in 2018 which claimed he was a wife-beater and had abused Amber Heard, was false. 

Many were confused when the High Court ruled against Johnny Depp, even though there was proof that Amber Heard had assaulted him. A voice recording surfaced of the pair talking and Heard admits to hitting Depp. Many called for Amber Heard to go to jail and the hashtag #justiceforjohnnydepp began trending.

However, a lot of people have misunderstood the case. Despite involving domestic abuse, this was not a criminal trial but a libel trial. This means neither Amber Heard or Johnny Depp were on trial. Johnny Depp was only suing The Sun and Amber Heard was simply a witness to help The Sun's case.

Unlike in a criminal trial where one must prove guilt 'beyond reasonable doubt', in this libel case The Sun only had to prove it was 'more likely than not' that what they had reported was true; that Depp had abused Amber Heard.

Amber Heard has been giving a sneak peek of her prep for Aquaman 2 for a while now. The actress has been intensively training for her revival as Mera.
She’s gotten back on sets today for the shoot but the news hasn’t gone down well with Johnny Depp and his fans. However, Twitter is witnessing #JusticeForJohnnyDepp trending with over 10K tweets in a few minutes after her revival was announced.

Johnny Depp's fans are trending #JusticeforJohnnyDepp as they are expressing anger over the same studio that fired the actor and is continuing to employ Amber Heard. Johnny, who was expected to return as Gellert Grindelwald in Fantastic Beasts 3, sadly came under scrutiny recently during his highly publicised divorce from Amber Heard. Johnny was accused of domestic abuse. Although he denied the allegation, he lost a high profile case against a newspaper who dubbed him as a wife beater. Due to allegations against him, Warner Bros asked him to step down from the role as Grindelwald in The Fantastic Beasts franchise. Johnny lost another most prominent role as Captain Jack Sparrow in Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean. On the other hand, Amber Heard began filming for Aquaman 2. Now Johnny's fans have expressed anger over the same and want justice to be served for the actor. The online hate for Amber Heard’s removal from Aquaman 2 is largely based on various unproven allegations that have been levelled against her over the years.

She’s gotten back on sets today for the shoot but the news hasn’t gone down well with Johnny Depp and his fans. However, Twitter is witnessing #JusticeForJohnnyDepp trending with over 10K tweets in a few minutes after her revival was announced.

Johnny Depp's fans are trending #JusticeforJohnnyDepp as they are expressing anger over the same studio that fired the actor and is continuing to employ Amber Heard. Johnny, who was expected to return as Gellert Grindelwald in Fantastic Beasts 3, sadly came under scrutiny recently during his highly publicised divorce from Amber Heard. Johnny was accused of domestic abuse. Although he denied the allegation, he lost a high profile case against a newspaper who dubbed him as a wife beater. Due to allegations against him, Warner Bros asked him to step down from the role as Grindelwald in The Fantastic Beasts franchise. Johnny lost another most prominent role as Captain Jack Sparrow in Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean. On the other hand, Amber Heard began filming for Aquaman 2. Now Johnny's fans have expressed anger over the same and want justice to be served for the actor. The online hate for Amber Heard’s removal from Aquaman 2 is largely based on various unproven allegations that have been levelled against her over the years. Johnny's lawyers had also accused the actress of a calculated and manipulative lie.",en-US,PT8M11S,2d,hd,false,True,rectangular,processed,public,youtube,True,True,False,14251,340,118,0,149,,,

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard.

Amber Heard’s Father’s HORRIFIC Threat to Johnny Depp!

https://youtu.be/r1vQod8BJk4

One of the biggest Hollywood debacles going on right now is the rather ugly
divorce proceedings between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard. Still, it is pretty
difficult to say who’s right and who’s wrong, but it seems like Amber Heard is
far from winning. There is so much evidence against her. The whole world
considers her as a liar and now her father has been accused of threatening to
shoot Johnny Depp. How far can Amber Heard go for the money? And is it true
that her father was ab*sive towards her when she was a kid?
Make sure you stay till the end to figure out the real reason for Amber Heard’s
father wanting to kill Johnny Depp.
But before we start with Amber Heard’s father threatens to kill Johnny Depp,
let’s got back to 2020 to see the whole picture which shows that being agressive
and violent towards people is not something which happens for the first time in
Amber Heard’s family. Back in 2020 the actress revealed to a UK court that she
previously witnessed violence at home growing up and said that Johnny Depp
“makes dad look like a saint when he falls off the wagon”.
Amber Heard told the court that her father, David, “struggled with alcohol and
drug abuse issues his whole life.” “He is an addict and an alcoholic and he was
very violent but I love him very much,” she said.
Amber Heard said she reached out to her mom after one of Johnny Depp’s
alleged benders in March 2015 because she wanted “someone to talk to who
might understand first hand how it was.”
“My father was violent to my mother growing up,” Amber Heard told the court.
“They loved each other but he was very violent to her until the end ... she
passed away.”
Amber Heard told her mom the “Pirates of the Caribbean” actor was a
“madman” - but insisted he was not physically abusive with her. “It’s ok mom.
He’s not being violent with me. He’s just even raging in general,” she wrote.
The actress, however, denied in court that she was being truthful with her
mother, saying she “just didn’t want her to tell my dad.”

“I felt safe to tell my mother, but I didn’t know how my dad would react,” she
said. “I had never been in this situation before and I didn’t know if he would
react violently ... to Johnny.” And now. Here we are. It seems like Amber
Heard was absolutely right about her father because recently he was being
agressive towards Johnny Depp and there’s a witness who revealed the entire
situation. But before we start, make sure you hit the subscribe button to knoow
the most interesting information about celebrities’ lives.
So, how it all started. When it seemed as though things couldn’t get any worse,
there were some official reports saying that Johnny Depp was apparently being
threatened by Amber’s father, David Heard. According to a legal document, the
threats were overheard by a witness via a phone conversation in which her dad
made accusations that Johnny Depp was ruining his daughter’s career. Amber’s
father said about Johnny: “That f**ing piece of s**t is f**ing me too because
I’m supposed to get 10% of the money and without it I can’t produce the movie
I was gunna make!...He is ruining my baby girl’s career and blackballing her in
Hollywood”. Seems like the money is the biggest reason for the Heards to
attack Johnny Depp back and forth. The threat only seemed to escalate further
when guns were brought into the conversation, with David saying: “And when I
get to him I’m going to beat the s**t out of him...I’m from Texas, and men
from Texas carry 45’s and Johnny is going to meet the f**ing end of mine!”
So, what was going on there and who was the witness? According to the report,
David Killackey, the owner of Performance Allison Transmissions who worked
on both Amber and Johnny‘s classic cars, claimed that Amber became abusive
towards him and that her father made “death threats” towards Johnny in a phone
call.
...
And now I want to know your opinion. What do you think about Amber and her
family being agressive towards Johnny? Do you think is it possible that any
word or action will be taken against Amber Heard’s father? Let me know your
opinion in the comments section down below.

APOLOGY VIDEO
When Amber Heard smuggled their two pet dogs to Australia, which goes against the country’s laws- the pair came out with an apology video to address the situation. But, to a lot of people the video seemed weird. Although it was Heard herself who did the activity, Depp appeared to be quite off in the video and some even remarked that it looked like he was being forced to show up in front of the camera. We will let you be the judge of it.

PREMIERE OF ALICE THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS
In 2016, when Johnny and Amber’s divorce were in the works, he attended a movie premiere at London. When asked if he had any message for his fans, Depp said some lines that sounded extremely weird and even funny to his fans and the audience. However, when we look back now- the message seems almost cryptic, as if he was trying to ask for help. Watch the interview for yourself.

Ever since the divorce of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp was filed, there has been a stream of new information leaked in regard to their strange situation. 

Amber Heard accused Johnny Depp of several horrifying things throughout the course of their marriage. However, more evidence has been discovered that proves a lot of what she has claimed has been false. 

After a recent victory in the United Kingdom, it is clear that Amber Heard will stop at nothing to get the case to go her way, while Depp is doing the same.

Johnny Depp and his ex-wife Amber Heard have been involved in different legal battles for years now, and it finally looks like this drama might soon come to an end.
Johnny’s fans are now saying they can’t wait for justice to be finally served and for the court to prove what the fans claim they knew all along–that Amber heard was lying.
And it’s not just Johnny’s fans who always believed the actor was telling the truth, but also his celebrity friends and colleagues.
So as we wait for this bitter legal drama to reach its conclusion, let’s take a look at all the times celebs have warned us about Amber Heard’s lies.

Johnny Depp WINS Against Amber Heard In Defamation Case...!!!?

https://youtu.be/vNCZ8Zy7J5U

Huge Win For Johnny Depp | Truth Always Wins

https://youtu.be/QSWHT8p62lQ

Amber Heard Friends Testify AGAINST Her & Side With Johnny Depp

https://youtu.be/IfZzdVZrPuI

Celebs divorces are box-office gold for the media, so the legal fight between
movie stars Johnny Depp and Amber Heard lasts for 5 years already. So far, the
trial has featured testimony about: violent, shrieking rows. Massive
consumption of drugs and drink. Wild punches and trashed rooms, lopped off
fingertip, and many other things. But is it true that Johnny Depp is so close to
defeating Amber Heard in a defamation case?
Make sure you stay till the end to know Johnny Depp's odds of winning the
case.
The fact that Johnny Depp recently failed to secure an appeal in the “wife
beater” verdict against him in Britain is causing consequences on his other legal
battles in the US. Amber Heard's lawyers state that Johnny Depp's Stateside $50
million defamation lawsuit against Amber Heard should be dismissed.
Amber Heard's legal team (Heard and Charlson Bredehoft Cohen & Brown, PC
and Woods Rogers PC attorneys) declares a supplemental plea in bar, stating:
“Giving full effect to the UK Judgments necessitates a finding that statements in
the op-ed published in the Washington Post are true – Mr. Depp committed
domestic violence against Ms. Heard on many occasions, causing her to fear for
her life.” “Therefore, as a matter of law, Depp cannot prevail on any of his
claims, and Depp’s Complaint against Ms. Heard should be dismissed in its
entirety,” adds the April 13 filing that recently appeared on the Fairfax County
docket.
As the more than two-year-old matter crawls toward its new-ish April 11, 2022,
trial start date, Amber Heard has requested a May 28 hearing on her plea filing
in front of Judge Penney Azcarate, who was assigned to the case last month by
Chief Judge Bruce White.
Amber Heard's failed plan to destroy Johnny Depp in the past probably made
her try some new ideas. Now she is looking far ahead with a new strategy,
probably will help her gain a sure-footed move in the US court. The actress
seems to be absolutely desperate as she’s got nothing to lose. She has already

made so many mistakes and lied several times (and almost every time she was
caught lying). But what if her plan can actually work?
Because for now, it seems like her legal team is a little bit pushing. According to
all the testimony and evidence presented at that trial and Justice Nicol’s decree,
Amber Heard’s team believes once again that the March 2019-filed Virginia suit
should be DOA. “Depp cannot relitigate these factual issues, and as a result of
their preclusion, he cannot claim that the statements are false and ‘actionable’
under Virginia defamation law, so his claims are barred as a matter of law,” the
plea filing states.
...
The court date for the main defamation date is in April 2022 and we will make
sure to be the first ones to deliver the latest news to you. Thanks for watching

Top 10 Celebrities Who Tried To Warn Us About Amber Heard

https://youtu.be/OFO6sMJGjHc

Few celebrity breakups are as controversial as the ever-unfolding drama between Johnny
Depp and Amber Heard. Most people I know are either “Team Johnny” or “Team Amber,”
and they’ve spent a lot of time discussing who the real abuser in the troubled relationship
must have been. However, Johnny Depp was trying to warn everyone about Amber Heard
and who she is for real.
Over the past several months, we’ve heard from Depp’s friends, fans, and exes who all claim
he could have never mistreated Amber because of his sweet and gentle nature. And there
have been many doubts cast upon Heard, leading people to think she’s the core abuser, a
narcissistic gold digger, and ultimately, a liar. Adding to this we have Johnny Depp’s hints
and attempts to tell the truth about his ex wife.
Amber Heard is not an obvious abuser
We like to imagine that the real abuser is always some sort of obvious monster, and that
we’re not going to be manipulated by any wolves in sheep’s clothing. Do you remember that
‘message’ to Johnny Depp’s fans when he was ‘jokingly’ saying: “I’m scared to death, I’m
frightened and I don’t know what to do, I am confused and I want to go home”. This phrase
made everyone laugh but what if it was Johnny’s cry for help? He couldn’t tell anyone what
was going on between him and Amber Heard (before the legal fight) as he is a good person
and he didn’t want to show people their dirty laundry.
Amber Heard pretended to be a victim
The myth of the obvious abuser was very convenient for Amber Heard and of course
eventually it did more harm than good, even for Amber. People easily wind up defending
their guilty friends and blaming the victims. We might mistake self-defense and coping
mechanisms by victims as ""proof"" of their crimes. Victims of domestic violence may even
use violence themselves against their abusers, and it can be very difficult for outsiders to
establish which person is the primary abuser and which person is the primary victim. Johnny
Depp was trying to warn everyone she was a liar but he couldn’t prove he wasn’t guilty.
Amber Heard had a strong tactic - to lie in a court. But eventually body language experts
analysed the video back in 2016 court deposition. First everyone thought Amber Heard
behaved really weird because she was stressed and scared. But according to body
language experts, she just behaved like a typical liar.
Severed Finger
Being a real man Johnny Depp didn’t tell anyone what happened with his finger for real and
was even trying to hide the facts and lied to his friends about the incident! Obviously, he
wanted to protect Amber Heard. During the Venice Film Festival 2015 conference Dakota
Johnson obviously asked Johnny Depp about his finger, Johnny answered vaguely, he
avoided the question with the joke but it seems Dakota didn’t believe him. She knew:
something was wrong. Just notice, Dakota gave him a look that says that she knows more
than he lets on.

Amber Heard made him lie for her
You may remember the story about Amber Heard’s dogs and that she had some problems
with them. In July 2015 Amber Heard brought Yorkshire terriers Pistol and Boo to the
country illegally. And to avoid problems Amber Heard asked her former employee Kevin
Murphy to lie under oath after she was charged with bringing her two dogs to Australia
illegally. Murphy claimed Heard pressured him to commit perjury about the travelling terriers
or risk losing his job. “She wanted me to say essentially that it was my fault in one way or
another that the paperwork wasn’t completed, so that I could take the blame for her,” Murphy
said. And of course, she asked Johnny Depp to help with this problem. Isn’t it a warning sign
of ab**se? But probably Johnny Depp had to go along with everything Amber wanted
because he truly loved her. But she literally forced Johnny to help her with the problem and
he got in trouble as a result.

was going on between him and Amber Heard (before the legal fight) as he is a good person
and he didn’t want to show people their dirty laundry.
Amber Heard pretended to be a victim
The myth of the obvious abuser was very convenient for Amber Heard and of course
eventually it did more harm than good, even for Amber. People easily wind up defending
their guilty friends and blaming the victims. We might mistake self-defense and coping
mechanisms by victims as ""proof"" of their crimes. Victims of domestic violence may even
use violence themselves against their abusers, and it can be very difficult for outsiders to
establish which person is the primary abuser and which person is the primary victim. Johnny
Depp was trying to warn everyone she was a liar but he couldn’t prove he wasn’t guilty.
Amber Heard had a strong tactic - to lie in a court. But eventually body language experts
analysed the video back in 2016 court deposition. First everyone thought Amber Heard
behaved really weird because she was stressed and scared. But according to body
language experts, she just behaved like a typical liar.
Severed Finger
Being a real man Johnny Depp didn’t tell anyone what happened with his finger for real and
was even trying to hide the facts and lied to his friends about the incident! Obviously, he
wanted to protect Amber Heard. During the Venice Film Festival 2015 conference Dakota
Johnson obviously asked Johnny Depp about his finger, Johnny answered vaguely, he
avoided the question with the joke but it seems Dakota didn’t believe him. She knew:
something was wrong. Just notice, Dakota gave him a look that says that she knows more
than he lets on.

Amber Heard made him lie for her
You may remember the story about Amber Heard’s dogs and that she had some problems
with them. In July 2015 Amber Heard brought Yorkshire terriers Pistol and Boo to the
country illegally. And to avoid problems Amber Heard asked her former employee Kevin
Murphy to lie under oath after she was charged with bringing her two dogs to Australia
illegally. Murphy claimed Heard pressured him to commit perjury about the travelling terriers
or risk losing his job. “She wanted me to say essentially that it was my fault in one way or
another that the paperwork wasn’t completed, so that I could take the blame for her,” Murphy
said. And of course, she asked Johnny Depp to help with this problem. Isn’t it a warning sign
of ab**se? But probably Johnny Depp had to go along with everything Amber wanted
because he truly loved her. But she literally forced Johnny to help her with the problem and
he got in trouble as a result.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

Now it turns out that Elon Musk might have helped Amber Heard pay her donation to the ACLU. That was supposed to be paid with money from the $7 million Amber Heard received from Johnny Depp in divorce settlement.. Let's break it down in today's video.

Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been involved in a handful of lawsuits dating back to their divorce in 2017. By that point, Heard had accused Depp of abuse, and that would lead to an April 2018 headline by The Sun, which referred to Depp as a Wife Beater. Recently, Judge Andrew Nicol determined that Amber’s claims were substantial, which also let The Sun off the hook. The 14 incidents that lead to the judge’s ultimate decision, which include the 12 leading to the court’s ultimate decision, as well as what he thought regarding each specific incident have now been released.

Has Amber Heard been finally exposed? Johnny Depp and Amber Heard’s highly-publicized legal battle has been going on for years, with no end in sight.
However, a lot of people have recently come out of the woodwork and offered evidence in support of Johnny’s version of events.
After nearly having his career ruined and being fired from several big-budget projects, Johnny is now being backed by Disney, who has reportedly rehired him for his role as Captain Jack Sparrow in the upcoming Pirates of the Caribbean movie.

Join us in today’s video as we share with you the full apology of Amber Heard. Until now, none of either johnny Depp's or Amber Heard's accusations has ever been put before a judge or jury in any court anywhere, or even confirmed by police reports. But with everything that is going on between the two former co-stars and couple, it’s hard to lose track of how it all started in the first place.

Johnny Depp and Amber Heard went their separate ways after the divorce was finalized and it seemed like everything was calming down when Heard became romantically attached to billionaire inventor Elon Musk in the spring of 2017. That relationship, however, was short-lived. Because of all these chaos, Amber Heard has shared her thoughts. Be sure to watch the whole video and in addition, do us a favor and like the video and subscribe and turn on the notification bell. We’ll see you in the next video!

As the case moves along further what many have noticed is that the finger is starting to solely point to Amber Heard as more and more evidence gets brought forward. People all over the world are starting to believe that Johnny Depp was wrongfully accused of several different acts, none of which he actually performed.

A New York judge has partially granted a petition from the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" star to determine if Heard donated the entirety of her $7 million divorce settlement to the American Civil Liberties Union and to Children's Hospital Los Angeles, as she pledged. As a result of the ruling, the ACLU must release documents that confirm whether or not Heard followed through on the donation promise, which has become a point of contention in the former couple's legal saga.“Mr. Depp is most gratified by the Court’s decision,"" Depp's attorney Benjamin Chew said in a statement to USA TODAY. USA TODAY has reached out to Heard's attorney and to the ACLU for comment. In November, Depp lost a libel lawsuit in London against the publisher of The Sun tabloid, which had labeled him a ""wife beater"" in a 2018 headline after Heard accused him of abuse in Los Angeles in 2016 as they were ending their short, volatile marriage. The case pitted Depp against a powerful tabloid and its editor, with Heard as their star witness. In March, Depp was refused an appeal after his lawyer Andrew Caldecott argued that Heard's donation pledge was a “calculated and manipulative lie"" that ""tipped the scales against Mr. Depp from the very beginning.""Caldecott also alleged one of Heard's intended charitable beneficiaries, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, wrote to Depp's business adviser in 2019 saying Heard had not made any payments. Lawyers for The Sun's publisher rejected the arguments in court in March, saying Heard did not lie about the donations because she was pledging to pay the sums over 10 years. She had made “a number of payments already in pursuance of these pledges,"" said Adam Wolanski, representing News Group Newspapers. Johnny Depp loses bid to appeal UK court ruling that he assaulted ex-wife Amber HeardThe High Court ruling came after a three-week circus-like trial in July, during which Depp and Heard both took the stand and both were damaged by lurid testimony about drinking, drug use, fighting and room-trashing. The judge ruled that ""the great majority"" of Heard's claims of abuse, as presented by the tabloid's publisher in its defense, were mostly true. Proceedings now move to Virginia, where a separate case arose after Heard published a column in the Washington Post in December 2018, proclaiming herself a victim of domestic abuse and suggesting, without actually using his name, that Depp was the alleged abuser. Three months later, Depp filed a lawsuit in Fairfax County (where the Post is printed) seeking $50 million and accusing his ex-wife of defaming him with ""hoax"" allegations of domestic abuse. Heard shot back by filing more than 300 pages of documents in Virginia, expanding on the abuse allegations she lodged against Depp during their divorce in 2016, claiming Depp regularly beat her up before she married him in 2015 and continued to do so during their 18-month marriage.

In November, Depp lost a libel lawsuit in London against the publisher of The Sun tabloid, which had labeled him a ""wife beater"" in a 2018 headline after Heard accused him of abuse in Los Angeles in 2016 as they were ending their short, volatile marriage. The case pitted Depp against a powerful tabloid and its editor, with Heard as their star witness. In March, Depp was refused an appeal after his lawyer Andrew Caldecott argued that Heard's donation pledge was a “calculated and manipulative lie"" that ""tipped the scales against Mr. Depp from the very beginning.""Caldecott also alleged one of Heard's intended charitable beneficiaries, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, wrote to Depp's business adviser in 2019 saying Heard had not made any payments. Lawyers for The Sun's publisher rejected the arguments in court in March, saying Heard did not lie about the donations because she was pledging to pay the sums over 10 years. She had made “a number of payments already in pursuance of these pledges,"" said Adam Wolanski, representing News Group Newspapers. Johnny Depp loses bid to appeal UK court ruling that he assaulted ex-wife Amber HeardThe High Court ruling came after a three-week circus-like trial in July, during which Depp and Heard both took the stand and both were damaged by lurid testimony about drinking, drug use, fighting and room-trashing. The judge ruled that ""the great majority"" of Heard's claims of abuse, as presented by the tabloid's publisher in its defense, were mostly true. Proceedings now move to Virginia, where a separate case arose after Heard published a column in the Washington Post in December 2018, proclaiming herself a victim of domestic abuse and suggesting, without actually using his name, that Depp was the alleged abuser. Three months later, Depp filed a lawsuit in Fairfax County (where the Post is printed) seeking $50 million and accusing his ex-wife of defaming him with ""hoax"" allegations of domestic abuse. Heard shot back by filing more than 300 pages of documents in Virginia, expanding on the abuse allegations she lodged against Depp during their divorce in 2016, claiming Depp regularly beat her up before she married him in 2015 and continued to do so during their 18-month marriage.

Did Amber Heard just get booted for Aquaman 2? This would be great news to Johnny Depp and Aquaman fans around the world. The #FireAmberHeard movement is going strong. It seems the Aquaman 2 director, James Wan, does not even want Amber Heard in the movie. 

It seems like everyone is turning against Amber Heard. Including the actors in the movie such as Jason Momoa, Nicole Kidman, William Dafoe, etc. The Johnny Depp Amber Heard legal battle is still at the forefront of celebrity news. 

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

The tale of Amber Heard continues to get more and more curious as time goes on. Because she is in a war in court with her ex-husband Johnny Depp and it doesn't look to be getting any simpler as time goes on. Not the least of which is new evidence and more proof of her being a bad person coming to light. But she's holding fast and trying to keep going in the roles that she does have. Which right now includes Mera in the DCEU, which will continue via Aquaman 2. But a very familiar ""call to arms"" is happening that might just shut that down. We'll break it down for you.

Amber Heard Johnny Depp Lawsuit UPDATE,"As Johnny Depp and Amber Heard get deeper into their $50 million dollar lawsuit, lots and lots of fans, people, and even previous Amber Heard supporters are strolling away from her side and are choosing to side with Johnny Depp instead. You may remember that after losing his libel case against the news publisher “The Sun”, who gave him a very bad lable following Amber’s claims that he had hurt her, Johnny lost his chance to reprise his major role as Grindelwald in the upcoming third installment of the trilogy “Fantastic Beasts”, a prequel series to Harry Potter. Because of this, a huge volume of Johnny Depp fans around the globe were upset and angered, which led them to sign a petition for Warner Bros. to fire Amber from her role in the upcoming Aquaman sequel as well. However, despite reaching and even going over 1.6 million votes, the production company chose to let Amber stay in the movie. So how does Amber lose such a tremendous amount of supporters during the time that she needed them the most? What could Amber possibly have done to make her supporters lose interest in her? Well, let’s find out in this video. But before anything else, make sure to hit that subscribe button first and smash that notification bell for more updates. Let’s dive in!

Johnny and Amber’s romance started well, if one may say, before it all went down into ashes. There are those kinds of divorces that are amicable splits, while there are also divorce cases that are messy. Johnny and Amber’s divorce may be one of the messiest and chaotic in history. But how did it all come down to this? Let’s go back to the beginning. Johnny and Amber first ignited a spark between them when they starred together in the 2011 comedy-drama film, The Rum Diary. Johnny played a journalist who was immediately smitten with Amber’s character. However, this love story between the two quickly travelled from the screen to real life. Amber Heard even told Vogue quickly after the release of the film that, “Working with Johnny was torture. It was better than I ever imagined, which is really saying something.” Technically, hearing these words from the actress already hinted that the two really hit it off easily during their film taping, and even though the two of them did not quickly jump into a relationship right after the film shooting, the same year that the film was released, the relationships they both were in at the time fell apart, and that suggested quite a rare coincidence. Just a year after the film’s release, the two officially started dating. Their relationship seemed quite beautiful, and as a proof of this, in 2014, just a couple of months into dating, Amber was spotted wearing an engagement ring, where Johnny also made an announcement about their upcoming wedding. Another year after, the couple held a private wedding ceremony at their home in LA. Fans were really happy about how things were going between the two.

In 2016, Amber Heard filed for divorce. It shocked many people, especially their fans who thought they were living the best days of their married life, but turned out it wasn’t the case at all. Along with filing for divorce, Amber also accused Johnny of physically hurting her, providing some photos as evidence of Johnny’s acts. However, these incidents were proven to be fabricated by the police. She also applied for a restraining order against Johnny, which made many people at that time believe that she was telling the truth. Many fans supported her, and it was then as well that she used her newfound acclaim and victimhood to front as one of the most public faces of the #MeToo movement, and subsequently, to serve as ambassador and speaker for various entities, organizations, and companies, many of whom rewarded Amber financially for her time, image, and story. BUT, Johnny Depp’s team and a lot of fans as well, saw this as Amber’s way to manipulate people into thinking she is a victim rather than a perpetrator. In line with this, Amber also penned an article in the Washington Post.

Apart from this, fans and supporters of Amber also started to lose the courage to defend and support her as evidence of her extra marital affairs surfaced, showing her with actor James Franco and multi-billionaire Elon Musk. Elon had been issued a subpoena by Johnny Depp’s team.

As of now, despite all the chaos swirling around the their case, Amber’s team has tried to dismiss it twice already.

In line with this, Amber also penned an article in the Washington Post.

Apart from this, fans and supporters of Amber also started to lose the courage to defend and support her as evidence of her extra marital affairs surfaced, showing her with actor James Franco and multi-billionaire Elon Musk. Elon had been issued a subpoena by Johnny Depp’s team.

As of now, despite all the chaos swirling around the their case, Amber’s team has tried to dismiss it twice already.

Body Language Analyst REACTS to Amber Heard's CRINGE Deposition | Faces Episode 15

https://youtu.be/hQFFm_X2lps

That’s crazy, as the tables have turned and now Amber Heard is the one who’s criticized by
so many people. But why is she the subject of such a toxic response? Johnny and Amber
have both accused each other of abuse. First, people thought that Johnny was the ‘bad guy’
but now, fans think that Amber is the one who is doing it for attention, enjoying the drama,
manipulating the truth, exaggerating reality.
Moreover, people were absolutely furious after Amber Heard’s former assistant Kate James
exposed Amber Heard for stealing her sexual assault story.
For so many women struggling from abuse, it was difficult to hear but, that's true that Amber
really lied about the fact that Johnny abused her. And the whole world was shocked after
Kate James, Amber Heard’s former personal assistant, alleged that Heard had appropriated
her story of being a “sexual violence survivor,” giving evidence at London’s Royal Courts of
Justice on the seventh day of Johnny Depp’s libel trial against the publisher of The Sun
newspaper.
However, the fact that Kate exposed Amber is really good for Johnny, as now he is suing
News Group Newspapers and journalist Dan Wootton for an article on The Sun website that
described him as a “wife beater.” Depp denies that he was violent toward Heard, to whom he
was married from 2015 to 2017.
Kate gave evidence in support of Depp, and said she had told Heard that she was raped at
machete-point in Brazil about 25 years ago. She said she was shocked to learn that in a
witness statement, Heard misrepresented and exploited the incident.
“She referred directly to a violent rape that occurred to me 26 years ago and she twisted it
into her own story and she used it for her own use,"" Kate James said by video link from Los
Angeles. “I am a sexual violence survivor and that’s very, very serious to take that stance if
you are not one,"" she added.
When Kate she read Amber Heard’s submissions, she said, “to my utter shock and dismay, I
discovered that Ms Heard had in fact stolen my sexual violence conversation with her and
twisted it into her own story to benefit herself. This of course caused me extreme distress
and outrage that she would dare to attempt to use the most harrowing experience of my life
as her own narrative.”
Referring to Amber Heard’s drinking habits, James said in a witness statement: “Amber
would drink vast quantities of red wine each night.” Plus, in evidence given remotely from
Los Angeles, Kate James also said she had regularly received a barrage of drunken,
abusive and incoherent text messages from Heard between 2am and 4am.
In her declaration, James outlines how she spent large amounts of time with Heard during
her employment - sometimes up to seven days a week, often in intimate settings. That is
significant, she says, because many of Heard's allegations of physical abuse date to that
time period - and she never saw any evidence of it. Instead, she claims to have seen ample
evidence of Heard's own abusive behavior, which was often directed at her.

“Amber was regularly verbally and mentally abusive and would often scream at me... over
the smallest things,” she wrote. “She would fly into blind rages where no-one could reason
with her, and even if I was trying to offer an explanation, I didn’t think that she could hear me
as she was so angry.”
Kate James claims the actress would often binge on wine and drugs - specifically magic
mushrooms and MDMA - and text her abuse throughout the night.
“When I woke up in the morning, there would almost always be a barrage of incoherent
abuse sent to me from Amber by text between around 2am and 4am. I discovered later that
she had gone ahead and deleted all evidence of abusive texts from that ICloud account,”
she claimed. The abuse was so severe, that James said it left her emaciated from stress and
caused concern among her friends and family.
...

And now I want to know what you think about Amber Heard. Do you think she really enjoys
the drama and does it for clout? Let me know your opinion in the comments section down

A batalha legal entre Johnny Depp e Amber Heard tá durando mais do que o casamento em si. Posso dizer, seguramente, que esse é o caso com mais reviravoltas de todos que eu já vi na minha história aqui no canal, te juro. Exatamente 5 anos após o casamento, novas evidências vieram à tona.

As acusações de agressão surgiram pela primeira vez em 2016 e, de vez em sempre, Amber Heard ou Johnny Depp lançam outra bomba com mais revelações...Depois de tantas notícias, acho que dá pra dizer que estamos mais próximos da verdade do que jamais estivemos! O mais novo é que um áudio de duas horas de conversa entre Johnny e Amber pode ser uma das evidências mais polêmicas de todos os tempos! Mas como será que essa novela da vida real, ou filme de terror, chame o que quiser, começou? Ah meu amor, clicastes no vídeo certo, ó ternura.

Como esse caso já tá rolando há muito tempo na justiça, comecemos do início. Amber Heard e Johnny Depp se casaram em 3 de fevereiro de 2015 em uma cerimônia muito reservada que aconteceu justamente na casa deles em Los Angeles, depois de 4 anos em que já haviam se conhecido no set do filme “Diário de um Jornalista Bêbado”. Depois de 15 meses de casamento, Amber pediu o divórcio sob a justificativa de diferenças irreconciliáveis. Quatro dias depois, ela entrou com uma ordem de restrição contra o ator por violência doméstica, que ia de puxada de cabelo até o infame incidente em que Johnny Depp supostamente teria jogado um telefone celular contra ela! Além dessa ordem ela também queria que ele tomasse distância do “catioro” do ex-casal. Mais que isso, surgiram fotos de Amber com hematomas no rosto e ela alegou que Johnny a havia abusado verbal e fisicamente.

As acusações de agressão surgiram pela primeira vez em 2016 e, de vez em sempre, Amber Heard ou Johnny Depp lançam outra bomba com mais revelações...Depois de tantas notícias, acho que dá pra dizer que estamos mais próximos da verdade do que jamais estivemos! O mais novo é que um áudio de duas horas de conversa entre Johnny e Amber pode ser uma das evidências mais polêmicas de todos os tempos! Mas como será que essa novela da vida real, ou filme de terror, chame o que quiser, começou? Ah meu amor, clicastes no vídeo certo, ó ternura.

Como esse caso já tá rolando há muito tempo na justiça, comecemos do início. Amber Heard e Johnny Depp se casaram em 3 de fevereiro de 2015 em uma cerimônia muito reservada que aconteceu justamente na casa deles em Los Angeles, depois de 4 anos em que já haviam se conhecido no set do filme “Diário de um Jornalista Bêbado”. Depois de 15 meses de casamento, Amber pediu o divórcio sob a justificativa de diferenças irreconciliáveis. Quatro dias depois, ela entrou com uma ordem de restrição contra o ator por violência doméstica, que ia de puxada de cabelo até o infame incidente em que Johnny Depp supostamente teria jogado um telefone celular contra ela! Além dessa ordem ela também queria que ele tomasse distância do “catioro” do ex-casal. Mais que isso, surgiram fotos de Amber com hematomas no rosto e ela alegou que Johnny a havia abusado verbal e fisicamente.

Amber Heard Faces 10 Years In Prison For Accusations Against Johnny Depp!!!

https://youtu.be/UvsHWTGHmts

Amber Heard and Johnny Depp have been involved in major legal battles for years now and
it seems that this drama is coming to an end now with new revelations and plot twists. It is
not easy to keep up with Johnny and Amber's case but what is most important here is that
Amber Heard is potentially facing jail time.
The court drama made a major plot twist when Johnny Depp filed a defamation lawsuit
against his ex-wife. He not only claimed that she lied in court, but also that she was abusive
toward him. However, the actors will need to wait even longer to get an official court ruling. If
the court rules in Johnny Depp’s favor, Amber Heard could be facing up to three years of jail
time.
Basically, Amber Heard claimed that Johnny Depp had physically and emotionally abused
her. Their original court drama in 2015 resulted in a restraining order against Johnny Depp,
but that’s also where the blurry lines began. Johnny claims that Amber had faked her black
eye seen at the court, and Amber Heard’s stylist corroborated this.
She stated, “Throughout the day of December 16, 2015, I could see clearly that Amber
Heard did not have any visible marks, bruises, cuts, or injuries to her face or any other part
of her body.”
But this was not the only time Amber Heard lied and was caught lying. Why would she do
that all the time? It was her strategy. She wanted to play a victim and she was good at it until
the truth came out. Even in 2017 she still managed to convince everyone that in this
situation she suffered from Johnny Depp's actions against her. Amber Heard made people
trust her and, moreover, she almost ruined Johnny Depp’s career, as the publicity called him
a ‘wife beater’ and supported Amber and sympathized with her.
While nothing could be proven, Amber Heard’s accusations against Johnny Depp were
enough to significantly damage Johnny’s reputation and acting career. The story also almost
derailed the latest Pirates of the Caribbean movie, Dead Men Tell No Tales, Johnny Depp
has faced significant levels of hate and ostracizing over the past five years. But then things
have changed.
The first thing which ruined Amber Heard's vicious plan was the leaked audio. And since the
audio leak, the internet has already returned to Johnny Depp's side of the issue. Johnny
Depp filed a defamation lawsuit against his ex-wife just over a year ago, and Amber Heard
attempted to get the case dismissed but her request was denied.
Johnny Depp initially filed the suit to sue Amber Heard for $50 million. But now it appears
that she could not only be forced to pay the sum, but she could also be facing jail time.
According to the International Business Times:
“If Heard will be proven guilty of faking her bruises, she could face three years of
imprisonment. According to the Wallin & Klarich Law Firm, the California Penal Code Section
141 PC stated that it is illegal to alter, modify, plant, place, conceal, manufacture or move
any physical matter with the intention of causing someone to be charged with a crime. Some
would face felony charges for this”.
But it doesn’t stop there. Amber Heard could also be charged with offering false evidence.
These are also considered felony crimes and each carry a maximum sentence of up to three
years.
And again, it doesn’t stop here. More and more evidence has come forward to showcase
that Amber Heard was the one who abused Johnny Depp and that she had a strategy of
making people think she was innocent. The number of times Amber lied is impressive: she
was caught lying in court (the audio recording situation), she asked or even forced people to
lie for her in court and she stole her assistant’s s*xual assault story and used it as her own.
Later it turned out that Amber Heard has a history of violence.
...
And now I want to know your opinion about this situation. Do you think Amber Heard is
facing jail time? And what’s gonna happen with Johnny Depp’s career? Let me know your
opinion in the comments section down below.

Amber Heard Faces 10 Years In Prison For Accusations Against Johnny Depp!!!

https://youtu.be/UvsHWTGHmts

Amber Heard and Johnny Depp have been involved in major legal battles for years now and
it seems that this drama is coming to an end now with new revelations and plot twists. It is
not easy to keep up with Johnny and Amber's case but what is most important here is that
Amber Heard is potentially facing jail time.
The court drama made a major plot twist when Johnny Depp filed a defamation lawsuit
against his ex-wife. He not only claimed that she lied in court, but also that she was abusive
toward him. However, the actors will need to wait even longer to get an official court ruling. If
the court rules in Johnny Depp’s favor, Amber Heard could be facing up to three years of jail
time.
Basically, Amber Heard claimed that Johnny Depp had physically and emotionally abused
her. Their original court drama in 2015 resulted in a restraining order against Johnny Depp,
but that’s also where the blurry lines began. Johnny claims that Amber had faked her black
eye seen at the court, and Amber Heard’s stylist corroborated this.
She stated, “Throughout the day of December 16, 2015, I could see clearly that Amber
Heard did not have any visible marks, bruises, cuts, or injuries to her face or any other part
of her body.”
But this was not the only time Amber Heard lied and was caught lying. Why would she do
that all the time? It was her strategy. She wanted to play a victim and she was good at it until
the truth came out. Even in 2017 she still managed to convince everyone that in this
situation she suffered from Johnny Depp's actions against her. Amber Heard made people
trust her and, moreover, she almost ruined Johnny Depp’s career, as the publicity called him
a ‘wife beater’ and supported Amber and sympathized with her.
While nothing could be proven, Amber Heard’s accusations against Johnny Depp were
enough to significantly damage Johnny’s reputation and acting career. The story also almost
derailed the latest Pirates of the Caribbean movie, Dead Men Tell No Tales, Johnny Depp
has faced significant levels of hate and ostracizing over the past five years. But then things
have changed.
The first thing which ruined Amber Heard's vicious plan was the leaked audio. And since the

Elon Musk just keeps getting dragged back into the Johnny Depp Amber Heard celeb drama. Elon Musk, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard are back on the frontlines of celebrity news. Amber Heard just had a baby girl and rumors are swirling on who the baby's father is. 

Many are saying it is Johnny Depp. Some are saying is Elon Musk himself. Elon Musk and Amber Heard are past lovers and rumors are swirling that Elon Musk paid Amber Heard's 7 million donation to the ACLU back in 2016. So these two have a history together.

But no public statements have been made in this regard by either Elon Musk, Johnny Depp or Amber Heard. So no one knows for sure yet. In this video, we breakdown the story in detail. This celebrity drama goes down while the Johnny Depp Amber Heard civil court case rages on.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

But how did all of this frenzy start? How did the romantic private wedding go down this badly? And what were the actions taken by Amber Heard that were angering the judges so much? Let’s all find out in this video. But before we go any further, make sure to hit that subscribe button and notification bell first for more updates. So, let’s begin!

If you remember, Johnny Depp has been at the height of his career in the industry for many, many years now. He started acting as early as the 1980’s, when he first appeared in the horror-slash-thriller film “A Nightmare on Elm Street '', and played a minor role as the boyfriend of the main character. This helped Johnny begin his acting career, landing more minor roles and then major ones. Later on, he became a popular star of the classic, eccentric director Tim Burton’s films, where he portrayed various roles that all have these similarities: unique, bizarre, and kinda creepy in their own ways. In the romantic fantasy film “Edward Scissorhands”, he met his ex-partner Winona Ryder, whom we all see now in the sci-fi series Stranger Things. The two of them dated for four years, and even though the couple ended things between them in the 90’s, Winona still defended Johnny against Amber Heard on her recent allegations of abuse. He also played a few roles with Helena Bonham Carter in many Tim Burton films such as Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Alice in Wonderland and Alice Through the Looking Glass, Corpse Bride, Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, and Dark Shadows. One of the most widely-known appearances of Johnny Depp that perhaps brought him the largest commercial and critical success was the Disney media franchise “Pirates of the Carribean” series, where he landed and reprised his lead role for all five movies that ran from 2003 to 2017. 

Amber Heard, on the other hand, started her acting career in 2003, first by appearing in two music videos, and then later on landing small supporting roles in three various television series. This then later on elevated her to more film and television roles, both in the supporting and lead actress roles. Her latest film that hit commercial success was the 2018 DC movie “Aquaman”, where she co-starred alongside Jason Momoa as Mera, the Atlantean Queen. However, even amidst the controversies circling her divorce with Johnny Depp, she managed to keep and reprise her role in the 2021 superhero film “Zack Snyder’s Justice League'', a director’s cut of the 2017 film. Not only that, but she also starred in the post-apocalyptic miniseries “The Stand”, which was based on Stephen King’s novel of the same name. Here, she co-starred alongside Alexander Skarsgård, James Marden, and Odessa Young, and it premiered in December 2020. This upset fans because as Johnny was being banned from reprising his role as Grindelwald, Amber got to star in more films and series, and not only that, she was also reported to reappear as Mera in the sequel of the DC movie Aquaman which is set to start filming in July of 2021. Many fans saw this as an unfair treatment, given that both actors slash ex-lovers are facing the ongoing lawsuits between them.

And just recently, there has been a new occurrence in the ongoing defamation case against Amber’s article on The Washington Post, and it seems like Johnny’s side is stepping a little ahead of the game.

Amber Heard has been looking into Disney and what the company knew about Johnny’s actions and behavior during his time on the Pirates of the Caribbean films. For his part, Johnny has asserted Amber has lied on several occasions, including saying she would give their divorce settlement to charity but didn’t, and also said she had asserted he was violent once, when police body cam footage allegedly showed otherwise. Not so cool, Amber. Her lawyer has also said that the Aquaman 2 actress has not been able to pay out the full divorce settlement to charity.

Amber Heard is earning praise from progressive and feminist activists for deciding to get pregnant, have a baby, and embark upon motherhood alone. So is single motherhood stunning and brave? Or is promoting it another attack on the nuclear family?

Amber Heard first accused Johnny Depp of being violent towards her back in 2016 when she filed a court petition claiming. 
Amber’s accusations came at the height of the #MeToo movement, and the actress was hailed as a “hero” for speaking up about the alleged violence she endured during her relationship with Johnny.
But it’s 2021, and the narrative has completely changed. The fans are now convinced Amber was the violent one in the relationships and that she tried to frame Johnny by co-opting the #MeToo movement.
So why do fans think Johnny is the real #MeToo victim?

However, their feud that rooted from their messy marriage did not end there, and now, the case is swirling once again as their latest court trial is about to come in July this year. As the trials are coming near, the issue that has somehow been buried deep in the internet has recently surfaced once again, and guess who’s been the subject of ridicule these past few weeks? You guessed that right, Amber Heard. Amber seemed to have been losing more and more of her supporters due to more and more evidence surfacing in the media, including the fact that she couldn’t provide proof that she donated the money she got from her divorce settlement, which she promised to donate to charity. But where is it now?  Then there was evidence of her having affairs with actor, James Franco and multi-billionaire, Elon Musk. But what angered most people was the fact that Johnny Depp was forced to step down from his role as Grindelwald in the upcoming third franchise of the film trilogy “Fantastic Beasts”. Now, the trilogy is quite a big deal in the entertainment industry, considering that it is the prequel series to one of the most prominent film series of all time, “Harry Potter”. And aside from this, Johnny is actually an incredibly big name in the industry as well, and not just because of his very famous role as Jack Sparrow, but also because he has starred in countless movies too. But now that Johnny had been removed from his role, people’s fury shot directly at Amber Heard, as she was going back to reprise her role in the second installment of the DC Extended Universe film Aquaman, despite the lawsuits she is currently facing. Many, many fans were enraged by this, and some even started a petition to request Warner Bros. to fire Amber Heard, the same way they did to Johnny. But after a very long deliberation, did these people who fought for Johnny Depp’s equal treatment in the industry actually succeed? Had Warner Bros. finally come to their senses and fired Amber Heard from their newest DC film? Well, let’s find out in this video. But before everything else, make sure to hit that subscribe button first and smash that notification bell for more updates. So, let’s begin!

Let’s backtrack a little bit into Johnny and Amber’s career. Johnny Depp has been at the height of his career in the industry for many, many years now, and despite everything he is going through, he is nowhere close to a stop. He started acting as early as the 1980’s, when he first appeared in the horror-slash-thriller film “A Nightmare on Elm Street '', and played a minor role as the boyfriend of the main character. This helped Johnny begin his acting career, landing more minor roles and then major ones, including in the 2010 romantic thriller film “The Tourist” in which he co-starred with respected actress Angelina Jolie.

After many more roles, Johnny landed one of his biggest commercial films, the critically acclaimed Disney media franchise, the “Pirates of the Carribean” series, which is one of the major projects that really skyrocketed Johnny’s career into its highest point. In this series, he worked with numerous legendary actors and actresses, and worked on the lead role of Jack Sparrow, which earned him a remarkably huge fan following, as he reprised his role in all five movies that ran from 2003 to 2017. Some people even call him Jack Sparrow more often than his real name. Needless to say, he was and still is, a legend in the film industry. But we can’t say that now in his 2011 comedy drama film “The Rum Diary” which we can now safely say was not the brightest decision he made, as this was the film where he met his ex-wife, Amber Heard.

On the other hand, Amber Heard started her acting career in 2003, first by appearing in two music videos, and then later in landing small supporting roles in three various television series. This then later on elevated her to more film and television roles as both a supporting and lead actress. Her latest film that hit commercial success was the 2018 DCEU movie “Aquaman”, where she co-starred alongside Jason Momoa as Mera, the Atlantean Queen. 

Above all these, Amber Heard manages to keep her name in the headlines as many more issues come up. She even angered a judge in Virginia once, warning her not to waste the court’s time. 

That’s all for today, we hope you enjoyed that video and if you did, don’t forget to subscribe and hit that notification bell for more videos like this. Stay tuned!

Johnny Depp vs. Amber Heard is a case many lawyers are running away from. Why? It's one of the greatest controversial cases in the history of Hollywood.

Johnny Depp sued Heard and News Group Newspapers (NGN) based on the accusations leveled against him and he still lost the case. This has led to lots of tragedy for Johnny Depp as he has lost money and respect in society. With all these going on, is there still a chance for Johnny Depp to regain everything?

One would think that following the release of the Aquaman 2 movie title, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, that fans would get excited about it all, however that isn't exactly the case here. Ever since the absolute war that started between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard, it seems that there is constantly one thing after another that is taking place. When Johnny Depp was originally fired from the Pirates of the Caribbean series and lost his role as Captain Jack Sparrow along with his role with Warner bros, individuals following the case were hoping that the same thing would happen to Amber Heard, but that doesn’t seem to be true. Although fans strived to get Amber Heard cut from the beginning of this case, it was a bit tough however with the release of the new Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom title, the #FireAmberHeard movement seems to have made its return.

The FBI Is Coming For Amber Heard - BREAKING! - Justice (Finally?!) For Johnny Depp

https://youtu.be/QR9_W4jVEcQ

The various court cases involving Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been all
over the news over the last several months and still it is unclear who's right and
who's wrong. But this time there's never-seen-before evidence: body cam
footage from the Los Angeles police department (LAPD) officers who
responded to the 911 call and this evidence seems to change the compilation of
the case.
Make sure you stay till the end to see the final downfall of Amber Heard. This
time she is exposed for real. So, what was on the bodycam footage and why it
could change the whole case.
Nobody expected this was coming but Johnny Depp's attorneys claim that
never-before-seen body cam footage from the Los Angeles police department
(LAPD) officers who responded to the second of two 911 calls proves that
Johnny Depp did not have the violent altercation with his ex-wife! Moreover, it
proves that Amber Heard lied about the alleged brawl that took place in May
2016.
However, it's not the first time that Amber Heard lied. Let’s look back at the
following things: donating the entirety of the divorce settlement money to a
children’s charity, an abuse story that she stole from her former colleague, the
‘dogs story’, never hitting Johnny Depp, and many other things. Amber Heard
lied about all of these things while under oath in the UK high courts. Now
there’s even more evidence that she lied.
And now, ahead of Johnny Depp's upcoming $50 million defamation lawsuit
against his ex-wife, which will take place in Virginia in April 2022, the actor's
lawyers are revealing depositions from the officers and body camera footage
from them and the attorneys are claiming that cops do not support Amber
Heard's allegations.
Giving testimony, Amber Heard claimed that Johnny Depp hit her in the face
with a phone and tore out clumps of her hair in an extended altercation that took
place throughout their shared home at the time. Amber Heard and her friend,
Rocky Pennington, both gave depositions about the incident and each of them

described the scene as a violent mess. Rocky Pennington described it as, ""They
have a big kitchen island in the middle of the kitchen and on there, there's
candles and like fruit and, you know, glass, like jars and vases and things like
that. And he just was hitting everything with the wine bottle, just smashing it all
off. So there was fruit on the floor and baskets and, you know, glass bottles and
flowers.""
Amber Heard's description was, ""We have huge heavy silver candlesticks,
candelabra sticks. Those were on the floor broken. Baskets of fruit that we had
on the kitchen island. There ... fruit everywhere. Baskets on the ground. The
containers holding the spoons and forks, kitchen utensils, those were spilled. He
broke a lot of glass things that left glass on the floor ... when he walked out into
the hallway, you could see wine spilled all over the ground and wine on the
walls and ... and so I knew that at least he had gone through there and was like
sloshing wine anywhere.""
Right now we have a chance to take a look at what really happened that night!
...
And now I want to know your opinion of the matter. Do you think this evidence
will help Johnny Depp to prove that he is not the ab*ser? And do you think
Amber Heard will continue to put up the fight? Let me know your opinion in the

Amber Heard Faces 10 Years In Prison For Accusations Against Johnny Depp!!!

https://youtu.be/UvsHWTGHmts

The saga of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp’s messy divorce continues. But this
time things went really harsh for Amber Heard. According to the latest reports,
Amber Heard is at risk of facing jail time because now she is under
investigation by the LAPD for perjury concerning the 2016 incident in which
Depp allegedly hit his then-wife in the face. For now, Amber Heard is trying to
get the case dismissed officially.
I’m going to break it down for you, but before we start, hit that subscribe button
and make sure you stay till the end to know if the game is over for Amber
Heard.
After Johnny Deepp's defeat in the British High Court last year, his legal team
has plans to appeal. But this is more difficult than it seems because Amber
Heard’s legal team has tried to get the U.S.-based lawsuit dismissed, arguing
that the findings in the U.K. libel suit should be adopted. As for Johnny Depp’s
lawyer? He’s calling it a “hail Mary.”
Apparently, Amber Heard's legal team doesn't want to give up without a fight
and they've filed a motion to stay discovery on the defamation claims and also a
memorandum in support of her motion for leave. Her team believes that due to
the libel case results, which found in favor of The Sun after that outlet called
Johnny Depp a “wife beater,” that the judgment rendered should be applicable
in the US as well. The motion reads:
With the finality of the Judgment, rendered after Mr. Depp presented his best
evidence and arguments on the exact same factual issues assessed here, Mr.
Depp should be precluded from seeking yet another bite of the apple, where he
has fully adjudicated his dispute and lost. Because of the UK Judgment, the
entire world may now say, forever, that Mr. Depp is a ‘wife beater’ and has
committed at least 12 acts of domestic violence against Amber Heard, causing
her to be in fear for her life. In short, the UK Judgement, now final, permits this
court to end the litigation.
According to Johnny Depp’s lawyer, Benjamin Chew, however, this is not the
first time Amber Heard’s legal team has tried to get the $50 million defamation

lawsuit dismissed. He noted (via Courthouse News) that this is just “the latest
Hail Mary” from Amber Heard’s legal team and that her team has tried to get
the defamation lawsuit thrown out three times over the past two years. Johnny
Depp's team believes Amber Heard's Op Ed in the Washington Post was
defamatory and cost the actor work.
But what about the US? We will talk about that in a second, but now, make sure
you hit the like button if you enjoy this video. It seems like the cases are moving
forward in Virginia. However, they have been expensive, with deposition
requests and more coming from both sides. Both Amber Heard and Johnny
Johnny are digging for additional information that can be used against each
other. Amber Heard, for example, has been looking into Disney and what the
company knew about Johnny Depp’s actions and behavior during his time on
the Pirates of the Caribbean films. Speaking of Johnny Depp, he has asserted
Amber Heard has lied on several occasions, including stealing her ex assistant's
s*xual as*ult story, and saying she would give their divorce settlement to
charity but didn’t. In addition, Amber Heard had asserted Johnny Depp was
violent against her but police body cam footage allegedly showed otherwise.
But here is a very interesting moment. According to the police officers who
arrived on the scene (when Amber Heard’s friends accidentally called 911
twice), there was no visual evidence that a crime had taken place at all. 
...
The court date for the main defamation date is in April 2022 and we will make
sure to be the first ones to deliver the latest news to you. So stay tuned and don’t
forget to hit the subscribe button not to miss all the details about Amber Heard
and Johnny Depp’s case. Thanks for watching this video, see you in the next

While some celebrities prefer living a quiet life away from the public, others just have so many scandals following them. In this video, we are going to talk about Johnny Depp and Amber Heard, who have been on each other’s throats ever since they split up and how Amber Heard might be facing jail time for one mistake she made in all this.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

While some celebrities prefer living a quiet life away from the public, others just have so many scandals following them. In this video, we are going to talk about Johnny Depp and Amber Heard, who have been on each other’s throats ever since they split up and how Amber Heard might be facing jail time for one mistake she made in all this.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

Amber Heard opens up about losing parts in films in the wake of making claims of maltreatment against Johnny Depp, Amber Heard in an article shared what opening up about the maltreatment she had encountered meant for her profession.

 Amber Heard, who was most as of late seen in Aquaman, has composed a paper for The Washington Post, distributed on 18 December, about the result of blaming Johnny Depp for abusive behavior at home. Heard in the article, composed that she ""felt the full power of our way of life's anger for ladies who stand up"".

Aquaman 2 is correct now expected to hit theaters in 2022, so creation may be starting soon. There has been a lot of speculation about Amber Heard's part in Aquaman 2 lately. Unsubstantiated reports keep on appearing to be on the web and across online media requesting the performer isn't most likely going to return as the hero Mera in Warner Bros.' spin-off of James Wan's 2018 superhuman hit, and some have suggested that she had been superseded. Regardless, Heard says such cases are all in all wet.

""I'm truly amped up for the proportion of fan love and the proportion of fan appreciation that Aquaman has gotten and that it has procured such a ton of energy for Aquaman and Mera that it suggests we'll be returning,"" Heard tells EW. ""I'm so anxious to film that."" Heard added that the creation wants to get in progress eventually in 2021. In light of everything, Aquaman 2 isn't yet legitimately greenlit by the studio, its cast isn't asserted and it's anything but a revealed starting date.

Hannibal performer Mads Mikkelsen is by and by in converses with accept power over the piece of dull wizard Gellert Grindelwald. Depp will evidently still get paid for the looming Fantastic Beasts 3 despite having quite recently recorded one scene. She shared that she needed to frequently change her telephone number since she used to get passing dangers. Heard likewise composed that she seldom got out of her loft yet when she did, she was followed by paparazzi just as camera drones.

On May 23, 2016, Heard petitioned for legal separation from Depp and furthermore got a brief controlling request against the Oscar-designated entertainer. She claimed that Depp had genuinely manhandled her during their relationship, and said it had been generally while affected by medicine or liquor. She asserted that at the hour of seeking legal separation, an event had as of late occurred during which Depp tossed his telephone at her, leaving her with a wounded face.

In December 2018, Heard wrote an op-ed for The Washington Post saying she was mishandled, during which she talked about the treatment of women in homegrown maltreatment cases. Inside the opinion piece, Heard expressed: ""I turned into a name addressing homegrown maltreatment, and that I felt the total power of our way of life's fierceness for women who stand up."" Depp himself was never referenced by name.
Depp's lawyers say that Killackey's account proves that Heard was motivated by money to talk out against her ex-husband. In legal documents obtained by The Blast, Killackey portrayed a few 'very threatening' discussions with both Heard and her dad after he moved toward them about paying for the fixes to their vehicles.

Heard cravings to smash Depp's defamation guarantee by showing her charges that her ex is a boozer with addictions to drugs who consistently kicked her, beat her and, once in a while, was furious to the point that she passed out. Depp denied those allegations and insisted that Heard was the violent one in their relationship, claiming that he needed to possess his finger surgically reattached after she hurled a vodka bottle at him. 

About Amber Heard's separation, Amber Heard and Johnny Depp's case has been all the rage for a long time now. The couple is taking on a legitimate conflict to separate and has asserted actual maltreatment charges against each other. Following the genuine abuse case, Johnny Depp has been killed from his part as Grindelwald in the looming Fantastic Beasts 3 film. Devotees of Johnny Depp have made a couple of petitions online for the ejection of Amber Heard from the Aquaman foundation.

For years now, Johnny Depp and his ex-wife Amber Heard have been clawing back and forth to go and get an advantage over the other in the numerous cases that have been filed by them at each other. Johnny Depp for example filed a Defamation Suit against Heard for $50 million and she filed a countersuit worth $100 million. That case is still going on and has been delayed until 2022 due to the pandemic pushing back scheduling. But even though that’s going on, there are some things that aren’t adding up in Heard’s defense. We’ll break it down for you. Be sure to like the video and subscribe to the channel!

Johnny Depp finally speaks on how these court cases have affected Amber Heard's career. Let's just say he does not feel too bad for here. 

Here is a look at Amber Heard and all the things that she’s done to Johnny Depp, to fans, and more that have painted her in a more monstrous light that’ll no doubt end her career. How much longer do you think it’ll take for Hollywood to realize who Amber Heard truly is?

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

Jason Momoa is a name that is buzzing and has been buzzing in the world of showbiz for quite some time. In fact, when Aquaman was released earlier in the year 2018, he was the only talk of Hollywood! 

Due to Aquaman’s major success, soon after its release, the second sequel to the movie was announced to be premiered in the year 2022. Unfortunately, with the Me Too movement targeting so many A-listers, one of the cast members was accused of being a part of this bandwagon. Any guesses on who fell off the wagon and joined in amongst the list of abusers? Yes, it was Amber Heard!

Amber Heard has been making headlines regularly for almost 2 years now, especially after her divorce from Johnny Depp. Initially, people assumed her to be the poor victim in the chaotic scenario she had going on with Johnny Depp. At one point, we were pretty convinced that she was the victim after she posted her pictures of the scars that she had obtained due to being a victim of domestic violence. 
 
What were Amber’s claims?

Amber Heard proved to be the biggest victim of the year, with her constant rants on social media as well as her claiming Johnny Depp to be an evil man with anger issues. She kept throwing out lies until one day Depp was forced to sue her, hence causing the famous chaotic court case to make repeated headlines.

How did Ambers Claims backfire?
 
Johnny Depp was proven innocent to his ex-wife’s claims after a leaked conversation between the two was released, proving that in fact, it was Johnny Depp who was being victimized. This surely didn’t save the mess he was in but made the likes of big platforms such as Disney apologize to him for believing the allegations.

How did this news worsen?

The Me Too movement was trending and each day a new celeb was being called out for inappropriate behaviour of misconduct with the co-workers, especially the female ones. Due to this being embedded in the minds of all, Depp was the most likely candidate to get abuser-bashed for his immoral actions.

Due to her alleged accusations, Johnny Depp’s career was quite miserable. In fact, the production teams that loved working with his massive talent started to reject his role in the movies. And all this was due to the fault of Amber and her bunch of lies. Imagine not having Jack Sparrow in the next Pirates of the Caribbean sequel!

What’s the big question now?

What’s racing across everyone’s mind is what does Amber Heard’s co-star, Jason Momoa, have to say about this? 

As you may be aware, Warner Bros just like all other entertainment entities, have the contents of the contract that they sign with the actors, strictly specifying them to follow privacy protocols, leaving the actors with little to nothing left to say about what goes on with the production of their movie as well as any other activities that take place under the roof of the Warner Bros. 

Jason Momoa has been adhering to the protocol and has not stated anything about the scandal his co-star was involved in. It shows that he doesn’t care about this blow -up or change in the cast, or that he has been asked by Warner Bros. to keep this situation on the low.

But, was Momoa and Heard compatible in real life as much as they seemed on screen?

Rumor has it that the Momoa and Heard were not as compatible as they seemed on the screen. With them being actors from two different worlds, it is sure to be quite a clash in the studios. But others state that they were actually good together since they were complete opposites and that opposites attract. Even though they seem great together on the red carpet, always having fun, the truth behind this fact is still left unknown!

Would Momoa’s word and stance on this scenario change the fate of who plays the role of Mera?

Most probably, yes. Without Jason, there is no Aquaman. In fact, the entire success behind Aquaman was 90% due to Jason Momoa’s efforts in making the storyline as lively. Without him, reaching this milestone would have been highly impossible. On a serious note, it’s highly possible that rather than risking their biggest asset, Warner Bros. would not sacrifice their king for the sake of Amber!

Jason Momoa is a name that is buzzing and has been buzzing in the world of showbiz for quite some time. In fact, when Aquaman was released earlier in the year 2018, he was the only talk of Hollywood! 

Due to Aquaman’s major success, soon after its release, the second sequel to the movie was announced to be premiered in the year 2022. Unfortunately, with the Me Too movement targeting so many A-listers, one of the cast members was accused of being a part of this bandwagon. Any guesses on who fell off the wagon and joined in amongst the list of abusers? Yes, it was Amber Heard!

Amber Heard has been making headlines regularly for almost 2 years now, especially after her divorce from Johnny Depp. Initially, people assumed her to be the poor victim in the chaotic scenario she had going on with Johnny Depp. At one point, we were pretty convinced that she was the victim after she posted her pictures of the scars that she had obtained due to being a victim of domestic violence. 
 
What were Amber’s claims?

Amber Heard proved to be the biggest victim of the year, with her constant rants on social media as well as her claiming Johnny Depp to be an evil man with anger issues. She kept throwing out lies until one day Depp was forced to sue her, hence causing the famous chaotic court case to make repeated headlines.

How did Ambers Claims backfire?
 
Johnny Depp was proven innocent to his ex-wife’s claims after a leaked conversation between the two was released, proving that in fact, it was Johnny Depp who was being victimized. This surely didn’t save the mess he was in but made the likes of big platforms such as Disney apologize to him for believing the allegations.

How did this news worsen?

The Me Too movement was trending and each day a new celeb was being called out for inappropriate behaviour of misconduct with the co-workers, especially the female ones. Due to this being embedded in the minds of all, Depp was the most likely candidate to get abuser-bashed for his immoral actions.

Due to her alleged accusations, Johnny Depp’s career was quite miserable. In fact, the production teams that loved working with his massive talent started to reject his role in the movies. And all this was due to the fault of Amber and her bunch of lies. Imagine not having Jack Sparrow in the next Pirates of the Caribbean sequel!

What’s the big question now?

What’s racing across everyone’s mind is what does Amber Heard’s co-star, Jason Momoa, have to say about this? 

As you may be aware, Warner Bros just like all other entertainment entities, have the contents of the contract that they sign with the actors, strictly specifying them to follow privacy protocols, leaving the actors with little to nothing left to say about what goes on with the production of their movie as well as any other activities that take place under the roof of the Warner Bros. 

Jason Momoa has been adhering to the protocol and has not stated anything about the scandal his co-star was involved in. It shows that he doesn’t care about this blow -up or change in the cast, or that he has been asked by Warner Bros. to keep this situation on the low.

But, was Momoa and Heard compatible in real life as much as they seemed on screen?

Rumor has it that the Momoa and Heard were not as compatible as they seemed on the screen. With them being actors from two different worlds, it is sure to be quite a clash in the studios. But others state that they were actually good together since they were complete opposites and that opposites attract. Even though they seem great together on the red carpet, always having fun, the truth behind this fact is still left unknown!

Would Momoa’s word and stance on this scenario change the fate of who plays the role of Mera?

Most probably, yes. Without Jason, there is no Aquaman. In fact, the entire success behind Aquaman was 90% due to Jason Momoa’s efforts in making the storyline as lively. Without him, reaching this milestone would have been highly impossible. On a serious note, it’s highly possible that rather than risking their biggest asset, Warner Bros. would not sacrifice their king for the sake of Amber!

For starters, Warner Brothers decided to push through on their initial decision to keep Amber Heard in the newest DC Extended Universe movie franchise, despite the lsuit and all the drama with Johnny Depp that she is currently involved in. Because of this, many fans are campaigning to stop production of the entire movie, as they believe that not only does Amber Heard deserve for her movie to flop, but the whole Warner Brothers production as well. But the problem here is there will be many other actors that will be affected once people go against it, and that includes major actors such as Nicole Kidman, Patrick Wilson, Willem Dafoe, Randall Park, and of course, Aquaman himself, Jason Momoa. For many Jason Momoa and Johnny Depp fans, this is a pretty tough decision to make. Johnny and Amber are in not just a rocky situation these days, they are facing a huge case before them, and supporting Amber Heard’s movie is basically supporting her. So, many fans want to know, what does Jason Momoa have to say about working with Amber Heard? Is he also tired of her drama? Does he think she is a good or bad person? Or will he defend her against Johnny Depp? Well, I guess you’ll need to stick around until the end of this video to find out. But before that, please make sure you subscribe first, and hit that notification bell for more updates. So, let’s begin!

The year 2021 may not be big for the DC universe, as movie theaters are still just reopening and many restrictions are still ongoing. As you all remember, Wonder Woman 1984 had been a much awaited film before the illness, but somehow this subsided the excitement. However, Warner Brothers remained hopeful for their second installment of the Aquaman movie. Despite the challenges that are uncertain by the time of its release, they are still going to push through on this major project, and in fact, they have already started filming the movie. Good decision, people might say. But there’s one big catch in the movie that many fans did not love, and it’s that Warner Brothers should really care more about one certain cast member. Just by the facts mentioned, you’d already conclude that Amber is not cool at all. Despite all these occurrences, Warner Brothers still kept her and even gave her the role of Queen Mera, while the same production company let go of Johnny Depp from his supposed upcoming film Fantastic Beasts 3 that is also set to be released in 2022. Obviously, many fans are not happy. The first installment of Aquaman was no doubt a huge success, both commercially and cinematically. The movie, directed by James Wan, was a depiction of an entirely new world, and it was surreal how they put all of them together in a manner that would not bore anyone. Indeed, it was worth watching again and again. And the 2018 movie’s success really reflected on its box office earnings, reaching 1.184 billion dollars, with a production budget of 160 to 200 million dollars. Because of the first film’s success, fans became very excited for the second installment right away, but after the movie’s success, case after case brought Amber Heard to the spotlight again, but this time in a very negative way. Now, obviously, people would automatically think that Warner Brothers would relieve Amber Heard from her role as Queen Mera. 

But amidst all this craziness in the entertainment industry, fans have been wondering, what is Amber Heard like as a co-star? During the Johnny and Amber battle, many celebrities have already pointed out that Amber isn’t exactly a truth-teller. A lot of film colleagues have stood by Johnny Depp through all these, defending him from Amber. But how about the insights of those who work with Amber? One of these celebrities is Jason Momoa, and he has got a lot to say.

Well, much to fan’s dismay, Jason Momoa reportedly has no problems with Amber Heard at all. Despite Warner Brother’s rogue decision to keep Amber Heard, which might actually cause their new movie to flop, at least Warner Brothers is somehow trying to reduce Amber Heard’s exposure. So let’s talk about Jason Momoa. Jason will be back as Arthur Curry in the upcoming Aquaman 2 movie.

 But in the end, it’s Warner Brothers’ call, and after all, we just hope it won’t affect the other actors that much. That’s all for today, hope you enjoyed our video and we’ll see you next time. Don’t forget to like, subscribe, and smash that notification bell for more videos like this.

The year 2021 may not be big for the DC universe, as movie theaters are still just reopening and many restrictions are still ongoing. As you all remember, Wonder Woman 1984 had been a much awaited film before the illness, but somehow this subsided the excitement. However, Warner Brothers remained hopeful for their second installment of the Aquaman movie. Despite the challenges that are uncertain by the time of its release, they are still going to push through on this major project, and in fact, they have already started filming the movie. Good decision, people might say. But there’s one big catch in the movie that many fans did not love, and it’s that Warner Brothers should really care more about one certain cast member. Just by the facts mentioned, you’d already conclude that Amber is not cool at all. Despite all these occurrences, Warner Brothers still kept her and even gave her the role of Queen Mera, while the same production company let go of Johnny Depp from his supposed upcoming film Fantastic Beasts 3 that is also set to be released in 2022. Obviously, many fans are not happy. The first installment of Aquaman was no doubt a huge success, both commercially and cinematically. The movie, directed by James Wan, was a depiction of an entirely new world, and it was surreal how they put all of them together in a manner that would not bore anyone. Indeed, it was worth watching again and again. And the 2018 movie’s success really reflected on its box office earnings, reaching 1.184 billion dollars, with a production budget of 160 to 200 million dollars. Because of the first film’s success, fans became very excited for the second installment right away, but after the movie’s success, case after case brought Amber Heard to the spotlight again, but this time in a very negative way. Now, obviously, people would automatically think that Warner Brothers would relieve Amber Heard from her role as Queen Mera. 

But amidst all this craziness in the entertainment industry, fans have been wondering, what is Amber Heard like as a co-star? During the Johnny and Amber battle, many celebrities have already pointed out that Amber isn’t exactly a truth-teller. A lot of film colleagues have stood by Johnny Depp through all these, defending him from Amber. But how about the insights of those who work with Amber? One of these celebrities is Jason Momoa, and he has got a lot to say.

Well, much to fan’s dismay, Jason Momoa reportedly has no problems with Amber Heard at all. Despite Warner Brother’s rogue decision to keep Amber Heard, which might actually cause their new movie to flop, at least Warner Brothers is somehow trying to reduce Amber Heard’s exposure. So let’s talk about Jason Momoa. Jason will be back as Arthur Curry in the upcoming Aquaman 2 movie.

 But in the end, it’s Warner Brothers’ call, and after all, we just hope it won’t affect the other actors that much. That’s all for today, hope you enjoyed our video and we’ll see you next time. Don’t forget to like, subscribe, and smash that notification bell for more videos like this.

Why? As you remember, Warner Brothers stuck with their initial decision to keep Amber Heard in Aquaman’s second movie despite her involvement in the lawsuits with Johnny Depp, and despite the same production company’s reckless decision to fire Johnny from his iconic role as Grindelwald in the third installment of the Fantastic Beasts film trilogy. Because of this, many fans were outraged, as they should have been, because of the so-called unfair treatment between the former couple. However, despite garnering almost two million signatures in a petition for Warner Brothers to fire Amber, the production company still pushed through on casting her. Many fans were angered by this, and as a result, they vowed to boycott the upcoming Aquaman movie in 2022. Many said they would not watch it so that Amber Heard and the rest of Warner Brothers get their well-deserved downfall. All this time, Warner Brothers never bent their decision, but now that they are experiencing a major backlash in social media due to mean comments about their film and Amber Heard, will they finally regret casting her? What are fans saying about Warner brothers now? Will the movie and the production company itself plummet to the ground? Let’s find out in this video. But before that, make sure first to subscribe to our channel and hit that notification bell for more updates. Now, let’s begin!

The first day of filming of the new movie sequel Aquaman and The Lost Kingdom was expected to be huge news to its fans, but rather, it turned out to be a big flop. What made it an even bigger disappointment for Warner Brothers is that the first Aquaman movie turned out to be a major blockbuster success in 2018, reaching 1.184 billion dollars, with a production budget of only 160 to 200 million dollars. That’s a lot of profit! However, after the first release of the first movie, one of the main actresses, Amber Heard, had been involved in a lawsuit with Johnny Depp, all brought about by their messy marriage and split. And even though Amber played the victim at first, soon enough, evidence surfaced proving her as a “liar and a manipulator” to use one of Johnny Depp’s co-stars’ words. And aside from the stuff that Amber told the public, there was evidence of her having affairs during her marriage with Johnny, a phone call record proving she was the one who actually lifted a finger on Johnny, and a missing 7 million dollars worth of charity donations. Because of this evidence and allegations, Amber Heard had turned into one of the most despised celebrities today real quick. Now, having someone with a bad image to star along with a few of the highest paid actors in the industry is actually a big risk for a huge production company like Warner Brothers, and that’s why people are so confused why Warner Brothers kept her from getting fired. But apart from this, Warner Brothers are reportedly trying to reduce Amber’s screen time, a matter which Jason Momoa and the director, James Wan himself, kind of disagree about.

Everywhere you look on social media, there were mean comments about Amber, and sadly, about the upcoming Aquaman film itself. There’s no doubt that the first Aquaman directed by James Wan was a huge hit. Here are some of the nastiest reactions of fans about Warner Brother’s firm decision to keep Amber Heard.

When Aquaman director James Wan posted on social media a photo of a clapperboard hinting on their start of filming,  it was overshadowed by negative comments with almost 3,000 tweets. One social media user took it to twitter and said, “When you see that Warner Bros kept Amber Heard onboard for Aquaman 2, but still haven't brought back Johnny for 'Fantastic Beasts'. #FireAmberHeard, with a GIF of a man throwing tantrums in a kitchen. Some twitter users even made social media memes out of it making fun of their excited reactions when Aquaman 2 was announced but then changed it to disgust after learning that Amber Heard will be in it. While another twitter user did not use any more fuss and just directly said, “Don’t care, just fire Amber Heard”.

As if things with Amber Heard couldn’t get more confusing it just so happens to be that she dropped some insane news not too long ago. It turns out that Amber Heard is actually a mother? And actually had been for a couple of months already, which is a shock to many. On Thursday the 35 year old Aquaman actress announced this big news on her personal instagram. Heard went on to post a mother daughter photo of her now 12 week old baby. But the truth is, people are kind of confused as to who the other person in the picture is. At this point, anything is possible and it just seems to be that Heard is full of surprises so no one is sure as far as what to expect.
