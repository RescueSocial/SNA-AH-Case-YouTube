Lyrics:
[Intro: Whistling]

[Verse 1]
A great big bang and dinosaurs
Fiery raining meteors
It all ends unfortunately

[Chorus 1]
But you're gonna live forever in me
I guarantee, just wait and see

[Verse 2]
Parts of me were made by you
And planets keep their distance too
The moon's got a grip on the sea

[Chorus 2]
And you're gonna live forever in me
I guarantee, it's your destiny

[Verse 3]
Life is full of sweet mistakes
And love's an honest one to make
Time leaves no fruit on the tree

[Chorus 3]
But you're gonna live forever in me
I guarantee, it's just meant to be

[Interlude: Whistling]

[Verse 4]
And when the pastor asks the pews
For reasons he can't marry you
I'll keep my word and my seat

[Chorus 1]
But you're gonna live forever in me
I guarantee, just wait and see

[Outro: Whistling]

Have passionate sex Scene (Amber Heard  and Alexander Skarsg√•rd)
Making love Scene From Series: ""The Stand"" (2021)


‚Ä¢ Original title: ""The Stand""
‚Ä¢ Episode title (S01E07) ""Episode 7""
‚Ä¢ Adventure, Drama, Fantasy 
‚Ä¢ Creators: Josh Boone, Benjamin Cavell
‚Ä¢ Stars: Whoopi Goldberg, Alexander Skarsg√•rd, James Marsden 
‚Ä¢ IMDb: 5,5/10


The Stand picks up the pace significantly in a crucial episode directed with flair and dread by Vincenzo Natali (Splice, Cube). There are still some odd changes to the source material in this hour.


How is Nadine not in Vegas yet? Wasn‚Äôt she going 120 mph? Anyway, she finds a red carpet in the desert, and she‚Äôs suddenly in Flagg‚Äôs penthouse. She made it. She‚Äôs finally with her King. They kiss, and she tells him about Harold. Now she can be his wife, and the two have passionate sex that gets more and more intense. She starts to sense something isn‚Äôt right and realizes she‚Äôs still in the desert just as she suddenly sees a demon form of Flagg. It‚Äôs an odd, vague cut to commercial in that shocking moment that somewhat lessens one of the darkest scenes in Stephen King history. In the book, this is a brutal, violent rape scene (‚ÄúHe battered into her, invader, destroyer, and the cold blood gushed down her thighs‚Äù) that traumatizes Nadine and leaves her catatonic. It may have been too dark for CBS All Access, but the way it‚Äôs framed here feels like it mutes how much Flagg abuses even his ‚ÄúQueen.‚Äù


By this time, Nadine has finally reached the next phase of her destiny. Flagg transports her to his suite in New Vegas, where he has sex with her. It‚Äôs all a beautiful illusion, though, as Nadine realizes too late. The edges of the fantasy dissolve to reveal that she‚Äôs lying in the dirt, and Flagg is a demon. And while this scene also shifts to imply that Nadine is no longer consenting, it is an improvement upon the scene in the book, which is a violent rape scene.


Nadine is simultaneously reluctant and determined to get to Flagg, enticed of his protection and terrified of his ownership of her. She willingly goes, but it‚Äôs also the result of years and years of conditioning on Flagg‚Äôs part. He shrunk her world so that it seemed like he was the only person she had. He made her need him. She starts to have sex with him and then tries to stop, but he ignores her protests, and things turn violent and terrifying. She sees him for the monster he really is, but it‚Äôs too late. He sucks everything out of her so that she becomes a floating, quiet, submissive shell. She has served her purpose: She‚Äôs pregnant with Flagg‚Äôs demon baby, and it‚Äôs literally sucking the life out of her. Flagg‚Äôs at his scariest here. His behaviors with Nadine have all the markings of an abusive, manipulative, all-consuming relationship.


It goes both ways, too. As already mentioned, Harold understands in his last minutes that it was his inability to let go of his humiliation and hatred that has doomed him, and once Nadine gets to the desert, she too has an awful moment of clarity when she and Flagg bang it out. Even Mother Abigail chastises herself for the sinful pride that caused her to forget that, ‚ÄúI was not the potter, but the clay.‚Äù As this series creeps toward the final showdown, Cavell and his writers are making it clear that the bigger battle for humanity‚Äôs salvation is already underway, and the lines there for which side one should be on are as clear as day.


‚ÄúThe Walk‚Äù works as well as it does because it manages to pull these character and thematic moments together in an episode that is also captivating, and is bolstered by some gorgeous cinematography capturing the quartet‚Äôs walk west (and a clutch use of Radiohead‚Äôs ‚ÄúI Promise‚Äù during one such portion). The performances of Marsden, Adepo, Kinnear, and Bedard represent an emotional high-water mark for the series, with all four actors using the history of the previous six episodes to fall into an effortless rapport as a group.


On the flipside, like Harold‚Äôs motorcycle, Teague hits a wall with his performance this time around, as his magnificent crescendo in last week‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Vigil‚Äù didn‚Äôt leave him anywhere to go in the early moments of this episode. And while Nadine‚Äôs lightening-fast gestation of Flagg‚Äôs demon-baby does hit the whole, ‚Äúthe future is what you make of it‚Äù theme a little too squarely on the head, her corpse-like complexion at the end of the episode.

Welcome to the Heavy Spoilers show, I'm your host Paul and I dunno if it's just me but does anyone else think The Stand is Randall Lagging a bit after episode 3?

I think by far this was my least favourite of those released and I found the time jumps to be a bit all over the place. If you're confused by exactly what's going on then don't worry as we're gonna be breaking it all down and discussing the main book differences.

Obviously full spoilers ahead from here on out though I will keep some of the bigger elements of the book a secret to not spoil some certain surprises. If you enjoy the video please smash the thumbs up button and make sure you subscribe for breakdowns of the series every week.

With that out the way, Happy New Year, I'm your host Paul now let's get into the breakdown!

Ok so Episode 3 sort of fills in the back stories of some of the side characters that we've been introduced to and primarily we focus on Nadine, Nick and Stu meeting Glen Bateman.

Now you may remember that last week we caught Nadine being drawn towards a planchette and this episode we see that the device ties back to her childhood. Similar to the source material, Nadine was an orphan but rather than living with her Aunt and Uncle like in the book we see her starting off in a home.

Through the Planchette, Randall Flagg is able to contact her and he clearly has had eyes on her from a young age. The villain carves into the floor ""Nadine will be my queen, we are in the house of the dead Nadine"" which yeah...you can have her mate.

Now even in her adult version, Nadine is still a virgin and this is because throughout her life Flagg has contacted her and told her to save herself for him. Though many men have shot their shot some dark force has always swept in and scared them off.

In the present we catch her waking up in bed and to everyone's surprise Amber Heard hasn't pooped in it.

Melanie Martinez's creative drive and talents as a visual artist have long distinguished her from other musicians. With her debut album Cry Baby, Melanie introduced the world to her distinctly original vision with hits like ‚ÄúPity Party‚Äù, ‚ÄúPacify Her‚Äù, ‚ÄúAlphabet Boy‚Äù, ‚ÄúCarousel‚Äù and ‚ÄúSippy Cup‚Äù. Creating unique music videos for each album track, including ‚ÄúSoap/Training Wheels‚Äù and ‚ÄúTag, You're It/Milk and Cookies‚Äù, Melanie portrays the traumas and insecurities of the album's titular character over a bed of electro pop, alternative and hip-hop. Her latest triumph K-12, an inspired new album and feature film directed by and starring Melanie, brings together a melting pot of low-key hip-hop, soulful pop and indie-leaning electro with whimsical, surreal visuals and magical realism to stunning results.

The Stand Episode 8 Release Date
‚ÄòThe Stand‚Äô episode 8 is scheduled to premiere on February 4, 2021, on CBS All Access at 3 am ET. The miniseries is slated to have a total of nine episodes.

Spoilers ‚ÄòThe Stand‚Äô is also titled ‚ÄòThe Stand.‚Äô It is the penultimate episode of the limited series. If the show follows the Stephen King book closely, then the upcoming episode will see Glen executed by Lloyd after he denies bending his knee to Randall Flagg. The episode may also see a dying Nadine prophetically telling Flagg that four men from Boulder would be his end. In the book, a livid Flagg tosses Nadine from the penthouse balcony, thus killing her instantly. The next episode might also see the Trashcan Man return with the nuclear weapon that Flagg wanted.

Titled ‚ÄúThe Stand,‚Äù The Stand Season 1 Episode 8 is soon going to be released. The post-apocalyptic fiction has been getting mixed reviews since its premiere. This show is based on a book penned down by Stephen King. It went by the same name and was published back in 1978. The makers took very long to realize that the book is worth having a TV adaptation.

The Stand S01E08: In a world mostly wiped out by the plague and embroiled in an elemental struggle between good and evil, the fate of mankind rests on the frail shoulders of the 108-year-old Mother Abagail and a handful of survivors. Their worst nightmares are embodied in a man with a lethal smile and unspeakable powers: Randall Flagg, the Dark Man.

The Stand is a post-apocalyptic dark fantasy novel written by American author Stephen King and first published in 1978 by Doubleday. The plot centers on a pandemic of a weaponized strain of influenza that kills almost the entire world population. The few survivors, united in groups, establish a new social system and engage in confrontation with each other. In writing the book, King sought to create an epic in the spirit of The Lord of the Rings that was set in contemporary America. The book was difficult for King to write because of the large number of characters and storylines.

In 1990, The Stand was reprinted as a Complete and Uncut Edition. King restored some fragments of texts that were initially reduced, revised the order of the chapters, shifted the novel's setting from 1980 to 10 years forward, and accordingly corrected a number of cultural references. The Complete and Uncut Edition of The Stand is considered to be King's longest stand-alone work with its 1,152 pages, surpassing King's 1,138-page novel It. The book has sold 4.5 million copies.

Premise: Musician Larry Underwood is on the cusp of his big break when ""Captain Trips"" strikes New York. Alone and wandering an empty city, he meets an alluring new acquaintance also desperate to escape. Meanwhile, an incarcerated Lloyd Henreid comes face-to-face with Randall Flagg, The Dark Man himself, who makes him an enticing offer. - from IMDb.

Another day has passed us
With its lack of change
And all we have is what we share
And all we want is someone else to be there

And if the sun will set tonight
Hold our secrets up to the sky
As our shadows grow there's nothing left to hide
And if you ever doubt
You will know that I still wonder
How many times that I've compared
The stars to your eyes

We will make it through
No matter the cost
We've gone this far
Why not find out how it works out
For you and me
We'll make it through
I thought we were lost
But somehow we haven't found a way
And I hope that we never do

It's hard to get to understand
When our own lives are in our hands
And don't stop when you've never been closer
Just 'cause you don't know what matters most
The way won't always be so clearly right in front of us

And if the sun will set tonight
Hold our secrets up to the sky
As our shadows grow there's nothing left to hide
And if you ever doubt
You will know that I still wonder
How many times that I've compared
The stars to your eyes

We will make it through
No matter the cost
We've gone this far
Why not find out how it works out
For you and me
We'll make it through
I thought we were lost
But somehow we haven't found a way
And I hope that we never do

Never do

Got this far without knowing who we truly are

'Waves' Lyrics

There is a swelling storm,
and i'm caught up in the middle of it all.
And it takes control,
of the person that I thought I was,
the boy I used to know.

But there, Is a light,
In the dark, and I feel its warmth.
In my hands, and my heart,
Why can't I hold on?

It comes and goes in waves,
It always does, it always does.
We watch as our young hearts fade,
Into the flood, into the flood

The Freedom, of falling,
a feeling I thought was set in stone.
It slips through, my fingers,
I'm trying hard to let go,
but it comes and goes in waves,
It comes and goes in waves,
and carries us away.

Through the wind, 
down to the place we used to lay when we were kids.
Memories, of a stolen place,
Caught in the silence, 
an echo lost in space.

It comes and goes in waves,
It always does, it always does.
We watch as our young hearts fade,
Into the flood, into the flood.

The Freedom, of falling,
a feeling I thought was set in stone.
It slips through, my fingers,
I'm trying hard to let go,
but it comes and goes in waves,
It comes and goes in waves,
and carries us away.

I watched my wild youth, 
disappear in front of my eyes.
Moments of magic and wonder,
seem so hard to find.
Is it ever coming back again?
Is it ever coming back again?
Take me back to the feeling when,
everything was left to find.

It comes and goes in waves,
It always does, ow it always does.

The Freedom, of falling,
a feeling I thought was set in stone.
It slips through, my fingers,
I'm trying hard to let go,
It comes and goes in waves,
It comes and goes in waves,
and carries us away.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dKlgCk3IGBg/default.jpg,120,90,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dKlgCk3IGBg/mqdefault.jpg,320,180,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dKlgCk3IGBg/hqdefault.jpg,480,360,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dKlgCk3IGBg/sddefault.jpg,640.0,480.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dKlgCk3IGBg/maxresdefault.jpg,1280.0,720.0,DeanLewisVEVO,"['Dean Lewis Need You Now', 'Need You Now', 'Dean Lewis Same kind of different', 'Same kind of different', 'Suits TV', 'Suits TV Music', 'Suits Music', 'Riverdale', 'Shadowhunters', 'Waves Acoustic', 'Riverdale Music', 'Shadowhunters music', 'Riverdale TV Show', 'Shadowhunters TV Show']",10,none,Dean Lewis - Waves (Official Video),"Official video for 'Waves' by Dean Lewis.

According to insider Daniel Richtman, talk that Emilia Clarke, who‚Äôs been linked to the role of Mera before, is set to replace Heard, has no basis in truth. And although this news may not be taken as positively by some people as it will be by others, it seems that Heard‚Äôs immediate career prospects and personal life are going to be shadowed by these sorts of stories for a while yet.

Of course, in recent weeks, Richtman has also reported that the actress is angry at Warner Bros. for bringing in another female lead, reducing her screen time in the Aquaman sequel. However, she‚Äôs apparently set to get a pay rise for her part in the movie, too, so it‚Äôs hard to really know what‚Äôs going on behind the scenes on the film. Meanwhile, campaigns to boycott it rumble on in the background, with the actress‚Äô legal battles with ex-husband Johnny Depp also set to resume this year.

Mera will next be seen as a supporting figure in Zack Snyder‚Äôs Justice League cut, and there‚Äôs even been talk that she could be upgraded to a more prominent presence in the League following the events of that picture. Furthermore, Heard can currently be found in the new version of The Stand on CBS All Access, wherein she appears as Nadine Cross, one of the more villainous figures on the show.

Given how the Heard-Depp controversy isn‚Äôt going away anytime soon, it‚Äôs hard not to see Aquaman 2 receiving a lot of scrutiny as it gradually heads into production.

Orlando Bloom defended Johnny Depp as ""one of the most private and stand-up people I've ever met"" as the fifth ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" movie held its Hollywood premiere on Thursday (18 May) at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles. 
Depp has faced recent scrutiny for his messy divorce from actress Amber Heard and a lawsuit filed by his former business managers that claims he fell into financial trouble due to a lavish lifestyle that cost more than $2 million a month. 
""You know, listen ‚Äì the man that I know and love is the man who is here tonight and is on form and does everything the right way,"" said Bloom, who starred in the first three ""Pirates"" movies with Depp. 
""People go through all kinds of weird stuff in the world. And it's just a shame that it has to be dragged out into the public. Because God knows he has been one of the most private and stand-up people I've ever met.""
""Pirates"" franchise producer Jerry Bruckheimer blamed the news media for Depp's troubles. 
""Oh, he's the best. And unfortunately the media kind of picks on certain people. And it was his turn in the barrel,"" Bruckheimer said. ""But he's a fabulous guy and a great artist. And he's here and he's excited to be here for the premiere.""
The Captain Jack Sparrow actor signed autographs and posed for selfies with fans dressed like pirates on Hollywood Boulevard. 
""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales"" also stars Javier Bardem, Geoffrey Rush, Brenton Thwaites and Kaya Scodelario.  
Bloom's returning role as Will Turner in the new movie is small - and he acknowledged his fee for joining in hinged on showing up to the movie's premieres. 
""They kind of told me I had to. It was part of the deal. It was like 'Bro, we're going to pay you this. And you're going to do two days, but you're coming to every premiere that we do. OK?' I was like, 'OK!' So ‚Äì but it was great, because to be honest, we shot this 2 and a half years ago. That was a time where I was having really precious moments with my son, didn't want to really leave him,"" Bloom said. ""So when I was like, OK, I did shoot two scenes over three continents, and I was all over the place. But it's great, man. I mean, these movies ‚Äì I had a nice emotional hook for my son, to send him off of the journey, and at the end I get to kiss Keira Knightley. It couldn't be worse, right? How bad could it get?""
Spanish actor Javier Bardem plays a character new to the franchise, the undead Captain Armando Salazar. 
He remembers play-acting as a pirate as a child - along with being Darth Vader's spaceship. And now that he's in the Disney family, maybe there's another franchise in his sights. 
""Yeah, yeah ‚Äì of course. I am a kid. I'm a boy. So I remember playing ‚Äì I remember playing pirate, warriors, and also I remember playing spaceship ‚Äì Darth Vader's spaceship. Not Darth Vader, but the spaceship. Which is very weird for a kid,"" Bardem said. 
""Yeah ‚Äì the whole noise, and the whole thing. So I guess I'm trying to get into the 'Star Wars' franchise now. ... Yeah, I could do that. I know some people now.""
Brenton Thwaites plays the son of Orlando Bloom's character. 
He says he's not sure if ""Pirates"" could continue as a franchise without Depp at its center. 
""I mean, I think all of the fans including myself really want to see what Captain Jack Sparrow is up to you in the next movie. In this one, I think he is deeper, darker, funnier,"" Thwaites said. 
Both he and co-star Kaya Scodelario became parents in the time since filming ended and the movie premiered.

Hello Albsterz Here, in today's video we are doing part 2 of Shadows Amidst Snowstorms with Albedo. What a incredible quest this was in the new update 2.3 of genshin impact. In the adventure we had Bennett, amber, eula and albedo with us. But the scene was with Paimon. This is one of the funny moments in genshin impact with Paimon.

Sometimes amongst all the frights, pulse-pounding jump scares, and skin-crawling horrors, you come across a few that do more than just frighten you ‚Äî they break your heart in two by making you terrified through inescapable chills. Today, I'm here with a list of creepy videos that is nothing like your average, predictable list; it is a list of 15 scary videos that'll make your hair raise ‚Äî with ominously dark and mysterious happenings. So turn off the lights and cover yourself in your blanket, because these will likely leave you unsettled and in need of some warmth.
 
The entries in this list of top 15 creepy videos feature freakish ghost encounters, supernatural occurrences, scary videos that capture paranormal events in a haunted house, mysterious happenings, menacingly eerie recordings, and true instances of hauntings and ghost sightings. With that, these scary videos teem with bone-chilling frights and shudders. Taking this into consideration: if you are seeking a good scare from your screen, these creepy videos may do the job but the fear, chaos, and horror may feel a tad too real. 
 
Even though there are plenty of creepy videos in this list that will leave you freaked out from your wits while you literally shake like a leaf, I do acknowledge that you are also as much a fan of horror as I am ‚Äî frankly, that's why you and I are here, right? 
 
However, at the same time, we all like keeping safe alongside feeling the most exhilarating emotions that we can experience. The collection of these scary videos would let you feel just that! You get to feel adventurous without truly going through what you would have, had you experienced in person the dire and dreadful events shown in this collection of scary videos. Sounds good, right? Nevertheless, if you get scared too stiff, just keep in mind that you are behind the security of your computer screen ‚Äî that you are merely observing shivery ghost encounters and are, in fact, well protected in the comfort of your home. That should help with the chills that are certain to run up and down your spine as you watch this list of creepy videos.
 
Done watching? That's great!
Which of these scary videos made your hair raise the most? Let me know right below in the comments!

But her position on this subject isn‚Äôt the only thing causing trouble for the star. Apparently, McCarthy knows how to get on a celebrity‚Äôs bad side. When reviewing her track record, you‚Äôll see she‚Äôs made quite a few enemies.

What is it that compels her to diss other public figures in such a way? And who exactly has she upset throughout her career? Sit back and relax, because we‚Äôre about to dish on the celebs who can‚Äôt stand Jenny McCarthy.

They‚Äôve probably answered everything already, and they could be coming off a long stretch of time being around a media circus.

It‚Äôs shouldn‚Äôt be a surprise that sometimes celebrities lose it on a reporter or interviewer. It could come down to fatigue or being asked a stupid question that was interpreted as being offensive or hitting below the belt.

Instances where a celebrity fires back at the interviewers on live TV can create awkward moments for both parties. But it also creates compelling live content for viewers. We‚Äôve compiled a list of such moments, so take a look at these stars who fired back at their interviewer on live TV.

With a lot going on in the news between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard, their marriage, their divorce, and the abuse accusations, there is a lot more stirring up in the case! A new document has been circulated which states a nameless party, conjectured to be Whitney Henriquez, Amber Heard‚Äôs sister. 

It‚Äôs nothing but a subpoena!  Rumour has it that Amber Heard has paid or let‚Äôs say bribed her sister, Whitney Henriques a hefty sum of 10,000 dollars to give false testimony, against Johnny Depp. Yes, you have heard it right! 

How did the story of Johnny Depp and Amber Heard start? 

In short, their story can be covered in four words - courtship, divorce, and domestic abuse.

Johnny Depp and Amber Heard met on the sets of ‚ÄòThe Rum Diary‚Äô back in 2009. Soon after forming a warm camaraderie, the duo escalated their relationship and became lovers around 2012. Both of them split up with their then-partners in the same year. 

But little did they know that this was soon about to make a turn for the worse. 

A fact to note here is that Amber Heard was arrested on the charge of physically assaulting her girlfriend Van Ree, which was later resolved, clearing the air. Van Ree defended her ex-girlfriend Amber Heard by stating that the police wrongly interpreted the actions and it was all just a misunderstanding. 

Well, let‚Äôs just say something similar happened between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard, because just a year after their marriage, Amber Heard filed for divorce and accused Johnny Depp of physical assault. A temporary restraining order was also taken out against her husband.

What‚Äôs the status of the case so far? 

Depp has denied Amber‚Äôs claims of physical assault and has filed a defamation suit against Amber Heard for a whopping 50 million dollars. And now Heard has finally filed her counterclaims, saying that she is the true victim here. 

Let‚Äôs come back to the defamation case filed by Depp against his ex-wife. The case revolves around a 2018 article Amber Heard wrote in The Washington Post, about being a survivor of domestic abuse.

Despite Johnny Depp‚Äôs attempts to throw out the case against him, a judge has granted Amber Heard permission to file her 100 million dollar countersuit in response to the actor‚Äôs suit.  

Johnny Depp‚Äôs Claims

Amber Heard was the abuser in the relationship with Johnny Depp, as per the claims of his former personal assistant. As a result of this incident, Depp spent the entire time in the bathroom after his personal security intervened.  During the time the couple took a trip to Australia, due to frictions between them, Heard threw a bottle of Vodka at Depp and severed his finger. Now, let‚Äôs delve into the testimony and the sum of $10,000 offered to Whitney Henriquez, Amber Heard‚Äôs sister. This document is a subpoena, it states that the person to whom it is addressed has to take a stand, they will be answerable to the court. That is followed by a number of requests for documentation and communications. The amount paid, clearly hints that something is fishy

If one has to pay for testimony from someone they are close to, precisely their own sister, then the accusations are feeble, lack real evidence, and reasoning. 

To explain what is mentioned in the document, here are two examples:

Request number 1:  All documents or Communications that refer, reflect, or relate to any physical or verbal (blank) in any form against anonymous and Mr. Depp.

Request number 2: All communications YOU and (blank) that refer, reflect, or relate to any physical or verbal (blank) in any form against anonymous and Mr. Depp.
 
Lastly, the documentation shows the amounts of monetary payments, gifts, or transfers in value of (blank) to you or for your benefit, with the connection of the defamation case, the divorce action, and or the Sun Case in the amount of $10,000 or more. An incident back from March 2015, gives a hint of evidence that Amber would have perhaps bribed Whitney to lie in the court against Depp. Henriquez justified the actions of Heard when she had allegedly punched Depp, which she defended by arguing that she threw her fist against him because she felt threatened by the possibility of Depp pushing her down the stairs.  clevver news  amber heard aquaman 2  celebrity news johhny depp case amber heard case

Is Amber Heard lying? This is the question that has caused a lot of controversies lately. There has been plenty of evidence by Johnny's team proving that Amber has started fights and hit him before but there is no direct evidence Johnny did the same actions. Even Amber's parents stand by Johnny deep down. Enjoy watching and don't forget to smash that Like button at the end.

In this video we chat about how Heard's lawyer claims there are NO prior arrests or trouble with the law, with Heard.

Armenian publicist Vaghinak Byurat was 25 years old in the spring of 1912. He described what happened on his journey to America on the most famous ship in the world in his memoirs.

SUMMARY:
- Armenian publicist Vaghinak Byurat was 25 years old in the spring of 1912. He described what happened on his journey to America on the most famous ship in the world in his memoirs.
- In 1912, Vaghinak published some books together with his father, a famous Armenian writer. His task was to take the books to America.
- They went to bed rather late on April 14, just like on the other nights. Shortly after midnight, something that sounded like a big explosion woke everyone up.
- None of the crew members wanted to say anything, but a few minutes later it was impossible to deny that the Titanic was going underwater.
- Vaghinak put his passport and money in a little bag and tied it around his neck. The Titanic‚Äôs bow was already underwater by that time. A lot of people in this situation wouldn‚Äôt have dared to take it to the open water.
- The water in the North Atlantic that night was just below freezing, at a scary 28 degrees Fahrenheit (-2 C). The young writer felt his arms and legs go numb, and he was understandably getting weaker and weaker every second.
- Then, he bumped into something. It was a lifeboat! But it was so overcrowded they pushed the young man with a paddle when he tried to stick to the boat.
- Vaghinak woke up alive on board another ship. That ship was the Carpathia, and it was en route to New York with lucky survivors on board.
- 12 days later, a woman came into the room. She turned out to be the person who saved Vaghinak. Missis Astor told the sailors that the young man was her son, and she wouldn‚Äôt let them go without him since she‚Äôd already lost her husband on the Titanic.
- Vaghinak lived a long and happy life and, as a great storyteller, he shared what happened to him many times. Interestingly, he‚Äôs never mentioned an iceberg hitting the Titanic, and always spoke about an explosion.
- It could have been a fire, and quite a lot of people actually believe that theory, saying that coal was burning in the ship‚Äôs hull.
- Another theory that explained the explosion claimed that there was a German U-boat involved in the sinking of Titanic.

Dying Nadine Scene (Amber Heard)
Nadine Scene (tosses herself)
Dead Scene From Series: ""The Stand"" (2021)

‚Ä¢ Original title: ""The Stand""
‚Ä¢ Episode title (S01E08) ""Episode 8""
‚Ä¢ Adventure, Drama, Fantasy 
‚Ä¢ Creators: Josh Boone, Benjamin Cavell
‚Ä¢ Stars: Whoopi Goldberg, Alexander Skarsg√•rd, James Marsden, Amber Heard 
‚Ä¢ IMDb: 5,5/10


The Stand Episode 8 Release Date
‚ÄòThe Stand‚Äô episode 8 is scheduled to premiere on February 4, 2021, on CBS All Access at 3 am ET. The miniseries is slated to have a total of nine episodes.

Spoilers ‚ÄòThe Stand‚Äô is also titled ‚ÄòThe Stand.‚Äô It is the penultimate episode of the limited series. If the show follows the Stephen King book closely, then the upcoming episode will see Glen executed by Lloyd after he denies bending his knee to Randall Flagg. The episode may also see a dying Nadine prophetically telling Flagg that four men from Boulder would be his end. In the book, a livid Flagg tosses Nadine from the penthouse balcony, thus killing her instantly. The next episode might also see the Trashcan Man return with the nuclear weapon that Flagg wanted.

Titled ‚ÄúThe Stand,‚Äù The Stand Season 1 Episode 8 is soon going to be released. The post-apocalyptic fiction has been getting mixed reviews since its premiere. This show is based on a book penned down by Stephen King. It went by the same name and was published back in 1978. The makers took very long to realize that the book is worth having a TV adaptation.

The Stand S01E08: In a world mostly wiped out by the plague and embroiled in an elemental struggle between good and evil, the fate of mankind rests on the frail shoulders of the 108-year-old Mother Abagail and a handful of survivors. Their worst nightmares are embodied in a man with a lethal smile and unspeakable powers: Randall Flagg, the Dark Man.

Aqu√≠ est√° lo que sabemos.

The Stand es una narrativa extensa que cubre gran parte de Estados Unidos, llevando a los lectores desde la ciudad de Nueva York a Maine, y desde Nebraska a Las Vegas. 

En medio de todo eso, King desarrolla gente buena, gente mala y aquellos que se encuentran en el medio.

Las primeras noticias sobre el reparto de la serie revelaron estrellas como: James Marsden como Stu Redman, Amber Heard como Nadine Cross, Odessa Young como Fran Goldsmith y Henry Zaga como Nick Andros, los cuatro principales protagonistas de la lucha que constituye el n√∫cleo del libro.

Los anuncios posteriores del elenco  informaron que Nat Wolff se uni√≥ al show como el villano Lloyd Henreid, mientras que Jovan Adepo ser√° la estrella de rock Larry Underwood, Brad William Henke har√° a Tom Cullen, y Greg Kinnear interpretar√° a Glen Bateman. 

Otros dos nombres, Marilyn Manson y la estrella de The Flash, Ezra Miller, tambi√©n estar√°n, pero con papeles a√∫n misteriosos.

Por supuesto, podr√≠a decirse que las decisiones de reparto m√°s importantes llegaron cuando la producci√≥n tuvo que escoger a los l√≠deres en ambos lados de la lucha, la benevolente Madre Abigail y el siniestro Randall Flagg. 

Al final, esos papeles fueron para la legendaria Whoopi Goldberg y el siempre convincente Alexander Skarsg√•rd, respectivamente, preparando el escenario para una batalla que estremecer√° la televisi√≥n.

 The 'Aquaman' actress takes the witness stand in London court, claiming her former husband threatened to murder her many times during their tumultuous marriage.   Jul 21, 2020  ¬†AceShowbiz - Amber Heard has alleged Johnny Depp ""explicitly threatened to kill me many times"" during the course of their marriage.  ¬† The ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" actor is suing bosses at Britain's News Group Newspapers (NGN) for libel, after he was labelled a ""wife beater"" in a 2018 article published in The Sun. ¬† ¬†   ¬† Depp has vehemently denied accusations of domestic violence levelled at him by his ex-wife but, as she took to the witness stand at London's High Court on Monday (20Jul20), the ""Aquaman"" star alleged Depp told her ""death was the only way out"" of their marriage and threatened her life on several occasions.  ¬† ""Some incidents were so severe that I was afraid he was going to kill me, either intentionally or just by losing control and going too far,"" she claimed in her witness statement.

He has the innate ability to mix strangeness with coolness, and somehow he makes it looks sexy and endearing.

There is no doubt that Depp is an exceptional talent and he has been pulling off great performances on the big screen for decades. He has embodied some of the most iconic characters from ""Edward Scissorhands"" to Captain Jack Sparrow. However, even though Depp has a reputation for being one of the most talented actors in the business, he has also built a long list of celebs who can‚Äôt stand him. So, who are these celebs who are not fans of the talented Johnny Deep? We have the deets.

Summary from NYT:

For months after the shooting death of Ahmaud Arbery, a 25-year-old black man who was pursued by armed white residents of a coastal South Georgia neighborhood, no arrests were made. But after an article by The New York Times, the release of a video of the February confrontation, and increased attention from lawmakers, celebrities and civil rights activists, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation stepped in.  The police arrested two men, Gregory McMichael and his son Travis McMichael, on Thursday and charged them with murder and aggravated assault in the killing of Mr. Arbery. The state agency said Travis McMichael had fired the fatal shots. Days before the arrests, a video that appears to show the deadly struggle between Mr. Arbery and one of his pursuers went viral. The same day, the prosecutor handling the case, Tom Durden of Georgia‚Äôs Atlantic Judicial Circuit, said that a grand jury should decide whether criminal charges are warranted for the people involved in Mr. Arbery‚Äôs death.

[Sofia: Just what? The Rompkins made you their queen, and they need you. You know it's the right thing to do.]
[Amber: I want to help him, to help everyone here, but Sofia... I'm not sure I can. I'm starting to think there's a reason why you get to be story keeper, and have a special amulet, and I don't.]

Amber:
Every day I watch you give your all to those in need
Every place we go you make things better with your good deeds
You're the one who saves the day of that, there's no doubt
You're so strong, a natural hero inside and out

But that's not who I am
Though it makes my heart break
That's not who I am
I don't have what it takes

So today I caused Nothing but trouble, can't you see
Every place we've gone I've been thinking only of me
I'm the one who let harm come To all our new friends
I was wrong to think that I'm brave, It was all just pretend

'Cause that's not who I am
Though it makes my heart break
That's not who I am
I don't have what it takes

[Sofia: But that's not true, Amber. There's so many times I've seen you do the right thing.]
[Amber: You have?]
[Sofia: Yes. You rescued Dad and James from the jade jaguar. You went after Mom when you thought she was taken by Selians. You even helped fix Clio and Hildegard's friendship.
[Amber: I guess there were times when I put others first.]
[Sofia: Yes. You do have it in you, Amber.]

Sofia:
You're the one I've counted on to stand by my side
You're so strong, a natural hero when you reach deep inside

'Cause that's just who you are
We all make mistakes
That's just who you are
You've got what it takes

Amber:
Yes, that is who I am
I'll fix my mistakes
And I'll come through, do all I'm meant to do

So today I caused Nothing but trouble, can't you see
Every place we've gone I've been thinking only of me
I'm the one who let harm come To all our new friends
I was wrong to think that I'm brave, It was all just pretend

'Cause that's not who I am
Though it makes my heart break
That's not who I am
I don't have what it takes

[Sofia: But that's not true, Amber. There's so many times I've seen you do the right thing.]
[Amber: You have?]
[Sofia: Yes. You rescued Dad and James from the jade jaguar. You went after Mom when you thought she was taken by Selians. You even helped fix Clio and Hildegard's friendship.
[Amber: I guess there were times when I put others first.]
[Sofia: Yes. You do have it in you, Amber.]

Sofia:
You're the one I've counted on to stand by my side
You're so strong, a natural hero when you reach deep inside

'Cause that's just who you are
We all make mistakes
That's just who you are
You've got what it takes

Amber:
Yes, that is who I am
I'll fix my mistakes
And I'll come through, do all I'm meant to do
'Cause that is who I am",en,PT3M6S,2d,hd,false,False,rectangular,processed,public,youtube,True,True,True,1295594,8940,388,0,0,,,

Johnny Depp vs. Amber Heard: Auch diese Stars spielen auch eine Rolle   Schlammschlacht geht weiter   ¬†Derzeit l√§uft der Prozess in der Auseinandersetzung zwischen Schauspieler Johnny Depp (57) und der britischen Boulevardzeitung ""The Sun"" vor einem Gericht in London. Depp wehrt sich gegen einen Artikel, in dem seine Ex-Frau Amber Heard (34) schwere Vorw√ºrfe gegen ihn erhoben hat und er unter anderem als ""Ehefrauenschl√§ger"" bezeichnet wurde. Er bestreitet die Vorw√ºrfe. In seiner US-Heimat hat der Schauspieler Heard zudem wegen Verleumdung verklagt. In den ersten Prozesstagen in London sowie in den ersten Zeugenaussagen im Verleumdungsprozess wurden einige pikante Details ihrer gescheiterten Ehe zutage bef√∂rdert. Dabei wurden auch einige prominente Namen genannt. Wir nennen alle Prominamen, die in den¬†Rosenkrieg involviert waren oder sind.  Tesla-Chef Elon Musk & Model Cara Delevingne  ¬†Josh Drew, der Ex-Mann von Heards bester Freundin Raquel ""Rocky"" Pennington (31) hatte im Juni im Verleumdungsprozess ausgesagt und Heard eine Aff√§re mit Tesla-Chef Elon Musk (49) und Model Cara Delevingne (27) unterstellt, die noch vor der Scheidung zwischen Depp und Heard gelaufen sein soll. Laut der britischen ""Mail Online"" hat Drew auf die Frage hin, ob Pennington ihm gegen√ºber je erw√§hnt habe, dass es eine Aff√§re mit Musk gab, mit ""Ja"" geantwortet. Auf die Nachfrage, ob Heard auch einen Dreier mit Musk und Delevingne gehabt habe, soll Drew erkl√§rt haben: ""Meinem Verst√§ndnis nach, ja."" Musk hatte daraufhin in einem Statement gegen√ºber ""Page Six"" erkl√§rt: ""Cara und ich sind Freunde, aber wir waren nie intim. [...] Au√üerdem m√∂chte ich noch einmal betonen, dass Amber und ich erst ungef√§hr einen Monat nach ihrer Scheidung angefangen haben, auszugehen.""   Schauspieler James Franco  ¬†Am zweiten Prozesstag in London kam eine angebliche Aff√§re von Amber Heard mit Schauspieler James Franco (42) zur Sprache. Depp soll Heard 2014 auf einem Flug von Boston nach Los Angeles auf die Aff√§re angesprochen haben und die Schauspielerin verbal attackiert haben. Depp bestritt laut ""Mail Online"" in einer Aussage die Attacke und betonte in Bezug auf seine Ex-Frau: ""Das ist ein gutes St√ºck ihrer Vorstellungskraft."" Er habe sich nur um Heard gesorgt, die ihren Kollegen als ""gruselig und aufdringlich"" beschrieben habe. Heard stand mit Franco f√ºr den Film ""The Adderall Diaries"" vor der Kamera.   Kult-Star Elton John  ¬†√úber Musik-Ikone Elton John (73) hat Johnny Depp hingegen nur Gutes zu berichten. Am ersten Prozesstag in London offenbarte der Schauspieler, dass der S√§nger ihm nach der Trennung von seiner langj√§hrigen Lebensgef√§hrtin Vanessa Paradis (47) aus der Drogensucht geholfen habe.

Hollywood star Johnny Depp has been booted off the Fantastic Beasts film franchise after he was branded a ‚Äúwife beater‚Äù in the High Court this week. 

A judge found on Monday that Depp had repeatedly beaten ex-wife Amber Heard during their five-year romance, punching and headbutting her in bouts of verbal and physical abuse while drunk and on drugs. 

Depp, 57, has vowed to appeal the career-wrecking ruling, but revealed in a social media post today that he is leaving the Harry Potter spin-off series.

‚ÄúI wish to let you know that I have been asked to resign by Warner Bros. from my role as Grindelwald in Fantastic Beasts and I have respected and agreed to that‚Äù, he said in a typed statement shared on Instagram.

I've got your first look at the trailer for Paranoia!
Liam Hemsworth gets down and dirty (literally and figuratively) in the new trailer for Paranoia, and OMG, it looks amazing.
Check out the intense thriller's trailer, and stay tuned for more details.
Intense, right!?
As you saw, Liam Hemsworth is the main character in the movie‚Äîhe plays Adam Cassidy, a blue collar worker who's desperate to help his sick dad.
He gets twisted into a dark world of corporate greed, where he's hired by Gary Oldman's character to find out secrets about Harrison Ford's character. Before he knows it, Liam's character is caught in the middle of a high-stakes war between both guys.
Amber Heard plays Liam's love interest, and judging by the steaminess we saw in the trailer, we're gonna see a good amount of sexy time throughout the film.
Paranoia will explode into theatres on August 16th.
Take it the comments section now and let me know if you'll be seeing Paranoia this summer, and if you think this could be Liam best movie yet!?

The fate of Amber Heard is one that many in Hollywood and beyond are curious to talk about. Mainly for the reason that right now her place is very much balancing on a razor‚Äôs edge. In recent times she has been hailed as a strong actress but also been noted by many as being abusive and lying about everything that went on in her relationship with Johnny Depp. To the extent that some are trying to get her kicked out of Hollywood. And that‚Äôs why many think she should just quit and go away. We‚Äôll break it down for you. Be sure to like the video and subscribe to the channel!

The rumors suggesting Amber Heard has been fired from¬†Aquaman 2 have been debunked. Heard plays¬†Xebellian princess Mera in the DCEU, ever since her first appearance in 2017's¬†Justice League. She went on to have a prominent role in 2018's¬†Aquaman and will reprise the part next month for¬†Zack Snyder's Justice League. Additionally, Heard is expected to return for¬†Aquaman 2, which will once again star Jason Momoa as the titular hero and is slated for release in December 2022. Plot details are still being kept under wraps, and filming is expected to begin this summer. On Sunday, unverified reports of Heard being fired from¬†Aquaman 2¬†emerged online and led the actress to trend on social media. This is hardly the first time rumors of Heard's firing have spread, seemingly stemming from her brutal and public battle with ex-husband Johnny Depp. Both Depp and Heard have contested the other was physically and verbally abusive during their relationship. In the fall, Depp was fired from Warner Bros.'¬†Fantastic Beasts franchise, which led to fan outcry online. Depp's departure also caused some to wonder why Heard wasn't receiving the same fate.

THR staff writer Ryan Parker took to social media to state he's been told by a ""reliable source"" that the reports of Heard's alleged firing are ""inaccurate."" Parker offered up no further information. As the initial rumors regarding Heard being fired did not stem from a reputable source, it isn't surprising they're being debunked now. Oftentimes, stories of certain actors either being cast or let go from projects will take on a life of their own on the internet, but they end up being untrue. Heard and¬†Aquaman 2 is an interesting case, in that the controversy surrounding the actress could very well result in some changes, similar to Depp's situation with¬†Fantastic Beasts. However, as it stands right now, Heard will continue to play Mera in the DCEU. This news will likely be met with a great deal of mixed reactions. Those who stand by Heard will be relieved to hear she's still a part of¬†Aquaman 2, while others who think Heard is the aggressor in her relationship with Depp will be displeased. A petition calling for Heard's removal from¬†Aquaman 2 gained traction in December and crossed one million signatures, signaling there are some who would like to see her fired.

No one wants to wind up being thrown out of Her Majesty‚Äôs dinner party, so you should remember the rules if you want to avoid making a royal fool of yourself. By the way, let‚Äôs just assume right here that burping or some other release of gas is forbidden, so we‚Äôll stick to the main ones.

Did you know, for example, that using French words is considered impolite when speaking with the Queen, or any member of the royal family? Of course, breaking the rules of etiquette probably won‚Äôt get you thrown into the Tower of London in chains, or even out on the street, you should be on your best behavior if you want your royal rendezvous to go smoothly.

Animation is created by Bright Side.

SUMMARY:
- You might think you look good in your tee shirt and jean shorts, and it might even be true, but that kind of outfit would get you thrown out of even the least formal royal gathering. 
- Everybody likes presents, and the Queen is no exception. The practice of presenting the Monarch with a gift is a tradition going back centuries, and respecting it is a great way to get on Her Majesty‚Äôs good side.
- Have you ever wanted just to run up and give somebody a hug? Most of the time there‚Äôs no harm done, but when it comes to royalty, you‚Äôre better off keeping your hands to yourself. 
- The correct way to greet Her Majesty is with a formal bow or curtsy. Don‚Äôt worry, no one‚Äôs expecting you to hurl yourself at the floor. Men are expected to bow from the shoulders, just lowering their heads out of respect. 
- It‚Äôs very improper to get up and leave without permission, or to arrive late. But quite frankly, that‚Äôs just good ‚Äòol fashioned manners. 
- Before speaking to the Queen, it‚Äôs important to take note of where exactly you‚Äôve been seated. As a rule, the guest of honor will be seated directly to the Queen‚Äôs right, and it‚Äôs customary for Her Majesty to address them first. In general, it‚Äôs considered good form to let the Queen begin the conversation anyway. 
- You might be super curious to hear the truth about some royal family drama, but the Queen is definitely the wrong person to be hassling with personal questions. 
- While there have been some instances of fellow monarchs addressing one another on a first-name basis, unless you‚Äôre King Harold of Norway, you shouldn‚Äôt even think about addressing The Queen by her name.   
- Another thing that‚Äôs important to remember is that when speaking with the Queen, or any member of the royal family for that matter, it‚Äôs considered impolite to use French words.

No one wants to wind up being thrown out of Her Majesty‚Äôs dinner party, so you should remember the rules if you want to avoid making a royal fool of yourself. By the way, let‚Äôs just assume right here that burping or some other release of gas is forbidden, so we‚Äôll stick to the main ones.

Did you know, for example, that using French words is considered impolite when speaking with the Queen, or any member of the royal family? Of course, breaking the rules of etiquette probably won‚Äôt get you thrown into the Tower of London in chains, or even out on the street, you should be on your best behavior if you want your royal rendezvous to go smoothly.

SUMMARY:
- You might think you look good in your tee shirt and jean shorts, and it might even be true, but that kind of outfit would get you thrown out of even the least formal royal gathering. 
- Everybody likes presents, and the Queen is no exception. The practice of presenting the Monarch with a gift is a tradition going back centuries, and respecting it is a great way to get on Her Majesty‚Äôs good side.
- Have you ever wanted just to run up and give somebody a hug? Most of the time there‚Äôs no harm done, but when it comes to royalty, you‚Äôre better off keeping your hands to yourself. 
- The correct way to greet Her Majesty is with a formal bow or curtsy. Don‚Äôt worry, no one‚Äôs expecting you to hurl yourself at the floor. Men are expected to bow from the shoulders, just lowering their heads out of respect. 
- It‚Äôs very improper to get up and leave without permission, or to arrive late. But quite frankly, that‚Äôs just good ‚Äòol fashioned manners. 
- Before speaking to the Queen, it‚Äôs important to take note of where exactly you‚Äôve been seated. As a rule, the guest of honor will be seated directly to the Queen‚Äôs right, and it‚Äôs customary for Her Majesty to address them first. In general, it‚Äôs considered good form to let the Queen begin the conversation anyway. 
- You might be super curious to hear the truth about some royal family drama, but the Queen is definitely the wrong person to be hassling with personal questions. 
- While there have been some instances of fellow monarchs addressing one another on a first-name basis, unless you‚Äôre King Harold of Norway, you shouldn‚Äôt even think about addressing The Queen by her name.   
- Another thing that‚Äôs important to remember is that when speaking with the Queen, or any member of the royal family for that matter, it‚Äôs considered impolite to use French words.

Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been on the news for a while over their several court cases regarding their divorce and still there is no clear verdict about who is right and who is wrong. But now there has been a new development regarding the evidence: body cam footage from the Los Angeles police department (LAPD) officers who responded to the 911 call. And this  evidence seems to change the direction of the case. So, what was on the bodycam footage and why it could change the whole case?

Nobody expected this was coming but Johnny Depp's attorneys claim that never-before-seen body cam footage from the Los Angeles police department (LAPD) officers who responded to the second of two 911 calls proves that Johnny Depp wasn‚Äôt the violent one in the altercation with his ex-wife. Moreover, it might be final proof that Amber Heard lied about the alleged brawl that took place in May 2016.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
When Josey (Charlize Theron) is heckled by the men in the crowd, her father Hank (Richard Jenkins) steps in to stand up for her.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
A fictionalized account of one of America's most groundbreaking sexual harassment lawsuits comes to the screen in this hard-hitting drama. In the late '80s, Josey Aimes (Charlize Theron) fled her abusive husband, and needed to find a way to support her two children. Aimes returned to her hometown in Minnesota and followed the lead of her old friend Glory (Frances McDormand), who had bucked tradition and found a job in the iron mines that had long provided employment for much of the community. Aimes found honest labor and a living wage working the mines, but she also discovered she was working with men who were uncomfortable working with women (whose right to work in the mines had been mandated by law almost 15 years prior), and didn't care to show them much respect. However, as Aimes found herself the growing target of sexist jokes and abhorrent behavior, she found that many of her female co-workers were reluctant to stand beside her, afraid of losing a good-paying job at a time when they were increasingly hard to find. But as a personal crisis became a public war of words, Aimes became the center of a nationwide controversy when she attempted to file a class action sexual harassment suit against the mine owners, which put her and her family in a position of scrutiny beyond her worst expectations. North Country also stars Sean Bean, Sissy Spacek, and Woody Harrelson.

‚ÄúI Stand Amazed‚Äù lyrics:

I stand amazed in the presence
Of Jesus the Nazarene
And wonder how He could love me
A sinner, condemned, unclean

How marvelous, how wonderful
And my song shall ever be
How marvelous, how wonderful
Is my Savior's love for me

He took my sins and my sorrows
He made them His very own
He bore the burden to Calvary
And suffered and died alone

How marvelous, how wonderful
And my song shall ever be
How marvelous, how wonderful
Is my Savior's love for me

When with the ransomed in glory
His face I at last shall see
'Twill be my joy through the ages
To sing of His love for me

How marvelous, how wonderful
And my song shall ever be
How marvelous, how wonderful
Is my Savior's love for me

How marvelous, how wonderful
And my song shall ever be
How marvelous, how wonderful
Is my Savior's love for me

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber 
Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

We gonna make the girls dance

I ain‚Äôt lookin‚Äô for enemies
But I ain‚Äôt playin‚Äô nice
The way you testing me and look me in the eyes
Want some of my own candy
I love to see you try
Ain't nothing real about the way you look tonight

'Cause I know in the morning
You'll be wakin‚Äô up all alone
Posing all over your story
With nothing to hold but your phone
You got it bad all over your head
Are you upset

You think that you cool
But you ain‚Äôt got a crown
Be watchin' and learning 'cause I show you how
Lookin at me like you want my man

What the f**k

Ain't lookin for drama
Promise I'm not gonna compete
So keep on movin 'cause you got nothing on me

What you know about karma
Oh I heard she ain‚Äôt so sweet (yeah so sweet)
Get your self out of the club
If you can‚Äôt take the heat

'Cause I know in the morning
You'll be wakin‚Äô up all alone
Posing all over your story
With nothing to hold but your phone
You got it bad all over your head
Are you upset?

You think that you cool
But you ain‚Äôt got a crown
Be watchin' and learning 'cause I show you how
Lookin at me like you want my man

As she explained to Vanity Fair, she wanted the part back in 1994, when Stephen King‚Äôs epic was first getting the miniseries treatment at ABC, though the role eventually went to Ruby Dee. Mother Abagail is the 108-year old prophet who, thanks to her line of communication with God, becomes the unifying force behind the Boulder Free Zone, a community of peaceful apocalypse survivors. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been fighting with not making her the Magic Negro because she‚Äôs complicated,‚Äù Goldberg said, a longtime fan of King‚Äô work. She‚Äôs part of a sprawling cast of stars assembled to bring the author‚Äôs best-selling novel to life yet again‚Äîthis time as a nine-episode miniseries for CBS All Access‚Äîwhich (with King‚Äôs blessing) looks to update the classic tale of good versus evil for a modern audience. During a virtual press junket ahead of The Stand‚Äôs premiere, The A.V. Club was given the opportunity to speak with Goldberg and her co-stars about the legacies of their iconic characters; Greg Kinnear, Jovan Adepo, Amber Heard, Nat Wolff, Odessa Young, Katherine McNamara, and James Marsden all weighed in on what it means to step into these well-known roles, and shared how they hope to highlight different shades to King‚Äôs work.

The Stand premieres on CBS All Access on December 17, and will air new episodes weekly ever Thursday.

Although it is true the actual shop ""Orange County Choppers"" is still open and functioning, the show ""American Chopper"" has ended. You WON'T believe what happened behind the scenes! The show was set for the 13th season but the last episode ""The Last Ride"" pretty much sums it up. The show had a good run and we'll be sad to see them go.

Lyrics:

Seems like just yesterday
You were a part of me
I used to stand so tall
I used to be so strong
Your arms around me tight
Everything, it felt so right
Unbreakable, like nothin' could go wrong
Now I can't breathe
No, I can't sleep
I'm barely hanging on

Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry

Johnny's Depp's ex-wife Amber Heard gives a statement outside the Royal Courts of Justice in London, on the last day of his libel case against The Sun newspaper.

She said: ‚ÄúI travelled here to the UK to testify as a witness to assist the court.
