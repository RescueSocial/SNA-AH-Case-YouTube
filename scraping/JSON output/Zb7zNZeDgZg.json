One would think that she&#39;d quickly donate and call it a day, but I doubt she has enough left to make the donation...designer clothes and nights out on the town being vastly more appealing than buying medical equipment.

Amber Heard and people like her will no longer rely on the opposite gender for money, they will have to rely on their talent and looks. Looks fade, it&#39;s easy to be beautiful when your a teenager or 20s, but they fade, and then you have your talent, I&#39;m thinking Jodi Foster, an extremely attractive, talented, slightly older lady. In Amber&#39;s case, that talent is mediocre at best. Mediocre talent and fading looks, I have a feeling Amber&#39;s days are numbered. She attacked an incredibly loved and respected actor. He lost contracts because of her actions. She united the different people around the globe in the revulsion felt towards her attitude in using Johnny and we will probably find more about if she treated Elon Musk any differently.<br>I still have no desire to see Amber in Aquaman or any movie she is in.",

If that's the case, that's low. I Kno the pay difference between male and female is different in favor of the male, but that gap is becoming narrower and narrower each year. Amber Heard and people like her will no longer rely on the opposite gender for money, they will have to rely on their talent and looks. Looks fade, it's easy to be beautiful when your a teenager or 20s, but they fade, and then you have your talent, I'm thinking Jodi Foster, an extremely attractive, talented, slightly older lady. In Amber's case, that talent is mediocre at best. Mediocre talent and fading looks, I have a feeling Amber's days are numbered. She attacked an incredibly loved and respected actor. He lost contracts because of her actions. She united the different people around the globe in the revulsion felt towards her attitude in using Johnny and we will probably find more about if she treated Elon Musk any differently.\nI still have no desire to see Amber in Aquaman or any movie she is in.",
