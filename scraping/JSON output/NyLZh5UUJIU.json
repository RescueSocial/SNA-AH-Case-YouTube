In that picture she&#39;s had a buccal fat removal done, but that was a good choice because it made her the beauty she was on The Rum Diary.

After the buccal fat was removed, her facial structure &quot;came out&quot; and her cheekbones looked more prominent and her lower face was more &quot;feminine&quot; and smaller.. Then she propably got carried away with the plastic surgery and had nose jobs (which were very nicely done, very subtle), then upper lip lift which was completely unnecessary and if you watch some of her interviews now, you can see that her upper lip moves strangely when she speaks, so she might have suffered from some nerve damage in that procedure..
