There are photos from his body guards of bruises and cigarette burns, and of course there was the incident in which she severed the top of his finger on his right hand (he&#39;s a guitarist so losing his finger is a big deal), crushed the bone and he contracted MRSA 3 times.  Amber&#39;s sister told her friends that Amber was the abuser and Amber was the one who pushed the sister down the stairs, not Johnny.  There is no real evidence that Johnny abused Amber.  Her &quot;evidence&quot; doesn&#39;t hold up to scrutiny; her stories aren&#39;t consistent - which is a major red flag.  Johnny may be at fault for not leaving the relationship earlier -- he left her after she pooped in his bed, she just got to court first because she expected him to file - but she is the one who told lies to the public to ruin his reputation which caused him to lose movies.  Frankly, as a victim of abuse myself, I am very angry that an abuser has stepped in the role of spokesperson for victims of abuse.  It is a very common tactic for abusers to step forward ahead of the victim and claim the victim role and that&#39;s what Amber did.  She glommed onto the metoo movement and now she speaks about DV when she was the abuser.  That all by itself makes her a con artist.  I don&#39;t want to be represented by an abuser.  She has nothing to say about abuse that any real victim of abuse wants to hear.  She is being used by organizations who want a &quot;victim&quot; to speak out, but it&#39;s false, phony and insincere to have a female abuser represent female victims.  Shame on the UN and the ACLU for using an abuser as a spokesperson.  Shame, shame, shame on them.",

As I&#39;ve repeated and iterated many times here, I am reading the cards and channelling the messages. Abuse can take many different forms - verbal, mental, emotional, financial, spiritual and of course physical. Some easier to prove than others. What I&#39;ve iterated in the comments before and I&#39;ll iterate it again is the overall message of this reading which is, when you get caught in the web of a toxic person, in this case Amber and you don&#39;t pull yourself out early enough, they can take you down a road and a path that can cause you to act out of your character and in the worse way. Is Johnny&#39;s energy an abusive person? NO but every one has a dark side. He got with someone that lowered his energy vibration and pulled out the worse in him. That&#39;s why I say this is a very nuanced reading. This is the point of my channel. I want us to go beyond the headlines, to dig beneath the surface to give a spiritual perspective on the energies and intentions of what is taking place. You mentioned Johnny should have left earlier. So let&#39;s dig deeper into the consequences of what not leaving looks like?! Not leaving looks like the energy that Johnny is in and that&#39;s my point. This is the cautionary tale I want viewers to leave with - recognise toxic tricks and protect your energy or else.... Alot of this reading has been proven fact but the message of this reading is the reason why it&#39;s been proven fact. This is where your fantastic points come in. Firstly, on a personal note, from one abuse victim to another, I empathise with you as I myself have been through every form of abuse listed above and more to your point, have not been believed. People don&#39;t take the time to dig deeper into another&#39;s perspective or below the surface of a narrative as they don&#39;t like uncomfortable truths This in turn leads to abusers (as you rightly pointed out) being able to use convincing surface tactics such as reconstructing truths, moving the goal posts and as in the case of Amber, wearing the false cloak of victim. So how do we win?! How does the truth win? How do abusers such as ourselves finally win and get our voice heard? By sharing perspectives as we&#39;re doing here, having the courage to create space to heal and part of that healing looks like digging deeper into the spirit energy and psychi of the abuser to understand how they think, to recognise the red flags through the situations they perpetuate and to know what to avoid to protect your energy, spirit and light. I hope this makes sense. \ud83d\udd4a\ufe0f",
                        "textOriginal": "Hi  Been There. Thank you for taking the time to view this reading and comment. As I've repeated and iterated many times here, I am reading the cards and channelling the messages. Abuse can take many different forms - verbal, mental, emotional, financial, spiritual and of course physical. Some easier to prove than others. What I've iterated in the comments before and I'll iterate it again is the overall message of this reading which is, when you get caught in the web of a toxic person, in this case Amber and you don't pull yourself out early enough, they can take you down a road and a path that can cause you to act out of your character and in the worse way. Is Johnny's energy an abusive person? NO but every one has a dark side. He got with someone that lowered his energy vibration and pulled out the worse in him.

His wife had dinner parties with amber and her lawyer and the lawyer co wrote a book with judge nicol. Johnny sadly never had a chance. He was denied bringing up new evidence because it &quot;wasnt relevant&quot;. Its sad that the media run stories to fit a narrative. Amber has many people who speak badly of her and her attitude. She is a bully and very rude. There is a clip of her beibg asked to speak on behalf of gay youth who committ suicide and to bring awareness. When she spoke about a families child she was very inappropriate and laughed. She even made the individual who spoke beside her on the topic uncomfortable. I understand not many people truly follow whats happening but i thought you should know just to give perspective.",
