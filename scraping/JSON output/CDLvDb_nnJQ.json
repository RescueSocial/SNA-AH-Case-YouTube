That question used to scare me to death because according to worlds standards it&#39;s crazy that a guy my age has never done that. This also goes along with the Matthew Kelly book I&#39;m reading about the seven levels of intimacy. I really like this part when he talks about how we are often afraid that people won&#39;t like us for who we truly are, so we portray ourselves as someone we are not in hopes that they will like us.
