She did not care. He was supposed to stop what he was doing and pay attention to her, cater to her. That was not going to happen. About a month or so later I ran into him. He was all smiles. I was all smiles once he told me he had dumped the clinger. He was a great guy and if she hadn&#39;t been a whining clinger she might have had herself a wonderful and caring man. IMHO, Amber is a complete fool. She had the type of man that so many of us women would love to find --- a nice guy who is known for being kind and gentle.

I\u2019m completely baffled! This is the most ridiculous thing I\u2019ve ever heard and seen! She is nothing but a complete and total psychopath who gets off on ruining the lives of anyone who dare try to get her out of their lives!
