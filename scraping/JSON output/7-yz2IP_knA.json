You don&#39;t beat on family members if you care about them and their safety.  I think that everything she did to Johnny, after he had been so kind, generous and good to her is disgusting.

She needs to finally come forward and publicly admit the truth about everything she did to him and take measures to clear his name, help restore his career, make restitution, especially since she created all the drama &amp; fiction that caused him so much grief in the first place!  She  needs to be honest in a court of law and accept the consequences.  Accountability, truthfulness, integrity and justice are all sacred &amp; she didn&#39;t respect any of those things.  She showed a lot of disrespect for the judge and court hearing process by eating, lying, making faces at questions she didn&#39;t like and not paying attention.  I find her to be an utterly detestable woman!  Just monstrous!  Warner comes in a very close second on the reprehensibility meter for their part in hurting Johnny.

I&#39;m sorry, perhaps because I&#39;ve been through this, that&#39;s how I know but watching Johnny gain weight and let her words define him (calling him fat old man)should be a large clue as to what&#39;s going on.
