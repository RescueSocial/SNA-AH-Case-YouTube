How is this still a question on who\u2019s the abuser?! How has this case not been solved? How is her career thriving while his is ending? ALL of his ex\u2019s came forward to tell everyone that JD was NEVER abusive to them and always kind! HOW with ALL of this proof, is she still the victim?! How has she not LOST the case yet?! I\u2019m completely baffled! This is the most ridiculous thing I\u2019ve ever heard and seen! She is nothing but a complete and total psychopath who gets off on ruining the lives of anyone who dare try to get her out of their lives! She not only gets off on it, but absolutely loves watching her lies destroy innocent people! She has no regard for anyone\u2019s life but her own! If it were possible for her to get away with, she would have killed him and even then with the way this BS case is going she might have gotten away with that too!!! She\u2019s absolutely loving this!

She deserves to lose everything and more! Someone needs to beat her a$$! She is an absolute disgusting, waste of flesh, oxygen, and space who needs to be taken down! She cannot just do this to a beloved, innocent, kind man! Johnny\u2019s only fault was marrying this POS! She is a truly horrifying psychopath who now knows she can get away with something this disturbing so this makes her even more dangerous! <b>FUTURE VICTIMS BEWARE</b> because there are absolutely going to be more victims! Please for the love of god someone take her down and give her a taste of her own psychotic medicine!!! Take her down before she can do this to anyone else! She has been proven to be a big fat liar many times! She says herself how she got the bruises painted on her face to screw him over! She\u2019s disgustingly toxic and manipulates him into thinking he\u2019s at fault too! She MADE herself seem irresistible to him, made him think she was the \u201cperfect woman\u201d, LIED her way into the relationship, manipulated him into the relationship, she NEVER loved him, she\u2019s incapable of loving anyone but herself. She pretended to love him to get him to marry her! I know women like her, I have seen exactly this situation many times, psychotic women who try to ruin a mans life when the man gets tired of them and tries to leave the relationship and these psychotic women WILL NOT just LET them leave the relationship OH NO how dare they try to leave them, they will PAY for it, I\u2019ve seen them literally hit themselves in the face and then call the cops and blame the man, getting him arrested and then try to turn around and get him back by manipulating him into thinking it was his fault too! She tried to make herself seem innocent and sweet during interviews about the \u201cabuse\u201d she\u2019s SO despicable, dangerous, disgusting, a lying tw@$, everything about her SCREAMS abusive liar, fake, psychotic, who needs to be heavily medicated and locked in a padded cell!
