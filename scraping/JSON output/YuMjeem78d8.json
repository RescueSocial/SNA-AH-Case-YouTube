I feel like it was put in the third film as sort of a &quot;get-out-of-jail free&quot; card for Spidey&#39;s identity, instead of doing a smaller, more personal film about the struggles of his double life and all that jazz. <br><br>I also do think we&#39;ll see some good stuff in the college films. This is also just a general problem I sorta had with the writing in the MCU, but I hope Im proven wrong, and if I&#39;m not, itll be a good time at least! Also the shape Jacob Batalon has gotten into!",
