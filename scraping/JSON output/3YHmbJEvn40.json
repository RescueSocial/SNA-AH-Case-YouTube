He was legitimately honing his craft to deadly sharpness... the dude could wrap himself into characters in such an incredibly embraced capacity, that you couldnt even see the normal depp, he would become unrecognizable in such a talentful way, in a way that 98% of actors can only dream of...

Which was crazy too, i didnt know it was him till after the movie.... I mean even like JD playing willy wonka, lol.. how in the hell is that Johnny Depp.. or edward scissor hands, grindlewald, and even his character in fear and loathing.. Hes quite possibly the best actor of our generation... He doesnt just act like himself going through these emotions the character would feel throughout the script... he creates a new persona, a split personality so genuine, its wild.. And honestly kinda humbling... Hes not just being his recognizable self, to build himself up in the publics eye, and make his personality even more recognizable to the public... He does things that sometimes people wont even realize is him... for example Grindlewald.. Lol like HL playing Joker,  i didnt even know that was him till AFTER i watched the movie and learned that it was him.. and i had to rewatch it to do a double take.. blew my mind man.. How do you shed yourself in a way that your normal self is completely dissolved...",
