                    "textDisplay": "I still stand with head, but the whole truth and nothing but the truth will come out. If she&#39;s brave enough to confess, believe me that this is not over and Johnny is next. He will face the harsh truth and confess his sins as well. Remember no one is perfect. There will be evidence real proven evidence on Johnny over his crimes over her. She is facing her karma is she not!? People will find out that 70% of what she reported against him is true. Both hands are dirty oh yes. Someone in the background is handling the couple I assure you of that. Immediately as she reported against him. They been trying to control her even more. She&#39;s a tough one and if she&#39;s willing to lie to be free from such a toxic abuse one can never be free from without God&#39;s help. I&#39;m telling you it&#39;s time for truth. She realized that to free her self is to be fully honest no lies just the truth nothing but the truth. She confessed what still shows that she still stands by the fact that she was abused aswell. So if people are willing to let Johnny go because she confessed then people you are idiots and hypocrites you&#39;re too blind and naive. Don&#39;t you see it. She has left it all to God. What unfolds, unfolds and let truth shine. It&#39;s time for Johnny to confess. Let the truth flow and you&#39;ll see. Fans won&#39;t and will never know what they want from these two, fired or kept rolling. They are both guilty. And yet people demand and petition that head be gone for good. What world is this. You&#39;re basically giving an execution to an individual. If you&#39;re too blind to see it then you need to taste the waters you&#39;re in. It&#39;s simple really, if Amber goes Johnny goes if she stays, Johnny stays. Fair is fair. Not fair when one leaves and one stays. They&#39;re both guilty no!? I mean it&#39;s the opposite way, Johnny stays Amber stays, Johnny leaves Amber leaves. And you all are going to hate Aquaman 2 either way with Amber gone or not I promise you. You will hate it, one because you saw Amber reprising her role, second if she doesn&#39;t and Emilia takes the role, the movie does horribly bad and you hate it. But I can tell you this. The movie does so well and great but people hating it because Amber is in there. A man does a poor job a very very poor job in the white house but no one petitions. You march and protest leading to death and destruction and chaos. Choosing ways that lead to violence but you ain&#39;t gonna March for couples making more money than your puny presidents and its not just the white house but every other money loving president. And yet thry can never receive the attention celebrities get, which they seek to control them because they earn more than they do. And it&#39;s true. You know it&#39;s true deny the truth knowing it scares you because you been yip yapping about Hollywood protecting Amber. Did you ever come to think all these Actors and actresses are puppets. Like us some audiences been warning all of you that some of these Actresses are more puppets than the males ones. Males too. But what drives Hollywood further is the females. When they seek help to be free from these suckers control you all start supporting the offenders the accused with evidence. And if the accused is willing to squeeze everyone to shut the victim up they will. If the victim is willing to lie to be free to gain their soul back they will. But when they see it does nothing but escalate the problem they will and must confess for the lies but the truth of the crimes of the accused still stands. Talk about being woke and yet non of you still understand poop crap and I mean sh** period. Still gotta a lot to learn what goes on in Hollywood and it&#39;s ally shadow places. You think Hollywood is the only place. Oh please. And you thought you understood Dave Shappelle. He even says you can never be woke enough. The devil can make you side with him and you can&#39;t even tell its devil. That includes me. Until it&#39;s too late and the door is slam shut. You all need to see with your heart soul and spirit. See with the eyes of God not mortal man. Anyone would lie to be free. She&#39;s not the only one. You&#39;re all hypocrites sad you dhould be ashamed of yourselves. Hell I was when I felt hate inside me for her. And I realized nothing makes me anyway how different from her. She&#39;s no better than me or you and neither am I better or greater or lesser than her. The one and only difference is the quality of life we both have I don&#39;t care about the pockets obviously. But the moral the humanity the selflessness the bravery the love. We all are and always will be equal despite the differences that makes us unequal. When all that does not matter no more, that equally will blossom and we will see better than before and now presently. I don&#39;t that she lied on some accounts because that tarnishes her innocence. But we all have have to forgive and move on. No one is no different. So drop the BS and judge yourself piss off and stop trying to act like your better than her. No one is no one will ever be because she is no better than us either. Remember we are equal. What makes us different is the darkness jealous of the great light you carry inside you so you&#39;d never tap into it. Feel it use it. Man you all need to let go forgive her. But non of you want to believe Johnny did something wrong. Is he a good man who am I to judge. Has he done good things yeah so is Amber. But I will not glorify him like he is the most perfect man on earth like he is worthy God or angel I cannot stand by and say Amber is an Angel and a sweet perfect woman. If I do. Then we all are angels. Angels who can&#39;t seem to get it right. We ate the fallen angels who cannot ascend to their original form. Leave her be let her be this Beautiful woman she has been pursuing to become. A great obstacle came upon her. In my eyes. She&#39;s reaching for that goel to become a better person a better human being and thats why she inspires me, cause no one is perfect and if she&#39;s willing to face the beautiful truth to be free, free from evil corruption control sedition all sorts of darkness. The way I see itwe all are evil consumed by it. It&#39;s the light in you that keeps you in check and in balance with all good that lives and exists. With no light in us, this world would have been totally and completely consumed by perversion. Look around you this world is highly perverted. And it&#39;s at a tipping point between life and death. There is great knowledge awaiting for us. But we will never reach it with such nonsense. Let her be. Forgive her and move on. Period.",
