AH is the eldest and maybe felt as a child that grown-ups don&#39;t make a fuss about being abused (her mum) and those in charge are abusers (her dad), which might explain why she called Johnny a baby a lot, (like her sister). Johnny was the youngest, (like Whitney) and I wonder about his other siblings. Also in Johnny&#39;s case there were more siblings and a single parent. Johnny also had a guitar at a young age allowing him to focus on something else (escape). Maybe if you have an escape, you have more oxytocin? Amber was most likely a fighter and fought back for control and respect in her family. Perhaps because of this she had less empathy for her mother who she felt should have stood up to her dad. She maybe found ways to control her father by saying and doing all the right things so she could control him (stopping him from hitting her), whilst despising him. She then controlled her mum and her sister, perhaps by negotiating with him on their behalf. She then controlled him later with money. She learned the art of manipulation young, therefore empathy is not important for survival. <br>Johnny&#39;s empathy could be because he just kept out of the way when his mother was home. He knew that she had to work hard to support 4 kids, and when he comes across anyone in a bad position he can empathise and he knows that he has a ways of making people happy. Making people happy, makes him feel happy, probably what gives him more oxytocin. Just guessing of course.",
