We drink coffee.  We advocate for Down syndrome awareness.  We are loud.  We are chaotic.\n\nHere I'll share vlogs about all these things, what I'm doing that works and what I've tried but didn't work.  I hope to encourage you in your journey through motherhood, homeschooling, learning to cook, and growing in your faith through it all.\n\nFor written blogs you can find me at www.camphomeschool.blogspot.com\n\nInstagram  https://www.instagram.com/acountry_life/\n\nFacebook  https://www.facebook.com/camphomeschool/",
