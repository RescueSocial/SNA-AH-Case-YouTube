I'm a former teacher and mother of three, with an MSed in Elementary Education from UPENN. I left public school teaching in 1992 after only two years because I could not abide the prevailing view amongst my colleagues and superiors that \"individualism\" is \"selfish\" and \"dangerous.\" I couldn't beat them using reasoned arguments, and I didn't want to join them in the land of unreason, so I left, hoping parents and cultural leaders would wake up, and correct this trend in due time. Turns out I hoped in vain. \n\nI believe the illiberalism dominating our schools, and our culture today, poses an existential threat to our freedom, our civil rights, and our republic. If you agree, I hope you'll subscribe.\n\n\n",
