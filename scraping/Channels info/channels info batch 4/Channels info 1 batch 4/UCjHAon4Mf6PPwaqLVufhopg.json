            "description": "To live a metaphysically charged life means to go passed what you see with the naked eye, in other words, to look past physical conditions as they are and focus on the Energy/God (or whatever you call your creator) that created all to live the life of your dreams. One way to do this is to let go of whom you were taught to be by your parents, siblings and other family members, peers and the mass media, to become whom you were meant to be. Living the metaphysically charged life means to learn to look into the unseen until the unseen becomes the seen; to live by faith and not by sight. \n\nThis channel is about spiritual awakening and personal development. Everyone learns and awakens at a different pace using a variety of resources to do so which is as individual as a fingerprint and a snowflake. For this reason this channel covers an eclectic number of topics that will help people awaken you to your true Divine Self and your unique purpose in life.\n\n\n",
