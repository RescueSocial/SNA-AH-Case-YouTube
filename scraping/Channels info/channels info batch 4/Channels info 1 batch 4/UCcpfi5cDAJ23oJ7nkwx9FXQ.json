We will take you along and show you America, through our lens!\nKyle- He's a huge lover of baseball and travel. He is more of the 'behind the scenes' kinda guy. He does all of our video editing and equipment handling. \nJenn- She's a lover of all things makeup and fashion! Plus, she's super artsy fartsy and adores interior design.\nBen (9)- This kiddo has the kindest heart you'll every meet! You can find him exploring the outdoors or playing Fortnite in the evening with his buddies.\nMolly (7)- She's a mini version of jean with double the sass! She LOVES to shop, get a mani pedi, and visit Starbucks. \nEli (5)- He usually isn't wearing anything but underwear (and trust me, its a struggle to get him to keep those on). He can be spotted playing with his monster trucks in the dirt, or find a new stick.",
