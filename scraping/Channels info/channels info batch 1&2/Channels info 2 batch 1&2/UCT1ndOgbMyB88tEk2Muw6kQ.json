            "description": "My channel is committed to helping people build a better version of themselves after surviving narcissistic abuse. Also known as the Fully Alive Again Warrior, I aim to unapologetically expose narcissistic abuse and the effect it is having on our society. I am an independent researcher, and lifelong survivor of narcissistic abuse. My mother and 3 siblings are all narcissists \u2013 and I was in a 23 year marriage to one as well. I have lived through and recovered from all the extremes of narcissist abuse. I fully understand narcissistic abuse and the Complex PTSD it creates. I am a Post-Traumatic-Growth Coach. I use what I have learned from my research, and soul-crushing experiences to help other narcissist abuse survivors take back their life and become fully alive again.
