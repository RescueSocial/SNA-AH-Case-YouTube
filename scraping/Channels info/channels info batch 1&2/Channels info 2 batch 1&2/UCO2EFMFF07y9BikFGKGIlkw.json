            "description": "In this channel, you will enjoy the art of the Concept Trailers! \n\nMy objective is to conceptualize creative ideas for different movies, into a trailer form. I combine clips from existing productions using programs like Adobe Premiere Pro and Final Cut Pro to bring you an amazing edited trailer. I add the color grading, different perspectives of the backgrounds, new stages, etc. I use Adobe Audition to make you feel the drums and sound fx on your headphones, we convert it in Dolby 5.1. \n\nBasically, i give a new meaning to the films. Hope you enjoy my hard work! \n\nAll of this with the proposal of improve your creativity. The videos are made to display transformative visual commentary on the new meaning i am telling in each video. You will also enjoy composed music, tv spots, official trailers, tributes and fan films!\n\nRemember that your imagination is the best partner to enjoy the life! Stay safe and create!\n\nWant me to edit your trailer?\nMy e-mail: alfonsoloredoedits@gmail.com",
