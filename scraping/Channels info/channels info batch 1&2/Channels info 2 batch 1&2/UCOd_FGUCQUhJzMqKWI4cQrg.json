            "description": "Snapped is an American true crime television series produced by Jupiter Entertainment. The series depicts high profile or bizarre cases of women accused of murder. Each episode outlines the motivation for murder, whether it be revenge against a cheating husband or lover, a large insurance payoff, or the ending to years of abuse, with each murder's circumstances as unique as the women profiled.[2]\n\nSnapped premiered on August 6, 2004 on Oxygen. It has since become the network's longest-running original series, with its 28 defined seasons and sixteen years in production (and two spin-offs) outlasting the seventeen seasons and thirteen years of the Bad Girls Club. The show also played a large role in the decision by parent company NBCUniversal to relaunch Oxygen as a crime network in 2017.[3][4] As of November 22, 2020, 500 original episodes of Snapped have aired.\n",
