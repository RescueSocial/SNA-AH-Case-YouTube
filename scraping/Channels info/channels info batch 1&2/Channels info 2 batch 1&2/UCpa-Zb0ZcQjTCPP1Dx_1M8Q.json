Have some fun and learn to think like a lawyer.  \n\nI get asked a lot about whether being a practicing attorney is like being a lawyer on TV.  I love watching legal movies and courtroom dramas.  It's one of the reasons I decided to become a lawyer.  But sometimes they make me want to pull my hair out because they are ridiculous.  So I created this channel to answer your burning questions about the law and the legal profession.  While all legal movies and shows take dramatic license to make things more interesting (nobody wants to see hundreds of hours of brief writing), many of them have a grain of truth.  Learn everything you always wanted to know about being an attorney!\n\nIf you\u2019re a law student or thinking about law school, check out my other channel made specifically for law students and 0Ls here: https://goo.gl/e3kEHL",
