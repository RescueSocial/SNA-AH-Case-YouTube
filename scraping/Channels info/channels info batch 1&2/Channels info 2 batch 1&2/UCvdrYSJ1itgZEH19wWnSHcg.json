Seventy years later, members of the HFPA represent 56 countries with a combined readership of 250 million in some of the world\u2019s most respected publications. Each year, the organization holds the third most watched awards show on television, the Golden Globe\u00ae Awards, which has enabled the organization to donate nearly $30 million to entertainment-related charities, scholarship programs and humanitarian efforts.
