Thank you for watching!\n\nI spend a lot of time creating each and every one of my videos! Let me show you my process: First I do the research, staying up-to-date in the celebrity world requires spending a lot of time on social media and different media outlets! Then I write a script for it and additionally record the audio for the video. \n\nOnce that is all perfect, I edit the video and make sure I include relevant footage that makes the video interesting to watch. This is the most time-consuming part and can take anywhere from 2-5 hours per video! Once that's done I upload the video and hope that you guys enjoy it!\n\nLooking forward to seeing you in my future videos! Thanks!\n",
