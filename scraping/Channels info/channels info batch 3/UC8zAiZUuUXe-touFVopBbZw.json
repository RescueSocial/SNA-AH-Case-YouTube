I have covered Twin Peaks, Better Call Saul, Mr. Robot, Westworld, Game of Thrones, Watchmen, Dark, Ozark, The Expanse, and more. I like a good story with interesting characters, and love to get caught up in trying to solve a show. For that reason I don't focus on any particular genre.\nI am most active on my twitter account @PetePeppers if you want to keep up, or want to tell me your ideas for new videos. I try to do my best to answer as many comments as possible here on YouTube.",
