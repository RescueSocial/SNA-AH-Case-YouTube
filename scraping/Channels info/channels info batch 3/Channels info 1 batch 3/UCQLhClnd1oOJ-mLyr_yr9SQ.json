I\u2019m Amber Smith. I\u2019m a wife, a mother, actor and city girl turned country. Together we live on a farm with a lot of animals outside of Austin, Texas. We have four young children. Three of them are here on earth with us and we have one in heaven. We created this show to try to spread honesty and positivity the best way we know how and to keep us accountable in doing so. We share a lot of laughs, a lot of joy but we\u2019re also not afraid to show our heartache and tears. Life is a journey and sometimes it\u2019s all smooth sailing, but sometimes it\u2019s scattered and broken. We\u2019re very grateful for every step of ours, and we hope you\u2019ll join us. Welcome to the Smiths! New 'Smith's' episodes launch every Tuesday and Thursday at 6pm CST! New 'Arise With Amber' episodes launch every Sunday at 8am CST!",
