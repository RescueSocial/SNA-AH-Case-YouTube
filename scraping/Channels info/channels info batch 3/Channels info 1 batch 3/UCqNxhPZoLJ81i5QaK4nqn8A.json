            "description": "The music of Cigarettes After Sex invokes not only the powerful feelings of euphoria inherent in the band\u2019s name itself, but somehow manages to recreate emotions found only in the most romantic of movies; immersive, achingly nostalgic, and intensely visual. After the phenomenal online break-out success of \u201cNothing\u2019s Gonna Hurt You Baby\u201d the singer, guitarist, and creator of Cigarettes After Sex, Greg Gonzalez, wanted to project his worldview onto a bigger screen. Yet Gonzalez rejected conventional studio routes for his band, which includes Randy Miller on bass and Jacob Tomsky on drums. They recorded their self-titled debut album during a three-day stint at a modest pay-by-the-hour rehearsal space in Brooklyn & their upcoming second album, Cry, over the course of a week on the Spanish island of Mallorca. It\u2019s this bottled intensity, and perfect cohesion between musical landscape and lyrics, which keeps listeners thoroughly enraptured, returning to the music again and again.",
