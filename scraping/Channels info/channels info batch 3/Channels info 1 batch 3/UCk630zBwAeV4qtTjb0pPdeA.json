            "description": "The Concussion Legacy Foundation is a 501(c)(3) registered non-profit organization dedicated to the study, treatment, and prevention of the effects of brain trauma in athletes and other at-risk groups. \n\nHeadquartered in Boston, CLF and its partner organization, the Boston University Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) Center are the leaders in the field of sports-related head trauma. A team of researchers, led by Dr. Robert Cantu, Dr. Ann McKee, and Dr. Robert Stern, have profoundly advanced the study of CTE, a degenerative brain condition caused by repeated head trauma. \n\nCLF supports this research through its active fundraising efforts. In addition, CLF engages in education and advocacy for the effects of concussions. So far, CLF's support has led to the passing of anti-concussion legislation in several states and municipalities, as well as acknowledgement of the long-term dangers of concussions by the NFL and NHL. \n\nLearn more at concussionfoundation.org",
