Like many other aspiring young musicians, the reality of having to get a real job and eventually support a family, made me move down with a different path. Along came the advent of YouTube and the ability to share my passion with others through this medium, which rekindled my playing in a way that I never anticipated. I appreciate you all for watching, and for the inspiration you continue to give me every day. :)\n\nIn addition to guitar lessons, I'm also open to reviewing gear and doing demos.
