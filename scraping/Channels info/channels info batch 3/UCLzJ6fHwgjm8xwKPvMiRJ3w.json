            "description": "Keto Chow is complete nutrition for Nutritional Ketosis. It\u2019s a drink mix that quickly and easily makes a complete keto meal. It\u2019s not meant to replace your bacon and steak. Rather, it\u2019s targeted to replace the mundane meals; running to a meeting, breakfast in the car, stuck in class, etc\u2026 By design, a serving of Keto Chow provides 1/3 of your daily needs of electrolytes, vitamins, protein and more. The aim is that you could replace all your meals without ill effect if you are so inclined, but most users replace 1-2 meals a day and have a fantastic keto meal with family or friends for the 3rd. It\u2019s also quite tasty with a range of great flavors. You combine the powdered mix with your own personal amount of heavy cream to get the calories you want, anywhere from 800 calories a day, up to 2200 calories. Many liken the taste and texture to melted ice cream or a milkshake.",
