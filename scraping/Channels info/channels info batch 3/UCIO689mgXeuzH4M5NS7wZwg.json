From Stoned Gremlin Productions and TheCinemaSnob.com, here you can check out a whole host of original series from writer/director Brad Jones.  \n\nOriginal content includes shows like The Cinema Snob, where a high brow art critic is stuck reviewing exploitation films and WTF Hollywood films of the past.  Midnight Screenings where Team Snob attends pre-screenings for new release films and talk about them directly afterwards in the car.  Our new animated series LLOYD, about a private detective Siamese Cat and his bizarre cases.  Brad Tries where Brad samples gimmicky foods and drinks from all over.  From other original shows (The Reviewers) to original movies, there is plenty of content to chose from.",
