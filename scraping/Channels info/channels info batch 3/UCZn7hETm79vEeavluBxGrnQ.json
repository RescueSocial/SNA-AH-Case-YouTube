She's had many, MANY trials along the way, but we're thankful that God has a plan for her, and that even now, she's fulfilling God's purpose for her. There's always hope even when life seems hopeless.\n\nWe post videos of Raelynn's seizures, surgeries, assistive medical technologies, and life with disabilities. With every upload, we hope that you'll be inspired and encouraged in your life as well!\n\nBack when we were fostering her, we couldn't use Raelynn's name online. So when we started this YouTube channel (which only had private videos at first), we called her our \"Sunshine\" Baby because her name is Raelynn, and she's a beautiful Ray of Sunshine!",
