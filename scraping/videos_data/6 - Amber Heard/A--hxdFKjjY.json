            "description": "Amber Heard Faces Prison After New Investigation. \nJohnny Depp and his ex-wife, Amber Heard have constantly been in the news due to a scandalous saga that could rival the fantasy movies both celebrities are famous for. Back in 2016, eyebrows first rose when Amber Heard issued a restraining order against her husband. Since then, plot twist after plot twist has been added to the original story so much so that it's beginning to look like something out of a mystery drama. The pair have even gone as far as dragging other popular names into their ongoing scandal and we have been here for all of it. That's why today we would be spilling all the tea we know about the latest twist to this ongoing saga. Make sure to stick around until the end so you do not miss out on any of the juicy details.\n\nSubscribe for celeb drama:  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVRROqlaHIP92Oun1Cl8XAw?sub_confirmation=1\n\n#TheSocial #AmberHeard",
