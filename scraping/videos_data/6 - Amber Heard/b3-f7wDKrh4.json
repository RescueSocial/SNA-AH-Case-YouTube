            "description": "Johnny Depp will be allowed to pursue his defamation case against ex-wife Amber Heard. According to court documents obtained by Access Hollywood, a Virginia-based judge granted the \"Pirates of The Caribbean\" actor permission to move forward with his 50-million-dollar lawsuit. On August 17, 2021 the court overruled Amber's supplemental plea, which she filed in an attempt to get the case dismissed. The 58-year-old is suing his ex over an op-ed she wrote for the Washington post in 2018.",
