            "description": "10 Times Johnny Depp Tried To Warn Us About Amber Heard\nhttps://youtu.be/n2q-kN4GIwg\n\nAmber heard has been the CENTER OF ATTENTION of many controversies since her NASTY DIVORCE with The Rum Diary co-star and the popular Hollywood celebrity Johnny Depp! The actress who has been a part of the Warner Bros and DC universe Aquaman, the spokesperson of cosmetics brand L\u2019Oreal Paris, as well as American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) ambassador for women's rights has been getting NEGATIVE responses and STRONG HATE and it seems that she might have ruined her OWN CAREER! \nIn fact, if sources are to be believed the actress may not appear in the second installment of DC\u2019s Aquaman that will be released in 2022! And according to multiple websites the actress has been replaced by Games of thrones star EMILIA CLARKE!!! In today\u2019s video I will reveal how Amber Heard destroyed her own Hollywood career in her attempts to defame Johnny Depp! But before jumping in the video you can help our channel grow by smashing those like, subscribe and bell notification buttons. A little action from you can help grow our channel tremendously!\nAnd make sure to stick with us till the end of this video!\n\nAmber Heard\u2019s career started in 2003 when she first appeared in two music videos Kenny Chesney's 'There Goes My Life' and Eisley's 'I Wasn't Prepared,\" and went onto star in an array of TV shows and movies, her career really took off in 2015 the same year when she married Depp and when she had prominent roles in four mainstream movies. \nShe played the lead in the comedy-drama 'Magic Mike XXL,' which like its predecessor, 'Magic Mike' (2012), was a huge box office success. Heard also starred in the critically acclaimed historical drama 'The Danish Girl' and the independent crime thriller 'The Adderall Diaries.' She also appeared in the television film 'One More Time.'\nAlthough she appeared in different television shows and a few movies but she was not in any way equivalent to Johnny Depp in fame or standing in Hollywood. After she married Depp her position in Hollywood solidified and she started getting more recognition. After her divorce from Depp she landed the biggest role of her career in the form of WARNER BROS Aquaman in which she played the character of female lead MERA alongside Justin Momoa. 'Aquaman' became the fifth most profitable release of 2018, and the most profitable DCEU installment till that point.\nAt that time she also got selected as the brand ambassador of LOREAL PARIS and became the representative of women rights in ACLU! She got these opportunities after she blamed Depp with domestic violence accusations and pretended to be a victim. This earned her a lot of support and she became successful.  L'Oreal announced in 2017 that Heard will be the new global spokesperson, calling her \"fearless, witty and smart\" and a woman who defied definition and rejected convention. \nAnd yet, she has claimed in her court declaration countering ex-husband's $50 million defamation suit against her that her career took a serious hit and she received death threats that forced her to constantly keep on changing her contact details.\n\"Following my highly-publicized separation from Johnny, I read accounts in the media referring to me as a victim of domestic violence. In response, many people called me a liar (without ever hearing my story). I was dropped from a global fashion brand's upcoming campaign. I lost a part of a movie in which I had already been cast. People I have never met or spoken to threatened me with violence. I received so many death threats I had to change my phone number on a near-weekly basis,\" she declared in her motion to dismiss the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' actor's lawsuit filed in Fairfax County, Virginia Circuit Court.\n\nBut things started changing when new evidences came to light! Initially most of the people were supporting Amber in her fight against Depp but when audio and video tapes of Amber Heard threatening Depp were released many people were shocked and furious at Heard!\nEver since the verdict of the Libel case was announced by the UK court, millions of Johnny Depp fans are criticizing  the \"Aquaman\" actress. His fans recently started circulating a video featuring Amber Heard as a proof that although she has won the legal battle but people still hate the \"Aquaman\" actress. The video is an interview of the actress posted on YouTube channel \"Access\" with more than one million followers.\nThe video has received only 16,000 likes while it has been disliked by more than 203,000 people. Posted on December 15, the YouTube video was watched by over a million people within 10 days.\n\nThank you for your valuable time, if you are interested into these kind of stuff, please consider subscribing to our channel and support my hard work if you enjoy watching our videos regularly.\n\nSUBSCRIBE:  https://bit.ly/30kR4eB\n\n#amberheard #amberheardinterviews #amberheardapology #amberheardaudio #johnnydeppamberheard",
