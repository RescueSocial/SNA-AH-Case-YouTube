Swank was born in Utah but had the opportunity to live all over the country including time spent in Tennessee, Georgia, Washington state, and most recently in Iowa.

Three years later he received his Juris Doctorate from Drake University Law School in Des Moines, Iowa.\n\nAfter graduating from law school, Sterling made the trip back to Utah and joined the Utah State Bar in 2019 and then CoilLaw as an Associate Attorney shortly after. Prior to becoming a part of the CoilLaw team, Sterling worked in the Drake Legal Clinic providing legal services for criminal defense clients and to young people facing juvenile delinquency charges.\n\nSterling has a passion for the legal system and ensuring the best outcomes for his clients and their families. In his off-time Sterling loves spending time outdoors camping, hiking, or taking a scenic ride on his motorcycle.\n\nThe case is interesting because these types of cases happen sometimes, but it is usually a female filing an abuse claim against a male, and here it\u2019s swapped.\n\nAmber Heard (Aquaman) and Johnny Depp started dating in 2012 after The Rum Diary movie (2011). Depp has 2 children from a previous marriage. Johnny\u2019s exes (Vanessa Paradis and Winona Ryder) both came out saying that these abuse claims were totally out of character for Johnny for what they knew of him.\n\nDivorce was finalized in 2017. Heard received 7 million dollars, which she apparently donated to charity. Depp has shown a history of being irresponsible with money. They both agreed they wouldn\u2019t say anything disparaging about the other party. This is a standard agreement in most divorces.\n\nHe sued her for libel, and then she came out with a lot of allegations against him.",
