Among them is James Franco. Which is shocking given all the controversy James Franco has going on right now. Does James Franco actually believe Amber Heard or is this a PR stunt? Let's find out in today's video.\n\nWith the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases.

Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.\n\n#JohnnyDepp #AMBERHEARD #JamesFranco\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWelcome to The Gossipy.
