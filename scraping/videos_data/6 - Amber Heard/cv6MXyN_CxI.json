We give you a closer look in the lives of celebrities like Kanye West, Ed Sheeran, The Rock, Jay Z, Selena Gomez, Kylie Jenner, Kim Kardashian, Rihanna and 100s more.\n\nAmber Heard has been CAUGHT collaborating with the ACLU. Heard is very clearly a liar, in my opinion and has done whatever she COULD to defame Johnny Depp. We all know Depp is probably cheering and jumping with joy, to know Heard could potentially loose this thing, especially with all of the evidence against. The Amber Heard Johnny Depp audio recordings should be the only thing needed for him to get justice, but I guess we will have to see!\n\nWith the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. \n\nEver since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.\n\n#AmberHeardACLU #ACLU #JohnnyDepp\n\nWe tell you interesting things about these Hollywood celebrities that you may have never heard before.\n\nPlease subscribe to our channel to stay up to date with interesting facts about Hollywood Celebs.\n\nCheers!",
