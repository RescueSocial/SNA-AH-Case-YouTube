This has been more so highlighted in the newly taken up role of Heard as a single mother of Baby Oonagh Paige Heard. Yes! A mother! This celebrity news has totally changed the game for Heard in between lawsuits and a number of her supporters have turned against her. \n\nWe will fill you in on the latest Amber Heard motherhood timing cuppa and how this can be of advantage to her losing lawsuit position against Johnny Depp. I hope you all are prepared, and are pumped as we are ready to spill some brewing celebri-tea. Maybe grab some snacks, click the subscribe button, and turn on the notification bell with your Cheetos-covered-finger if you haven\u2019t yet! Now, let\u2019s get on with the video:\n\nTo give you a quick timeline rundown, last 2015, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard made headlines when they married in their Los Angeles home. The then couple has touched the hearts of many with their intimate ceremony. However, who would have thought that their divorce and the lawsuits that followed would break the Internet harder than the news of their marriage and even six years later! In 2016, Heard accused Depp of domestic violence and has called for a divorce. Since then, both parties have retaliated with their differing narrative of the same story. Heard has consistently stated in court and in various interviews that Depp had serious substance abuse which would cause him to be violent towards her. Bruised and disturbed Amber would show up in court and vividly recount Depp\u2019s allegedly abusive behavior. \n\nDepp denied all claims and was strengthened by accounts of his co-stars and supporters. \u201cMy husband and I will never forget the sweetness, protection, and kindness he treated me with during every single step of that [pregnancy] process,\u201d Penelope Cruz, Depp\u2019s co-star in \u2018Pirates of the Caribbean\u2019 shared in defense of Depp. In the same year, Heard then withdrew her restraining order appeal on the grounds of domestic violence and received a $7 million settlement. \n\nIn 2019, Depp sued Heard for $50 million defamation over a 2018 Washington Post op-ed on which has been pushed, yet again, to next year. \u201cI spoke up against sexual violence \u2014 and faced our culture\u2019s wrath. That has to change,\u201d Heard manifested. Especially in this contemporary social climate where a fight for oppressive behaviors is strengthened, her story as a \u201csurvivor of domestic abuse\u201d quickly gained an audience. Talking about change, Depp did not brush this off. \n\nDepp\u2019s lawsuit appealed that Ms. Heard\u2019s allegations of abuse, even with no mentions of Mr. Depp\u2019s name, is false and reflects a perpetrator character. \u201cThey were part of an elaborate hoax to generate positive publicity for Ms. Heard and advance her career.\u201dOn Ms. Heard\u2019s side of the fence, she pursues a $100 million defamation countersuit against Mr. Depp. The significance of the Depp-Heard controversy has taken the Internet into a whirlwind no one is wanting to miss! While Depp has been continuously dragged by Heard with various accounts of physical and verbal abuse, the Internet is yet to side with her. Videos and phone recordings have surfaced featuring an abusive and manipulative Heard towards her then-husband. \u201cI can\u2019t promise you I won\u2019t get physical again. God, I f---ing sometimes get so mad I lose it,\u201d Heard admitted in a phone recording released in 2020.",
