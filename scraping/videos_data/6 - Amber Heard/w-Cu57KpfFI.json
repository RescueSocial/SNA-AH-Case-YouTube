Even though Johnny's defamation lawsuit is set to proceed to a trial next year, there are still so many lies, rumors and opinions about the entire situation. In the process of all this fight, many fans and even stars have expressed their opinion and they all as one claim that Amber lied and made false accusations against Johnny Depp all this time. While the case was still ongoing, even Johnny Depp\u2019s exes testified in the actor\u2019s defense. Vanessa Paradis and Winona Ryder have made it clear that Johnny is not a \u2018wife beater\u2019. But not only his exes stood up for Johnny. Penelope Cruz, Sharon Osbourne, Laurie Holden and others shared their opinions on the entire situation. \n\n10. Penelope Cruz\n\nLet\u2019s start this list with Johnny Depp\u2019s co-star Penelope Cruz, who worked with Johnny in three movies: Blow, Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, Murder on the Orient Express. Penelope Cruz was the one who officially defended Johnny Depp by providing a written testimony. According to the documents, Penelope said, \u201cMany years have passed and I have not only made 3 movies with him, but I also count on him as a great friend. I\u2019ve always been impressed by his kindness, his brilliant mind, his talent, and his peculiar sense of humor.\u201d The actress even went into detail about how Johnny Depp treated her during her pregnancy with her first child. \u201cDuring six months of my first pregnancy,\u201d Penelope Cruz wrote, \u201cI spent every single day with him while we shot Pirates of the Caribbean. My husband and I will never forget the sweetness, protection, and kindness he treated me with during every single step of that process.\u201d So, judging by these words, it is clear that Penelope doesn\u2019t believe Amber\u2019s accusations.\n\n9. Laurie Holden\n\nLaurie, Walking Dead star, didn\u2019t officially defended Johnny in court, as Penelope, but she took to Twitter and defended him, because she had an \u201cimpassioned reaction to the vilification of a human being on social media and the public outcry for complete and utter rumination.\u201d\n\n\u201cI, for one, am going to see Johnny Depp\u2019s new movie,\u201d the actress referred to Alice Through the Looking Glass. \u201cHis personal life is just that. Personal. No one knows the real truth so just zip it.\u201d \u201cTo be clear: I am just saying DON\u2019T JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS,\u201d she added. \u201cEven a pic might not be telling the whole story\u2026.\u201d Well, she didn\u2019t say a word about Amber but it is clear that Laurine is on Johnny Depp\u2019s side.\n\n8. Paul Bettany \n\nAnother Johnny\u2019s co-star is Paul Bettany, who worked with him in three films \u2013 Transcendence, The Tourist and Mortdecai. He also took to Twitter to express his opinion about the entire situation, \u201cKnown Johnny Depp for years and through several relationships\u201d. \u201cHe\u2019s the sweetest, kindest, gentlest man that I\u2019ve ever known. Just saying.\u201d \u201cAll I\u2019m saying-Domestic violence is a serious allegation,\u201d he continued. \u201cTrial by Twitter is unhelpful. Let the facts come out before rushing to judgment.\u201d Well, Amber, it seems like more and more people DO believe Johnny Depp.\n\n7. J.K. Rowling\n\nAnother big name that expressed her opinion was JK Rowling. After Warner Bros. shared a cast photo in November that re-confirmed Johnny Depp was reprising his role as dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald in the series\u2019 second film, The Crimes of Grindelwald, some people took to social media to criticize the decision. She was the one who defended Johnny Depp and always wanted him to stay in this role. JK Rowling has shared a blog post on her website in which she defended the decision to not recast the role. \u201cI\u2019m saying what I can about the Grindelwald casting issue here,\u201d she tweeted alongside a link to the post. \u201cBased on our understanding of the circumstances, the film-makers and I are not only comfortable sticking with our original casting but genuinely happy to have Johnny playing a major character in the movies\u201d. \n\n\nBinge Watch - Binge Watch is the best source of the latest celebrity news.
