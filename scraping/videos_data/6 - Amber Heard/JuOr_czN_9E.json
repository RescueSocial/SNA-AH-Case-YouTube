However, it seems like Amber Heard and her legal team are that desperate, so they subpoenaed LAPD over 2016 domestic disturbance incident!\nFor those who don\u2019t remember, in 2016 Johnny Depp and Amber Heard allegedly had a fight at their LA apartments. Allegedly, there was a heated altercation and Amber was so scared and asked her friends to call 911. Her friends called 911 twice reporting that there was a huge fight and the apartment is absolutely trashed from a knockdown blowout between the volatile couple. Later, Amber Heard and her allies have given evidence in multiple legal cases saying Johnny Depp hurled a phone at her face and trashed their penthouse kitchen during that notorious fight. Amber and friends claimed in court that there were broken candelabras, glass strewn on the floor and red wine sloshed on the walls and carpets. \n\nAmber Heard and her friends, iO Tillet Wright and Rocky Pennington described in court the entire situation and claimed that Johnny Depp really threatened Amber and she was scared for her life. Rocky Pennington said to judge: \"They have a big kitchen island in the middle of the kitchen and on there, there's candles and like fruit and, you know, glass, like jars and vases and things like that. And he just was hitting everything with the wine bottle, just smashing it all off. So, there was fruit on the floor and baskets and, you know, glass bottles and flowers.\"\n\nAs for Amber Heard herself, she said: \"We have huge heavy silver candlesticks, candelabra sticks. Those were on the floor broken. Baskets of fruit that we had on the kitchen island. There \u2026 fruit everywhere. Baskets on the ground. The containers holding the spoons and forks, kitchen utensils, those were spilled. He broke a lot of glass things that left glass on the floor \u2026 when he walked out into the hallway, you could see wine spilled all over the ground and wine on the walls and \u2026 and so I knew that at least he had gone through there and was sloshing wine anywhere.\" \n\nBut when the police actually arrived there was no sign of a crime. As Amber\u2019s friends called 911 twice, there were 2 groups of policemen who arrived. The first two police officers who arrived on the scene said they didn\u2019t remember seeing any such spillages and that there was no visual evidence that a crime had taken place at all. Moreover, we can see this because a bit later Daily Mail released the body cam footage from a second set of officers (who arrived later, the second time) and they had cameras on when they entered Amber Heard and Johnny Depp's former marital home later that night. And according to this bodycam footage, there\u2019s no spilled red wine, no scene of a crime, no violence at all. Moreover, when the police arrived, Amber Heard didn\u2019t look like she was assaulted.\n\nAnd of course, Johnny Depp and his legal team had to react on the things Amber Heard and here friends said, so Johnny Depp's attorney, Adam Waldman, also claimed that this evidence proves there was never any wrecking spree and that Amber Heard's account of the evening cannot be trusted.\n\nSo, now I want to know your opinion. Do you think Amber Heard and her legal team are so desperate that they are trying to do at least something that can help them out? Do you think she is guilty?
