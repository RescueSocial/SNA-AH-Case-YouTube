From being Hollywood's favorite couple to being one of the worst and most toxic couples to be in the spotlight. The pair are still at it with their ongoing court battles and lawsuits and we are about to witness Amber\u2019s behavior towards most of it. \n\nBut before we head on to the video, please don\u2019t forget to hit the like button!

Now on to the story:\n\nAmber Heard and Johnny Depp are inarguably some of the most recognizable faces in Hollywood today \u2013 and they\u2019ve gotten even more recognizable and notable in recent years though it\u2019s all for the wrong reasons. But to keep you guys in the loop, here\u2019s a refresher of how a seemingly promising relationship went downhill after just one year of being married to each other. \u201cWorking with Johnny was torture. It was better than I ever imagined, which is really saying something,\u201d she told Vogue magazine once. They didn\u2019t quite hit it off just yet as Johnny was still in a tight-knit, 14-year relationship with Vanessa Paradis with which he has also shared two children. Moreover, Amber was also dating her former partner at the time, Taysa van Ree. But it wasn\u2019t until 2012 that the two would eventually decide to break up with who they were with and start a new relationship altogether.\n\nIt is worth mentioning though that prior to dating, Amber had been arrested in 2009 on the charge of physically assaulting van Ree in Washington. So, I guess Johnny always had the red flags? Who knows? But anyway, it wasn\u2019t long until they were dubbed as the new it-couple of Hollywood. They eventually tied the knot in 2015 in a private ceremony held in their LA home. People were even wishing to have the same kind of relationship they had shown everyone that time.  But little did we know that there was more dark stuff happening in the background than what we\u2019ve been led on to believe. \n\nBut as mentioned, one year into the relationship, all hell broke loose and Amber eventually filed for divorce from Johnny and stated that she had been physically and emotionally abused by the \u201cPirates of the Caribbean\u201d actor. Everything came crashing down for both parties where speculations and assertions were made especially on Depp. Under many deliberations against him, she claims Johnny threw a phone at her face that caused bruises. Meanwhile, Johnny completely and consistently denies all assertions regarding physical abuse. Apparently, after investigations were made it was proven that her claims were false and that the photos of her bruises were all made up. Moreover, the actress also claimed mental abuse on Johnny\u2019s part saying he was using his sexes to cause her pain and suffering. However, Johnny\u2019s exes denied all of this and even went on to come into his defense. \u201cThe idea that he is an incredibly violent person is the farthest thing from the Johnny I knew and loved. I cannot wrap my head around these accusations,\u201d Winona Ryder narrated.",
