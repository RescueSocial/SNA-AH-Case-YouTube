            "description": "FBI DETAIN Amber Heard After Charity Donation Lie\nIt's not been a good time to be Amber Heard recently, that's for sure. Yes, while she is working right now on being Mera once again via Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, and she is a new mother via a surrogate. But, that's about all she has going for her, because her court case with former husband Johnny Depp has gotten deeper and more infuriating (for her and him both) with every single step it takes. For example, she recently had a bunch of rulings go against her, and now, she's apparently facing the wrath of the FBI. We'll break it down for you.
