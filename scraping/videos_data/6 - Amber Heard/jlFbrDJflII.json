            "description": "Today I will be doing a cosmetic analysis of the stunning Amber Heard. She is considered to have one of the most perfect faces in Hollywood. Is her face natural, or did she get Cosmetic procedures done? I will show what I found behind all the rumors and speculation, through researching hundreds of photos, and using my knowledge of the world of Plastic Surgery.\u00a0#AmberHeard #loreal #JohnnyDepp\nAmber Heard is an American actress, age 34, born April 22, 1986, to her family in Austin Texas.Today, Amber is an internationally known star, and has been featured in many highly successful films such as: Aquaman ($1.148 Billion USD Worldwide Gross),Justice league ( $657 million USD Worldwide),  Magic Mike XXL ($117 million Worldwide Gross), and some other films like the Rum Diary and Pineapple express. Amber Heard has a current net worth of $9 million Dollars.\n\nAmber heard has also been the face of many Brand/ Ad campaigns through her career. Some examples are: L\u2019Oreal campaign in 2019-Now. In the past she was the face of Guess Girl Belle, a fragrance by Guess fragrance is 2013 and 2014. Recently L\u2019Oreal has been pressured to drop her as the face of the campaign due to alleged abuse toward Johnny Depp. Currently they are in court over allegations, speaking with many divorce lawyers, and presenting their evidence in court. \n\n\nAside from her acting career, Amber is known for her beauty, and is considered to have one of the most perfect faces in the world according to the Greek Golden Ratio. Some say she has a striking resemblance to Scarlett Johansson. Amber touts Near perfect facial symmetry, Large beautiful Eyes, and a cute pointed chin. She also appears to have quite flawless skin, and most certainly has a great skin routine. \n\n\nThe beginning of Amber Heard\u2019s career, she was very natural, and did not start to change until somewhere in mid 2008. tHe biggest differences are that her face became less soft and round, and began to take shape and become tighter and flatter. This look is most often achieved through buccal fat removal aka a Bichectomy. If it were weight loss, the difference would be even over her entire face, later in her 20\u2019s and much more gradually than 1 year. \n\n\nThe next procedure was her nose, which was naturally straight and symmetrical. Over studying 100 photos, I saw that her nose was narrowed and nostrils brought in with a rhinoplasty. She most likely tried to hide it by dying her hair brown, a very typical diversion tactic in Hollywood. \n\n\nAmber Heard's teeth were her next target for change. In early years, she had, what we call in dentistry, An overjet where teeth jut forward. She probably fixed this problem with invisalign braces that are clear, plastic and not very obvious. She has also been using Teeth Bleaching throughout her career.\n\nThe last procedure I am covering is her cheeks. They started out flatter, but still naturally gorgeous and didn\u2019t necessarily need larger cheeks at all. It puzzled many people when she opted to get large cheek implants in 2018 causing a lot of buzz. She also may have lost some weight, further exposing the cheek implants and making them more obvious. A solution would be some dermal filler or Placing some fat around them to make it more subtle. Either way, she is absolutely stunning. \n\nRight now, Amber Heard and Johnny Depp are in a legal battle over allegations toward each other. I have chosen not to take a stance on the situation and instead am focusing solely on her appearance and some bits about her career. I hope you Understand.\nMusic:\nXavy Rusan \"Lifeline\" Epidemic Sound \nVideo credits:\nPineapple Express:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvttgV0vL90&t=38s\nThe Rum Diary:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiso65OLV4c\nMagic Mike XXL:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86RiGV3s50w\n\nDoctor Credits:\nV-y plasty\nhttps://www.newyorkfacialplasticsurgery.com/plastic-surgery-results/lip-augmentation/v-to-y-lip-augmentation\n\nAmber Interview 2018\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pGFvd02zFE\n\nAmber interview 2015\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNwoRxZzbjM\n\nEverything  talked about in this video is MY OPINION ONLY and not actual medical facts about the individual represented here.\n\nPlease know that although I have a very informed opinion based on my own experience I am not an EXPERT or a Doctor.
