            "description": "The filming of the second movie for DC Extended Universe film Aquaman 2 started filming a couple of months ago, but have fans finally gotten over the fact that Warner Brothers recast Amber Heard as Queen Mera? Absolutely not. As you all remember, when the news of Amber Heard reprising a main role in the previous blockbuster hit came out, lots of fans were outraged, and many even went as far as signing a petition for Warner Bros. to fire the actress, and by \u201cmany\u201d, we mean 1.6 million people. That\u2019s a lot! But it is kind of safe to say that all those efforts went nowhere. The actress still landed the important role, and she has been flaunting all her training in social media. Not cool, Amber. But anyway, up until now, fans couldn\u2019t accept the fact that the very same production company who kicked out Johnny Depp from his supposedly upcoming third installment of the Fantastic Beasts series, had decided to keep Amber who was apparently as much involved as Johnny in their ongoing lawsuit. Now, fans are rooting for various other artists to replace Amber Heard from her role as Queen Mera. A lot of fans are throwing their own bets on social media, but we could all agree that one of them really stands out from the crowd. And that celebrity is none other than the Queen of the North herself, Sophie Turner. But what makes Sophie Turner the perfect replacement as Queen Mera? Here are the top three reasons why Sophie can very much dethrone Amber from Aquaman 2. But before that, make sure to hit that subscribe button first and ring that notification bell for more updates. So, let\u2019s begin!\n\nFollowing the ruckus brought about by their previous marriage, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard\u2019s careers were expected to crumble as they continuously face allegations and suit cases here and there. As Johnny Depp lost his libel case filed against news publisher The Sun in 2020, he also lost his chance to reprise the role of Grindelwald in the upcoming third installment of Fantastic Beasts. But despite Johnny leaving, or being forced rather, to vacate his role, Amber Heard was set to continue on to reprise her role as Queen Mera in the upcoming second installment of the DCEU movie Aquaman 2, entitled Aquaman and The Lost Kingdom. Both movies are set to premiere in 2022, and both movies are going to be under Warner Brothers. \n\nEven though it has long been decided that Amber Heard would in fact reprise her role, fans are still hoping that Warner Brothers will soon change their mind. However, despite the production company\u2019s rogue decision to keep Amber Heard, which might actually cause their new upcoming movie to flop, at least they are somehow trying to reduce Amber Heard\u2019s exposure.\n\n1. She rocks red locks\nQueen Mera is a pretty and strong minded redhead who rules Atlantis. If there\u2019s anyone who quickly comes to mind when talking about redheads, superheroes, kingdom leaders, and action, then there\u2019s only one obvious option: the Queen of the North herself, Sophie Turner. Sophie made her acting debut in the widely-popular HBO series Game of Thrones, and it helped her skyrocket to fame. \n\n2. Sophie Turner is no newbie to action and superhero scenes\nIn fact, Sophie actually debuted in this kind of environment. Remember, she debuted her acting skills as a teenager in HBO hit Game of Thrones, and it brought her career to unimaginable heights. Her character, Sansa Stark, initially started off as a naive young woman, but when the time came that her family suffered from one cruelty and betrayal after another, she grew up hardened and stronger than ever. Exactly what we are looking for in a Queen Mera. \n\n3. Queen Mera is the new superhero role that Sophie Turner needed\nFirst of all, there is a certain stereotype going on around women that once a lady becomes a mother, she cannot take on strong roles anymore. Well, Sophie is the perfect female to break this barrier in the film industry. Sophie gave birth last year to her lovely daughter with Jonas Brothers\u2019 member Joe Jonas. The actress still keeps updating her social media showcasing her siren physique that is perfect for Queen Mera. Also, it\u2019s a little unfortunate for talented actors such as Sophie to get shackled to roles that underserve them or weak franchises that drag them down. \n\nDespite all these obvious choices, Warner Brothers still stuck with their initial decision to keep Amber Heard and keep her in the spotlight. \n\nThat\u2019s all for today, we hope you enjoyed that video, and if you did, don\u2019t forget to like, subscribe, and hit that notification bell for more videos like this.
