Johnny Depp, also lovingly known as the Jack Sparrow for his impeccable acting in Pirates of the Caribbean, was 47 and Amber was 25 when they fell for each other. Depp, being married to Vanessa Paradis, with whom he had two children, announced his separation from her in 2012. Also Heard was also known to split up with her partner Tasya at the same time. Rumors about a budding relationship between Depp and Amber were speculated around which were intensified after Heard had posted an engagement ring on one of her social media accounts. \n\nIn May 2016, Amber Heard filed for divorce from Johnny Depp. She alleged that Depp used to physically abuse her during their relationship. She also quoted that during such an incident, Depp had thrown his phone at her face, leaving severe bruises. He was also alleged to smash things all around the place in their apartment that night. There were negotiations and finally they reached a $7 million settlement as Heard withdrew her domestic violence accusation. Later, according to Heard, she donated the money to charity as she wasn\u2019t comfortable with it, holding the money of a domestic abuser. \n\nThey simply said that throughout their relationships, Depp has never been violent with them. Depp claimed that Heard was having an affair with Elon Musk also at the same time. Depp has also alleged that Heard hit him which she denied. Heard, in response, said that she had received death warnings from Depp several times. The trial continued in many hearings. Depp was denied to appeal against the ruling two times in a row. During the evidence given at the application hearing, Depp's team said that they had not received a fair trial and presented \"fresh evidence\" that alleged Heard lied about donating her full $7 million divorce settlement to charity. Depp's team Andrew Caldecott told the that Heard's claim about the donation was a lie that \"tipped the scales against Mr. Depp from the very beginning,\"\n\nDepp\u2019s team claim that the false depictions of rampage which included red wine splashed over the place, a huge mess of broken glasses, and shabby walls of the penthouse are completely opposite to what the police quote. That night 4 LAPD officers visited the couple\u2019s royal penthouse when Heard\u2019s friends mistakenly dialed 911 twice within a span of two hours. The first officers who reported at the spot within 15 minutes of the assault were Tyler Hadden and Melissa Saenz. Melissa Saenz is a domestic violence expert. \n\nAsked by Depp's attorney, if she remembered spotting anything resembling the damage depicted in Heard's photos during her inspection, Melissa confidently replied: 'I did not.'Hadden was of the same opinion as Melissa regarding the incident.\n\nDespite one of Heard\u2019s friends claiming to have cleaned the place between the two police visits but he was quite sure that there was a big stain of the wine in the hallway. Depp\u2019s team says that it is impossible that two sets of cops can miss the large red wine stains and abides by his saying that Heard has been lying throughout.\nWith Heard and her partners having multiple times referred to this incident and tipping the judgment of the in their favor, this simply seems to be manipulating the with lies and false witnesses after seeing the clip. \n\nThis controversy has dented Depp\u2019s image in the industry, He has already lost his role in the movie \u2018Fantastic Beasts 3\u201d. He also has to pay a hefty price to the ones he is fighting against after the jury decided against him in . But surely this news is important in the context of the case. This can change the outcome of the case as Heard can be easily accused of misleading the case and falsely accusing Depp of abuse. This case is getting more and more intense with time. me too movement\nclevver news johnny depp amber heard amber heard aquaman 2 theumbrellaguy jason momoa aquaman 2 thishappened viral vision johnny depp appeal yellowflash 2 informoverload information overload\n\n#AmberHeard #JohnnyDepp #AmberHeardFootage #JohnnyDeppFootage #JusticeForDepp #JusticeForJohnnyDepp #AmberHeardExposed #AmberHeardAudio #JasonMomoa #Aquaman2 #TheSpotlight #Depp #Heard #JohnnyDeppAppeal #JohnnyDeppCase #AmberHeardCase",
