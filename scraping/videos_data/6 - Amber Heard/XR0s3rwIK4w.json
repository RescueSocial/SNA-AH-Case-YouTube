            "description": "#AmberHeard #JohnnyDepp #LifeInJail\nAmber Heard LIVE Footage In Prison | Amber Heard Life In Jail | Amber Heard Sentenced To Prison.\n\nThe tale of Amber Heard continues to get more and more curious as time goes on. Because she is in a war in court with her ex-husband Johnny Depp and it doesn't look to be getting any simpler as time goes on. Not the least of which is new evidence and more proof of her being a bad person coming to light. But she's holding fast and trying to keep going in the roles that she does have. Which right now includes Mera in the DCEU, which will continue via Aquaman 2. But a very familiar \"call to arms\" is happening that might just shut that down. We'll break it down for you.
