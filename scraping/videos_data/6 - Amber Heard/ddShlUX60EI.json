            "description": "Elon Musk has been divorced three times, twice by the same person, and has been with\nother women. However, his first wife recently opened up about the illustrious billionaire,\nand what she revealed will shock many people!\nIn this video, we dive into the juicy bits as Musk's first wife, Justine, finally reveals what\nshe thinks about Elon Musk!\nWhat better source to hear from about Elon Musk than the woman who has five of his\nsons? There is a certain notoriety to being the world's richest man's ex-wife, but Justine\nseems to be handling it well. She even claims she is the model ex-wife!\nJustine Musk still goes by Elon's last name, which she says is for the benefit of her\nchildren. She is a successful author who has published three fiction works; Blood Angel,\nUninvited, and a sequel to Blood Angel called Lord of Bones.\nJustine was born in Ontario, Canada, and later enrolled at Queen's University in\nKingston, Canada, where she obtained a degree in English Literature. She later moved\nto Japan, where she taught English, and spent time in Australia.\nHowever, while in the university, Justine and Musk had met. Musk had obtained\nCanadian citizenship through his mother. Musk eventually transferred to Wharton,\nalthough he kept in contact with Justine.\nJustine said Musk made a big impression on her by giving her his credit card to buy as\nmany books as she wanted and she was so impressed that they got married in 2000.\nThe kids came. First was Nevada, who died due to sudden infant death syndrome at the\nage of ten weeks. They ended up having a set of twins and triplets, making the surviving\nchildren between the pair five.\nThe couple split in 2008 with joint custody of the children, and Musk would go on to date\nand marry Talulah Riley. The second marriage ended up in divorce again, but the two\ndecided to give it another trial by tying the knot for the second time but ultimately parting\nways again. Musk then dated Amber Heard, but the two lasted only a year due to their\nintense schedules.\nBy 2018, Musk had been confirmed to be involved with Grimes, meaning Musk was\ngoing back to his roots again as the artiste is Canadian. The pair have a baby together\ncalled X but have become semi separated, although Musk recently claimed they lived\ntogether.\nOne remarkable thing about all Musk's relationships is that he maintains a cordial\nrelationship with all his exes. For example, Musk said he and Amber Heard remains\nclose friends and love one another and who knows what the future holds.\nAnd after their second and final divorce, Riley still had positive things to say about her\nbillionaire ex. She even made an appearance during the Strauss Rolling Stone profile of\nMusk and told People magazine that she and Musk saw each other all the time and took\ncare of each other.\nComing back to Justine, Musk's first wife, she recently spoke about Musk where she\ndropped more than a few bombshells that will change your view of the industrialist!\nPreviously, shortly after her divorce, Justine wrote that she watched herself slowly take\nthe back seat to Musk's work as Musk's success rose astronomically. She became the\ntrophy wife, which apparently didn't sit well with her.\nBut as a courtside observer to Musk's insane climb to fame, and with her skills as a\nwriter, Justine was able to distill the changes in her husband. While responding to a\nquestion on Quora, she gave a rather candid impression of the man she was married to\nfor eight years. According to her, people like her former husband, Bill Gates, Steve\nJobs, and Richard Branson, who has a friendship with Musk, tend to be freaks and\nmisfits who were forced to experience the world in an unusually challenging way!\nJustine claimed they don't think the way other people think but see things from angles\nthat unlock new ideas and insights! Other people consider them insane!\nJustine illustrated Musk's childhood with the example of another friend who had a\ntroubled childhood because other kids mocked him for not being cool, a personae Musk\nwould later embrace, as you shall see! The friend's growing up was terrible enough that\nhe didn't want other kids going home with him from school because they threw soda\ncans at him! So instead of hanging out with these mean kids, Justine's friend buried\nhimself in computer games and coding, leading him to his first company, which he sold\nwhen he was in his mid twenties! But of course, nobody can throw cans at him again!\nInstead, people throw money at her friend and Musk, which he welcomes",
