            "description": "Johnny Depp Reacts To Amber Heard Being In Aquaman 2\n\nAmber Heard has been giving a sneak peek of her prep for Aquaman 2 for a while now. The actress has been intensively training for her revival as Mera.\nShe\u2019s gotten back on sets today for the shoot but the news hasn\u2019t gone down well with Johnny Depp and his fans. However, Twitter is witnessing #JusticeForJohnnyDepp trending with over 10K tweets in a few minutes after her revival was announced.\n\nJohnny Depp's fans are trending #JusticeforJohnnyDepp as they are expressing anger over the same studio that fired the actor and is continuing to employ Amber Heard. Johnny, who was expected to return as Gellert Grindelwald in Fantastic Beasts 3, sadly came under scrutiny recently during his highly publicised divorce from Amber Heard. Johnny was accused of domestic abuse. Although he denied the allegation, he lost a high profile case against a newspaper who dubbed him as a wife beater. Due to allegations against him, Warner Bros asked him to step down from the role as Grindelwald in The Fantastic Beasts franchise. Johnny lost another most prominent role as Captain Jack Sparrow in Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean. On the other hand, Amber Heard began filming for Aquaman 2. Now Johnny's fans have expressed anger over the same and want justice to be served for the actor. The online hate for Amber Heard\u2019s removal from Aquaman 2 is largely based on various unproven allegations that have been levelled against her over the years. Johnny's lawyers had also accused the actress of a calculated and manipulative lie.",
