Amber Heard has been in the news recently because she didn't donate any money to charity (ACLU and Children's Hospital) even though she promised to donate her $7 million divorce settlement that she received from Johnny Depp. \n\nThis video is like Cliff's notes and there's lots I had to leave out to keep this under twenty minutes (such as the dog smuggling, allegations/evidence of Amber cheating on Johnny, the staged cell phone incident with Rocky and IO,  Amber's mysterious disappearing bruises that many claim she faked, and of course her failure to pay the money she said she donated to charity). \n\nThere's so much more to discuss, SO I'VE UPLOADED A SECOND VIDEO WITH ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS AT https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_xhpK6Okc \n\nI forgot to add the picture of Amber doing her walk of shame outside court, so here it is.
