            "description": "Johnny Depp and Amber Heard: 5 Times When Johnny Depp Tried To Warn Us \n\nAPOLOGY VIDEO\nWhen Amber Heard smuggled their two pet dogs to Australia, which goes against the country\u2019s laws- the pair came out with an apology video to address the situation. But, to a lot of people the video seemed weird. Although it was Heard herself who did the activity, Depp appeared to be quite off in the video and some even remarked that it looked like he was being forced to show up in front of the camera. We will let you be the judge of it.\n\nPREMIERE OF ALICE THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS\nIn 2016, when Johnny and Amber\u2019s divorce were in the works, he attended a movie premiere at London. When asked if he had any message for his fans, Depp said some lines that sounded extremely weird and even funny to his fans and the audience. However, when we look back now- the message seems almost cryptic, as if he was trying to ask for help.
