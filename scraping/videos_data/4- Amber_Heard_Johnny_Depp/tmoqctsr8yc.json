            "description": "Amber Heard LOSES IT In Court Against Johnny Depp (Lawsuit Update!) \nJohnny Depp vs. Amber Heard is a case many lawyers are running away from. Why? It's one of the greatest controversial cases in the history of Hollywood. The case has been bugged with different stories, influenced by contentious narratives from many parties and untrue reports from tabloids. After their divorce was finalized in 2017 and Johnny Depp paid Amber Heard a whopping amount of $7 million, there are still numerous reports about Johnny Depp and Amber Heard. Johnny Depp sued Heard and News Group Newspapers (NGN) based on the accusations leveled against him and he still lost the case. This has led to lots of tragedy for Johnny Depp as he has lost money and respect in society. With all these going on, is there still a chance for Johnny Depp to regain everything? In this video, we will be discussing how Johnny Depp can WIN against Amber Heard in Court and regain his respect.\n\nSubscribe for celeb drama:  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVRROqlaHIP92Oun1Cl8XAw?sub_confirmation=1\n\n#TheSocial #JohnnyDepp #AmberHeard",
