            "description": "Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have had a chaotic relationship to say the least. Although they divorced in 2016, court battles have continued as accusations of domestic abuse have been claimed by both sides. Today, we take a look back at the timeline of their relationship and each of the disastrous mis-steps along the way.\n\n00:00 - Intro\n0:31 - Happy Beginnings: Johnny Depp & Amber Heard Meet in 2011\n3:43 - Abuse Accusations: The Johnny Depp & Amber Heard Divorce Begins\n8:36 - Recent Court Battles & Lawsuits\n\n\ud83d\udea8 SUBSCRIBE to the Trender channel for more videos:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-RQtY6MpSkCkaTRQP6G8PQ?sub_confirmation=1\n\nRenowned actor Johnny Depp and young actress Amber Heard met in 2011 while producing the film \"The Rum Diary\". The two actually played a couple on-screen for this film, roles that even included a steamy make-out scene. From this point, it became very clear that the two were interested in each other romantically. Although they kept it quiet for some time, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard eventually admitted to being in a relationship.\n\nThis relationship came to light in 2014 when Johnny Depp began wearing a woman's engagement ring - a clear signal he was off the market. The story goes that Johnny Depp bought Amber Heard the engagement ring but it was too big to fit her finger. So, he bought her a new one, and decided to wear the original engagement ring on his own hand. Just a few months later, they would have a private wedding.\n\nJohnny Depp and Amber Heard seemed to share a wholesome relationship at first. Depp was always eager to talk about her and they appeared together more often than not. They even appeared at charity events together and seemed to support each other. They started making headlines for the wrong reasons in 2015 when they flew their Yorkshire Terriers into Australia illegally. Amber Heard faced legal repercussions and the couple also released an apology video at this time.\n\nIn 2016, things went south as the couple officially filed for a divorce. However, things were just getting started. Just days after the divorce filing, Amber Heard filed for a restraining order, claiming that Johnny Depp had been physically abusive with her. This claim was accompanied by apparent bruises shown in photos, as well as a number of stories from Amber Heard. Johnny Depp, as well as many of his friends, family and exes came to his support saying that he would never get physical with a woman. Furthermore, the stories told by witnesses and the police didn't quite line up with Amber Heard's claims.\n\nEventually, Amber Heard dropped her claims and the divorce was settled. She was given $7 million in the divorce settlement and donated every cent of it to charity.\n\nAmber Heard wasn't done though - she continued to speak out about domestic abuse and even published an op ed in 2018 that shared more details about her experiences. Johnny Depp responded with a defamation lawsuit, claiming that her actions would directly damage his career and image - AND that her accusations were false! \n\nThis has developed into a number of court proceedings, cases and lawsuits in which both Jonny Depp and Amber Heard have taken the stand and testified on their experiences. More shocking details of their marriage have come out throughout these processes. For example, Johnny Depp reveals that Amber Heard actually cut off his finger by throwing a vodka bottle at him - an injury that kept him from working, as well as had many tragic complications throughout his recovery. Furthermore, Johnny Depp revealed that Amber Heard once pooped on his bed, a move she claimed was a \"practical joke\". \n\nDespite the evidence seemingly mounting against Amber Heard, Johnny Depp lost his lawsuit against the Sun who claimed he was a \"wife beater\". These ongoings have cost Depp his role in Fantastic Beasts and the Pirates of the Caribbean, as Warner Brothers have distanced themselves from his controversial case. Amber Heard seems to be taking things well, and no announcements have been made about her future films. However, with Aquaman 2 on the horizon, Johnny Depp supporters around the world are petitioning to have Amber Heard removed from the film. Many people see her equally or even more at fault of domestic abuse, and should therefore face the same career repercussions as Johnny Depp.\n\nAmber Heard is scheduled to stand trial in early 2021.\n\n#JusticeForJohnnyDepp #MeToo \n\nWhat're your thoughts on this controversial situation?
