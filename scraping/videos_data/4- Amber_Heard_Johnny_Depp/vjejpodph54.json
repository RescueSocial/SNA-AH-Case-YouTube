(Johnny Depp Victory)\n\nhttps://youtu.be/M1lxGj_KkyQ\n\nAmber Heard Faces 10 Years In Prison For Accusations Against Johnny Depp!!!\n\nhttps://youtu.be/UvsHWTGHmts\n\nThe saga of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp\u2019s messy divorce continues. But this\ntime things went really harsh for Amber Heard. According to the latest reports,\nAmber Heard is at risk of facing jail time because now she is under\ninvestigation by the LAPD for perjury concerning the 2016 incident in which\nDepp allegedly hit his then-wife in the face. For now, Amber Heard is trying to\nget the case dismissed officially.\nI\u2019m going to break it down for you, but before we start, hit that subscribe button\nand make sure you stay till the end to know if the game is over for Amber\nHeard.\nAfter Johnny Deepp's defeat in the British High Court last year, his legal team\nhas plans to appeal. But this is more difficult than it seems because Amber\nHeard\u2019s legal team has tried to get the U.S.-based lawsuit dismissed, arguing\nthat the findings in the U.K. libel suit should be adopted. As for Johnny Depp\u2019s\nlawyer? He\u2019s calling it a \u201chail Mary.\u201d\nApparently, Amber Heard's legal team doesn't want to give up without a fight\nand they've filed a motion to stay discovery on the defamation claims and also a\nmemorandum in support of her motion for leave. Her team believes that due to\nthe libel case results, which found in favor of The Sun after that outlet called\nJohnny Depp a \u201cwife beater,\u201d that the judgment rendered should be applicable\nin the US as well. The motion reads:\nWith the finality of the Judgment, rendered after Mr. Depp presented his best\nevidence and arguments on the exact same factual issues assessed here, Mr.\nDepp should be precluded from seeking yet another bite of the apple, where he\nhas fully adjudicated his dispute and lost. Because of the UK Judgment, the\nentire world may now say, forever, that Mr. Depp is a \u2018wife beater\u2019 and has\ncommitted at least 12 acts of domestic violence against Amber Heard, causing\nher to be in fear for her life. In short, the UK Judgement, now final, permits this\ncourt to end the litigation.\nAccording to Johnny Depp\u2019s lawyer, Benjamin Chew, however, this is not the\nfirst time Amber Heard\u2019s legal team has tried to get the $50 million defamation\n\nlawsuit dismissed. He noted (via Courthouse News) that this is just \u201cthe latest\nHail Mary\u201d from Amber Heard\u2019s legal team and that her team has tried to get\nthe defamation lawsuit thrown out three times over the past two years. Johnny\nDepp's team believes Amber Heard's Op Ed in the Washington Post was\ndefamatory and cost the actor work.\nBut what about the US? We will talk about that in a second, but now, make sure\nyou hit the like button if you enjoy this video. It seems like the cases are moving\nforward in Virginia. However, they have been expensive, with deposition\nrequests and more coming from both sides. Both Amber Heard and Johnny\nJohnny are digging for additional information that can be used against each\nother. Amber Heard, for example, has been looking into Disney and what the\ncompany knew about Johnny Depp\u2019s actions and behavior during his time on\nthe Pirates of the Caribbean films. Speaking of Johnny Depp, he has asserted\nAmber Heard has lied on several occasions, including stealing her ex assistant's\ns*xual as*ult story, and saying she would give their divorce settlement to\ncharity but didn\u2019t. In addition, Amber Heard had asserted Johnny Depp was\nviolent against her but police body cam footage allegedly showed otherwise.\nBut here is a very interesting moment. According to the police officers who\narrived on the scene (when Amber Heard\u2019s friends accidentally called 911\ntwice), there was no visual evidence that a crime had taken place at all. \n...\nThe court date for the main defamation date is in April 2022 and we will make\nsure to be the first ones to deliver the latest news to you.
