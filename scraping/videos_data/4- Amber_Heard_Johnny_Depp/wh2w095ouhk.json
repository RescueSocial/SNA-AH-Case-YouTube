            "description": "\"Me Too Saved My Case\" Amber Heard Admits Exploiting Me Too Against Johnny Depp\nThe Me Too Movement is a social movement that was adopted to advocate for females who underwent sexual violence to talk about their experiences. The goal of this movement has been to show the survivors of sexual violence that they are not alone.\n For the past years, this movement has helped to shine a light on the sexual violence taking place worldwide.\nWhen Amber Heard spoke about her alleged sexual abuse, she used this movement to ensure her story was heard. Many people supported her and showed her love for speaking out.\nHowever, as the court battle between Amber Heard and Johnny Depp continues, it is becoming more evident that Amber was the actual abuser in the relationship.\n If this is true, then it means that Amber took advantage of the Me Too platform to win her case.\n\nHere on Film Streak we are all about the latest spill in Hollywood!
