Having this crucial context helps make Amber's mood at the time clearer. Was she really scared around Johnny Depp? It doesn't look like it here. The way the footage was filmed without his knowledge, her encouragement of him to vocalise his anger, and the way the footage was cut, all adds to impression that Amber Heard is creating a smear campaign around Johnny Depp.\n\nI have done extensive research on narcissism and the effects of narcissistic abuse. I work as a coach specifically with people who have experienced an abusive relationship.
