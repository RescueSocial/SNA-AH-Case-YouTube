Also, do mention #JusticeForJohnny in the comment section below so as to provide him with the justice he truly deserves as well as to feed the algorithm.\n\nSo we guess most of you guys know about the messy divorce case that took place between Hollywood superstar Johnny Depp and the gorgeous Amber Heard. Ever since the proceedings of the divorce took place in 2016, Johnny\u2019s name in the industry has constantly been deteriorating while her name kept rising amongst the ranks of other film stars. \n\nIn complete honesty, no one knew who Amber Heard was. Many film stars from the industry have also claimed of not knowing her until her infamous divorce case was the talk of the town. \n\nDo you guys want to know a certain bunch of deals she struck after her gruesome divorce?\nWell, for starters she was hired by the Warner Bros to play the role of Mera in Aquaman which was such a big deal for her as she had been playing smaller roles till then. This was also accompanied by her being the spokesperson of Loreal Paris, the world-renowned cosmetics brand.\n\nSo, what exactly caused her career to come crashing down?\nNot going to lie, but all the virtual rotten tomatoes that are being thrown at her by the public after the truth about her actions was out, was completely her fault. Amber Heard had strategically planned all her moves carefully all along. She had the prime goal of ruining Johnny\u2019s life as well as career, probably for his money as he was once worth 400 million dollars which kept deteriorating till it touched 150 million dollars as of now and is still dwindling due to the massive amounts he has to pay.\n\nSo, what exactly is the 50 million dollar Johnny Depp filed against Amber Heard, and what are the consequences that she may face in case Johnny wins?\nLong story short, Johnny cut the chase and brought out evidence of leaked audiotapes and text messages that clearly displayed Amber to have abused him.\n\nIn the case of Amber being accused guilty, she would have to face a minimum of 3 years in prison for the reason of manipulation of evidence as well as for defaming her ex-husband. In addition to all of this, there are two petitions out in the open that are gaining a massive inflow of signatures on Change.org, one of them holding the goal to remove her from being cast in Aquaman 2.  \n\nAfter the divorce with the Me Too movement blowing up, of which Johnny was a major victim, Johnny was losing roles, losing money, and losing fame. He even gave out a statement that he was attracted to her for beauty and actually thought she was a supportive woman but only a while later did he notice that she was only with him for the fame and the money. This is also probably why she struck a major deal with the DC movie Aquaman quite easily. I think with that being said, it is safe enough to say that Amber Heard was truly a golddigger, not only for his money but was out to get his fame too.\n\nBut what has Amber Heard said about these claims?\nFirst of all, Amber is a professional liar and that is something we all can agree on now. She has constantly been refuting the truth by stating that the accusations were false and that the world is just going against her based on some false facts.\n\nIn fact, she even went out to lie about her divorce settlement. While she received her divorce settlement for 7 million dollars, she openly claimed that she didn\u2019t want to keep the money of an individual who is involved in domestic abuse and even stated she would donate them to two organizations one being ACLU and the Children's Hospital Los Angeles. The truth did come out that she did not fulfill her promise to both the organizations and just gave a mere few thousands out of the millions that she inherited. \n\nSo back to the latest news about her, is she being kicked out of Aquaman\u2019s sequel?\nWarner Bros have been quiet about this, but the latest reports have stated that she didn\u2019t pass the physical exam which she is to pass as mentioned in the contract. Due to her being out of shape, the movie may outcast her if she doesn\u2019t fix it quickly.  jason momoa\n\n#AmberHeard #JohnnyDeppCase #JusticeForDepp #AmberHeardCase #AmberHeardAudio #JusticeForJohnnyDepp #TheSpotlight",
