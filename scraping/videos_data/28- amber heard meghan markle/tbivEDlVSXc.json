This rumour comes from Daniel Richtman\u2019s Patreon page.\n\nIn this video are going to share the full news on Amber Heard Reportedly Talks For Mera in HBO Max Spinoff. \n\nThis comes after months of speculation that Amber Heard might be replaced as Mera in Aquaman 2, however, it sounds as though Warner Bros. Pictures are very much on Heard\u2019s side. When I say on Heard\u2019s side, I\u2019m of course talking about the whole Amber Heard vs. Johnny Depp case.\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures asked Johnny Depp to step down from the role of Grindelwald in Fantastic Beasts 3. They did this after he lost his libel case against The Sun in the United Kingdom. It was then revealed that Warner Bros. Pictures\u2019 executives are not paying any attention to the online petitions demanding that Heard be removed from Aquaman 2.\n\nThis is something that I\u2019m pretty sure a vast number of DC Comics and DCEU fans will not like to hear. There\u2019s been a huge number of people who are very much against Amber Heard and do not want to see her as Mera in the DCEU any more. That said, the likes of Zack Snyder and other executives over at WB are very much fans of the actress. Zack Snyder actually recently revealed that he would love to work with Heard again. The two of them worked together on the reshoots fos Snyder\u2019s upcoming Justice League cut, which will also be coming to HBO Max.\n\nOther than this, Amber Heard\u2018s DCEU future has been constantly called into question, thanks to the fallout of the actress\u2019 messy divorce from Johnny Depp. However, despite the sizeable backlash against the Aquaman star online, Warner Bros. is sticking by her. That\u2019s definitely how it seems, anyways, given that Depp\u2019s been fired from the Fantastic Beasts franchise while Heard has said she\u2019s excited to return as Mera in Aquaman 2. Not only that, but she might even get her own vehicle as the future queen of the oceans.\n\nAccording to insider Daniel Richtman, Heard has reportedly had talks with the studio about doing a Mera TV show, which would end up on HBO Max. That\u2019s all Richtman, who shared the intel on his Patreon page, has revealed at the moment, but this info does add up with everything we\u2019ve heard about WB\u2019s plans to expand the DCEU onto the small screen and make use of their new streaming service. After all, they\u2019re going to want to create as many offshoots from the movies as they can, so it adds up that they would explore doing more with one of the DC universe\u2019s leading ladies.\n\nOf course, this is just what one source is saying and Beyond the Trailer\u2019s Grace Randolph has painted a very different picture of what\u2019s going on behind the scenes with her own scoops. Randolph\u2019s claimed that Aquaman 2 is being written in such a way to allow for Mera\u2019s role to be reduced if things go against her in her next lawsuit with Depp. Furthermore, a new female supporting lead \u2013 possibly played by an Asian actress \u2013 is apparently being added in to \u201cbalance things out.\u201d Mera has a long DC Comics history, so there\u2019s a lot of material to work with there if WB did end up moving ahead with a spinoff for Amber Heard. And the world clearly wants more from the Aqua-verse, given the first movie\u2019s $1 billion global gross. \n\nBut how do you feel about a possible Mera show, likely following 2022\u2019s Aquaman 2? Would you watch a Mera spinoff TV show on HBO Max? Sound off with your thoughts in the comments section below and If you haven\u2019t subscribed to my channel yet, please do so.
