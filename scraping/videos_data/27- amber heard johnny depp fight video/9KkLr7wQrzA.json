            "description": "The couple stayed at a trailer park in Hicksville, New York, in June 2013, when Ms Heard claims her megastar ex-husband exploded around the campfire when he believed another woman 'flirted' with her - calling Amber a 'lesbian camp counsellor'. In an explosive witness statement, published as she started her second day of evidence at the High Court in London, Ms Heard said: 'He grabbed her by the wrist and threatened her by talking about the pressure that would be needed to break it if she didn't admit that she was trying to flirt with me. Johnny and I went back to our trailer cabin where he continued to fight about it. By that point, the amount of cocaine he had taken affected his ability to make rational sense and he went into a manic state'. Ms Heard the row then spilled into their trailer, which he allegedly 'trashed in a rage'. She said: 'He broke light fixtures and he broke the frosted glass front of a cabinet, and I think he threw glasses at me. He accused me of being the moral police\" and \"lesbian camp counsellor\" and of hiding his drugs. I had a pretty dress on that I'd dyed pink - and loved and wore all the time: he ripped one of the straps and then ripped it off me at the front, claiming to be searching for the drugs'. Amber Heard smiled as she arrived at the High Court hand-in-hand with her girlfriend Bianca Butti for her second day in the witness box after making extraordinary claims about her tumultuous marriage to Johnny Depp.\n\nOriginal Article: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8544073/Amber-Heard-arrives-day-two-explosive-evidence-against-Johnny-Depp.html\nOriginal Video: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/video/newsalerts/video-2214320/Video-Day-Eleven-Johnny-Depp-Amber-Heard-arrive-High-Court.html\n\nDaily Mail Facebook: http://facebook.com/dailymail\nDaily Mail IG: http://instagram.com/dailymail\nDaily Mail Snap: https://www.snapchat.com/discover/Daily-Mail/8392137033\nDaily Mail Twitter: http://twitter.com/MailOnline\nDaily Mail Pinterest: http://pinterest.co.uk/dailymail\nDaily Mail Google+: https://plus.google.com/+DailyMail\n\nGet the free Daily Mail mobile app: http://dailymail.co.uk/mobile",
