Heard played Xebellian princess Mera in the first Aquaman film. She starred alongside Jason Momoa, who portrayed the titular superhero. Aquaman was met with generally positive reviews, and a sequel is currently set for a December 2022 release date.\n\nHeard has recently been at the center of a heated domestic violence dispute with her ex-husband Johnny Depp. Heard filed for divorce from the actor and claims that Depp was verbally and physically abusive during their time together. Depp, on the other hand, says that it was Heard who was abusive, not him. Depp recently sued U.K. tabloid publication The Sun for calling him a \"wife-beater.\" After losing the court case, Depp was asked to step away from Fantastic Beasts 3 by Warner Bros. This has outraged many Depp fans, who have called for Heard to be fired from Aquaman 2. To that end, an online petition demanding Heard be let go has amassed over 1 million signatures.\n\n#aquaman2",
