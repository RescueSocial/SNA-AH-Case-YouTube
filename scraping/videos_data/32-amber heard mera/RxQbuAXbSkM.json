            "description": "Drawing \"Mera\" from the recent epic DC comics' movie release \"AQUAMAN\". She is a fictional character appearing in this movie and her special ability/power is that she can control Aqua/Water and remove water too from any space and surface when needed. As every other drawing, i enjoyed the whole process and  i tried to put as many effort and detailing as i could with patience of course into it. I hope you guys will like this epic artwork of mine. \u270c\ufe0f\ud83d\ude0a #dccomics - #WBbros - #Aquaman - Aquaman - Time lapse video - Speed Drawing - #DawoodShahidArt \n\nTook me approximately 31 hrs, 4 mins and 23 secs of real time to draw this amazing piece of work.\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO MY CHANNEL\n\u25ce Youtube  \nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/dawoodshahidart\n\nFOLLOW\n\u25ce Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/DawoodShahid...\n\u25ce Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/dawminator_...\n\u25ce Snapchat -  https://www.snapchat.com/add/dawminat...\n\nMATERIALS USED\n\u25ce Faber Castell color pencils\n\u25ce Staedtler color pencils\n\u25ce Pelikan color pencils \n\u25ce Mono Art Drawing Pencils 2H, 4H, 2B, 4B, HB\n\u25ce Dollar Pointer 0.3mm\n\u25ce Sakura Gelly Roll Classic Gel Pen\n\nFILMING EQUIPMENT\nNikon D5300 DSLR\n\nEDITING\n\u25ce Adobe Premiere Pro CC 2018\n\u25ce Adobe Photoshop CC 2018\n\u25ce Adobe After affects CC 2018\n\u25ce Adobe Audition CC 2018\n\nMUSIC\n\u25ce Music by Squiid and Niklas Johansson\nEpidemic Sound - https://www.epidemicsound.com/",
