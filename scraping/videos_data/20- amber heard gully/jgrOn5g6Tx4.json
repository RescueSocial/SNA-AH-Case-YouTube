The show explores the magic of 'first love'. Naina a quintessential good girl meets flamboyant Sameer in her school in Ahmedabad. She starts liking him the moment she meets him. But, when she watches Sameer hit another boy she has to tell the truth to the principal of the school. This results in Sameer's suspension and his dislike towards Naina. The same is followed by a series of misunderstanding between Sameer and Naina. In order to avenge his insults Sameer takes a bet with his friends that he will make Naina fall in love with him. What starts as a bet ends up in true love for Sameer as Naina cares for him like no one has ever done. When Naina gets to know about the bet she is heartbroken. Thus, begins Sameer's journey of transformation and penance. This show will be a closer exploration of everyday moments that these two share.\n\nCast:\nAshi Singh as Naina Agarwal \nRandeep Rai as Sameer Maheshwari \nSadiya Siddiqui as Naina's Voiceover\nJiten Lalwani as Sameer's Voiceover\nAyesha Kaduskar as Preeti Agarwal, \nSomendra Solanki as Arjun Agarwal\nKristina Patel as Swati\nAbha Parmar as Beena Agarwal (Taiji)\nSanjay Batra as Tauji\nSachin Khurana as Anand Agarwal (Chachaji)\nMadhusree Sharma as Bela Agarwal (Chachiji)\nChandresh Singh as Rakesh Agarwal\nSanjay Choudhary as Manoj aka Munna\nRaghav Dhir as Pandit\n\nConcept: Sony Pictures Network India PVT LTD\nStory: Shashi Mittal, Vaishali N., and Nageen M.\nScreenplay and Dialogues: Rohit Malhotra and Amit Aaryan\nB.G.
