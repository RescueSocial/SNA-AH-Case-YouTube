Sixteen-year-old Mandy Lane (Amber Heard) is an earthbound angel who has been courted by every available man in her small Texas town to no avail. When the normally reclusive enchantress reluctantly agrees to accompany her new friends on a weekend getaway, the initially irritating adolescent advances made toward her rapidly turn menacing. As the sun falls behind the hills and a volatile mix of drugs, alcohol, and hormones turns explosive, the irreversible propositions of her peers lead to unexpected, and horrifying, consequences.",
