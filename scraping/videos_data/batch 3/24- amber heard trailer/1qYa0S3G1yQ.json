Please subscribe! \ud83d\udc49 http://bit.ly/PetePeppers\n\nWe take a look at the episode 5 trailer and the promotional photos that Showtime released ahead of the next installment of Dexter New Blood (Season 9). Runaway is the fifth of ten episodes in the Showtime special event series Dexter: New Blood. It will debut on 5 December 2021 on Showtime.\n\nThe synopsis for \"Runaway\" reads: Dexter\u2019s method of protecting his son from drugs unleashes his Dark Passenger in a very impulsive way. Meanwhile Angela and Molly take a trip to New York City that leaves them wondering about a well-respected member of the community.\n\nPicking up after episode 4, Dexter has questions about the straight razor he found in Harrison's room. Does he have a Dark Pasenger? Why did he attack Ethan? Will finding the straight razor that looks the same as the Trinity killer's drive him away and back to drugs? \n\n10 years after Dexter Morgan went missing in the eye of Hurricane Laura, everyone in Miami believes he is dead. His son Harrison left for Argentina with Hannah, and Dexter lived under an assumed name in Oregon for a period of time. Now he\u2019s settled in Iron Lake, NY, working at a local fish and game store under the alias Jim Lindsay. It\u2019s been a decade since he killed anyone, and his dead sister Deb has taken the place of his adoptive father Harry as the person he talks to inside his head. In the beginning of the season Harrison tracked Dexter down, and the first season will explore their father son relationship.\n\nIf you want to leave me a tip for my work \ud83d\udcb0 https://paypal.me/petepeppersYT\n\nDexter's new revival cast also includes Julia Jones (Westworld), Alano Miller (Sylvie\u2019s Love), Johnny Sequoyah (Believe), Jamie Chung (Lovecraft Country), Oscar Wahlberg (NOS4A2), Jack Alcott (The Good Lord Bird), and Michael Cyril Creighton. Clancy Brown will play a new villain that Dexter will have to face off against. Clyde Phillips, who served as the showrunner for the four first seasons of Dexter, will return for that role, as well as produce alongside Hall and director Marcos Siega.\n\nAll Images Courtesy of Showtime. \n\nThumbnail Image Photo Credit: Seacia Pavao/SHOWTIME\n\nDexter Stuff:\n\ud83d\udd2a Complete TV series (Blu-ray) - https://amzn.to/3j3yOz1\n\ud83d\udd2a Collector\u2019s Edition - https://amzn.to/3iaF1tR\n\ud83d\udd2a Darkly Dreaming Dexter book - https://amzn.to/3yitrm4\n\ud83d\udd2a Complete book series - https://amzn.to/3rDcyQo\n\ud83e\ude78 Watch Season 1 - https://amzn.to/2TGT4O9 \n\n\n\ud83d\udc49Follow me on Twitter - https://twitter.com/PetePeppers\n\n\ud83d\udc49Follow me on Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/pete.peppers\n\n\ud83d\udc49Join me on Patreon! - https://www.patreon.com/PetePeppers\n\n\ud83d\udc49Like my Facebook Page - https://www.facebook.com/FleaBottomPete/\n\nThe Dexter television series follows the life of Dexter Morgan (Michael C.
