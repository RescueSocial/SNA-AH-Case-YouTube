            "description": "In the early morning hours of June 19, 1982, Virginia and James Campbell were sound asleep when intruders entered their home through a window and entered their bedroom.  As their grandsons slept nearby, six rounds were fired into the defenseless couple.  The two young boys ran to their live-in housekeeper\u2019s room for help and she called 911.\nWhen first responders arrived at the Campbell home in Houston, Texas, the intruders had gone and Virginia and James were dead.  Everyone who knew the Campbells\u2019 peculiar daughter, Cindy, suspected that she was somehow involved, but the evidence was scarce. Cindy attended her parents\u2019 funeral, but she was not welcomed with any enthusiasm from the family. She further implicated herself when she did all she could to collect on her inheritance.  \nJoin us at the quiet end for Betrayal in Blood. As Cindy focused on legal maneuvers to get her parents\u2019 possessions and money, other family members hired a private investigator to get to the truth.  The PI quickly saw Cindy\u2019s boyfriend, David West, as the weaker of the two suspects, and worked to exploit his vulnerabilities to get a confession.",
