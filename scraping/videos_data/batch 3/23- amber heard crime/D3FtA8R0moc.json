            "description": "What is the body language of a psychopath? Erin Caffey is convicted of the capital homicide of her mother and two brothers. What do four of the world's top experts on human behavior and body language make of her Erin Caffey interview with Dr Phil?\n\nPLEASE SUBSCRIBE: https://www.youtube.com/thebehaviorpanel?sub_confirmation=1\nLISTEN TO US ON THE DR PHIL PODCAST: https://bit.ly/BehaviorPanel_PT1\nBUY BEHAVIOR PANEL MERCH: https://teespring.com/stores/the-behavior-panel\nTRUE CRIME PLAYLIST: https://youtube.com/playlistlist=PLguNzIxZa3ERwKVFvXw7ynFGH36PveAtY\nBINGO CARD: https://bingobaker.com/#ae245f7c67e2e893\n\nA teenage girl charged with capital homicide for her role in the demise of her mother and two young brothers agreed to a plea deal that could make her eligible for parole when she's 59, her attorney said. Erin Caffey, 17, accepted the agreement, said defense attorney William McDowell. She had been scheduled to be tried as an adult next month in Hopkins County. Authorities said Caffey, her boyfriend and two other co-defendants plotted against Caffey's parents because they didn't approve of her boyfriend. Caffey was 16 at the time of the crime. Police reports said she and Bobbi Gale Johnson waited in a car down the road from Caffey's home in Alba while boyfriend Charlie James Wilkinson, 19, and Charles Allen Waid, 20, went on a shooting and stabbing rampage before setting fire to the house. Penny Caffey, 37, and her sons Mathew, 13, and Tyler, 8, died in the attack in March. Terry Caffey, 41, was shot five times but escaped from the burning house, saying he recognized Wilkinson shooting him and his wife in their bed, sheriff's officials said. Caffey has since recovered from his gunshot wounds. All four defendants were initially charged with three counts of capital homicide. Prosecutors had said they didn't plan to seek the highest penalty against Erin Caffey. Wilkinson and Waid also avoided the highest penalty in November by pleading guilty for their involvement. McDowell said both would likely receive life sentences with parole\n\nDr. Phil speaks exclusively to Erin Caffey, who is serving two life sentences plus 25 years for plotting a brutal attack on her family that left her mother and two younger brothers without life. In the early morning hours of March 1, 2008, two intruders, armed with a .22-caliber pistol and a samurai sword, entered the family's home and dispatched Erin's mother, Penny, and brothers, Matthew, 13, and Tyler, 8, before setting the house on fire. Her father, Terry, suffered multiple gunshot wounds but managed to escape through a window and crawl to a neighbor's house. Authorities say that Erin, who was 16 at the time, conspired with her boyfriend, 19-year-old Charlie Wilkinson, and two others, Charles Waid, 20, and Bobbi Johnson, 18, to dispatch her parents - because they didn't approve of her relationship with Charlie. For the first time, Erin speaks out about what happened that night. Did she really want her family gone for god? Or, was she the victim of puppy love gone terribly wrong? Plus, Terry opens up about the horrific ordeal. Why does he say he's forgiven everyone involved? And, does he believe his daughter's account of what happened? As Dr. Phil pokes holes in Erin's story, will Terry change his mind about his daughter's role? This program contains graphic images. Viewer discretion is advised.\n\nWhat is the psychology of a psychopath and what is the body language of a psychopath. This episode may help you with how to spot a psychopath.\n\nThe Behavior Panel is a group made up of the world's top body language and behavior experts, Mark Bowden, Scott Rouse, Greg Hartley, and Chase Hughes.
