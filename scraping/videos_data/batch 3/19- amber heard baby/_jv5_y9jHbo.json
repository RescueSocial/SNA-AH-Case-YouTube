Her husband asks her to drop the idea of accepting the twins who would be abnormal. Lata decides to take care of her kids and name them Amber and Dhara.\n\nAbout The Amber Dhara :\n------------------------------------------\nAmber, Dhara are conjoined twins yet are as different as chalk and cheese. Amber Dhara is a bittersweet tale of survival, ambitions, music, and understanding, and most importantly: unconditional love. Abandoned by their father, since the two sisters are joint at the hips, Amber [Sky] and Dhara [Earth] are raised by their mother and grandfather in the idyllic hilly town of Panchgani. From birth, life for these girls has always been a challenge since people stare at them and jeer at their deformities. However, their mother is determined to make them independent and successful. Amber Dhara is a story of a courageous journey where the twins survive various challenges and meet people- good, bad, and ugly. The show emphasizes human values, compassion, and a persistent struggle against all odds.",
