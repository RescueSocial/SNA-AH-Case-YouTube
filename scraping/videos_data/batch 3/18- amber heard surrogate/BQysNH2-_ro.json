But what scientists have now discovered is that it was actually the smoke from the blazes that caused the greatest human loss. For weeks and weeks, vast swathes of the country were choked in a suffocating haze of highly polluted air. It led to a staggering toll. More than 400 deaths, as well as 4000 hospital admissions, have been directly attributed to the bushfire smoke. As Tara Brown reports, everyone hopes this year\u2019s fire season will be less severe, but unless the insidious health threat posed by smoke is fully understood, more lives will be at risk.\n\nWATCH more of 60 Minutes Australia: https://www.60minutes.com.au \nLIKE 60 Minutes Australia on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/60Minutes9 \nFOLLOW 60 Minutes Australia on Twitter: https://twitter.com/60Mins \nFOLLOW 60 Minutes Australia on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/60minutes9\n\nFor forty years, 60 Minutes have been telling Australians the world\u2019s greatest stories.
