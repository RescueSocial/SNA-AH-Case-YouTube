            "description": "Dear Friend,\nI was preaching about the love of Jesus to a very kind gentleman  today and after our brief conversation he said the following to me, \" Sir, I really don't follow Jesus, but I'm so happy to see someone  keep the faith the way you are, whatever you do, don't stop.\" This wasn't the first time I heard from someone having this type of mindset towards faith and religion. It's  as if they are somehow vicariously having hope and faith through mine, like I am their surrogate in Christ.  It is alright for you to be influenced by someone's else's  faith but you can't rely on someone else's faith to save you through association.  If your parents, brothers, sisters, relatives, friends, neighbors, or co workers are saved, you cannot be saved just by knowing and being affiliated with them . You will not receive credit towards your Salvation for such  an alliance. Jesus loves you my friend,  he loves you with all of his heart. Jesus cries when he sees any of his children go astray. There is nothing to fear other than that maybe knowing one day  you will no longer be known and loved by God as you suffer eternal torment. We all must accept Jesus Christ as our Lord and Savior on our own, no one else can do this for us. Jesus loves us all the same, unconditionally and has no favorites. Start your own personal relationship with your Heavenly Father today, he always loves to hear from you. Call out the name of Jesus right now, and he will answer your call. Go in peace my friend and may God continue to bless you for always, Amen.",
