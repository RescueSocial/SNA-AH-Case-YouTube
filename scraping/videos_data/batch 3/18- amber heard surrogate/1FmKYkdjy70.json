            "description": "Gerard Baden-Clay tried to portray himself as 'Mr Middle Class' - a successful small-businessman, proud father and loving and devoted husband. But the real Gerard was the complete opposite. He was an incompetent real estate agent whose business was hemorrhaging money; he was intolerant with his three young daughters and he was a womaniser who wasn't even faithful to his long-term mistress. But why Gerard Baden-Clay thought all his problems could be fixed by killing his beautiful wife Allison, only he knows. So far he's not saying, but after being convicted of murder, he now has a lifetime in prison to think about it. In 2014, 60 Minutes went inside the extensive police investigation which led to Baden-Clay's prosecution.\n\nWATCH more of 60 Minutes Australia: https://www.60minutes.com.au \nLIKE 60 Minutes Australia on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/60Minutes9 \nFOLLOW 60 Minutes Australia on Twitter: https://twitter.com/60Mins \nFOLLOW 60 Minutes Australia on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/60minutes9\n\nFor forty years, 60 Minutes have been telling Australians the world\u2019s greatest stories.
