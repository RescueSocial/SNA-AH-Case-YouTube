There I focused on learning the agency and information pertaining to Victim Services. During my practicum I was able to learn popular laws and policies pertaining to the agency, shadow a victim assistance coordinator, engage in the technological software used by the VACs, access court documents, learn court language, learn helpful resources for crime victims and much more. I got to experience first hand being on the restitution side of justice while realizing my strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats.",
