            "description": "Helle Crafts had secretly been tracking her husband's affairs and was planning on filing for divorce when she went missing. Her husband, Richard Crafts, came up with several stories to explain her sudden disappearance before deciding that he didn't know where she was. It didn't take long for Richard to become the main suspect and even be convicted for her murder, but Helle Crafts' body has never been recovered, resulting in the first murder conviction without a body in Connecticut history. Savannah takes you through the mountain of evidence that surrounded this historic case, as well as the timeline of Helle's final moments as theorized by police and prosecutors.\n \nLove Killer Instincts but hate the ads?
