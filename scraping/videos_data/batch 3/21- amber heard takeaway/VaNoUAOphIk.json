            "description": "Domestic violence, or relationship abuse, affects 12 million people in the United States each year. From what you see, read or hear in the media, it can seem like an issue that only affects certain types of people. The truth is there is no typical case. Domestic violence can affect anyone, regardless of age, race, gender, or background, and the experience is different for every survivor. In this webinar, survivors share their unique stories and experiences, as well as what helped them and what did not. We also discuss ways to support the survivor in your life.",
