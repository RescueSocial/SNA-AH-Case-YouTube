            "description": "Will\u2019s talk, \u201cThe Power of Self-Awareness,\u201d illustrates the transformative potential of giving and receiving feedback.  In his talk, he recounts his first class during his doctoral program at George Washington University when his professor gave him an \u201cA\u201d on his final paper, but an \u201cF\u201d in life.  During their exchange, Professor Jerry B. Harvey introduced Will to his \u201cShadow\u201d and helped him see that the dysfunction in his failed marriage had been largely brought by himself, not his ex-wife. Confronted with this reality, Will discusses the implication of understanding how our Shadow often brings about the very thing we are trying to avoid.  He closes his talk with the broader implications of this exchange, and the moral responsibility we have to give and receive honest and candid feedback with those in our lives. William L. Sparks is the Dennis Thompson Chair & Professor of Leadership at the McColl School of Business at Queens University of Charlotte, where he also serves as the Director of the Office of Leadership Initiatives.  His research is focused on self-actualization and leadership.  His assessment, the \u201cActualized Leader Profile,\u201d is based on Carl Jung\u2019s concept of the \u201cShadow\u201d and has been translated into eight languages.  He is the co-author with Peter C. Browning of the book \u201cThe Director\u2019s Manual: A Framework for Board Governance\u201d (Wiley, 2016) and is the author of the forthcoming book \u201cActualized Leadership: Meeting Your Shadow & Maximizing Your Potential\u201d (SHRM Publishing, 2018). This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at https://www.ted.com/tedx",
