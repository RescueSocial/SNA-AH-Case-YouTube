Streaming on Peacock https://pck.tv/3pOiao8\nReserve your spot in the live studio audience for The Amber Ruffin Show at https://1iota.com/show/1210/the-amber-ruffin-show\n\nLike most Americans, Amber Ruffin was glued to the news this week watching that insane series of events unfold. A mob of Trump-supporting terrorists stormed the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday, in an effort to overturn a fair and legal election and subvert democracy. It has honestly been a lot to take in, and Amber\u2019s personal feelings have ranged from rage to devastation to embarrassment. We\u2019re gonna do our best to talk about it tonight, and to process it, and then we\u2019re gonna push it aside and try to have some fun. Sound good?\n\nShow Synopsis: Amber showcases her signature smart-and-silly take on the news of the week, responding to it all with a charming, late-night mix of seriousness, nonsense and evening gowns.",
