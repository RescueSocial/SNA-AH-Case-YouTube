Quinton is made from sea plasma harvested from vortex plankton blooms, that quickly restore the body's biological terrain. With 78 minerals that are necessary for proper genetic expression, Quinton Isotonic is nearly identical to the concentration of minerals and trace elements found in human blood plasma.\n\nLearn more about Water and Wellness and use discount code longevity for 10% off your purchase!\n\nAbout:\nInternational water scientist Robert Slovak is regarded as one of the world\u2019s foremost water experts.\nAfter retiring from the corporate world, Robert left for Brazil to bring advanced water technology. While working in the rainforest, he contracted a gastrointestinal illness due to unsanitary eating conditions in the small village. It was then Robert was taken to see a biologist for treatment. The scientist recommended Quinton Marine Plasma to eliminate the affliction.
