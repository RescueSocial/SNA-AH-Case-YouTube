            "description": "Jason Momoa REFUSES To Work With Amber Heard...\n\nThe battle between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard truly seems to be one that is never ending and the longer it goes, the more damage it does. It is safe to say that the case is being followed by millions, all coming forward to express their thoughts on the case. With the case gaining tons of attention, a decision was made to make a documentary from Discovery+ that will go through the ins and outs of it all. The more that the court case gets pushed back, the more things seem to change for the two. In terms of their careers, things have been pretty rocky as well, and for quite some time, fans of Johnny Depp believed that Amber should be taken off the Aquaman 2 cast, and that did not happen, but there is a new update on that.
