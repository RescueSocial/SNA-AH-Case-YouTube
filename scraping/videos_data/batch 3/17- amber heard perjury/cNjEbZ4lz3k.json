            "title": "Johnny Depp loses finger? | Watch Johnny Depp Describe His Finger-Severing Fight With Amber Heard",
            "description": "on Monday the Daily Mail published a part of Johnny Depp\u2019s deposition from a lawsuit that, remarkably, is entirely separate from the two other lawsuits he\u2019s currently involved in. The deposition is from 2018, and in it Depp describes his version of a March 2015 incident that left part of his finger severed. In the video, he describes how his finger, which he nicknamed \u201cLittle Richard,\u201d bled like \u201cVesuvius\u201d after then wife Amber Heard allegedly threw a broken vodka bottle at his hand, which was resting on a marble bar counter. They were fighting, he said, because he brought up post-nuptial papers to sign.\n\u201cI was trying to get the finger back, you know,\u201d he said in the video, with a smile. \u201cAnd then deal with the insanity of having had my finger chopped off by this woman that I was married to.\u201d (Audio of medical staff searching for the finger was also leaked to the Daily Mail on Tuesday).\nHeard\u2019s story, which she told in her own deposition at the time, differs dramatically. She said that the fight was sparked over her former co-star Billy Bob Thornton. While she alleged that Depp hit her with one hand, he was \u201cslamming a hard plastic phone against a wall with his other until it was smashed into smithereens. While he was smashing the phone, Johnny severely injured his finger, cutting off the tip of it.\u201d At some point later that night, Depp had written on the walls with a mixture of paint and the bloody finger, \u201cBilly Bob\u201d and \u201cEasy Amber.\u201d (Depp reportedly denies all of her account, except for the writing on the wall).\nThe Daily Mail also has a blurred out photo of the severed fingertip, which you may click over to see if you choose, but a warning: the blurring is not sufficient for the faint of heart.\nThe deposition video is from a lawsuit against Depp\u2019s former lawyer, Jake Bloom, a suit that was eventually settled in October. The actor accused the lawyer of collecting $30 million during their 18 years working together. (A settlement was reached, though a Bloom spokesperson said he \u201cpaid only a \u2018fraction\u2019 of the original demand.\u201d) Depp discussed the severed finger in his deposition, according to the Daily Mail, because the lawyer in question was the one who drew up the post-nup that he claims caused Heard to lose her temper.\nWhen asked to comment on the leaked video, and whether or not it could be brought to bear in either of Depp\u2019s two current lawsuits, his lawyer, Adam Waldman told Vanity Fair, \u201cAn endless river of evidence keeps flowing up from the past, obliterating the lies Amber Heard and her co-conspirator friends told under oath to support her abuse hoax in 2016. In both the U.K. and U.S., the penalty for perjury\u2014false statements made under oath, defrauding the court to obtain a temporary restraining order, manufacturing and submitting fake \u2018evidence\u2019\u2014is prison. What you say under oath, like all evidence, can and will be used against you.\u201d\nFor its part, Heard\u2019s team said in a statement, \u201cJust last month it was revealed in a U.K. court that Mr. Depp admitted to cutting off his own finger and sent multiple text message to his doctor about it. Once again, the evidence is inconsistent with Mr. Depp\u2019s self-serving account.\u201d\nDepp is currently suing the News Group Newspapers over an article in the Sun that called him a \u201cwife beater.\u201d (Both Heard and Depp\u2019s appearances in person in a London court have been postponed due to coronavirus, though not for lack of trying). And a second suit will move forward in a Virginia court over a Washington Post op-ed in which Heard described her alleged experiences as a domestic violence victim without naming Depp. A judge ruled earlier this\n month that the case would not be dismissed, as Heard had requested.\n\n#johnnydeppamberheardfight\n#johnnydepp\n#AmberHeard",
