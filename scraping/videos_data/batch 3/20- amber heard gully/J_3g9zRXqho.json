            "description": "Paralegal Reacts To Eric George Deposition -- Said Amber Heard LIED?! JOHNNY DEPP VS. AMBER HEARD\n\nToday we are discussing the deposition of Eric George, Amber Heard's former lawyer in her divorce case. One of the things I found interesting was when Eric George referenced a lie Amber told, I have included screenshots. Please note this was leaked on Twitter, I did not leak this, I am simply reporting on information that was made public by somebody else. Hopefully, the Judge grants Johnny a second deposition as I am sure he learned very little from this one. What do you think???
