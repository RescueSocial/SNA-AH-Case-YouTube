I want to drive home that this is deeper than the issue at hand. Just because an alleged victim is unlikable does not mean they're not a victim. Just because an alleged perpetrator is likable does not mean they're innocent. There are no perfect victims.\n\nBitch Media article:\nhttps://www.bitchmedia.org/article/johnny-depp-amber-heard-cycles-of-abuse",
