            "description": "The star of \"Aquamen\" Amber Heard never hid from the public his bisexuality, alternating relations with men and women. The 33-year-old actress decided to start the New Year with a passionate romance with a representative of her gender.\n\nPaparazzi caught Heard for hot kisses with 38-year-old cinematographer Bianca Butti. The couple fell into the lens of photographers when they left a luxury hotel in one of the resort towns of Southern California. The girls gently hugged and did not take their eyes off each other, then they left together on a vintage Ford Mustang Amber. It is noteworthy that the actress has been wearing a medical boot on her left foot since the beginning of the year. The details of the incident, after which she had to put in a cast, Hurd did not disclose.\n\nAbout the new beloved actress, it is known that she is from Los Angeles and works as a graphic designer. Last year, Bianche was re-diagnosed with breast cancer. The first time she found out about a terrible diagnosis four years ago, but after treatment the disease receded. Now she again has to fight with oncology, and Hurd - steadfastly support his chosen one.\n\nRecall that after a scandalous divorce from Johnny Depp and a relationship with billionaire Ilon Mask, Amber Heard enjoyed loneliness for a long time and did not advertise her personal life, apart from a romantic date with the director of the film \u201cIt\u201d, Andres Musketti.",
