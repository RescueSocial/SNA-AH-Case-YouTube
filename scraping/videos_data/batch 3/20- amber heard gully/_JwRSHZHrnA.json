Trailer mashups are often created for a movie that does not exist now or to change the genre of an existing film. These are derivative works and as such, may find protection from copyright claims under the doctrine of fair use. The trailer mashups are not only a user-generated form of digital creativity but a way to create anticipation for future releases, working in tandem with current movie trailers. Movie trailers are designed to give minimal plot detail and to create hype and anticipation. Fan-made trailer mashups allow the audience to perform their own cinematic spin on current movie footage. This allows the trailer to focus on a specific actor or portion of the film. It could even change the plot or genre of the film entirely.\n\nIF YOU WANT TO PROMOTE YOUR MOVIE TRAILER ON OUR CHANNEL THEN CONTACT US\nPlz, Email Me: moviecruzzerworld@gmail.com\n\nWe Follow All Youtube Term's",
