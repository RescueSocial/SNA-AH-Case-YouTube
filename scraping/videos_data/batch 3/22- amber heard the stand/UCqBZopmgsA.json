            "description": "Whoopi Goldberg\u2019s been eyeing the role of The Stand\u2019s Mother Abagail for the past 26 years. As she explained to Vanity Fair, she wanted the part back in 1994, when Stephen King\u2019s epic was first getting the miniseries treatment at ABC, though the role eventually went to Ruby Dee. Mother Abagail is the 108-year old prophet who, thanks to her line of communication with God, becomes the unifying force behind the Boulder Free Zone, a community of peaceful apocalypse survivors. \u201cI\u2019ve been fighting with not making her the Magic Negro because she\u2019s complicated,\u201d Goldberg said, a longtime fan of King\u2019 work. She\u2019s part of a sprawling cast of stars assembled to bring the author\u2019s best-selling novel to life yet again\u2014this time as a nine-episode miniseries for CBS All Access\u2014which (with King\u2019s blessing) looks to update the classic tale of good versus evil for a modern audience. During a virtual press junket ahead of The Stand\u2019s premiere, The A.V. Club was given the opportunity to speak with Goldberg and her co-stars about the legacies of their iconic characters; Greg Kinnear, Jovan Adepo, Amber Heard, Nat Wolff, Odessa Young, Katherine McNamara, and James Marsden all weighed in on what it means to step into these well-known roles, and shared how they hope to highlight different shades to King\u2019s work.\n\nThe Stand premieres on CBS All Access on December 17, and will air new episodes weekly ever Thursday.\n\nVisit: http://avclub.com\r\nLike: http://www.fb.com/theavclub\r\nFollow: http://www.twitter.com/theavclub\n\n#WhoopiGoldberg #TheStand #StephenKing",
