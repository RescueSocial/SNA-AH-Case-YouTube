We never really learn why they chose it. First it\u2019s Fred, who is deposited as seen a few seconds ago. Then Walker, who strikes a deal with Kayce to live. He might be the only person to ever return. Then it\u2019s referred to as the place to take Wade Marrow in Season 3 and he eventually his body gets dumped there, along with his son. \n\nIt\u2019s during that moment in Ep. 9 of Season 3, called \u201cMeaner Than Evil,\u201d that we learn the historical nature of the train station. Lloyd tells Walker that it\u2019s a location used to dump bodies by all sorts of people because it\u2019s in a lawless land. There are no residents and no cops. It\u2019s 100 miles of human-less real estate so the bones just pile up. And, as it turns out, there is a nub of truth to this. The Train Station may very well be based on a real-life lawless land.  \n\nIf you're new, Subscribe! \u2192 http://bit.ly/subscribe-taste-of-country \r\n\r\nDownload the app \u2192 http://tasteofcountry.com/app/ \r\nGo here \u2192 http://tasteofcountry.com/\r\nLike us \u2192 https://www.facebook.com/thetasteofcountry\r\nFollow us \u2192 https://twitter.com/tasteofcountry\r\nGet our newsletter \u2192 http://tasteofcountry.com/newsletter/\r\n\r\n#CountryMusic #Nashville",
