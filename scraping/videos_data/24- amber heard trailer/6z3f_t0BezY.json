Nobody really knew what to expect from it for multiple reasons, given that it was following the disappointing release of Justice League; centered on a character who had never had his own live-action solo movie. Naturally, the excitement that the project generated immediately led Warner Bros. to solidify a future for the franchise, and within a few weeks of Aquaman\u2019s release we learned about their plans to develop an Aquaman 2.\nIt\u2019s typical for Hollywood studios to try and produce sequels as quickly as they possibly can. After all, they don\u2019t want to let the heat of a burgeoning franchise die down, and the more time that passes means there\u2019s more opportunities for audiences to be distracted by other big properties. That being said, Aquaman 2 is taking an extra minute to find its way to theaters, as Warner Bros. has announced that the blockbuster follow-up is currently scheduled to be released on December 22, 2022.\n\naquaman, aquaman movie trailer, justice league, justice league post credits scene, justice league trailer, justice league aquaman, justice league superman returns, aquaman teaser, aquaman trailer, aquaman jason momoa, jason momoa, amber heard, superman vs justice league, wonder woman 2, shazam, infinity war trailer, star wars the last jedi, justice league deleted scenes,Are they making a Aquaman 2,Is there gonna be a Aquaman 2,Will James Wan Director Aquaman 2,Who is Aquaman's worst enemy,Will there be a Wonder Woman 2,Is there an end credit scene in Aquaman,How long is the movie Aquaman 2019,Will there be another Superman movie",
