Danielle Moore Nazzaria Grendanin Jazmyn Lynn Queen James Johnson ---------------------------------- \nEditing Details: Creating Aquaman 2 was challenging because I was not into this franchsie. But my DC lover side made me appreciate this film more. I watched this film once and I thought it was decent. The fresh clips are not too hard to find since there are plenty of cosplay to chose from. To avoid making this dream trailer feel low budget I chose clips from the Aquaman movie it self. Such as the Atlantic City. The music was great, despite the lack of humor the soundtrack by THE EQUALIZER 2 trailer #2 was great because it had lots of trailer fling to it. The main actor himself had lots of movies to chose from since this is the first time I made a project about him. Not the first Aquaman project though, I did one back in 2020 for one of the trailer style of the infinity saga. The line \"is only a myth\" is great connection to how Aquaman is a mystical character. The film SEE had great lines talking about \"gods\" that perfectly fits this dream trailer. Speaking of perfectly fits, the clip with Aquaman attacks the bad guy we get a transition to a guy getting attacked in the water. \n\nVIDEO CREDITS | AQUAMAN | SEE (2019) | 3 DAYS TO KILL | THE HOLLOW | THE UNDOING | TOGO (2019) | CANDYMAN (2020) | CREATING AQUAMAN'S SUIT | IKON COLLECTIBLES 1:1 BY COSPLAY CHRIS | AQUAMAN COSPLAY BY MIKE KIRTS | AQUAMAN'S MERA COSTUME | DIY AQUAMAN COSPLAY TATTOOS BY THE WOODLAND ELF | MULHER MARAVHILHA VS AQUAMAN BY FRANKLIN FERNANDES MUSIC CREDITS | THE EQUALIZER 2 TRAILER #2 SOUNDTRACK ---------------------------------------\n\n \u25baMusic Credit: YouTube Audio Library and thanks to Feature Presentation YouTube Channel for providing the trailer soundtracks.",
