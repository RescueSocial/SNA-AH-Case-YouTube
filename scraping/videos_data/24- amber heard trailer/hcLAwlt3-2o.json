            "description": "Holly\u2019s lifelong dream was to fall in love with the perfect guy, so when she meets skeptical, Christmas-hater, Chris, she\u2019s not interested. That doesn\u2019t stop Great Aunt Lillian (who\u2019s never wrong) from \u201cpairing\u201d them together\u2014in front of a crowd. Real feelings start to emerge for both Chris and Holly as their friends and family find ways to throw them together, but Holly\u2019s mistakes and Chris\u2019 stubbornness drive a wedge that seems too overwhelming to overcome. But their time together will teach both Chris and Holly lessons about honesty, family, and love.\n\nDirected by Annie Poling Swet\nStarring Micah Lynn Hanson, Tim Llewellyn, Aubrey Shimek Davis\n\n\u25ba Subscribe to get all the latest content https://bit.ly/3aOfZft\n\n\u25ba About \nEncourageTV brings you the best selection of FREE Family-Friendly, Kid-Friendly, Faith-Friendly and Christian content available anywhere!
