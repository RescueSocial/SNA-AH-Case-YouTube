In fact, when Aquaman was released earlier in the year 2018, he was the only talk of Hollywood! \n\nDue to Aquaman\u2019s major success, soon after its release, the second sequel to the movie was announced to be premiered in the year 2022. Unfortunately, with the Me Too movement targeting so many A-listers, one of the cast members was accused of being a part of this bandwagon. Any guesses on who fell off the wagon and joined in amongst the list of abusers? Yes, it was Amber Heard!\n\nAmber Heard has been making headlines regularly for almost 2 years now, especially after her divorce from Johnny Depp. Initially, people assumed her to be the poor victim in the chaotic scenario she had going on with Johnny Depp. At one point, we were pretty convinced that she was the victim after she posted her pictures of the scars that she had obtained due to being a victim of domestic violence. \n \nWhat were Amber\u2019s claims?\n\nAmber Heard proved to be the biggest victim of the year, with her constant rants on social media as well as her claiming Johnny Depp to be an evil man with anger issues. She kept throwing out lies until one day Depp was forced to sue her, hence causing the famous chaotic court case to make repeated headlines.\n\nHow did Ambers Claims backfire?\n \nJohnny Depp was proven innocent to his ex-wife\u2019s claims after a leaked conversation between the two was released, proving that in fact, it was Johnny Depp who was being victimized. This surely didn\u2019t save the mess he was in but made the likes of big platforms such as Disney apologize to him for believing the allegations.\n\nHow did this news worsen?\n\nThe Me Too movement was trending and each day a new celeb was being called out for inappropriate behaviour of misconduct with the co-workers, especially the female ones. Due to this being embedded in the minds of all, Depp was the most likely candidate to get abuser-bashed for his immoral actions.\n\nDue to her alleged accusations, Johnny Depp\u2019s career was quite miserable. In fact, the production teams that loved working with his massive talent started to reject his role in the movies. And all this was due to the fault of Amber and her bunch of lies. Imagine not having Jack Sparrow in the next Pirates of the Caribbean sequel!\n\nWhat\u2019s the big question now?\n\nWhat\u2019s racing across everyone\u2019s mind is what does Amber Heard\u2019s co-star, Jason Momoa, have to say about this? \n\nAs you may be aware, Warner Bros just like all other entertainment entities, have the contents of the contract that they sign with the actors, strictly specifying them to follow privacy protocols, leaving the actors with little to nothing left to say about what goes on with the production of their movie as well as any other activities that take place under the roof of the Warner Bros. \n\nJason Momoa has been adhering to the protocol and has not stated anything about the scandal his co-star was involved in. It shows that he doesn\u2019t care about this blow -up or change in the cast, or that he has been asked by Warner Bros. to keep this situation on the low.\n\nBut, was Momoa and Heard compatible in real life as much as they seemed on screen?\n\nRumor has it that the Momoa and Heard were not as compatible as they seemed on the screen. With them being actors from two different worlds, it is sure to be quite a clash in the studios. But others state that they were actually good together since they were complete opposites and that opposites attract. Even though they seem great together on the red carpet, always having fun, the truth behind this fact is still left unknown!\n\nWould Momoa\u2019s word and stance on this scenario change the fate of who plays the role of Mera?\n\nMost probably, yes. Without Jason, there is no Aquaman. In fact, the entire success behind Aquaman was 90% due to Jason Momoa\u2019s efforts in making the storyline as lively. Without him, reaching this milestone would have been highly impossible. On a serious note, it\u2019s highly possible that rather than risking their biggest asset, Warner Bros. would not sacrifice their king for the sake of Amber!\n\n#AmberHeardFired #JasonMomoa #Aquaman2 #JusticeForDepp #JohnnyDepp #DeppandHeard #Depp",
