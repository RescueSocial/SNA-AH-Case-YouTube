The anticipation builds day by day while fans of the actors wait for the official court hearing. Amber Heard is starting to create a pretty bad name for herself, but now might be the time for an offical apology to Johnny Depp. A lot of other celebrities have been dragged into this mess - one is the Tesla billionaire, Elon Musk (for some interesting reasons). And it does not seem like Elon Musk is quite done in this case, as Depp is not done dealing with him.\n\nIf you enjoyed the video make sure to like on the video and consider subscribing! \n\nCheck out these videos for more insights in the Johnny Depp and Amber Heard case:\nJohnny Depp OFFICIALLY REHIRED | Back In a New Pirates of the Caribbean 6 Movie? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utozMdfngVk\nEmilia Clarke REACTION Before Replacing Amber Heard in Aquaman 2! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYXp9wXHUWw\n\n#AmberHeardLied #JohnnyDepp #JusticeForJohnny #AmberHeardApology #FilmStreak",
