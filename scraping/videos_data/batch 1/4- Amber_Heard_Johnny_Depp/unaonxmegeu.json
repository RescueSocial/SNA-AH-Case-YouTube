            "description": "Johnny Depp's BIG COURT WIN - Amber Heard Feeling Desperate...\n\nOver the past couple of years Johnny Depp has been fighting head to head against his ex-wife Amber Heard. Johnny Depp and his legal team have been going above and beyond in order to provide the court with the evidence that Amber Heard has been telling multiple lies on multiple different accounts. Since the official hearing date has been pushed back, this just allows both parties to gather all that they need to build their case. The situation between these two movie stars is one that has constantly kept everyone who has followed it on their feet. Johnny Depp has successfully been able to secure evidence that will allow him to attempt to prove his innocence and it seems that Amber is turning desperate.
