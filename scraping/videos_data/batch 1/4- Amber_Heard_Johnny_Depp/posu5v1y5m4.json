Most people I know are either \u201cTeam Johnny\u201d or \u201cTeam Amber,\u201d\nand they\u2019ve spent a lot of time discussing who the real abuser in the troubled relationship\nmust have been. However, Johnny Depp was trying to warn everyone about Amber Heard\nand who she is for real.\nOver the past several months, we\u2019ve heard from Depp\u2019s friends, fans, and exes who all claim\nhe could have never mistreated Amber because of his sweet and gentle nature. And there\nhave been many doubts cast upon Heard, leading people to think she\u2019s the core abuser, a\nnarcissistic gold digger, and ultimately, a liar. Adding to this we have Johnny Depp\u2019s hints\nand attempts to tell the truth about his ex wife.\nAmber Heard is not an obvious abuser\nWe like to imagine that the real abuser is always some sort of obvious monster, and that\nwe\u2019re not going to be manipulated by any wolves in sheep\u2019s clothing. Do you remember that\n\u2018message\u2019 to Johnny Depp\u2019s fans when he was \u2018jokingly\u2019 saying: \u201cI\u2019m scared to death, I\u2019m\nfrightened and I don\u2019t know what to do, I am confused and I want to go home\u201d. This phrase\nmade everyone laugh but what if it was Johnny\u2019s cry for help? He couldn\u2019t tell anyone what\nwas going on between him and Amber Heard (before the legal fight) as he is a good person\nand he didn\u2019t want to show people their dirty laundry.\nAmber Heard pretended to be a victim\nThe myth of the obvious abuser was very convenient for Amber Heard and of course\neventually it did more harm than good, even for Amber. People easily wind up defending\ntheir guilty friends and blaming the victims. We might mistake self-defense and coping\nmechanisms by victims as \"proof\" of their crimes. Victims of domestic violence may even\nuse violence themselves against their abusers, and it can be very difficult for outsiders to\nestablish which person is the primary abuser and which person is the primary victim. Johnny\nDepp was trying to warn everyone she was a liar but he couldn\u2019t prove he wasn\u2019t guilty.\nAmber Heard had a strong tactic - to lie in a court. But eventually body language experts\nanalysed the video back in 2016 court deposition. First everyone thought Amber Heard\nbehaved really weird because she was stressed and scared. But according to body\nlanguage experts, she just behaved like a typical liar.\nSevered Finger\nBeing a real man Johnny Depp didn\u2019t tell anyone what happened with his finger for real and\nwas even trying to hide the facts and lied to his friends about the incident! Obviously, he\nwanted to protect Amber Heard. During the Venice Film Festival 2015 conference Dakota\nJohnson obviously asked Johnny Depp about his finger, Johnny answered vaguely, he\navoided the question with the joke but it seems Dakota didn\u2019t believe him. She knew:\nsomething was wrong. Just notice, Dakota gave him a look that says that she knows more\nthan he lets on.\n\nAmber Heard made him lie for her\nYou may remember the story about Amber Heard\u2019s dogs and that she had some problems\nwith them. In July 2015 Amber Heard brought Yorkshire terriers Pistol and Boo to the\ncountry illegally. And to avoid problems Amber Heard asked her former employee Kevin\nMurphy to lie under oath after she was charged with bringing her two dogs to Australia\nillegally. Murphy claimed Heard pressured him to commit perjury about the travelling terriers\nor risk losing his job. \u201cShe wanted me to say essentially that it was my fault in one way or\nanother that the paperwork wasn\u2019t completed, so that I could take the blame for her,\u201d Murphy\nsaid. And of course, she asked Johnny Depp to help with this problem. Isn\u2019t it a warning sign\nof ab**se? But probably Johnny Depp had to go along with everything Amber wanted\nbecause he truly loved her. But she literally forced Johnny to help her with the problem and\nhe got in trouble as a result.\n\n\nBinge Watch - Binge Watch is the best source of the latest celebrity news.
