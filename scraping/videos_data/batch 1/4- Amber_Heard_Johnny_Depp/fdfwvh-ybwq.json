            "description": "\"SHE DESTROYED HER OWN CAREER\" Johnny Depp Finally Reacts To Amber Heard | Celebrity Craze\n\nJohnny Depp finally speaks on how these court cases have affected Amber Heard's career. Let's just say he does not feel too bad for here. \n\nHere is a look at Amber Heard and all the things that she\u2019s done to Johnny Depp, to fans, and more that have painted her in a more monstrous light that\u2019ll no doubt end her career. How much longer do you think it\u2019ll take for Hollywood to realize who Amber Heard truly is?\n\nWith the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. \n\nEver since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.\n\nNow it turns out that Amber Heard may have not written the statement or OP ED in accusations against Johnny Depp. This could another case of defamation or fraud. Let's break it down in today's video.\n\n#AmberHeardJail\u200b #AmberHeard\u200b #AmberHeardCourt\u200b #JusticeForJohnny #JusticeforJohnnyDepp\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-lZTlG05ETwyjDS1JQCv3w/featured?sub_confirmation=1\n\nCHECK OUT OUR OTHER VIDEOS!\n\nJohnny Depp - Amber Heard Drama Playlist: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlEaTEO50CGZeBBelsB9UPo7VTXRu_zcu\n\nDavid Dobrik Drama Playlist: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlEaTEO50CGZvMGJgSPbWh2dnA6a1d1aX\n\nJustin Bieber Drama: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlEaTEO50CGZTJh_XpqH_BjfmbY4sRJJD\n\nKardashian Family Drama: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlEaTEO50CGZOHixd1sAisB2wgS5JzLua\n\nThis Channel intends to provide the most breaking celeb news, drama and controversies all in one place.
