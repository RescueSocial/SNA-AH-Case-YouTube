            "description": "#johnnydepp #amberheard #metoo #timesup\n\nHey everyone!  Welcome back!  Or if you're here for the first time, I welcome you just the same!\n\nThis is a pretty straight forward video, not so much the analytical breakdowns I usually do.  Although there is a little bit of that in this one as well.\n\nThis video is exactly what the title states.  Amber Heard, during her 2016 deposition, admitted to multiple violent assaults against Johnny Depp.  Admissions she was probably hoping would never see the light of day.  I use official court sworn transcriptions of her own words, so there leaves no doubt.\n\nThis video will be referenced in my future videos, so if you plan to watch any of those, please give this one a watch as well.  Future videos will be breaking down individual moments of alleged abuse (some of which link directly to her admissions here) and will include evidence, witness testimony, and anything else that helps us get closer to the truth.\n\nMy previous videos and Twitter handle will be linked below.  When I'm active making videos, I'm not as active on Twitter and vice versa.\n\nThanks for checking this one out!  I really appreciate it.  Feel free to like and share.
