            "description": "10 Times Johnny Depp Tried To Warn Us About Amber Heard\nThe question of \u201cwhy?\u201d is something that has been popping up a lot in regards to the case between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard. Such as \u201cwhy is this going this far?\u201d, \u201cwhy hasn\u2019t Johnny Depp been cleared yet?\u201d, \u201cwhy would Amber Heard do these things?\u201d, \u201cWhy did Johnny not come forward sooner about this?\u201d and so on and so forth. But while we don\u2019t have all the answers to those questions, we are able to look back in hindsight and see if Johnny Depp tried to warn us about all that was going on with his relationship with Amber Heard. We\u2019ll show some examples of this.
