            "description": "Jason Momoa REACTS To #BoycottAquaman2 - Fans Want Amber Heard FIRED!!!\n\nOne would think that following the release of the Aquaman 2 movie title, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, that fans would get excited about it all, however that isn't exactly the case here. Ever since the absolute war that started between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard, it seems that there is constantly one thing after another that is taking place. When Johnny Depp was originally fired from the Pirates of the Caribbean series and lost his role as Captain Jack Sparrow along with his role with Warner bros, individuals following the case were hoping that the same thing would happen to Amber Heard, but that doesn\u2019t seem to be true. Although fans strived to get Amber Heard cut from the beginning of this case, it was a bit tough however with the release of the new Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom title, the #FireAmberHeard movement seems to have made its return.
