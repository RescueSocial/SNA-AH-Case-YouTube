This divorce is explosive in every way that is affecting their image, celebrity status, and finances. Johnny Depp has been in the public eye since his first experience in the acting world in 1984 when he made an appearance in Nightmare on Elm Street. This movie was just the start of his career, and he is seen as one the most prominent film stars of all time. Not only is he an actor, but he is a producer and musician as well. His resume is long and vast, but his marriage to Amber Heard has been a short and destructive ride. \nJohnny Depp's early life was not cut and dry with a happy little childhood. He was quiet and withdrawn with drug use and self-harm starting at the age of 12, and this pattern has set a stage that will only worsen and affect his behavior in all areas of his life. His life only got worse when his parents split up, giving Johnny the responsibility at 15 to collect the child support since he was the youngest. These events are creating the pattern of failing relationships and mental health that are currently bringing him down. \nJohnny Depp has had various romantic relationships, actresses, and models, and not all ended disastrously as his current legal battle. The relationship before Amber Heard was with Vanessa Paradis, his partner for 14 years, and they share two children. There are many speculated reasons for this split, and none of them are centering around any abuse claims. The reports are Vanessa's dislike of his mother, Depp became bored, and a potential relationship with Amber Heard. Their relationship did start the same period as Depp and Paradis's separation. Again I will say in this relationship of 14 years, and there were no allegations of abusive behavior. \nAmber Heard files for divorce under irreconcilable differences on May 23rd,2016, just three days after his mother's death, but this rocky marriage of 15 months has many sides to it. Heard was seeking spousal payments and claiming verbal and physical abuse but this divorce and court proceedings go beyond civilized and straight revenge starts. Depp's behavior has become erratic throughout their marriage, and his silent cries for help are finally being seen and heard. Depp denies all allegations and states he will not respond to lies about his personal life, but this is far from the end. \n\nCeleb Trending is the #1 Youtube to get caught up on the latest news and trends about your favorite actors, athletes, political figures, and more!
