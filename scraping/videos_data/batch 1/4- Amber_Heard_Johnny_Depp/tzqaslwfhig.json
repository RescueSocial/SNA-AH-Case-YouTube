            "description": "MORE Celebrities Who Defended Johnny Depp Against Amber Heard!!!\n2020 has not been an easy year for anyone especially not for Johnny Depp. From his loss against the high-profile libel case involving the Sun and his ex-wife Amber Heard, one can say that Depp has really been in an intense battle throughout the year. However one thing that is looking good for Depp is the support that he has been receiving from millions, even including the support of some big name celebrities. For quite some time people were slowly starting to believe Amber Heard but that was only until an audio was leaked that quickly made people say she was the guilty one in this situation. There are so many scandals in the celebrity world but this is one that is causing quite the uproar as people are striving to bring justice to Johnny Depp. Allow us to break down the details of the scandal, but also provide you with a list of those celebrities who are supporting Depp during this time. \n\nCould it actually be true that Johnny Depp is the one who is innocent in this entire situation? Why would Amber Heard spread and display such false allegations about him? If Johnny Depp truly is innocent then, will Amber Heard be at risk of losing her status? Is there any way for her to defend herself after the audios that have been leaked? Let us know what you think in the comments down below!\n#JohnnyDepp #AmberHeard #JusticeForJohnnyDepp",
