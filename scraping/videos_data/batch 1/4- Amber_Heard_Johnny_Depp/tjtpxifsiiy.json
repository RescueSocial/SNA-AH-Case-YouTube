            "description": "Perhaps the whole internet or even the whole world are either following the case of Johnny Depp and Amber Heard\u2019s tumultuous relationship, or at least know something about it. Johnny and Amber\u2019s story started in flames when the two met on the set of the movie \u201cThe Rum Diary\u201d, in which Johnny played a journalist who was immediately smitten with Amber\u2019s character. However, this spark portrayed in the film continued off-screen, where Amber Heard told Vogue \u201cworking with Johnny was something else. It was better than I ever imagined, which is really saying something.\u201d After the end of the said film, the two started dating. Depp was then sharing his life with partner Vanessa Paradis whom he lived with for 14 years and whom he had two kids with, while Heard was with her then girlfriend Tasya van Ree. When Johnny and Amber started dating in 2012, they both ended their previous relationships. The start of their romance seemed quite good, but where and how did it end up so messy? And who were the people who bravely took a stand to help Johnny Depp? Let\u2019s find out, but first, make sure that you hit that subscribe button, smash that like button and hit the notification bell for more updates. Now, let\u2019s have a short recap of Amber and Johnny\u2019s roller-coaster ride on lover\u2019s lane.\n\nIn 2014, Amber was spotted wearing an engagement ring, stirring rumors. This rumored engagement did not stay secret long enough, as Johnny himself confirmed this in an interview. In 2015, after several years of dating, Johnny married Amber in a very private ceremony in their home in Los Angeles. However, their married life did not seem to go as well as expected, as Amber filed for divorce just after a year after their marriage, and accused Johnny Depp of physical abuse. Well, that\u2019s what you call \u201cdisappearing as fast as it came\u201d. Together with the divorce filed, Amber also filed a temporary restraining order against Johnny, saying that the actor usually hurt her while under the influence. She also alleged that while filing for divorce, Johnny threw a phone at her, bruising her face, an accusation that Johnny denied, and investigators found false. \n\nThe divorce was finalized in 2017, a year after Amber filed for it. However, the former couple\u2019s lawsuits were far from over. In 2018, Amber wrote an op-ed to The Washington Post saying that she was mistreated, and in which she spoke about the treatment of women in these types of court cases. \nHe was asked to resign from his role as Grindelwald in the Fantastic Beasts 3.  Due to this, other actors perceived this as \u201cunfair\u201d treatment of Depp and many stars stepped out to defend him. Many fans, friends, and co-stars defended him and what was shocking was that his previous lovers and wives stepped up to speak for him. Here are some of the stars who stepped up to defend Johnny Depp on his lawsuits against Amber Heard.\n\n1. J.K. Rowling\nJ.K. Rowling is a famous writer, and even though you are not a fan of books, you sure are familiar with her masterpiece, the Harry Potter series. Her works on the series escalated her name to the top and even made her one of the richest and most influential writers today. \n\n2. Winona Ryder\nPerhaps one of the most shocking faces to see in the line of those who defended Johnny was Winona Ryder, his ex-fiancee. Winona had been engaged to Johnny during their four-year relationship in the 1990s, a pair that had been the center of admiration during their time. She wrote that she was aware of the allegations against his ex-lover, and that she knew him very well, counting their relationship as one of the most significant in her life. \u201cI understand that it is very important that I speak from my own experience, as I obviously was not there during his marriage to Amber, but, from my experience, which was so wildly different, I was absolutely shocked, confused and upset when I heard the accusations against him,\u201d the Stranger Things actress said. \n\n3. Vanessa Paradis\nJohnny Depp has been involved with many actresses throughout his career, he is indeed a very handsome and career-driven man after all. But if there\u2019s someone whom he lasted more than a decade with, it\u2019s the mother of his two kids, renowned French actress Vanessa Paradis. Johnny and Vanessa were in a relationship for 14 years, and separated just before he and Amber were together. \n\n4. Javier Bardem\nAlthough the statements previously given by his ex-lovers and many of his friends and co-stars had a huge bearing on the case, \n\nThat\u2019s all for today, and if you enjoyed this video, make sure to smash that subscribe button and notification bell for more videos like this.
