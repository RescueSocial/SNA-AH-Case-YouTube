            "description": "Rest in Piece in Piece Activision Blizzard. The lawsuit and damage to the company continues to heat up, and the same organization that is suing activision blizzard is now going after Riot Games!\n\nRiot Games is being sued by the state of California over allegations of gender discrimination, sexual harassment, and retaliation against female employees. On February 3, 2021, the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing and the Division of Labor Standards Enforcement posted a litigation notice regarding Riot Games. The notice states that Riot Games violated the law in \"multiple ways\": gender discrimination in hiring, pay and promotion decisions; sexual harassment; and retaliation.\n\nThe filing was spotted by a Reddit user on Tuesday, in light of the recent DFEH suit against Activision Blizzard.\n\nIt also notably states that \"Women who signed arbitration agreements or other agreements cannot be excluded from the government\u2019s case. It is unlawful for your employer to retaliate against you for speaking to the government, or otherwise participating or cooperating in a government proceeding.\"\n\nLegal action for gender discrimination was first taken by Riot employees in 2018. The employee class action suit, separate from the DFEH suit, alleged both systemic sexism in which female employees were not permitted to advance in their careers, and specific instances of harmful behaviour, including the use of demeaning language addressed towards women and male employees sending unsolicited pictures of their genitals to their female colleagues. The original complaint also cites that \"[a] former male employee was allowed to remain in a position of leadership despite regularly making sexual comments in the workplace and drugging and raping another Riot Games' employee\".\n\nThe DFEH specification that arbitration agreements cannot be excluded from a government proceeding is significant, because the suit filed by Riot employees in 2018 was made more complicated by the arbitration agreements in some of the women's employment contracts. This was enforced by a judge at Riot's request in January this year, despite the possibility that earlier willingness to settle would have negated that. Arbitration agreements in employment contracts require employees to waive their rights to litigation in favour of arbitration: a process where disputes are settled privately, without the judgement of a court.\n\nThe employee class action suit has been represented by Genie Harrison Law Firm since a change in representation last year. Harrison confirms that the suit against Riot Games is still ongoing, despite the ruling regarding arbitration: \"The cases against Riot proceed. We continue litigating the class action against Riot, the PAGA claims against Riot, and now additional separate individual arbitrations on behalf of women who signed forced arbitration agreements.\" Multiple cogs are in motion, including more arbitration cases against Riot being prepared. \"The class action/PAGA case remains in Los Angeles County Superior Court and in discovery, meaning depositions are being taken and documents exchanged.  A number of separate arbitration cases have already been filed and those are proceeding in discovery. We will soon file additional arbitration cases.\"\n\nTwitch: https://twitch.tv/PapaStanimus \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/papastanimus\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/gamerebel\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRKOv7wEWoEaQhsT0adfyQg/join\n\nInside Blizzard Developers\u2019 Infamous Bill \u2018Cosby Suite\u2019\nThe same government agency that's suing Activision Blizzard has an ongoing lawsuit with Riot Games\nJohnny Depp fans\u2019 campaign to have Amber Heard axed from Aquaman 2 never had an impact, says producer\nDisney's Brutal Response to Scarlett Johansson Suggests Ugly Legal Fight\nEmma Stone Reportedly Considering Suing Disney Over Cruella Release\n\nblizzard lawsuit, \nblizzard lawsuit california, \nblizzard lawsuit asmongold, \nblizzard lawsuit reaction, \nblizzard lawsuit bellular, \nblizzard lawsuit preach, \nblizzard lawsuit hasan, \nblizzard lawsuit explained, \nblizzard lawsuit response, \nblizzard lawsuit reddit, \nblizzard lawsuit ign, \nblizzard lawsuit 2021, \nblizzard lawsuit news, \nblizzard lawsuit quartering, \nblizzard, \nblizzard lawsuit, \nblizzard scandal, \nblizzard activision, \nblizzard entertainment, \nblizzard is still terrible, \nblizzard activision lawsuit, \nblizzard lawsuit california, \nblizzard lawsuit asmongold, \nblizzard lawsuit reaction, \nblizzard lawsuit bellular, \nblizzard lawsuit preach, \nblizzard lawsuit hasan, \nblizzard lawsuit reddit, \nblizzard lawsuit response, \nblizzard lawsuit death, \nblizzard lawsuit summary , \nblizzard lawsuit cnn, \nblizzard lawsuit discrimination in gaming, \nblizzard lawsuit 2021, \nblizzard walkout 2021, \n\n\n#blizzard #riotgames #thefeed",
