No copyright infringement intended. All copyright belongs to their respective owners. \n\nIn 2018, James Wan\u2019s Aquaman became a remarkably surprising smash hit. Nobody really knew what to expect from it for multiple reasons, given that it was following the disappointing release of Justice League; centered on a character who had never had his own live-action solo movie. Naturally, the excitement that the project generated immediately led Warner Bros. to solidify a future for the franchise, and within a few weeks of Aquaman\u2019s release we learned about their plans to develop an Aquaman 2.\n\nIt\u2019s typical for Hollywood studios to try and produce sequels as quickly as they possibly can. After all, they don\u2019t want to let the heat of a burgeoning franchise die down, and the more time that passes means there\u2019s more opportunities for audiences to be distracted by other big properties. That being said, Aquaman 2 is taking an extra minute to find its way to theaters, as Warner Bros. has announced that the blockbuster follow-up is currently scheduled to be released on December 22, 2022.\n\nSo, why is Aquaman 2 coming out about four years after its predecessor? For starters, producer Peter Safran has noted that the filmmakers behind the movie don\u2019t feel the need to rush the project, believing that giving the sequel the most development time possible will ultimately be beneficial for the final product. But that\u2019s not the only reason. Not only is the film going to need some legitimate time to actually get made from a logistics standpoint (it\u2019s not super easy creating those underwater environments), but there are also many other DC Extended Universe titles in the works that the studio is developing between now and December 2022.\n\nSubscribe To Moviecliks Trailer To Catch Up All The New Movie  FanMade Trailers Just For You.
