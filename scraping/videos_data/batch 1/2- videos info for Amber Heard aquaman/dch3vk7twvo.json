            "description": "\"AMBER HEARD FIRED\" #FireAmberHeard Makes a Comeback Amid \u2018Aquaman 2\u2019 News | The Gossipy\n\nWe all saw this coming. The \"Amber Heard Fired\" movement is picking up steam again amid the reported filming of Aquaman 2. DC comic and Johnny Depp fans want Amber Heard gone and in jail. This is due the ongoing legal battles between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard. The Johnny Depp Amber Heard court case continues to make headline.  \n\nWith the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. \n\nEver since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.\n\n#AmberHeard #JohnnyDepp #JusticeForJohnny\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWelcome to The Gossipy.
