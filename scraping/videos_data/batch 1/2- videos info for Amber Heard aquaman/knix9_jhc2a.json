            "description": "Just when fans thought Amber Heard would finally stop all her unexpected stunts to try and get away with her wrongdoings during her marriage with legendary star Johnny Depp, she sinks even lower just recently, after trying to have her case with Johnny get dismissed again by the court, for the third time. But what did really go down over there? Are the Virginian judges actually considering this move by Amber\u2019s legal team? Let\u2019s find out in this video. But before anything else, make sure first to hit that subscribe button and smash that notification bell for more updates on this. So, let\u2019s dive in! \n\nBeing a celebrity is a tricky thing, as your personal relationships can become very public affairs. Amber Heard and Johnny Depp know this all too well, as the former couple is consistently making headlines due to their ongoing legal situation. Amber Heard and Johnny Depp have been duking it out in court for years, and are showing no signs of slowing down. It has been an excruciatingly long time since Johnny had filed a suit against Amber Heard\u2019s team after his former wife wrote details about their previous and failed marriage in an Op Ed article at The Washington Post, which then ended Johnny\u2019s chances of getting back on his most famous Disney film franchise, the Pirates of the Caribbean series, and basically ruined his entire career. Even though the article was not directly mentioning Johnny\u2019s name in it, it was obviously pertaining to him as Amber said, detailed, and explained that she was physically maltreated, and in which she spoke about the treatment of women in cases such as hers. So, in March of 2019, the 57 year old actor took action and filed a lawsuit of $50 million against her, for things said over the aforementioned article in the Washington Post. The suit said that Amber \"is not a product of domestic maltreatment, she is a perpetrator,\" and denied that Johnny ever hurt her physically. At the time, Depp's lawyer called the article an \"overuse of the women empowerment movement\". And instead, the suit said that her words were part of an \"elaborate stunt to generate positive publicity\" for the actress. And then of course the #NeverForget $7 million dollar\u2019s worth of divorce settlement she got from her wealthy ex husband, Johnny, which she vowed to donate to charity but who knows what really happened to it now? A Virginian judge scolded Amber Heard for quote \u201cwasting the court\u2019s time\u201d. \n\nBut anyway, after all these, you might think she's done. But nope, it seems like the end is a long way ahead yet for Amber\u2019s eyes. For the second time a few months ago, Amber tried to have her case with Johnny dismissed, pulling out her \u201che lost the case with The Sun card\u201d, which was honestly a little low. Not cool, Amber. You may remember that before this lawsuit with Amber, Johnny had already fought for a lawsuit against new publisher The Sun, after the company called him a very bad name. \n\n And after that, she then surprised the whole world with her own baby! It was born out of surrogate, and yes, no one knows who the father is, but it may actually be an important twist in the hearings to come. For the third time! Wow, being inside Amber Heard\u2019s head might be tough. \n\nThis latest update comes to us from Court House News, which revealed how the proceedings in court went down yesterday. One of Amber Heard\u2019s lawyers attempted to use the verdict in the U.K. as an indication that she shouldn\u2019t be hit with a lawsuit. Obviously Depp\u2019s team has clapped back, so it remains to be seen if the third attempt for the case to be dismissed is successful. According to the CourtHouse News, \u201cAn attorney for actress Amber Heard on Thursday asked a Virginia judge to embrace findings from a U.K. court that Johnny Depp, Heard's ex husband.\n\nJohnny\u2019s lawyers have challenged back, once again, stating that the cases cannot be connected. Depp's lawyer, Ben Chew of Brown Rudnick, characterized the motion for dismissal as futile and frivolous. However, after trying to dismiss her lawsuit one too many times, Ben Chow also called out for Amber Heard's legal team to halt before Johnny asks them to be abided by law, pushing for Heard and her team to receive consequences for their repeated claims in court. \n\nWhat upsets most fans is the fact that Amber will still star alongside Jason Momoa in the latest DCEU installment of Aquaman, despite many supporters\u2019 request for Warner Brothers to do otherwise.\n\nWhat about you? Will you be watching Aquaman 2? Do you think it's fair for Johnny\u2019s famous case to be dismissed because of the lost libel case years ago in a different continent?
