Which is both fine...and not fine. You see, when it comes to people like the fans or even the critics who don't know the celebrity personally or in great depth, it makes sense that many of them would be surprised. BUT, when it comes to the celebrities that DO know them...this is a bit harder to swallow. And in fact, in the case of James Franco, some have tried to warn about him for a long time.
