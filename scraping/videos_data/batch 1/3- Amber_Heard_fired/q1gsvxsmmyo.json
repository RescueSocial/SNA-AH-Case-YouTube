            "description": "#AmberHeard #HappiestSeason #T3Medias\n\n1. From Cinemablend, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been battling in court for months, most recently with Depp suing The Sun after the publication referred to him as a \"wife-beater.\" The judge ultimately sided with The Sun, resulting in Warner Bros. asking the actor to step away from his role as Grindelwald in the Fantastic Beasts movies. This has also put Mads Mikkelsen atop the list of actors being considered to replace Johnny Depp in the David Yates-directed Fantastic Beast 3, the third installment of the Harry Potter spinoff based on the JK Rowling fantasy franchise. And now nearly 1 million moviegoers have signed a petition for Heard to be fired from her role in the Aquaman franchise.\n\n2. Clea DuVall had been a ubiquitous actor in movies and on television for years when she got the idea for \u201cHappiest Season,\u201d a holiday romantic comedy with a lesbian couple at its center. \u201cI had never seen a movie that really represented my experience,\u201d she says. \u201cAny LGBTQ+ characters were, if they were there at all, side characters.\u201d It\u2019s delightfully conventional, all while being completely subversive because of the movie\u2019s queer spin on the genre. And if everything goes well for \u201cHappiest Season,\u201d Abby and Harper should take their place alongside the couples of \u201cLove Actually\u201d and \u201cThe Family Stone,\u201d ensconced forever in cozy holiday viewing. Happiest Season stars Kristen Stewart (Abby) and Mackenzie Davis (Harper) coming out November 25th.\n\n3.
