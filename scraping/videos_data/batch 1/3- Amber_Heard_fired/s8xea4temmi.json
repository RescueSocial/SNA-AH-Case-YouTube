It is\nnot easy to keep up with Johnny and Amber's case but what is most important here is that\nAmber Heard is potentially facing jail time.\nThe court drama made a major plot twist when Johnny Depp filed a defamation lawsuit\nagainst his ex-wife. He not only claimed that she lied in court, but also that she was abusive\ntoward him. However, the actors will need to wait even longer to get an official court ruling. If\nthe court rules in Johnny Depp\u2019s favor, Amber Heard could be facing up to three years of jail\ntime.\nBasically, Amber Heard claimed that Johnny Depp had physically and emotionally abused\nher. Their original court drama in 2015 resulted in a restraining order against Johnny Depp,\nbut that\u2019s also where the blurry lines began. Johnny claims that Amber had faked her black\neye seen at the court, and Amber Heard\u2019s stylist corroborated this.\nShe stated, \u201cThroughout the day of December 16, 2015, I could see clearly that Amber\nHeard did not have any visible marks, bruises, cuts, or injuries to her face or any other part\nof her body.\u201d\nBut this was not the only time Amber Heard lied and was caught lying. Why would she do\nthat all the time? It was her strategy. She wanted to play a victim and she was good at it until\nthe truth came out. Even in 2017 she still managed to convince everyone that in this\nsituation she suffered from Johnny Depp's actions against her. Amber Heard made people\ntrust her and, moreover, she almost ruined Johnny Depp\u2019s career, as the publicity called him\na \u2018wife beater\u2019 and supported Amber and sympathized with her.\nWhile nothing could be proven, Amber Heard\u2019s accusations against Johnny Depp were\nenough to significantly damage Johnny\u2019s reputation and acting career. The story also almost\nderailed the latest Pirates of the Caribbean movie, Dead Men Tell No Tales, Johnny Depp\nhas faced significant levels of hate and ostracizing over the past five years. But then things\nhave changed.\nThe first thing which ruined Amber Heard's vicious plan was the leaked audio. And since the\naudio leak, the internet has already returned to Johnny Depp's side of the issue. Johnny\nDepp filed a defamation lawsuit against his ex-wife just over a year ago, and Amber Heard\nattempted to get the case dismissed but her request was denied.\nJohnny Depp initially filed the suit to sue Amber Heard for $50 million. But now it appears\nthat she could not only be forced to pay the sum, but she could also be facing jail time.\nAccording to the International Business Times:\n\u201cIf Heard will be proven guilty of faking her bruises, she could face three years of\nimprisonment. According to the Wallin & Klarich Law Firm, the California Penal Code Section\n141 PC stated that it is illegal to alter, modify, plant, place, conceal, manufacture or move\nany physical matter with the intention of causing someone to be charged with a crime. Some\nwould face felony charges for this\u201d.\nBut it doesn\u2019t stop there. Amber Heard could also be charged with offering false evidence.\nThese are also considered felony crimes and each carry a maximum sentence of up to three\nyears.\nAnd again, it doesn\u2019t stop here. More and more evidence has come forward to showcase\nthat Amber Heard was the one who abused Johnny Depp and that she had a strategy of\nmaking people think she was innocent. The number of times Amber lied is impressive: she\nwas caught lying in court (the audio recording situation), she asked or even forced people to\nlie for her in court and she stole her assistant\u2019s s*xual assault story and used it as her own.\nLater it turned out that Amber Heard has a history of violence.\n...\nAnd now I want to know your opinion about this situation. Do you think Amber Heard is\nfacing jail time? And what\u2019s gonna happen with Johnny Depp\u2019s career?
