            "description": "\"She Flirts Her Way\" Emilia Clarke Reveals Why Amber Heard is not Fired Yet...\nFans of Johnny Depp have created a change.org petition to have Amber Heard removed from Mara, and the number of people signing it has risen in recent weeks. Unfortunately, many things have been rearranged as a result of the occurrences that occurred during 2020. What I mean is that a lot of comic book movies that were intended to be released were unable to do so, but on the plus side, things are looking brighter. This may not be the case in 2021, since comic book films, like other films, will likely resume their usual release dates.\n\n\ud83d\udc97 Hope you liked the video and would consider leaving a like and telling us what you thought in the comments!\n\nWe have put together a few similar videos that you might like:\nJohnny Depp REACTION To Amber Heard Destroying Her Own Career: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dge8Eyp0x_U\nNew iCarly Information Revealed!
