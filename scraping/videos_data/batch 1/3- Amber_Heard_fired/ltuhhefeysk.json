            "description": "How Weird Is Jason Momoa\u2019s Relationship With Amber Heard?\n \nSubscribe to Binge Watch -  http://tiny.cc/bingewatch\n\nWATCH NEXT \ud83d\udc47\n\nDisney Apologizes To Johnny Depp After This...\n\nhttps://youtu.be/siGE-fVUHG4\n\nRelated videos:\n\nActors Furiously REACT To Working with Amber Heard (Jason Momoa, Emilia Clarke, Nicole Kidman)\n\nhttps://youtu.be/So9UkwrMQjM\n\n\nAquaman and Justice League actress Amber Heard has been at the center of controversy for a several years now after her personal issues with ex-husband Johnny Depp were made public. Now, the actress faces so much backlash and hate for being the reason why Johnny Depp's career is ruined. However, it seems like her career is still doing well with Amber confirmed to return as Mera in Aquaman 2. But what about her co-star Jason Momoa? Reportedly, he's been pranking her over and over again. Do all these pranks mean Jason wants to show Amber she's not welcome?\nWe are going to break it down for you in a few minutes, but before we start, make sure you stay till the end to know how does it feel to work with Amber Heard and what is Jason Momoa\u2019s reaction on the entire Depp/Heard drama. \n\nThe things between Amber Heard and Johnny Depp keeps on getting worse. Multiple legal battles, testimonies, lies, accusations \u2013 the things are not amicable at all. Since 2016 the media and tabloids are not tired to make headlines of these two, digging in their dirty laundry. But what is the truth \u2013 Johnny Depp's career seems to be sinking. He was fired from his gig as Grindelwald in the Fantastic Beasts franchise as well as from Disney\u2019s Pirates of the Caribbean. But what about Amber Heard\u2019s career? \n\nNot so long-ago fans went super furious about the things that are going on with Johnny and they created an online petition calling on Warner Bros. to remove Amber Heard from the upcoming comic book tentpole \u201cAquaman 2\u201d. The petition to remove Heard from \u201cAquaman 2\u2033 alleges the actress is a \u201cknown and proven domestic abuser,\u201d and thus the studio should request her exit if they did the same for Depp and \u201cFantastic Beasts.\u201d Although, the petition has garnered over 2 million signatures, it seems like nothing has changed. However, the rumors started circulating that Amber Heard would be fired and replaced by Emilia Clarke.\nBut no matter how hard the fans try, Amber put every single rumor about her to bed in an interview with Entertainment Weekly: \u201cI\u2019m super excited about the amount of fan love and the amount of fan appreciation that Aquaman has acquired and that it has garnered so much excitement for Aquaman and Mera that it means we\u2019ll be coming back,\u201d Heard said. \u201cI\u2019m so excited to film that.\u201d\nThe actress added, \u201cPaid rumors and paid campaigns on social media don\u2019t dictate (casting decisions) because they have no basis in reality. Only the fans actually made \u2018Aquaman\u2019 and \u2018Aquaman 2\u2019 happen. I\u2019m excited to get started next year.\u201d\n\nSo, as you may understand, Amber Heard is likely to stay. And we kinda knew that from the start. No matter how the things go, it is still interesting to know how the relationship is between Amber Heard and her co-workers since the issue blew up (especially with the Aquaman himself \u2013 Jason Momoa). Reportedly (and surprisingly enough), Jason Momoa is not bothered by the allegations thrown at the Mera actress. In fact, the two actors get along pretty nicely despite all the drama surrounding Amber Heard's personal life. Due to the latest events and interviews, the actor has no problem working with Amber and he's able to differentiate his co-star's professional career from her private life. Analyzing the entire situation and the friendship between these two, it can be said that Jason Momoa wants to keep Amber Heard in the franchise and will be ready to back her up should Warner Bros. intervene. How do we know that? Stay till the end to figure out what we\u2019ve got on Amber and Jason\u2019s relationship.\nBut before we reveal the status of their relationship, it is also important to say that Director James Wan is also said to be fighting in Amber Heard\u2019s corner. The filmmaker is apparently doing all he can to protect her role in Aquaman 2 against the studio attempting to massively reduce Mera\u2019s screen time. Word has it that the sequel could introduce several new female characters, with the intention being to take the spotlight away from Heard\u2019s heroine. The actress herself is not pleased about this, obviously, and is said to be battling to land a bigger role. A few months ago, it was believed that Heard had been let go from the movie due to poor health, but her reps categorically denied these claims.\n\n\nBinge Watch - Binge Watch is the best source of the latest celebrity news.
