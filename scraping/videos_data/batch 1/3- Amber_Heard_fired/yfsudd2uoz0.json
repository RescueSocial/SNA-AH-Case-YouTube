But if even the strongest couples like Brangelina can break up, this is probably next to nothing in front of them. \n\nSo as the cliche series of events of any regular Hollywood love story goes, the couple were in love, dated for a while, and BOOM! married in a few years. But the year following came with quite a quick divorce leaving the couple and the showbiz world with nothing but pure messy drama!\n\nAnd here we are, suckers for drama, trying to keep up with the latest gossip on what this couple is up to next.\n\nWhat were the crazy events that took place after the divorce?\nHonestly, the details of the events that took place after the divorce took so many turns that even Sherlock Holmes would\u2019ve been confused, resulting in him taking quite a long time to unravel the truth. For starters, the divorce involved Depp paying Amber a whopping 7 million.\n\nFor those of you who do not know who Mera is, Mera is the female protagonist of the DC billion-dollar grossing movie Aquaman which was such a huge success that Warner Bros. declared the news of there being a sequel almost immediately. \n\nBut all this happened in 2018 when things for Amber were all playing out in her favor. Fast forward to 2020, the pandemic wasn\u2019t the only concern for her as 2020 brought out so much evidence against her in the 50 million dollar filed by Johnny Depp that she was trapped, not knowing what step to take next. I think by now it is safe enough to say that this woman will stoop to any level to get things done her way. \n\nSo back to her Aquaman debut in 2018, due to the film being quite a hit, Warner Bros. didn\u2019t want to delay in releasing the sequel which is said to be out in 2022. But the famous petitions against her along with her making constant headlines have left us to wonder if she actually still has a spot on the cast list. For the sake of justice, we truly hope not just Warner Bros, but the entire showbiz industry thinks twice before casting her.\n\nHas she been getting roles in the film industry considering the blow-up of the scandal?\nUnlike Johnny being rejected for movies he has made his legacy with, Amber has been scoring quite a few films. In fact, she has a mini-series on Netflix currently running as well as her role in Aquaman 2.\n\nSo yes as far as we know she will be coming back on the big screens next year, but her time on screen may be cut short so as to not infuriate the fans further. But hey, did you guys hear about the rumors of Emilia Clarke being a suitable replacement for Amber on the cast?! \n\nWhat has Amber got to say about her actions and this situation as a whole?\nThe woman has been seen laughing it off on various occasions. If she is not holding up a strong facade, she is busy coming to her defense with ever-ready tales of lies. \nA while back she was seen getting frustrated at how the public has been going against her, causing her to reach an infuriated state hence causing her to state that what is being said is not fair and that no one could take the role of Mera from her. \n\nLet us keep all this aside and head on to talking about Jason Momoa. How does he fit into all of this? Aquaman is Jason Momoa! The hunk is known to have been the main reason why the first Aquaman movie was such a big hit and Warner Bros. is counting on him to do them proud with its sequel too. In fact, the man is said to have brought the comics to life with his acting which truly made the movie gain tons of fans. amber heard aquaman 2 celebrity news clevver news amber heard fired\n\n#JasonMomoa #AmberHeard #JohnnyDepp #AmberHeardCase #JohnnyDeppCase #EmiliaClarke #Aquaman2 #JusticeForDepp #Depp #Heard #TheSpotlight",
