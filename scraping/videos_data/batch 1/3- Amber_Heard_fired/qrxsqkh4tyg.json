            "description": "Amber Heard Sentenced To Prison *LIVE FOOTAGE*...!?\nThe tale of Amber Heard continues to get more and more curious as time goes on. Because she is in a war in court with her ex-husband Johnny Depp and it doesn't look to be getting any simpler as time goes on. Not the least of which is new evidence and more proof of her being a bad person coming to light. But she's holding fast and trying to keep going in the roles that she does have. Which right now includes Mera in the DCEU, which will continue via Aquaman 2. But a very familiar \"call to arms\" is happening that might just shut that down. We'll break it down for you. Be sure to like the video and subscribe to the channel!\n\nClick HERE To Enter The GIVEAWAY! https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbiT0LUIbQj6CQScvWHJeKQ?sub_confirmation=1\n\nAnd there you have it, everyone! A look at the continued movement to get Amber Heard out of the role of Mera in Aquaman 2 as well as getting her out of Hollywood as a whole. Do you think that this movement will honestly be able to make things happen? Or will Amber Heard be laughing all the way to the bank?
