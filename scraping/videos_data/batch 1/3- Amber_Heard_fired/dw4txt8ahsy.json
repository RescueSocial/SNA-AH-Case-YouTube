Well, it is no longer news that Johnny Depp was fired from his role in Pirates of the Caribbean by Disney. The cause of this can be said to be the crisis going on between him and Amber Heard. Many believe that the decision made by Disney is actually unfair on Jack Sparrow and also not right. But recently, there have been rumors that Johnny Depp has been hired again to continue as Jack Sparrow in the Pirates of the Caribbean series. Despite this, many believe that he deserves an apology from Disney for all that happened. Let's dive more into this.\n\nNumber 3: Disney\u2019s reaction\nWell, it's a habit for Disney to always not involve themselves with anybody that might seem shady so this probably made them make the decision to fire him from his role as Captain Jack Sparrow. But let's think about it this way. What is Pirates of the Caribbean without Jack sparrow? Johnny Depp has brought life into the series with his great acting and Disney must have realized making such a decision as firing Jonny Depp from his role as Captain Jack Sparrow was going to have a tremendous negative effect on the franchise. It is even safe to say that his role as Captain Jack Sparrow is the most loved of all the characters. So it is obvious most fans of the series will see no reason to watch the new release of the franchise because what's the use of watching it if their favorite character is no longer existing? It's a huge turn-off.\n\nNumber 2: Fans Reaction\nOne of the reasons why Johnny Depp was called back to continue his job by Disney was also the effort put in by his fans. When the news broke out that Johnny Depp was fired, his fans became very infuriated, and they felt they had to do something to change the situation of things. So, what did they do, and did it work? Well, with the result gotten, we can say that it worked. They stood as one and in harmony against Disney firing him. One of his fans, a woman named Riza, raised a petition on change.org saying that they wanted him back with a picture of Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow in the Pirate of the Caribbean Series. The petition went well as it has been signed by more than 580,000 people. It was discovered that the major reason for Disney's final decision to bring him back was because of this petition. It was a really strong one and gained a lot of popularity.\n\nNumber 1: The Allegations\nThings have been pretty hard and difficult for Johnny Depp and Amber Heard after their divorce. Who is getting the most hit from this problem they are facing? Well, as it is, that seems to be Johnny Depp. Reason being that Amber Heard still has her position in Aquaman 2 while Johnny Depp was fired from his own position in the Pirates of the Caribbean Series. The two had allegations towards each other which seem to be ruining both of their careers in a very significant way. And just like I said before, it has been a harder hit on Johnny Depp because apart from being fired by Disney, he also stepped down from his role in the Fantastic Beast series by Warner Bros. Amber Heard has always claimed that Johnny Depp did some terrible things to her during their marriage. The allegations she put forward are so terrible that they could have a bad effect on their careers if found to actually be true. This brings us to the question; are those allegations Amber Heard made against Johnny Depp actually true? Johnny Depp has had people coming out for him saying that he is not the kind of person to do what Amber Heard is accusing him of. It can be safe to say that Disney might also have withdrawn their decision to fire him because he seems innocent with all the evidence supporting him. There was no information or evidence that Johnny depicted bad behavior in any way throughout his performance on set while filming the Pirate of the Caribbean series.\n\nViral Film Talk is the #1 celebrity channel dedicated to bringing fans the latest celebrity news, best tv shows, movies, entertainment, and exclusive video commentaries & more.
