            "description": "Amber Heard Responds To Losing ALL Movie Roles...\nWhen it comes to being a person in Hollywood, you always want to go and get that \"dream role\" that can elevate you to new heights. But, ask any major actor and they'll tell you that it's not just important to get that dream role, but to KEEP getting those kinds of roles as they'll prove just how good you are and show your range as an actor. For Amber Heard, she's had that \"dream role\" via Mera in Aquaman, but in terms of proving herself in other films...not as much. And apparently a new indie film she's in isn't doing her any favors. We'll break it down for you.\n\nClick HERE To Enter The GIVEAWAY! https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbiT0LUIbQj6CQScvWHJeKQ?sub_confirmation=1\n\nAnd there you have it, everyone!

Do you feel happy knowing that she's not getting a lot of film love given all that's going on with her court case? Do you think that if Aquaman 2 goes well that she'll be able to elevate herself once again? Or do you think that she is slowly unraveling in Hollywood?
