            "description": "Johnny Depp Speaks On Amber Heard Ruining Her Own Career\nThere are many tales in Hollywood about certain stars going and \u201cruining their own career\u201d. Mainly because they go and do acts that ruin themselves by exposing their \u201ctrue selves\u201d. Like with Kevin Spacey and the nastiness that he partook in. In the case of Amber Heard though, her destruction has been much more of a \u201cslow burn\u201d, mainly because she\u2019s tried to convince people she\u2019s one thing, but got caught and revealed that she\u2019s actually something else entirely.
