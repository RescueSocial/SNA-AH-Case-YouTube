While staying in a loveless marriage is never a good prospect, divorce can sometimes be almost as bad, which Johnny is now realizing, as he faces the aftermath of his divorce. As it happened, the judge overseeing this particular divorce chose Friday the 13th as the fateful day of dissolving the Depp/Heard marriage, ending a bitter battle that has been played out in the media since their separation. Even as Depp attempts to rebuild his life, after finding himself single once again, the Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them actor is also facing another lawsuit, this one initiated by Depp, himself. As People reveals, Johnny didn\u2019t get everything for which he was hoping in his divorce settlement from Amber Heard with the judge largely siding with Ms. Heard, but the actor is now free from all ties to his ex-wife. Friday, January 13, a day which most people view with a measure of superstition, was a busy day for Heard and Depp, as that was the day the judge declared the divorce proceedings finalized. For Amber, that means she will be receiving her $7 million settlement, funds which she has pledged to donate to charity. \u201cIt is a great day. All Amber wanted was a divorce and now she has it. In the words of Gerald Ford, \u2018Our long national nightmare is over,'\u201d Ms. Heard\u2019s attorney, Pierce O\u2019Donnell, said. Mr. Depp had requested a $100,000 sanction be imposed on Heard, alleging that Amber had deliberately tried to delay divorce proceedings, but the judge declined to impose the penalty. Alternatively, Ms. Heard has asserted a similar accusation, saying that Mr. Depp delayed taking action in making settlement payments, transferring ownership of a vehicle, and prevented her from retrieving her personal property.\n\nTAGS\n\nJOHNNY DEPP,FINALLY,FREE FROM AMBER,AMBER HEARD ,separation,benefit,finalized,divorce,separate,loveless,marriage,prospect,divorce,realizing,bad,judge,overseeing,happened,Depp/Heard,marriage,single,actor,Fantastic Beasts,bbc world news,breaking celebrity news,breaking election news,breaking late news,breaking local news,breaking music news,breaking news,breaking news alerts,breaking news canada,breaking news headlines, breaking local news, breaking music news, breaking news, breaking news alerts, breaking news canada, breaking news headlines, breaking news in atlanta, breaking news in nigeria, breaking news india, breaking news pensacola florida, breaking news plane crash, breaking news story, JOHNNY DEPP,FINALLY,FREE FROM AMBER,AMBER HEARD,separation,benefit,finalized,divorce, separate, loveless,marriage,prospect,divorce,realizing,bad ,judge,overseeing,happened,Depp/Heard,marriage,single,actor,Fantastic Beasts,bbc world news,breaking celebrity news,breaking election news,breaking late news,breaking local news,breaking music news,breaking news,breaking news alerts,breaking news canada,breaking news headlines, latest breaking news, latest celebrity news, latest information technology news, latest music news, latest news, latest news headlines, latest news update, latest sports news, live breaking news, local breaking news, local news today, msn breaking news, nbc breaking news, nbc world news, JOHNNY DEPP,FINALLY,FREE FROM AMBER,AMBER HEARD ,separation,benefit,finalized,divorce,separate,loveless,marriage,prospect,divorce,realizing,bad,judge,overseeing,happened,Depp/Heard,marriage,single,actor,Fantastic Beasts,bbc world news,breaking celebrity news,breaking election news,breaking late news,breaking local news,breaking music news,breaking news,breaking news alerts,breaking news canada,breaking news headlines",
