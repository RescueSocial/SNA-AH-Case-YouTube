She definitely has been one of Hollywood\u2019s most controversial actors. It has been quite a roller coaster ride when it comes to Amber Heard and her career and public opinion. Of course, more than for her acting roles or movies, she has been in the spotlight for her relationship and issues with Johnny Depp. The actor had accused Depp of being physically abusive after their breakup. \n\nBut to everyone's surprise, things came to a halt in that direction pretty soon. After Depp had been dropped out of a number of projects, new facts and rumors came to play. In quite a dramatic, soap-opera style revelation, it was now said that Depp, not Amber Heard, was actually the victim of abuse. This obviously ruffled a lot of feathers; fans who had supported her were heartbroken and confused, and general public opinion turned against her. Even a lot of her co-workers began revealing a lot of previously buried stuff. \n\n#AmberHeard #JohnnyDepp #JasonMomoa",
