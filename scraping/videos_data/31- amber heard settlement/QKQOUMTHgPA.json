            "description": "This past February, actress & activist Amber Heard joined SAMS on a women\u2019s health mission to Lebanon, targeting Syrian refugee women who have limited or no access to care. During her trip, she visited a number of informal settlements in the Beka\u2019a Valley where SAMS has provided and continues to provide medical care, from primary health care care to psychosocial support services.\nOne of the informal settlements she visited was  Al-Omaria, the only camp specifically designated for widows and their children in the Beka\u2019a Valley. There are 25 widows and their 60 children residing in this settlement. All the widows are registered with the UNHCR, and 80% receive a monthly stipend of $27 for living costs. Once a widow\u2019s son reaches the age of 13, the widow is given the choice to either force her son to leave the settlement on his own, or have the whole family depart from the settlement.\nAs a result of the trauma and loss experienced, these widows are in dire need of psychosocial support to help them cope with their emotional fatigue. Amber has partnered with SAMS on a new CrowdRise campaign to support these women and children.\nPlease join our campaign today: www.crowdrise/amberheardlebanon",
