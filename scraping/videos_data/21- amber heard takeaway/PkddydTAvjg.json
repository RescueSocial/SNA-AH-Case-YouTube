Schools must respond by putting learning and skills development before the rote memorisation of content: they must plan FOR learning. This webinar looks at what planning for learning really means: it challenges the \u2018accepted wisdom\u2019 of lesson plans and offers a look at a creative and innovative way of improving teacher competence and learning outcomes: what are students actually learning in lessons?",
