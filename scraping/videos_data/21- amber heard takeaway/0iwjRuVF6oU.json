            "description": "Here's the final video from the \"We Who Believe in Freedom\" album, an acoustic interpretation of Sweet Honey in the Rock's \"Ella's Song,\" sung with my dear friends Raquel Rodriguez and Jessica Childress. \n\nDeep respect and gratitude for Sweet Honey, for songwriter Dr. Bernice Johnson Reagon, and for civil rights hero Ella Baker, who inspired the song. Though its words were originally written in the context of the civil rights movement of the 60s, and put into song form in the 80s, they feel just as potent and needed today. This song calls attention to many things - a deep need for racial and gender justice (and beyond); understanding and reconciliation of privilege; intersectionality, the elevation of the collective over individual ego, and the value of wisdom sharing between older and younger generations. But perhaps my greatest takeaway comes from its refrain - the idea that in the march towards a more just and loving world, there's always more work to do; deeper work to be done. That can feel like a heavy weight to bear as one person, but it seems so much more achievable if we come together and support each other as a community.\n\nMy dream in making this album was to provide some inspiration and encouragement for our journey towards collective healing. I feel so inspired by the experience of recording these songs, and even more so in sharing them with you. Thanks for your comments, conversations, listening, sharing, and for being a part of the process. Here's the lyrics to \"Ella's Song\" - links to learn more about Ella, Sweet Honey, and Dr. Reagon are below.\n\nWe who believe in freedom cannot rest\nWe who believe in freedom cannot rest until it comes\n\nUntil the killing of black men, black mothers\u2019 sons\nIs as important as the killing of white men, white mothers\u2019 sons\n\nWe who believe in freedom cannot rest\nWe who believe in freedom cannot rest until it comes\n\nThe older I get the better I know that the secret of my going on\nIs when the reins are in the hands of the young who dare to run against the storm\n\nTo me young people come first, they have the courage where we fail\nAnd if I can but shed some light as they carry us through the gale\n\nStruggling myself don\u2019t mean a whole lot I come to realize\nThat teaching others to stand up and fights the only way my struggle survives  \n\nI\u2019m a woman who speaks in a voice and I must be heard   \nAt times I can be quite difficult, I\u2019ll bow to no man\u2019s word\n\nWe who believe in freedom cannot rest\nWe who believe in freedom cannot rest until it comes\n\nNot needing to clutch for power, not needing the light just to shine on me\nI need to be just one in the number as we stand against tyranny\n\nWe who believe in freedom cannot rest\nWe who believe in freedom cannot rest until it comes\nWe who believe in freedom cannot rest\nWe who believe in freedom cannot rest until it comes\n\n\nFor more background on Ella Baker and this song: https://bit.ly/2z36NUp\nFor more about Sweet Honey in the Rock: http://sweethoneyintherock.org/\nand Dr. Bernice Johnson Reagon: https://www.bernicejohnsonreagon.com/\n\nThanks to Nick Warner ( http://youtube.com/nickwarnermedia ) for filming and editing, to Dillan Witherow for recording and mixing the audio, and to Sam Brawner at Blue Dream Studios for having us in.
