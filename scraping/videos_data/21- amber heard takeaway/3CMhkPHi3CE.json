            "description": "We need to get Rebecca to the emergency room because her water broke! It all started when Rebecca Zamolo fainted after pregnancy reveal.  Next Matt and Rebecca uploaded \"Don't CHOOSE the WRONG Slip N Slide Truth or Dare Challenge.\" Finally the Game Master Network created \"Sneaking RZ twin out of prison.\"  Now in order to find out who can last the longest without saying wow, Rebecca hired a magician, hypnotist and a contortionist to get us to say wow in real life.  Something is wrong with the hypnotist.  The magician is funny though.  But the contortionist is a clown which is Rebeccas biggest fear.  There are also some surprise guests and other surprises just like Sofie Dossi.  Who do you think can last before being eliminated like in among us. Who is sus?
