            "description": "Catch up on the first season of Love is Blind, now streaming only on Netflix (www.netflix.com/loveisblind) and then join Jessica, Mark, Lauren, Cameron, Barnett, Amber, Carlton, Diamond, Kelly, Kenny, Giannina and Damian as they share with Nick and Vanessa Lachey what they've learned from their experiences and what it was like to see if play out on screen.\n\nAfter a highly-anticipated season finale, Nick and Vanessa bring the cast of Love is Blind back together for the first time to spill the tea and come clean on the season\u2019s juiciest moments.  All of your burning questions will be answered in this can\u2019t-miss episode.  Which couples are still together?  What was it REALLY like to watch this unfold all over again? Do they have any regrets?  Answers to those questions and more unexpected twists and revelations from the whole experiment explained from the couples who lived it!\n\nMore about the Series: Love is Blind follows the journey of singles who want to be loved for who they are, rather than what they look like. They take a less conventional approach to modern dating where they hope to meet the person they want to spend the rest of their lives with...without ever having seen them. With no distractions from the outside world, the singles talk to a stream of potential love interests and when a meaningful connection is made, they propose and then lay their eyes on their fianc\u00e9 for the first time. Engaged and back in the real world, as the couples plan their wedding day, they will quickly discover whether they can turn their emotional connection into a physical one before the fast-approaching ceremony. Hosted by Nick and Vanessa Lachey, this addictive series seeks to uncover whether looks or age do matter, or if love really is blind\n\nWatch Love is Blind , only on Netflix: https://www.netflix.com/title/80996618\n\nSUBSCRIBE: https://bit.ly/29qBUt7\n\nAbout Netflix:\nNetflix is the world's leading streaming entertainment service with over 167 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, documentaries and feature films across a wide variety of genres and languages.
