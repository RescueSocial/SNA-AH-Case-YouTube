We Compete in Fun Challenges to Find Next Friend to Replace Hacker Vy Qwaint to the Exposing Project Zorgo YouTube channel, I uploaded SPY NINJA DAX DEFEATED in HACKER BATTLE ROYALE (Hide & Seek Challenge with PZ9 for Vy Qwaint Phone) to the Chad Wild Clay channel. We recruited a new spy ninja to our team to replace Vy after she failed the lie detector test and left the safe house to join the hacker group Project Zorgo. We can't believe she betrayed us like that. Dax was the new team member after he completed the fruit ninja and crawling through tiny secret hidden tunnel battles. PZ9 hacked our television and announced that he still have Vy's iPhone X with lots of secrets on it still! We have to take back the phone! We tricked him into coming to the safe house and played hide and seek for 24 hours, like an escape room challenge.

We tried to keep Dax safe by letting him watch the security cameras back home but he did not listen to us. We ended up getting trapped in the basement headquarters but to our surprise Vy ended up saving us! She rescued us! Or did she? It still remains a mystery if my best friend and wife can be trusted. We had a chase back to our house where she finally told the truth. We played some trust challenges to see if we can welcome her back after she took $10,000 from us.
