            "title": "Nuts As Staple Foods with Osker Brown Part 8",
            "description": "Nut based agroforestry offers a huge potential to increase the ecosystem functions of human habitats. Osker Brown, of Glorious Forest Farm, will discuss all aspects of nutrition, harvest, storage, processing, and culinary use of acorns, hazelnuts, chestnuts, hickories, and black walnuts. We will show and tell tools and methods for processing, and sample some treats. We will also cover tending wild habitats for these crops, as well as cultivation of them in managed landscapes, and integration with livestock and annual cropping systems. Learn about the abundance of nuts around you and explore their many beneficial uses. In part 8, Osker shows us his finished red and white oak flours and some oil that he pressed from his harvest.",
