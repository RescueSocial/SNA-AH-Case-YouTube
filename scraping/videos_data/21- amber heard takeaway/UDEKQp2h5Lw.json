(If you can't remember becoming a listener-member for the first time, what else can you remember joining? What drove you to be part of that station/organization?)\r\n \r\nQ's for all:\r\n \r\n-What do you love about pledge drive?\r\n-Does anything make you nervous when you prepare for another pledge drive?\r\n-Do you have any routines you do or recommend for people getting ready to go on air and pitch?\r\n-Have you heard pledge pitches from people that have made you cringe? What about the pitches made you cringe?\r\n-Can you remember a pitch which seemed to resonate with the audience, and what about it do you think worked?\r\n-What advice can you give to volunteers who are anxious about asking for financial donations because they believe their audience does not have much to give? \r\n-How do you work with people who have had a lot of experience doing a pledge drive? Do you have any challenges getting your experienced hosts to practice pitching or try new ideas? \r\n\r\nPeople in attendance were: Khiem Le, Sam Jasmine, Ken Hippler, Simon Husbands, Ron Gerber, Rajib Bahar, Glen Powell, Gilberto Vazquez-Valle, Willie Dominguez, Bill Cottman, and Yonci Jameson.",
