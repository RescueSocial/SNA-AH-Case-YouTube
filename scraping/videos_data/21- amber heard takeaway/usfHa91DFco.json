            "description": "\u201cWhat is the practical application of your research?\u201d This is a question frequently asked of particle physicists. In this talk, Fermilab scientist Dr. Jennifer Raaf presents a few practical medical applications that have been enabled by fundamental scientific research undertaken by Fermilab employees. In particular, this talk will focus on a novel ventilator called the Mechanical Ventilator Milano that was developed for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Fermilab employees, volunteering their time and working together with an international team of physicists, engineers, and medical doctors, were involved with many aspects of this device, from hardware design and testing to software development and approval by the US Food and Drug Administration for emergency use of this device during the pandemic.\n\nDr. Jennifer Raaf is a senior scientist and head of the DUNE Department in the Neutrino Division at Fermilab. Her research focuses on neutrino physics and searches for rare decays that are enabled by the very large size detectors and low-background environments that are required for neutrino experiments. She specializes in detector instrumentation, with a particular interest in liquid and gaseous argon time projection chambers.\n\n\nFor more information:\n \nBenefits of Particle Physics\nhttps://www.fnal.gov/pub/science/particle-physics/benefits/index.html\n \nParticle Physics: Benefits to Society (2-page fact sheet; pdf document)\nhttps://news.fnal.gov/wp-content/uploads/particle-physics-benefits.pdf\n \nSymmetry magazine: applications of particle physics\nhttps://www.symmetrymagazine.org/archive?topic=3379\n \nThe Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment hosted by Fermilab:\nhttps://lbnf-dune.fnal.gov",
