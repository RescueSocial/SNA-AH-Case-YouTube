            "description": "Actor Johnny Depp's wife Amber Heard has avoided jail after pleading guilty to providing a false immigration document amid allegations she smuggled the couple's dogs into Australia.\nProsecutors in Queensland state dropped two more serious charges that Heard illegally imported the Yorkshire terriers, Pistol and Boo, into the country last year, when Depp was filming the fifth movie in the Pirates Of The Caribbean series.\nA conviction on the illegal importation counts could have sent the actress to prison for up to 10 years.\nThe false documents charge carries a maximum penalty of a year in jail and a fine of more than 10,000 Australian dollars (\u00a35,385).\nBut magistrate Bernadette Callaghan sentenced Heard instead to a one month good behaviour bond. She will have to pay a 1,000 Australian dollars fine (\u00a3541) if she violates the conditions of the bond over the next month.\nThe couple was swarmed by reporters when they arrived at court on Monday.",
