            "description": "Hip hop reacts to Meek Mill going to jail - yesterday the hip hop community got hit with some bad news. Meek Mill was sentenced to a 2-4 year prison sentence for violating his almost 10 year old probation. \"I've been trying to help you since 2009,\" was the words judge Brinkley told Meek Mill. Meek violated his probation by getting arrested twice this year. Once back in March at the St. Lous airport after getting into a fight, and the other arrest was in August for violating traffic laws. The hop-hop community is shocked to say the least, and there was some noteworthy reactions that we had to discuss, together. \n\nIn this video I talk about the different reactions we saw in the hip hop community after everyone found out that Meek mill was going to jail. \n\nFollow me on Twitter - https://twitter.com/BlackySpeakz\n\nInstrumentals in the background made by ORIGAMI.
