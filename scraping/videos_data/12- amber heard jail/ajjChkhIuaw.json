Now he could face up to 10 years in prison.\n\nFollow Rebecca Dunn: http://www.twitter.com/MissRebeccaDunn\nSee more at http://www.newsy.com\n\nTranscript:\nBy now you've probably heard the news that Johnny Depp committed a no-no down under.\n\nGet your mind out of the gutter. We are talking about how he illegally brought his two dogs to Australia. \n\nDepp should have gotten an import permit, and he didn't. If he had, the dogs would have undergone a 10-day mandatory quarantine, then would have been free to hang out with their pops.\n\nHe was then told to send his two Yorkshire Terriers back to America, or they would be euthanized.\n\n\"If you start letting movie stars, even though they've been the sexiest man alive twice, to come into our nation, then why don't we just break the laws for everybody?\" Barnaby Joyce, Australia's minister of agriculture, said.\n\nDon't worry, the dogs were sent home safe and sound.\n\nBut our Hollywood heart-throb might not be as lucky. No, he's not at risk for being put down, but he could be facing some serious legal trouble for the whole thing.  \n\nAn Australian senate committee was told if the case goes to court, Depp could face up to ten years in prison and a $340,000 fine, The Guardian reports. \n\nThe Sydney Morning Herald says Depp's pilot isn't off the hook either and could face up to two years in prison for \"undeclared importing.\"\n\nDepp was filming \"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales\" in Australia. And, as we all know, now without the companionship of his dogs Boo and Pistol.\n\nSources: \nGetty Images http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/actor-johnny-depp-attends-the-premiere-of-lionsgates-news-photo/461928852 \nGetty Images http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/johnny-depp-attends-a-photocall-for-the-film-mortdecai-der-news-photo/461714694 \nCommonwealth of Australia http://www.agriculture.gov.au/cats-dogs/step-by-step-guides/category-3-step-by-step-guide-for-dogs \nABC http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/johnny-depps-dogs-face-euthanasia-australia/story?id=31038681 \nTen News http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/celebrity-life/johnny-depps-dogs-to-be-deported-barnaby-joyce-tells-pistol-and-boo-to-bugger-off/story-fn907478-1227354495036 \nThe Ellen DeGeneres Show https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lj39cp5d_YQ \nThe Guardian http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/26/johnny-depp-dogs-australia-prison \nThe Sydney Morning Herald http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/johnny-depps-dogs-pistol-and-boo-in-senate-committee-hearings-20150525-gh99fa.html \nBuena Vista Pictures http://video.disney.com/watch/pirates-of-the-caribbean-at-world-s-end-trailer-4be1103c5c70e42f7f3ce022\n\nImage via: Getty Images / Jason Kempin\nhttp://gettyimages.com",
