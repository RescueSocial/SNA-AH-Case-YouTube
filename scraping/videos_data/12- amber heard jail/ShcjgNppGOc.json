            "description": "Dr. Joy, takes a critical look at the pattern of white women making dangerously false accusations against African Americans - like Amy Cooper who made a threatening 911 call against a black man bird watching in Central Park. \n\nIn court, prosecutors have used a hysterical 911 call as evidence of guilt. Usually, there is no video to refute it. \n\nThey say: \u201cJust listen to the call - listen to this panicked, passionate, fearful 911 call.\u201d \n\nWe watched this woman make a 911 call and was lying the entire time, becoming more emotional to bring the police on, to create this image of danger. We watched her do it. \n\nThe implications are serious. \n\nIn this video, we unpack a history that didn\u2019t make it into your school textbooks:\n\nThe difference between diversity and equity & social justice. \nAn anthropology lesson: The attributions placed on Africans by white anthropologists in the 1700s are still used today in 2020. Dehumanizing in order to justify actions against black people.\nA history lesson on institutionalized racism: this includes the North and South compromise to classify enslaved black people as \u2157 human to limit the Southern states\u2019 votes. It\u2019s not limited to the U.S. - there were HUMAN Zoos in Paris and Belgium as recently as 1958.\nThe history of white women killing or causing the murder of innocent black men and children.\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE to our YOUTUBE channel to receive notifications about our latest videos: https://www.youtube.com/user/DrJoyDeGruy\n\nFollow us on FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/joydegruypublications\nFollow us on TWITTER: http://twitter.com/joydegruypublications\nFollow us on INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/joydegruypublications\n\nVisit us at: https://www.joydegruy.com",
