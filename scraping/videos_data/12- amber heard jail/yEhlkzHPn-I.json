            "description": "A former Missouri City police officer has been convicted today of hiring two hitmen to kill his estranged wife in 1994. A jury in Houston convicted 52-year-old Robert Fratta of capital murder -- in his retrial.\n\nProsecutors say Fratta was motivated by money and a custody battle, over the couple's three children, during the divorce. The life-or-death sentencing phase begins May 26. It's the second time Fratta was convicted for his role in the shooting death of Farah Fratta, whose body was found in the garage of her home.\n\nHe originally was sentenced to death. Fratta was granted a retrial after jailhouse confessions of his co-conspirators were ruled inadmissible. The man named as the triggerman, Howard Paul Guidry, was convicted and is on death row. Joseph Prystash, who prosecutors say Fratta enlisted to hire Guidry, is also on death row.\n\n\nTexas Prison Strories Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/texasprisonstories Texas Prison Stories Merch: https://teespring.com/stores/texasprisonstories Texas Prison Stories Cashapp: $TexasPrisonStories \n#TexasPrisonStories #TimSno #Prison\n\n\nmurder for hire, murder, murder for hire plot, muder for hire, murder for hire plots, murder for hire cases, murder for hire coverup, dateline murder for hire, murder for hire documentary, hire, murders, murder mysteries, bad romance - murder for hire | abc 20/20,murder confession, murder documentaries, murder interrogations, for,murder-for-hire, people who hired hit men, forensics, blandford, former nypd, brenda delgado verdict",
