            "title": "GUESS Jeans - Fall 2011 Campaign - Featuring Amber Heard",
            "description": "This Fall, GUESS once again partners with famed photographer, Ellen Von Unwerth, to shoot rising talent, Amber Heard, and Silvu Tulu, in a love story that makes the timeless tale between a saloon singer and a lone cowboy fresh and exciting. The classic, black-and-white images are reminiscent of the 1950's and 1960's western film classics that defined a generation.\r\n\r\nCuffed, skinny jeans, cropped denim jackets, knit bustiers and retro-inspired dresses set the tone for the campaign -- a sexy, love story. The men's pieces draw the viewer into the western traveler with his denim jackets and leather bombers, western inspired wovens and worn in jeans which serve to compliment the women's collection. \r\n\r\nThrough a precise balance of close-up and scenic photographs, Ellen's lens transports the audience out west to an unidentified bus stop where a love story between the two leading characters begins to unfold. Whether it's a private glimpse of our heroine lounging in her seat, primping at a motel before her performance or the intimate shots of the characters connection unfolding - the campaign is shot in such a way that the viewer knows they are witnessing a life altering experience between the pair.\r\n\r\n\"Amber embodies the essence of the true GUESS girl with her natural beauty and all-American good looks,\" says Paul Marciano, Chief Executive Officer and Creative Director for Guess?, Inc. \"The campaign, which was shot by Ellen Von Unwerth, is sure to become an American classic that will continue to define what the GUESS brand stands for.\" \r\n\r\nPaul Marciano, who built the global lifestyle brand along with his brother, Maurice, Chairman of the Board, in 1981, has been heralded as launching the careers of then-unknowns including Claudia Schiffer, Anna Nicole Smith, Laetitia Casta and more recently, Kate Upton and Alyssa Miller. His natural eye for discovering raw talent has led to some of the most recognizable and iconic images over the past thirty years.\r\n\r\n\r\nMusic:\r\nDale Earnhardt Jr Jr\r\n\"Simple Girl\"\r\nfrom the album It's A Corporate World\r\nout now on Warner Bros Records",
