            "description": "Johnny Depp is out from the Harry Potter spinoff Fantastic Beasts series, where he played Gellert Grindelwald. Depp revealed the news in an Instagram post on November 6, days after he lost a libel case against British tabloid The Sun. In a typewritten note posted to Instagram, he claimed Warner Bros. asked him to resign from the series, which is currently shooting its third movie and has plans for two more. He also claimed he would appeal his case, over the paper\u2019s claims that he was a \u201cwife beater\u201d in coverage of his alleged abuse toward ex-wife Amber Heard. \u201cThe surreal judgment of the court in the U.K. will not change my fight to tell the truth and I confirm that I plan to appeal,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMy resolve remains strong and I intend to prove that the allegations against me are false. My life and career will not be defined by this moment in time.\u201d Heard\u2019s American lawyers previously responded in a statement to Entertainment Tonight. \u201cVery soon, we will be presenting even more voluminous evidence in the U.S.,\u201d Elaine Charlson Bredehoft told ET. \u201cWe are committed to obtaining justice for Amber Heard in the U.S. Court and defending Ms. Heard\u2019s Right to Free Speech.\u201d   Depp\u2019s role in the series has been controversial since preparations for the 2018 sequel The Crimes of Grindelwald. In November 2017, a year before the film premiered, director David Yates defended Depp\u2019s inclusion and called the abuse allegations against him \u201ca dead issue.\u201d  Update, 4:30 p.m.: The third Fantastic Beasts movie has been pushed from November 12, 2021, to summer 2022, Warner Bros. told Variety in a statement. The company also confirmed Depp\u2019s former role of Gellert Grindelwald will be recast. Where\u2019s a time-turner when you need one?  Update, November 9: The Hollywood Reporter has more details on Depp\u2019s ouster, with sources telling the magazine that Johnny Depp had just shot one scene after filming began on September 20. According to The Hollywood Reporter, Warner Bros. waited until the judgment came down to cut ties with Depp \u2014 who will still be paid his full salary for the project because of his pay-or-play contract. The third Fantastic Beasts movie, sans Depp, is now officially set for July 15, 2022.",
