Request [Explain in Hindi]\n\nWarner Bros. has requested that Johnny Depp resign from the role of Grindelwald in the Fantastic Beasts franchise, which the actor has agreed upon.\n\nWarner Bros. has requested that Johnny Depp resigns from his role as Grindelwald in the Fantastic Beasts film franchise. The actor has said that he respects and has agreed to the request.\n\nDepp released a short statement on Instagram where he addressed these details. \"In light of recent events, I would like to make the following short statement,\" Depp wrote. \"Firstly, I'd like to thank everybody who has gifted me with their support and loyalty. I have been humbled and moved by your many messages of love and concern, particularly over the last few days. Secondly, I wish to let you know that I have been asked to resign by Warner Bros. from my role as Grindelwald in Fantastic Beasts and I have respected and agreed to that request. Finally, I wish to say this. The surreal judgment of the court in the U.K. will not change my fight to tell the truth and I confirm that I plan to appeal. My resolve remains strong and I intend to prove that the allegations against me are false. My life and career will not be defined by this moment in time. Thank you for reading.\n\nJohnny Depp officially lost his libel trial against the Rupert Murdoch-owned British newspaper, The Sun, at the beginning of November. The Fantastic Beasts actor had filed the suit after the tabloid repeated claims by Depp's ex-wife, Aquaman star Amber Heard, that the Pirates of the Caribbean star was physically abusive towards her during their tumultuous, short-lived marriage.\n\nJudge Andrew Nicol explained his decision: \"The claimant [Depp] has not succeeded in his action for libel. Although he has proved the necessary elements of his cause of action in libel, the defendants have shown that what they published in the meaning which I have held the words to bear was substantially true.\" Nicol goes on further to note, \"I have reached these conclusions having examined in detail the 14 incidents on which the defendants rely as well as the overarching considerations which the claimant submitted I should take into account.\"\n\nIn his ruling, Nicol actually collected all 14 allegations made by either Depp or The Sun (via Heard herself, whose claims the newspapers were relying on for their article) and determined whether he believed Heard, Depp or neither of them. Ultimately, after determining that Depp was mostly at fault in 12 of the 14 allegations, Nicol determined that The Sun had successfully argued that it was reasonable for the paper to refer to Depp as a \"wife-beater.\"",
