And my cut is not the 10 week director\u2019s cut \u2014 it\u2019s a fully mature edit by Lee Smith standing on the incredible work by John Gilroy. It\u2019s all Steven Price\u2019s brilliant score, with not a single radio song in the whole thing. It has traditional character arcs, amazing performances, a solid third-act resolution.
