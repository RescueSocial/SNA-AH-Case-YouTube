            "description": "The filming for the upcoming DC Extended Universe film Aquaman and The Lost Kingdom has finally started, and fans were not happy about it. Well in fact, for a moment, they should have been happy, because this second installment is one of the most awaited films of 2022. When the first movie aired in theaters in 2018, fans were mesmerized by its cinematic wonder, and were already craving for more. However, due to a conflict that the film has gotten itself into, it is now pretty much a movie that almost everybody wants to cancel. How did this happen, you ask? Well for all of you who are newbies in the Johnny Depp and Amber Heard whirlwind of a case, let me just tell you that Amber Heard was able to reprise her role in the upcoming DCEU film franchise despite being involved in an ongoing case with Johnny Depp and their messy aftermath of a marriage. Apart from this, Johnny Depp had also been fired by Warner Brothers, the same production Aquaman is under, and has also been taken out from one of his most famous and commercially successful movies of all time: the Pirates of the Caribbean series.  So now that it has been decided that Warner Brothers will indeed keep Amber Heard despite all the allegations she is currently facing and despite all the unpleasant comments she is currently receiving. Fans are now wondering how her costars will take this news, especially the face and front of the whole movie, Jason Momoa. Some say that Jason actually secretly dislikes working with Amber Heard in their upcoming movie. But is this true? Let\u2019s find out in this video. But before that, make sure first to hit that subscribe button and smash that notification bell for more updates. Let\u2019s dive in!\n\nThe first day of filming of the new movie installment Aquaman and The Lost Kingdom was expected to be big news to its vieweers, but rather, it turned out to be a big waste. What made it an even larger disappointment for Warner Brothers is that the first Aquaman movie turned out to be a major blockbuster success in 2018, reaching 1.184 billion dollars, with a production budget of only 160 to 200 million dollars. That\u2019s a lot of profit! However, Amber Heard\u2019s involvement in the film has caused fans to turn their backs on the most awaited franchise.\n\nBut amidst all these, what are Amber\u2019s co-stars thinking about the issue? Does it affect their interaction knowing all about Amber\u2019s situation? And especially now that Amber has announced her newborn baby, who was born out of surrogacy, what do her colleagues at her Aquaman movie filming think of it? Well, let\u2019s hear some of Jason Momoa\u2019s thoughts about it. Jason Momoa, of all people, is the one who will get a really bad experience out of this once this movie flops because of Amber Heard. \n\nUnfortunately, much to fans\u2019 dismay, Jason Momoa is reportedly \u201cokay\u201d with working with Amber Heard. But, who knows, right? It might be easy to say \u201cyeah, it\u2019s cool. Working with Amber is just cool,\u201d despite having a seething dislike building up within you because this precious celebrity Warner Bros seems to be protecting is a person who will bring your movie down. But it seems like Jason Momoa feels more than that. More than just being \u201ccool\u201d. In fact, he even stated that Amber\u2019s personal problems should not be mixed with her work, which is a pretty weird thing to say to a celebrity because we all know pretty well that a wreck in one celebrity\u2019s personal life is a wreck in her image too. So if Amber Heard\u2019s personal life is the definition of \u201cmessy\u201d, then it might reflect on their relationship on screen and on the movie they are both in as well. \n\nAside from Jason himself, the Aquaman director seems to be backing Amber up as well. Despite Warner Brother\u2019s rogue decision to keep Amber Heard, which might actually cause their new movie to flop, at least they are somehow trying to reduce Amber Heard\u2019s exposure, perhaps to minimise the bad impact they may have to endure for the movie. But it is reported that Aquaman director James Wan is apparently doing all he can to protect Amber\u2019s role in Aquaman 2 against the studio attempting to massively reduce Mera\u2019s screen time. The actress herself is not pleased about this, obviously, and is said to be striving to land a bigger role. James Wan, along with Jason Momoa are in the frontrun, obviously, in defending Amber Heard from getting let go, which says a lot because they have big influence.\n\nThat\u2019s all for today, don\u2019t forget to like, subscribe, and hit that notification bell for more videos like this. \n\nRelated videos:\nHeard had Rocketman's BABY?!
