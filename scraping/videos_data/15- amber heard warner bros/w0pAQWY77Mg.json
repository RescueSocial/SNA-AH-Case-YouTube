Depp and Heard's marriage was short-lived, only lasting from February 2015 until she filed for divorce in May 2016.\n\nAmber Heard and Johnny Depp: the dramatic divorcee gift that keeps on giving. Just a few years ago, Johnny Depp was one of the highest-paid actors on the planet, but allegations of violence made him box office poison. Petitions calling for his removal from the Pirates of the Caribbean and Fantastic Beasts franchises emerged. Depp, during a lawsuit against his ex-wife Amber Heard, claimed that her allegations had hurt his career. While the role of Grindelwald is that the sole career casualty he\u2019s faced so far in his epic years-long showdown with Heard, Depp\u2019s legendary status as Captain Jack Sparrow could even be commandeered by his estranged ex-wife. Not only is she keeping her role in Aquaman 2, but she will even be within the running for a task within the new Pirates of the Caribbean reboot. If this information is true, she would be joining ranks with Margot Robbie\u2019s Pirates reboot, promising \u201clots of girl power.\u201d\n\nWhile it\u2019s unclear if the actress has had talks with the studio just yet about it, or if she\u2019s only discussed it with the Birds of Prey star at this stage, booting Depp from Pirates of the Caribbean then drafting Heard in to sail the body of water instead would little question send the online into a fit of rage? That being said, within the eyes of the law, Amber is technically the victim here, and if Warner Bros is willing to possess her headline a significant blockbuster.\n\nJohnny Depp continues to receive blows after losing his appeal against the United Kingdom\u2019s court ruling on the Sun\u2019s \u2018wife-beater\u2019 defamation case. New reports have circulated stating that Aquaman star Amber Heard is talking with Margot Robbie to hitch Depp\u2019s former franchise.\n\nWhile this is often ready to be a huge blow to Depp, we\u2019re unsure Jerry Bruckheimer, producer of Pirates and longtime friend of the actor, would allow such disrespect. Fans are also on Depp\u2019s side, with nearly 350,000 signatures on a petition to bring him back because of the famed Captain. Heard has her own, not so flattering petition to fireside her from Aquaman, which claims quite 1.5 million signatures.\n\nThe new developments in Depp and Heard\u2019s careers still unfold while their legal battle ensues. it's interesting to determine how things would find yourself later and if Heard\u2019s movies will receive the impact of the involves boycotts that fans are campaigning for. The Pirates of the Caribbean sixth installment with Margot Robbie remains in development. Disney dropped Johnny Depp from the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise four days after Amber Heard's op-ed within the Washington Post, his attorneys allege, which they see the events as connected.\n\nJohnny Depp's lawyers just filed a $50 million defamation suit against Amber Heard, arguing her abuse allegations \"were a neighborhood of an elaborate hoax to urge positive publicity for Ms. Heard and advance her career.\" Since the op-ed was published on December 18, the lawsuit also suggests it had been done to help promote her film Aquaman.\n\nWhat are your views all about? Are you disappointed that the Jack Sparrow actor won\u2019t be making an appearance in any future Pirates of the Caribbean installments, or are you happy with Disney\u2019s decision to cut ties with the alleged abuser?
