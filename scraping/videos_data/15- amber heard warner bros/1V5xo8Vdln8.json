            "description": "The last 4 years have been quite interesting for Actress Amber Heard. After she and Johnny Depp filed for divorce in 2016, her life has been a whirlwind of protection and lavish praise from the media. That same media has demonized Johnny Depp time and time again, and are now absolutely silent when Depp is fighting back against defamation claims and allegations put forward by Heard. Here I take a look at the history of the two characters, explain the media backlash and cover-up, and give my opinion about what I think will happen to Amber Heard, AQUAMAN 2, and potentially Jail.\n\n\u25ba SUBSCRIBE: http://youtube.com/3bucktheater?sub_confirmation=1\n\u25ba TWITCH: http://twitch.tv/3bucktheater\n\u25ba HOLLYWOOD AFTER DARK Archives: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdP_ZIQWvTV4E3HMAae99Cw\n\u25ba FACEBOOK: http://facebook.com/groups/3bucktheater\n\u25ba PATREON - http://patreon.com/MattJarbo\n\u25ba PAYPAL: http://paypal.me/mundanematt\n\u25ba AMAZON: https://www.amazon.com/shop/mundanematt\n\u25ba BITCOIN: 1FGxTiyKZDSkphRLn1xEwNR3aaG2RYKhGQ\n\u25ba DISCORD: https://discord.gg/jdjy9zQ",
