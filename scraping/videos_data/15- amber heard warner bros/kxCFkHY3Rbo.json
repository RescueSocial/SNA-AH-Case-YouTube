            "description": "Subscribe I n  News English YouTube Channel To All The Big News Of The World.\n\nJohnny Depp attempted to have ex-wife Amber Heard replaced on Aquaman. Depp and Heard were married from 2015-2017, and their relationship continues to have a major impact on the entertainment industry. The two made headlines for legal issues both during and after their marriage. Last month, Depp lost a lawsuit against The Sun, which called him a \"wifebeater\" in a 2018 article. Following this decision, Depp was asked to resign from the upcoming film Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them 3, where he was to reprise his role as Gellert Grindelwald. Despite only filming one scene, Depp received millions for his work on the movie.\n\nFollowing Depp's exit from the Fantastic Beasts franchise, a subset of fans have similarly called for Heard to be fired from Aquaman 2. The actor starred as Mera in the first movie and will play the part again in the sequel. Last month, a petition titled \"Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman 2\" was started on Change.org. It quickly surpassed one million signatures and now sits at over 1.7 million. Shortly after, Heard debunked rumors Mera would be recast in the film, stating, \"I'm excited to get started next year.\" Now, it seems those who signed the petition aren't the only ones who had an interest in having Heard replaced in the Aquaman franchise.\n\nAccording to a new article from THR, at one point, Depp told his sister, Christi Dembrowski, a producer with pull at Warner Bros., that he wanted Heard \"replaced on the WB film.\" In the process of the trial, Depp revealed the film in question was Aquaman.\n\nThe reveal about Depp comes after a similar report last year alleged the same. Though this more concrete information is shocking, it also lines up with what's already known about Depp and Heard's volatile relationship. Ultimately, it seems Depp's attempts to interfere with Heard's career amounted to nothing, as the actor remained a part of Aquaman. Still, the news is disconcerting to say the least, especially considering the power Depp once wielded in the industry. It's clear he was willing to use any sway he had against Heard, which is troubling.\n\nIt remains to be seen if this reveal about Depp will have any impact on Heard's future in the DC Extended Universe. If anything, it seems to reinforce Warner Bros' commitment to Heard. If Depp did follow through with contacting the studio through his sister, apparently his request was denied. Though there have been new developments in the last year or so, this could bode well for Heard's role in the next Aquaman movie.",
