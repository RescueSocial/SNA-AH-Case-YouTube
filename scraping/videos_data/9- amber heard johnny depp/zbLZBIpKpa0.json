            "description": "10 MORE Celebrities Who Defended Johnny Depp Against Amber Heard\nJohnny Depp is someone who seems to be on the outskirts looking in on our world. Why is that? Because ever since his ex-wife in Amber Heard went  to her during their year-long marriage, many people have backed away from him. Especially movie studios after he lost his Libel suit against a newspaper for publishing certain statements about him. But despite all the people turning away from him, there are those who have defended him, and others who have popped up to say nice things. Including a certain notorious fighter. We'll break it down for you. Be sure to like the video and subscribe to the channel!\n\nClick HERE To Enter The GIVEAWAY! https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbiT0LUIbQj6CQScvWHJeKQ?sub_confirmation=1\n\nAnd there you have it, everyone!
