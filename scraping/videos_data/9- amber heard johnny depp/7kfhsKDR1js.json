            "description": "\"Thank You\" -  Johnny Depp Thanks Fans For Defending Him Against Amber Heard...\nOne of the most interesting things to come from the Johnny Depp case that is going on right now is his support system. Because his ex-wife in Amber Heard has been going and proclaiming for years that Johnny Depp has been to her during their time together (which included years of dating and a 1-year marriage for the record). But yet, there have been many, MANY people in the celeb world, his personal life, and the fans who have not believed this since day one. And recently, Depp decided to go and thank those who have supported him. We'll break it down for you. Be sure to like the video and subscribe to the channel!\n\nClick HERE To Enter The GIVEAWAY! https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbiT0LUIbQj6CQScvWHJeKQ?sub_confirmation=1\n\nAnd there you have it, everyone!
