He's lost multiple movie roles, has received extreme backlash in his acting career, and all of this solely because his ex-wife accused him of harassment and abuse. Recently, though, Johnny Depp has scored a big win in the case against his ex-wife, as a judge granted his petition to see proof that Amber Heard donated the $7 Million from the divorce settlement as she said she would. In response, Johnny announced how grateful he was to have such a supporting fanbase, trying to help him clear his name from all of Heard's accusations. But how exactly did they manage to persuade the New York judge? And was there anything shady to it?\n\n#JohnnyDepp #AmberHerad",
