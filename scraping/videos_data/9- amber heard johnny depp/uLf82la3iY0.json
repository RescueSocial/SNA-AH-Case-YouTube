            "description": "Johnny Depp\u2019s wife, Amber Heard, has accused Depp of domestic violence and now believes his team has started a social media war attempting to refute her allegations. Will the testimony from Depp\u2019s security guards hinder Heard\u2019s testimony? We look into the allegations further with child protection and national security consultant Francey Hakes. Hakes also breaks down the new extradition attempts against Roman Polanski, the responsibility of Facebook in regards to a Texas man accused of killing his girlfriend and posting the crime photos online and lastly, the sexual assault and racial attacks on an Idaho football player in this episode of Crime Time hosted by Allison Hope Weiner. \n\nGUEST BIO:\nFrancey Hakes is a child protection and national security consultant.
