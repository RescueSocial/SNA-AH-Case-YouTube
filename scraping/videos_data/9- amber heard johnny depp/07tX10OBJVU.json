            "description": "Johnny Depp has recently broken his silence in an interview about his current state in the defamation lawsuit and his career years after he lost his British libel suit. You might remember that in November of 2020, Johnny Depp lost a libel case against British news publisher The Sun after labelling him something he still denies up to this day. This lost libel case might seem to be just a little stain in his long running career, but it actually dealt a huge blow to Johnny. After he lost this libel case, he was kicked out of his recurring role in the J.K Rowling critically acclaimed Fantastic Beasts trilogy, where he would have played the iconic Grindelwald in the series\u2019 third installment. He was then replaced by Mads Mikkelsen in the role. But this was just the start of a harrowing journey in Johnny\u2019s career. He was also kicked out of one of his most famous film series, Walt Disney\u2019s Pirates of the Caribbean and in any of its succeeding films, series, and spin-offs. This libel case really did damage a lot, even the iconic Jack Sparrow. Now, after all the chaos that has swirled around the actor in the past few years, he is almost at the end of it all as his 50 million dollar suit against his ex wife Amber Heard is advancing on its current state of trial. However, although it may seem that Johnny obviously has a lot of advantages over the Aquaman actress in many ways, it still cannot be denied that the whole whirlwind situation really did take a toll on his career, and as he even termed it, the Hollywood industry itself \u201cboycotted\u201d him during his predicament, especially that after all that he has gone through with his roles, his new film \u201cMinamata\u201d will not be released in the United States after all. But why did the award winning actor feel that way and what did he say about it? What made Johnny Depp speak up just recently, after years of keeping his silence, about Hollywood ruining his career? Let\u2019s find out the answer to that in this video. But before all else, make sure to hit that subscribe button first and smash that notification bell for more updates on the Johnny Depp - Amber Heard case. Now, let\u2019s begin!\n\nYou may all vividly remember the event in 2017 that started all this frenzy surrounding the now 58 year old actor Johnny Depp and his ex wife Amber Heard. Well, what we did not know back then was how greatly it would affect the actor\u2019s career in the years to come. Inside those four long years of the Johnny and Amber unending turmoil, here is what happened so far that escalated the fire that has already been burning up since 2017: In 2018, Amber wrote an op ed article in The Washington Post where she spoke up and explained how she was hurt and maltreated, and in which she also spoke about the treatment of many other women in the same types of cases. Despite not involving Johnny\u2019s name on her statement, Johnny\u2019s team knew that it was pertained to him, having recently filed a restraining order for physical complaints against him and, well, technically they just got out of their failed relationship. So, in March of 2019, the then 57 year old actor took action and filed a lawsuit of $50 million dollars against the Aquaman actress, for words said over the said aforementioned article in the Washington Post. \n\nThe evidence include a recorded phone call where Amber admitted to hitting Johnny, the actresses\u2019 alleged affairs with actor James Franco and mega businessman Elon Musk, which may have been proved somehow by itself when the two dated for a whole year right after Johnny and Amber\u2019s divorce, and the missing $7 million dollar settlement money that Amber received from the divorce.\n\nDuring all this havoc, Johnny\u2019s career has almost turned into shambles. The production company also admitted that the decision was made after Amber\u2019s article. Johnny just lost two film series that he is pulling off while Amber Heard continues to get huge parts in huge films. Because of this, fans continue to be upset, and even though they have once been turned down in their past petition to convince Warner Brothers to fire Amber Heard, they are still willing to do it all over again. On the first day of the second Aquaman movie\u2019s filming, #FireAmberHeard trended.\n\nThroughout all of these, Johnny Depp has kept his silence. \n\nSo, is Johnny Depp\u2019s career really in shambles? \n\nJohnny might still be in an unknown and disastrous chapter in his life, but once everything has gone back to the way they were, we do hope to see Johnny\u2019s career skyrocket back to where it was before.\n\nThat\u2019s all for today, if you enjoyed that video, make sure to like, subscribe, and hit that notification bell for more videos like this.
