This would be great news to Johnny Depp and Aquaman fans around the world. The #FireAmberHeard movement is going strong. It seems the Aquaman 2 director, James Wan, does not even want Amber Heard in the movie. \n\nIt seems like everyone is turning against Amber Heard. Including the actors in the movie such as Jason Momoa, Nicole Kidman, William Dafoe, etc. The Johnny Depp Amber Heard legal battle is still at the forefront of celebrity news. \n\nWith the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. \n\nEver since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.\n\nNow she is chilling and taking photos on set of the new Aquaman 2 movie. Set to hit theaters in 2022.
