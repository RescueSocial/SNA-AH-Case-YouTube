            "description": "As respected leaders from the southeast mount pressure on President Muhammadu Buhari to grant amnesty to Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the outlawed Indigenous People of Biafra, the one thing they appear to have forgotten is that Kanu has a track record of breaking promises. \n\nNot only did Kanu violate the terms of his bail in 2017 after his release from detention by a Federal High Court, he transformed into a megalomaniac that created an armed wing to attack the Nigerian state in his quest for the restoration of the Republic of Biafra in the southeast.  \n\nDespite this, some leaders from the region are confident that they can keep him in check once he is released to them. \n\nIn this interview, Dr. #ChukwuemekaEzeife, a former governor of the state, tells ARISE what has changed between 2017 when Kanu jumped bail and fled the country, and why he should be given a third chance. \n\nDr. Ezeife was a member of the delegation that met with Buhari last week to plead for Kanu\u2019s release.\n\n#TheMorningShow  #ReubenAbati #TundunAbiola  #RufaiOseni #nnamdikanu #kanu #sundayigboho #igboho #ipob #biafra #yorubanation #IndigenousPeopleofBiafra\n#nigeria #nigerians #dailynews #news #globalnews\n#NIGERIANNEWS #TRENDING #trendingvideo #politics \n\n\n\nSubscribe to our Channel for high profile interviews.
