            "description": "Amber Heard has been announced as the 2017 Woman of the Year at the GQ Men of the Year awards, in association with Bulgari. \n\nBrave and beautiful, Amber Heard has been a fearless advocate of women's rights, helping to redefine feminism in a modern age. 2017 has been the busiest of Heard's career, with Justice League and Aquaman. For the latter, Heard spent seven months shooting in Australia where, despite being unceremoniously booted out of the country two years earlier by Barnaby Joyce, she fell in love with the country. \n\nHaving starred in comedies, dramas and rom-coms, Justice League presented Heard with a new opportunity - that of her superhero debut. But despite all this and the end of her relationship with Johnny Depp, Heard has continued to campaign for justice and fairness, encouraging others to come forward and criticise the status quo by being shamelessly honest about her own issues. \n\nAn advocate for women's equality, Heard has cemented herself as a role model to young men and women and not surprisingly, is our GQ Woman of the Year. \n\nSee more on GQ.COM.AU\n\nCREDITS\n\nVideography: SixtyFour Films\n\nSUBSCRIBE HERE: https://www.gq.com.au/magazine\n\nFollow GQ on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/gqaustralia\nFollow GQ on Twitter: https://twitter.com/gqaustralia\nFollow GQ on Instagram: http://instagram.com/gqaustralia\nFollow GQ on Pinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/gqaustralia/",
