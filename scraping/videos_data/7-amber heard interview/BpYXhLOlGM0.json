The actress was recently interviewed by Access Hollywood, where she spoke about her new series\u00a0The Stand\u00a0and what she had learned in 2020. There are over 131k comments on the video at the time of writing, many of which are showing support for Heard\u2019s ex-husband,\u00a0Johnny Depp.\n\nBesides reflecting on her takeaways from the year, Heard also spoke about her new series \u2014 and why she thinks that it\u2019s particularly timely. She spoke about how the series, which debuted on CBS All Access in early December, follows the characters\u2019 lives as they struggle to adapt to the new world they are living in.\n\nAround the same time, Amber Heard recently that she was \u201cexcited to get started\u201d work on\u00a0Aquaman 2\u00a0\u2013 and that she hopes production will be getting underway some time next year. She also\u00a0responded\u00a0to those who seemingly called for her to be removed from her role as Mera, adding: \u201cPaid rumors and paid campaigns on social media don\u2019t dictate [casting decisions] because they have no basis in reality.
