Kate claimed her boy was terrified when she put him in front of the cameras as part of her publicity stunt. 4. She wasn't supposed to eat in her deposition and her gestures was pretty strange and funny at the same time. She obviously struggled to explain her lies. 5.

BUT this Amber I'm talking about. She had done so many horrific things for so many years and got away with it. \nI only believe people should be forgiven if they hold themselves accountable, if they straight up apologised for their actions even if it's only once - But Amber never did and she's still out there continuing to destroy people's lives such as Johnny Depp, like Kate James etc by continuing to lie and play victim.
