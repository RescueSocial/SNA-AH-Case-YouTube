            "description": "Olivia Munn is stunningly beautiful, and is in the news recently because she is allegedly dating John Mulaney amidst his divorce to Annamarie Tendler. I would like to, however, just cover a little about her life, and what plastic surgeries, and cosmetic procedures, she may have had done. I have had  requests to do a video on her non-stop, so here it is. \n\nSubscribe to my second channel ( Lorry Beauty): https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCplCCdqGsuRnwOoMjnKRSZw\n\n \n\nSupport my patreon and get EXCLUSIVE videos that youtube does not allow me to show due to the visual nature or the controversy of the fandom: https://patreon.com/lorryhill\n\n \n\nHave a suggestion for the channel?: https://www.lorryhill.com/suggestions/\n\nThis video is not meant to shame the celebrity we talk about and is meant to help people understand just how much work goes into a celebrity\u2019s perfect image. All views expressed here regarding plastic surgery procedures the celebrity has had are opinion and not to be taken as facts. I Have no actual proof that the celebrity has had these procedures. It is purely speculation based on my knowledge of plastic surgery and how it typically presents.\n\n\nOlivia Munn, actress, former TV Host, and Hobbyist financial investor, who was at one point the highest paid actress in the world, and an ambassador for covergirl. She is famous, worldwide, and known for her looks. Olivia Munn was born in Oklahoma city, on july 3, 1980, to her mother Kimberly (n\u00e9e Nguyen), and her father Winston Munn. Her father is German/Irish, and her mother is Vietnamese. Olivia has 4 older siblings, 2 are brothers, 2 are sisters. \n\n\nNatural Beauty traits of Olivia Munn: \n\nHooded eyes\n\nFreckles\n\nWide, bright smile\n\nLong dark hair\n\nThis was her pretty girl next door look, that has now changed to GOALS!\nOlivia Munn's teeth were her next target for change.  Olivia Munn has admitted to using Invisalign Clear Aligners on her teeth to straighten them.\nI will not disclose all the info that I will cover here, but just a general overview. I will cover Olivia Munn's possible procedures to her eyebrows, face, and some rumors about her cheeks being changed. I will cover the possibilities of some facial lifts, if she touched her in a rhinoplasty or not, and other nose procedures. I will also discuss the chance that Olivia Munn used lip fillers, botox, or other injectables. Finally we will end it with a message from Olivia about her eyes, and the scrutiny of people, and what they always say and think about looks. \n\n\nAs far as the controversy around Olivia, John, and his soon to be ex wife Annamarie Tendler, I hope that all parties can get along, and move forward smoothly. They will need to have good divorce lawyers to make sure they can split things fairly in this situation. I am mostly here for the looks, and the procedures. \n\n\nPlease know that although I have a very informed opinion based on my own experience I am not an EXPERT or a Doctor.  Please visit a plastic surgeon for medical advice.\n\nThank you to Miss J of Miss J Forum; much of my knowledge comes from there.\n\nLOVE YOU ALL!!!
