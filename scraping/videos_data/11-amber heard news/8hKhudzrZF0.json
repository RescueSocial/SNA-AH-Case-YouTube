This movie star is also rated  to be a talented actor.

Depp was accused of domestic abuse. He\u2019s denied the allegations, but lost a high-profile libel case against a newspaper that dubbed him a \u201cwife-beater.\" Due to the allegations against him, Warner Bros. asked him to step down from the role as Grindelwald in the Fantastic Beasts franchise. Depp has also lost his other most well-known role as Captain Jack Sparrow in Disney\u2019s Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. On the other hand, Amber Heard has begun filming for Aquaman 2.\n\nNow, Depp\u2019s online fans are angry and shocked that the same studio that fired the actor is continuing to employ Heard. They maintain that Heard should have a similar fate to Depp in regards to his firing from Fantastic Beasts. The online hate for Amber Heard\u2019s removal from Aquaman 2 is largely based on various unproven allegations that have been levelled against her over the years. Johnny Depp\u2019s lawyers had also accused the actress of a \u201ccalculated and manipulative lie.\"\n#JusticeForJohnnyDepp.\n\n\u201cI mean, obviously, they were going to do the film, and obviously he was not involved anymore,\" the \u201cAnother Round\" star said of Depp.\n\u201cBut I didn\u2019t have a dog in that fight.
