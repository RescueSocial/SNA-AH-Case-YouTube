            "description": "Johnny Depp is definitely the alive legend of Hollywood cinematography and the sex symbol of present days. He is not just an attractive man, but also a super-talented actor, who gave an outstanding contribution to modern entertainment industry. The characters, played by Depp, are really versatile and deep personalities. \n\nActually, he started his career as a member of a music band. The Sleepy Hollow start was really passionate about music \u2013 he could spend all day long playing the guitar. However, later, he was introduced to Nicolas Cage, who advised Johnny to try himself in acting. \n\nWell, let\u2019s have a look at people, who surrounded the future movie star, while he was a child.\n\nJohn Christopher Depp, the father of the Edward Scissorhands, worked as a civil engineer. Due to Johnny\u2019s father\u2019s job the family had to move a lot. Finally, when Captain Jack Sparrow was seven, they settled in Florida. When the future star was only fifteen his parents divorced. This created emotional distance between father and son. \n\nBetty Sue Palmer, Johnny\u2019s mother, was a waitress and a parent to four kids. After the divorce, Betty married once again to Robert Palmer. When Depp was 12, she presented him with his first guitar. That influenced him greatly, and the Hollywood icon even left high school to become a rock musician. Betty passed in 2016 at the age of 81 after long illness.\n\nThe actor has two half-siblings from his mother\u2019s side. \n\nDaniel Depp was born to Betty, before she married Christopher Depp, but was adopted after their wedding. Daniel is a history teacher and a writer. Daniel is definitely a bookworm \u2013 he is keen on reading, and even has his own bookshop in California, where he lives with his wife. He keeps his privacy and doesn\u2019t like being in the spotlight.\n\nDeborah J Depp is a younger Daniel\u2019s sister, who was also adopted by Johnny\u2019s father. Debbie is an elementary school teacher from Lexington, where she resides with her husband and two children. \n\nEliza Christi Depp-Dembrowski is three years older than her famous brother. She manages Infinitum Nihil \u2013 Depp\u2019s film production company and is a mother of four kids. Eliza is really close with her starry brother and gives him great assistance in his business dealings.",
