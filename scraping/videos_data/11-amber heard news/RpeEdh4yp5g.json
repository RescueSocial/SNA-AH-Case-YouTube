            "description": "\"He Won, I lost\" Amber Heard Apologises to Johnny Depp (IG LIVE Video) \n\u201cHe won, I lost\u201d. Amber Heard\u2019s latest apology to Johnny Depp is about to break the internet. While the court may have not announced its official verdict yet, it is safe to say that the situation is looking quite gloomy for Heard and her legal team. Ever since the allegations were first placed on Johnny Depp by his former wife, the legal battle has taken a number of twists and turns. The U.S Libel case that appeared to be swooping in favor of Heard years ago, seems to have taken a sharp turn in the opposite direction lately. This is not only great news for Johnny Depp fans but also puts a huge question mark on Amber Heard\u2019s credibility. So what developments have taken the case away from Heard and how has she responded? Let\u2019s find that out in this video.\n\n\ud83d\udc9c If you enjoyed this video make sure to leave a like and a comment telling us what you thougt! \n\nIf hollywood and the latest entertainment news are some of your interests, then you should make sure to subscribe to our channel!
