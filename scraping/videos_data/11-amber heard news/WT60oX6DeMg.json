Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been fighting over 4 years now. However, it is already can be said that there is a slow progress in this case and it becomes clear that Johnny Depp will get the justice he deserves any time soon. The case is still going on in the US and so far, the judges are presiding over the suit are ruling in favor of Johnny Depp. With all the new evidence coming up, it is clear that Amber Heard might lose the legal battle and to avoid that Amber Heard\u2019s lawyers have tried everything to get the court to toss out the defamation suit and adopt the ruling of the UK libel case.\nWe all know that it's a really difficult battle for Johnny Depp and that the consequences are really dramatic for him, because he lost so many roles and Hollywood started boycotting him. JD even spoke up about cancel culture recently and said that he is a victim of cancel culture and that \u201cno one is safe\u201d from the movement, calling on people to \u201cstand up\u201d for people facing \u201cinjustice\u201d.\n\u201cIt can be seen as an event in history that lasted for however long it lasted, this cancel culture, this instant rush to judgement based on what essentially amounts to polluted air,\u201d he commented ahead of receiving the honorary Donostia Award at this year\u2019s San Sebastian Film Festival.\n\u201cIt\u2019s so far out of hand now that I can promise you that no one is safe. Not one of you. No one out that door. No one is safe,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt takes one sentence and there\u2019s no more ground, the carpet has been pulled. It\u2019s not just me that this has happened to, it\u2019s happened to a lot of people. This type of thing has happened to women, men. Sadly, at a certain point they begin to think that it\u2019s normal. Or that it\u2019s them. When it\u2019s not.\u201d\nPlus, Johnny Depp suffered a major defeat in the British High Court last year when a judge ruled that it wasn\u2019t libelous to describe him as a \u201cwife-beater\u201d, but losing one battle isn\u2019t the end of the war.\nThe big finale is coming in Fairfax County, Virginia in mid-2022, where he\u2019s suing Amber Heard for $50M over a Washington Post op-ed she wrote about her experience as a victim of domestic vi*lence. We all remember that article, that Amber Heard wrote in 2018 for the Washington Post, and how Amber Heard was praised by many women first. Amber Heard even called herself a \u2018public figure representing domestic ab*se\u2019 and she said: \u2018I feel the full force of our culture\u2019s wrath for women who speak out\u2019. Even though Johnny\u2019s name wasn\u2019t mentioned anywhere in Amber\u2019s op-ed, it was not difficult to figure out who Amber was referring to. Plus, Amber Heard claimed to be a survivor of domestic abuse.\nSince the article went viral, Johnny Depp has become an object of public hate and Johnny Depp lost some of his roles and his life was never the same. Well, Johnny Depp was not ready to be defeated and in 2019 Johnny Depp sued U.K. newspaper The Sun for referring to him in a story as a \u201cwife-beater.\u201d And as it was already said, the judge found the paper\u2019s claims to be substantially true, based largely on Amber Heard\u2019s own testimony and JD lost the battle.  \nHowever, JD also sued Amber Heard for $50 million for defamation over the article and this time celebs and even media outlets had already understood that Amber has been lying all this time and she\u2019s not a victim at all. She is the one who made up a vicious plan to destroy Johnny Depp\u2019s life. \n\nSo, now I want to know your opinion. Do you think Amber Heard will win this time? Or she is going to fail and we all will celebrate Johnny Depp\u2019s triumph? Let me know your opinion in the comments section down below.
