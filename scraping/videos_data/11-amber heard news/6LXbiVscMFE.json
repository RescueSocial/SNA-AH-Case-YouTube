            "description": "Amber Heard Faces 5 Years In PRISON For Bribing Sister To Lie In Court!?\nAmber Heard for years now has said that her ex-husband in Johnny Depp has hurt her in various ways. Not the least of which was led to her divorcing him in 2016. But while many were very quick to believe her in 2016 and even 2017 when she wrote an Op-Ed about it, things have very much changed now. Because more and more evidence has come forward to showcase  and the lengths she\u2019s gone to in order to make people think she\u2019s innocent. Including potentially paying off her sister. We\u2019ll break it down for you.
