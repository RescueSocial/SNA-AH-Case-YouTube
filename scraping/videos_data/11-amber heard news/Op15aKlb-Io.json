They demand the head of a specific person. Later, we get more insights about Atul and his family life. Whose head are they demanding? Why are they demanding someone's head? Is this an act of revenge? What will Atul's parents do to save their son? Watch the episode to know more.\n\nAbout Crime Patrol : \n---------------------------------\nCrime Patrol will attempt to look at the signs, the signals that are always there before these mindless crimes are committed. Instincts/Feelings/Signals that so often tell us that not everything is normal. Maybe, that signal/feeling/instinct is just not enough to believe it could result in a crime. Unfortunately, after the crime is committed, those same signals come haunting.\n\n#crimepatrolsatark\n#crime",
