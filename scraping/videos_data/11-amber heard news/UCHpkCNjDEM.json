Amber Heard accused\nJohnny Depp of being ab*sive towards her and described Johnny Depp being\nangry, hostile and threatening. Johnny Depp was even called a \u2018wife-beater\u2019\nwhich ruined his career absolutely. One by one, he started losing the roles and it\nseemed there was no way out. But tables got turned and in 2021 the narrative\nhas completely changed. Right now there are much more fans who think that\nAmber Heard was the ab*ser and she tried to frame Johnny Depp to ruin his\ncareer.\nMake sure you stay till the end to see Amber Heard\u2019s vicious plan against\nJohnny Depp and what indicates that Amber was using Johnny Depp for her\nown purposes.\nLet's get back for a while to the fact that Amber Heard said she had been\nassaulted by Johnny Depp on more than 14 occasions. She said she had, at\ntimes, been in fear for her life and left with a broken nose, black eyes and split\nlip. Vicious, drunken tirades had, she said, lasted for days. There was also a 15th\nallegation too traumatic and personal to be heard in open court. The whole\nworld was shocked and these allegations even made Amber Heard a hero as not\nevery victim of domestic violence is brave enough to speak. Since then, Amber\nHeard has become a vocal campaigner on the issue of domestic and sexual\nabuse. The UN Human Rights Campaign named her as a Human Rights\nChampion for her work promoting women's rights. She became an Ambassador\nfor Women's Rights for the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and she\nhas given speeches and written in the Washington Post and New York Times\nabout her experience of domestic violence.\nIn the era of Me Too, she was a leading figure, speaking up for women who had\nsuffered in silence by revealing the abuse she had endured at the hands of one of\nthe most powerful people in Hollywood. She was Amber Heard, actor, model,\nactivist and domestic abuse survivor. However, her own assistant exposed\nAmber Heard for using her s*xual assault story. Since then (and many other\nsituations when Amber Heard was exposed for lying, being aggressive or\nviolent), fans and even experts started analyzing Amber Heard\u2019s behavior.\n\nThe first thing that attracted attention was Amber Heard\u2019s body language. When\nbody language analysts made a conclusion that Amber Heard lied in court\n(when there was a leaked audio case), everyone started looking closely at\nseveral photos and videos of Johnny Depp and Amber Heard together. In almost\nevery photo taken at the beginning of their relationship Johnny Depp looks very\nmuch into Amber Heard. He looks at her like someone who really loves Amber.\nWhile the actress doesn\u2019t really care, she is way more into the cameras and\nspotlight. But then it became even worse, and you don\u2019t need to be a\nrelationship expert to understand that. \n\nAnd now I want to know your opinion about Amber Heard\u2019s behaviour. Do you\nthink Amber Heard never loved Johnny Depp and just used him for fame?
