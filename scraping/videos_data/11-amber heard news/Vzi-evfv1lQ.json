News, Heard\u2019s attorneys say the 53-year-old actors failed to pay the first two installments of their seven figure settlement as well as neglecting to transfer the title to their Range Rover into her name as well as the division of personal property.\n\nShe\u2019s also requested that her legal fees \u2013 totaling a little over 35 thousand dollars \u2013 be taken care of.\n\nIn the docs, Heard wrote a written declaration regarding Johnny\u2019s decision to try to give the money to a charity instead of her. She also wrote that he claimed she violated the confidentiality provisions of the Deal Point Memorandum by announcing that she would be donating her settlement to charities. She also points out that she made those donations in good faith and was responding to the leaks by Johnny\u2019s agents bragging that she settled for substantially less than an earlier offer sum and attempting to label her as a gold digger. \n\nHeard and Depp announced their divorce back in May after reports claim the star was physically abusive. \n\nFor all your best and latest Kim Kardashian, KUWTK and Celebrity News, visit our Splash News TV YouTube Channel daily.
