[ johnny depp ill [ johnny depp recent ]\n\nJohnny Depp attends the premiere of Disney's 'Pirates Of The Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales' at Dolby Theatre on May 18, 2017 in Hollywood, Calif.\nFans are concerned for Johnny Depp\u2019s state of well-being after recent photos of the actor appearing \u201cill\u201d surfaced online over the weekend.\n\nDepp posed with fans at a Four Seasons hotel in St. Petersburg, Russia, last week, looking visibly thinner than in previous appearances.\n\n\u201cI think my hero looks ill,\u201d one user commented on Facebook of the shared fan photo.\n\nOther comments included, \u201cHe looks thin\u201d and \u201cF-k me is that Johnny Depp?\u201d\n\nThe actor was in Russia for a performance with his band, the Hollywood Vampires. Earlier in the week, Depp posed for fan photos in Moscow, donning sunglasses and a hat. The image also provoked concern in comment sections, where users described the actor as appearing \u201csick,\u201d \u201cweak\u201d and \u201cskinny.\u201d The reasoning behind the actor\u2019s new look is unclear.\n\nDepp has been in the headlines in the past year due to varied legal disputes, including one with his former management company, since 2017. The actor sued TMG and its principals Joel and Robert Mandel, alleging the managers loaned millions to third parties without permission, failed to keep proper books and invested his money in business ventures in which they had ownership interests, among other claims.\n\nIn 2017 Depp also faced divorce proceedings from actress Amber Heard after she accused him of physical abuse. Heard was later given a $7 million divorce settlement that she donated to charity.\n\nDepp is currently in post-production on City of Lies and Richard Says Goodbye, according to IMDb.\n\nTHR reached out to Depp's reps for comment.\n\nMusic Source:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulPvZFgoGYk",
