Depp\u2019s legal team claimed in the lawsuit that the domestic violence claims against the actor were a \u201choax\u201d to further Heard\u2019s career. \nDepp\u2019s lawsuit also accused Heard of having an affair with Tesla founder Musk while they were still married, which Musk has denied. \nHeard and Musk were first spotted together in July 2016 at a Miami Beach hotel around two months after the \u201cAquaman\u201d star filed for divorce from Depp. \nAt the time a source insisted, \u201cShe has been friends with Elon for four years.\u201d \nIn August 2016, it was revealed the Tesla co-founder had been trying to meet Heard for years. \nMusk, 47, and Heard, 32, were finally photographed together in Australia holding hands for the first time in April 2017. \nThe couple split up a few months later in August but reunited in November and continued to rekindle their romance into 2018. Just one month later, they called it quits for good. \nIn a new court filing, Heard said Depp would \u201cbecome a totally different person, often delusional and violent\u201d when he was using drugs. \n\u201cWe called that version of Johnny, \u2018the Monster,'\u201d Heard said. \n\u201cThe root of Johnny\u2019s violence against Amber, and now his defamation lawsuit against Amber, is his fixation, his jealousy and obsessive control and his need to exert ownership over her body,\u201d a source close to the ex-couple told Page Six. \n\u201cIt is clear from Amber\u2019s declaration that Johnny thought she was f**king Billy Bob Thornton, James Franco. Johnny\u2019s lawsuit accuses her of cheating with Elon Musk, so now Depp wants to drag Elon into court.\u201d \nHeard has never been linked with Thornton nor Franco, and Musk insists their relationship didn\u2019t start until after her split with Depp. \nThis story originally appeared in the New York Post.",
