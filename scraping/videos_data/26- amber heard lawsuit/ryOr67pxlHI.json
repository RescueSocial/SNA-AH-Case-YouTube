Jun 7, 2018  AceShowbiz - Johnny Depp has launched a libel lawsuit against bosses at British tabloid The Sun.   The Pirates of the Caribbean star filed the paperwork against publishing company News Group Newspapers Limited and columnist Dan Wootton on Friday, June 01 over a headline reading \"How can J.K. Rowling be 'genuinely happy' casting wife-beater Johnny Depp in the new Fantastic Beasts film?\" which was published in April.  The headline referenced allegations Depp's ex-wife Amber Heard made against him towards the end of their marriage, when she accused him of being physically and verbally abusive towards her throughout their brief union. Following the allegations, which the actor vehemently denied, Depp was cast as Gellert Grindelwald in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them and the film's upcoming sequel, which marked Rowling's screenwriting debut.   And the author stood behind the decision to cast him.   \"The filmmakers and I are not only comfortable sticking with our original casting, but genuinely happy to have Johnny playing a major character in the movies,\" a statement read.   Depp is suing for $268,300 (\u00a3200,000) and $14,100 (\u00a310,528) for legal fees. He is also seeking damages to be determined at a later date and an injunction barring editors at the paper from \"continuing to publish\" stories about the alleged abuse.
