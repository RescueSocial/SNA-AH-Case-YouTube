            "description": "LONDON (AP) \u2014 A U.K. High Court judge ruled Monday that actor Johnny Depp violated a court order by failing to disclose evidence relating to his drug use to lawyers for British tabloid The Sun, which he is suing for libel.Judge Andrew Nicol deferred a decision on whether to throw out Depp\u2019s claim against The Sun as a result.Depp is suing the newspaper\u2019s publisher, News Group Newspapers, and Executive Editor Dan Wootton over a 2018 article claiming the actor was violent and abusive to his ex-wife, Amber Heard.The trial is due to open at the High Court in London on July 7. But The Sun\u2019s lawyers argue the case should be dismissed because Depp failed to disclose text messages he exchanged with an assistant showing that he tried to buy \u201cMDMA and other narcotics\u201d while he was in Australia with Heard in 2015.Lawyers for The Sun urge judge to throw out Johnny Depp lawsuit against tabloidThe newspaper\u2019s lawyer, Adam Wolanski, said withholding the texts was a breach of a previous court order requiring Depp to provide all documents from separate libel proceedings against Heard in the United States. He said the lapse endangered the defendants\u2019 ability to get a fair trial.Judge Nicol ruled Monday that Depp had breached the disclosure order, and found that \u201cthe Australian drug texts were adverse to the claimant\u2019s pleaded case and/or were supportive of the defendants\u2019 pleaded case.\u201dHe did not immediately throw out the case, allowing Depp\u2019s lawyers to argue why the trial should go ahead.Depp\u2019s lawyer, David Sherborne, said it would be \u201cwholly disproportionate\u201d to scuttle the case.\u201cThe central matter in dispute in these proceedings is whether or not the claimant committed multiple acts of serious unprovoked physical violence during his relationship with Amber Heard, causing her significant injuries and to be put in fear for her life,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is now time for the defendants to have to prove what they published.\u201dDepp, 57, and Heard, 34, met on the set of the 2011 comedy \u201cThe Rum Diary\u201d and married in Los Angeles in February 2015. They divorced in 2017.Each accuses the other of being abusive, and Depp is also suing Heard for libel in the United States.Depp and Heard are both expected to give evidence in person at the London trial, which was postponed from March because of the coronavirus pandemic.",
