            "description": "NASHVILLE, TN (WSMV) - Video deposition of David Chase, obtained by the Channel 4 I-Team, shows the embattled hotel developer criticizing the district attorney and the woman who accused him of domestic violence, while discussing his own troubled past.\n\nAnother court filing also shows Chase asked for, and received, a change in his bond conditions that allowed him to remove the interlock device in his car.\n\nChase\u2019s attorney writes in the filing that Chase wants to become an Uber driver.\n\nChase became a familiar name in middle Tennessee in 2014 after he was charged with domestic violence and was then allowed by a judge to avoid a 12-hour cooling off period after his arrest.\n\nAfter that charge was ultimately dropped, Chase then filed a civil lawsuit in Williamson County, suing nine people, including Chase\u2019s ex-girlfriend who brought the criminal charge against him.\n\nWhen asked what the DA\u2019s office could have done different, Chase replied, \u201cAny level of investigation at all, period. Which they didn\u2019t do any.\u201d\n\nChase claims after the criminal charge, his reputation was damaged. He suffered humiliation and millions of dollars in financial loss because he said the ex-girlfriend he is accused of attacking conspired with another former girlfriend and others to ruin him.\n\n\u201cShe stalked, harassed, trespassed, assaulted me and made false allegations that had me falsely imprisoned,\u201d Chase said.\n\n\u201cShe denies that she assaulted him,\u201d said Rob McGuire, who represents Chase\u2019s ex-girlfriend. \u201cShe denies that she entered into this conspiracy to defame him or ruin him. The truth of the matter is she\u2019s a domestic violence victim.\u201d\n\nIn the deposition, attorney Brian Manookian, who represents some of the others being sued, grilled Chase about his past. He asked how someone\u2019s reputation can be damaged if their reputation is already questionable.\n\n\u201cJust tell me, how many times do you think you\u2019ve been charged with assault, regardless of who charged you?\u201d Manookian asked. \u201cAnd keep going down this list, including the DUIs.\u201d\n\n\u201cFive,\u201d Chase replied.\n\n\u201cDo gentlemen take molly, snort cocaine, hang out in strip clubs and date strippers?\u201d Manookian asked.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d Chase said. \u201cSure some do.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou would be one of those types of gentlemen, wouldn\u2019t you, Mr. Chase?\u201d Manookian said.\n\n\u201cApparently so,\u201d Chase said.\n\nIn the deposition, Chase said he is currently unemployed.\n\nChase\u2019s attorney spoke to Channel 4 Thursday. He said the deposition did not tell Chase\u2019s whole story and he hopes to get justice through the suit.\n\nChase\u2019s request to remove the interlock device was approved. It is unclear if he is currently working as an Uber driver.",
