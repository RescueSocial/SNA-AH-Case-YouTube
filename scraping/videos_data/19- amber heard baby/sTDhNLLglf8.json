Set in his beloved Baltimore, the story follows a pretty-boy greaser (Johnny Depp), whom Waters has described as \"the best-looking gas station attendant in the world,\" as he and his gang of rockers pay homage to the long-lost delinquent-teen films of the '50s and '60s. Waters hits every genre cliche in the book; there's plenty of rockabilly music, cheesy dance montages, heavy petting and, of course, a little perversion, although it pales in comparison to the likes of Pink Flamingos or Desperate Living. Cry-Baby is sure to amuse most audiences, with the exception of hardcore Waters fans more accustomed to scenes involving poodles or appendage transplants.\n\nCREDITS:\nTM & \u00a9 Universal (1990)\nCast: Johnny Depp, Amy Locane\nDirector: John Waters\nProducers: Jim Abrahams, Brian Grazer, Pat Moran, Rachel Talalay\nScreenwriter: John Waters\n\nWHO ARE WE?\nThe MOVIECLIPS channel is the largest collection of licensed movie clips on the web.
