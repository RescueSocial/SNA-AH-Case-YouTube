With her magical necklace, the Amulet of Avalor, to help her along with lots of caring new friends, Sofia soon realizes that to be a true princess you must have goodness and kindness in your heart. \n\nTHE AMULET OF AVALOR\nThis ancient, beautiful and magical necklace is given to Sofia by her new step-father, King Roland II to welcome her into the family. Among it\u2019s powers, the amulet allows Sofia to talk to woodland animals, transform into a mermaid and back again, shrink to the size of a sprite or grow to the size of a giant! If that wasn\u2019t enough, this magical necklace can also summon Disney princesses to offer advice to Sofia and has even summoned Olaf when she needed his help!  \n\nPRINCESS AMBER OF ENCHANCIA\nAmber is Sofia\u2019s fashion-loving, bossy older sister and twin to Prince James. Although she can be a bit vain, spoilt and jealous, she cares deeply for her family, especially her father King Roland and will always admit when she is wrong. \n\n PRINCE JAMES OF ENCHANCIA\nJames is the exact opposite to his twin sister, Amber. He is not at all vain, bossy or bad tempered. Although he means well, James often breaks the rules \u2013 even when he tries hard not to! He is never happier than when he is having fun with Sofia and with Amber \u2013 when she is being nice!\n \nQUEEN MIRANDA OF ENCHANCIA\nIt was love at first sight when Sofia\u2019s mother, Miranda and King Roland met. Once married, she became Queen of Enchancia and step-mother to Amber and James. But is she a wicked step-mother? No way! Queen Miranda is loving, kind and caring to all three children. She is very supportive of Sofia, Amber and James and is always on hand to lift their spirits if they\u2019re feeling down. \n\nKING ROLAND II\nKing Roland is very regal but also a very fair and kind king. He fell in love straight away when he met Queen Miranda, who was a humble shoemaker with the kindest heart. He loves his \u2018jiggly-wiggly\u2019 pudding but most of all, he loves his family more than anything.",
