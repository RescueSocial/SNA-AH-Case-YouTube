            "description": "In the newest 3D action-adventure from the director of MY BLOODY VALENTINE, DRIVE ANGRY 3D stars Nicolas Cage as Milton, a hardened felon who has broken out of hell for one last chance at redemption.  Intent on stopping a vicious cult who murdered his daughter, he has three days to stop them before they sacrifice her baby beneath a full moon.\r\n\r\nHe's joined by Piper (Amber Heard) -- a young, sexy waitress who liberates her ex-boyfriend's cherry-red muscle car in order to help Milton.  Now, the two of them are hot on the trail of the deadly leader of the cult, Jonah King (Billy Burke), who believes it is his destiny to use the baby to unleash hell on earth.\r\n\r\nBut the bloodthirsty cult is the least of Milton's problems.  The police are after him too.  And worse, an enigmatic killer known only as \"The Accountant\" -- who has been sent by the Devil to retrieve Milton and deliver him back to hell. With wicked cunning and hypnotic savagery, the Accountant will relentlessly pursue Milton at high speed across the country until his mission is accomplished.\r\n\r\nFueled by high octane and pure rage, Milton must use his anger to go beyond all human limits to avenge his daughter's murder, before his last chance at redemption is revoked. \r\n\r\nDRIVE ANGRY 3D opens in theaters February 25, 2011.\r\n\r\nBecome a fan at http://www.facebook.com/driveangry3d",
