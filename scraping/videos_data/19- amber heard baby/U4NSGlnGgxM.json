            "description": "At a ceremony held in Barbados where the country was honoring Rihanna, she was wearing a beautiful dress that created either an optical illusion or a major announcement: a possible baby bump. The internet lit up and we all started looking for clues and confirmation that Bad Girl Riri might be expecting a baby with boyfriend A$AP Rocky. While the two have been dating for a while now, and their friendship goes back about a decade, Rocky hasn\u2019t put a ring on it yet and they haven\u2019t confirmed whether or not a little one is on the way. But let\u2019s be honest, we all love their love and know that they would make great parents. They\u2019re wonderful partners professionally, from collaborating on music to going on tour together, and have shared how much fun they have working together - which makes us think they would have so much fun as mom and dad! Rocky has shared Barbadian roots through his dad, and has come to the island to celebrate the holidays with Rihanna\u2019s family in 2020. While Rihanna\u2019s career seems to show no indication of slowing down, this might be the perfect time to bring a baby into the mix, and we\u2019re all rooting for it. So what do you think? Baby bump or wishful thinking? Let us know in the comments below, and don\u2019t forget to like and subscribe for your fave Riri content.
