Some scenes are cut due to \"certain events\" taking place and also because we were using VRChat. We did not have any baby avatars to use either.\n\nLavender had rushed to the hospital after receiving spam texts from Dimensional Silver about Dimensional Blaze going into labor. Due to her experience and being a mother of twins herself, she had arrived to help the two out along with Dragon the Hedgehog. Will everything go well? And will the babies and parents be alright? Most importantly, will Lavender be able to hold herself together due to her labor experience?\n\nDragon's Channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/XxDragonBladexX\n\nDimensional Silver's Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCStJT0NEkAzmLLNpyVScD4w\n\nDimensional Blaze's Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCb0P8a6hBlfOeP2hZ22pDHQ\n\nDonate to PayPal here: https://paypal.me/fluffykittyofdoom1?locale.x=en_US\n\nANY FORM OF HARASSMENT IN THE COMMENTS SECTION WILL NOT BE TOLERATED.
