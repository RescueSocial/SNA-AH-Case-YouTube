Mother wolf is there. She says to the little boy, \"Mowgli, be careful, you could hurt yourself.\"\nMowgli, as an infant had been found by the wolf in the jungle; she had brought him up just as she had brought up her own cubs. Mowgli, still a boy played with all the animals in the jungle. He had many friends; Bhaloo, the bear. Bhagera, the panther and his many monkey friends. But Sher Khan, the tiger was no fiend. Mowgli had always been warned to stay away from Sher Khan's territory. Sher Khan did not like Mowgli and waited for a chance to harm the boy.\n\nOne day, while Mowgli was playing, Bhaloo came running to Mowgli and said, \"Mowgli, Sher Khan is in a terrible temper. He is going around telling everyone that he wants to kill you.\" Mowgli said, \"Don't worry Bhaloo, I can protect myself.\"\n\nMowgli had a plan. It was to counter attack. He wanted to let loose the wild bulls of the forest on Sher Khan. To do this he had to corner Sher Khan. He knew where Sher Khan spent most of his time; it was on a slope in the mountains, far from Mowgli's cave. He did not want Sher Khan to spot him because that would be the end of him. Mowgli thought, \"I should go around the mountain and to the top without Sher Khan seeing me. From the top the bulls can charge at Sher Khan.\"\n\nThat evening, Mowgli gathered eight wild bulls with the longest and sharpest horns. He said, \"Today, we will put an end to the reign of terror by Sher Khan. This is my plan.\" Mowgli explained to the bulls how he wanted to attack Sher Khan.\n\nAs per plan, they circled the mountain, unnoticed by the slumbering tiger. Once they reached the top, they could see in a clearing a little below rested Sher Khan. Mowgli said, \"Once I give you the signal, charge together. Any false move and we could be endangering out lives.\" Mowgli lifted up his hands, brought it down and shouted, \"CHARGE.\"\n\nThe bulls ran down the slope, kicking up huge amounts of dust. Sher Khan looked up hearing this thunderous noise. He saw the bulls hurtling towards him; he tried to turn and run but before he knew it the bulls were on top of him. The bulls pierced Sher Khan with their horns and flung him with the momentum of their run. Sher Khan was hurled and flung to his death.\n\nMowgli and the bulls proudly went to announce to the jungle folks of Sher Khan's end.\n\nSubscribe to our Geethanjali Kids and Nursery Rhymes Channel:\nhttps://goo.gl/bA03R1\n\n#junglebook #hindifairytales #mowglistory #fairytalesinhindi #hindikahaniya",
