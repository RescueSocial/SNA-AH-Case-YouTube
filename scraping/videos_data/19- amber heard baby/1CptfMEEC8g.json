Besides teaming up with R&B superstar Taio Cruz on his single release \u201cSigns\u201c, his remix of \u201cBella Ciao\u201c proved to be this year\u2019s biggest party anthem. Racking up more than 150 million streams worldwide, the remix has already reached Gold status in GSA. Never one to rest on his laurels, his most recent remix \u201cCe Soir?\u201c climbed the iTunes Charts as well, reaching the top 10 only three days after its release as well as being listed in major playlists on Spotify and Apple Music. \nHUGEL has remixed songs for and worked with international A-list artists such as Charlie Puth, David Guetta, J. Balvin, Robin Schulz, Tiesto, Taio Cruz or Post Malone and played some of the biggest festivals in the world including Tomorrowland, Mysteryland, Lollapalooza, and Parookaville. After opening on David Guetta\u2019s European Arena Tour, he played his third residency in Ibiza this year, appearing monthly at Ushuaia\u2019s party BIG by David Guetta as well as the legendary Pacha. HUGEL currently plays over 100 live shows a year, boasts over 3.8 million monthly listeners on Spotify and over 66 million views on his YouTube Channel.",
