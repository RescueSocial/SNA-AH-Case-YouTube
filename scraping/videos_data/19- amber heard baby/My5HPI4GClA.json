            "description": "Amber Heard has a baby ,no click bait ,straight up she posted on her IG today .!!!  Im not going to hate on an innocent child ,but she lost her mind. Why she did this to gain clout ? to be and look more wholesome for court ,revenge,money or just the genuine wish to be a mother ? Im really not sure it could be all of these things . But still it got me off guard ,specially the caption OMG ,actually the birth was on April 8 and there is a post on IG same date on which she seems so happy and passive aggressive saying\" SORRY ABOUT THE DEAD THREADS\"  ,with a smile on her face . Is that a good mindset to have the same day your child is born ? ?? I think is interesting and her insanity never ceases to amuse me, also her need of attention is probably a huge factor .Now everybody is talking about free britney and Manson case so AH could not just let go ,yep that is what it is. Also Im not hating on parents that adopt or saying that I am better because I birth my children not at all ! All I am saying is that she is not capable to take care of a gold fish . Thank you for watching ,more on Manson later I promise . :)  #amberheardbaby #amberheardnews #justiceforjohnny #johnnydeppisinnocent #amberheardlies",
