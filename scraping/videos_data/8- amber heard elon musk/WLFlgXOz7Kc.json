            "description": "A worldwide known billionaire Elon Musk is always surrounded by Hollywood beauties. Perhaps, that\u2019s why the list of his ex-wives and girlfriends is not that short. So, let\u2019s have a look at Tesla's founder relationships, marriages, divorces and kids. \n\nJustine Wilson\n2000-2008\n\nShe is now a well-known Canadian author, who had been married to Musk for 8 years. The couple began dating when both of them were studying at the Ontario\u2019s Queen University. Soon after their wedding, they welcomed a firstborn, a son who they named Nevada. Unfortunately, at the age of just 10 weeks he passed away from a sudden infant syndrome. Later, Justine and Elon became parents to twins in 2004 and triplets in 2006. And even though they were raising five kids together, they filed for a divorce after eight years of married life. They remained close and co-parent the kids.\n\nTalulah Riley\n2008-2016\n\nAfter the spit from the first spouse, the founder of SpaceX got romantically involved with a British actress. After two years of being together, they tied the knot officially and had been a happy married couple until they called it quits in 2012. Nonetheless, this breakup didn\u2019t last long and they got hitched again in 2013. In 2014 Musk filed for a second divorce but it was later withdrawn. In 2016, the media started saying that their divorce proceedings were underway once again. And this time it was true, with Riley herself filing for a divorce from her husband. That same year everything was successfully finalized. They split on good terms and frequently see each other.\n\nCameron Diaz\nMarch-May 2013\n\nAccording to some sources, after the first divorce from Riley, Elon had a short-term affair with a famous Hollywood movie star. Their romance started after Diaz purchased a Tesla. Although, it ended as quickly as it began. \n\nAmber Heard\n2016-2018\n\nThe relationship between these two love birds had been on and off since 2016 till 2018. When Heard divorced Johnny Depp, she found her happiness in Musk. They were often spotted together at various events between 2016 and 2017. In early 2018 they tried to get the feelings back but decided that it would be better to walk separate ways. Nowadays, even though they are not together anymore, they still care for each other.\n\nGrimes\n2018-present time\n\nFor many people, this couple is very bizarre and most probably won\u2019t last long. Musk and an indie musician met over Twitter when they both joked about artificial intelligence online. Soon after that, they came together arm-in-arm at the 2018 Met Gala. They were even spotted together at Kim Kardashian\u2019s Christmas party with Kim taking a picture with them and uploading it on social media. At the beginning of 2020 Grimes shared a picture on Instagram and wrote about her pregnancy. In the revealed photo one can clearly see a baby bump, meaning that Elon is going to be a father for the sixth time.\nDo you want to see more?\nSubscribe!",
