            "description": "\"ELON IS THE FATHER\" Elon Musk REACTS To Rumors On Being Amber Heard's BABY DADDY  | The HollyVibe\n\nElon Musk just keeps getting dragged back into the Johnny Depp Amber Heard celeb drama. Elon Musk, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard are back on the frontlines of celebrity news. Amber Heard just had a baby girl and rumors are swirling on who the baby's father is. Many are saying it is Johnny Depp. Some are saying is Elon Musk himself. Elon Musk and Amber Heard are past lovers and rumors are swirling that Elon Musk paid Amber Heard's 7 million donation to the ACLU back in 2016. So these two have a history together.\n\nBut no public statements have been made in this regard by either Elon Musk, Johnny Depp or Amber Heard. So no one knows for sure yet. In this video, we breakdown the story in detail. This celebrity drama goes down while the Johnny Depp Amber Heard civil court case rages on.\n\nWith the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. \n\nEver since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.\n\n#AmberHeard #JohnnyDepp #JusticeForJohnny\n\nWe tell you interesting things about these Hollywood celebrities that you may have never heard before.\n\nPlease subscribe to our channel to stay up to date with interesting facts about Hollywood Celebs.\n\nCheers!",
