Back in July first, Heard posted a picture of herself holding a baby on Instagram which surprised everyone because she had never mentioned anything even remotely referring to a pregnancy. Another fact many fans pointed out was that the baby looked at least a few months old but that isn\u2019t very surprising after you find out it was a surrogate baby because she has several medical issues that prevent her from having a child.
