Depp's allegations come after Amber Heard's 2018 Washington Post op-ed, where she accused the Fantastic Beasts actor of domestic violence. Depp denies these claims and has called them an \"elaborate hoax\" to advance her own career. \n\nBritish newspaper Metro.co.uk was first to report that Depp's attorney has issued a subpoena against Musk ,the Tesla CEO and Heard's former boyfriend.New York Post website page six also followed up with a similar story hours later. \n\nThe latest development in the legal battle involves an alleged affair Johnny Depp claims Amber Heard had with tech mogul Elon Musk while they were still married. Heard and Musk have confirmed to have been in a relationship shortly after The Rum Diary co-stars called it quits in 2016, but Depp has gathered information that points to the two possibly being together before that. \n\nDepp's attorney Adam Waldman told the publications ,\"We have now issued subpoenas to Amber Heard, her hoax assisting friends, Elon Musk and other witnesses to explain the avalanche of the video, Audio, photographic and testimonial evidence with which we intend to confront them.\" \n\nA source told page six, however \"Musk has not received anything\" as yet. He and Heard split in February 2018 following an on-off relationship.Heard also told that the pair now enjoy a \"beautiful friendship\" based on \"intellectual curiosity, ideas and conversation, a shared love for science.\"\n\nRecent surveillance footage from the garage of their building has Amber Heard and Elon Musk next to each other in an Elevator, per News 18. In addition to this, a lawsuit file statement makes the following claims: \n\nOnly one month after Mr. Depp and Ms. Heard were married - while Mr Depp was out of the country, filming in March 2015- Eastern Columbia Building personnel testified that Ms. Heard received Musk 'late night' at Mr Depp's penthouse. Specially Ms. Heard asked staff at the Eastern Columbia Building to give her friend Elon access to the building's parking garage and the penthouse elevator 'late at night' and they testified that they did so. Building staff would then see Mrs. Heard's friend Elon leaving the building the next morning. \n\nHeard asked a judge to dismiss the $50 million law suit on Friday. Heard filed a motion in the circuit court of Fairfax asking for the case to be struck out. She offered new details about instances in which Depp `` shaped her, shoved her, pulled her hair and choked her,\" AP said, providing photos as evidence. \n\nSince their divorce Mr Depp has continued to publically harass Ms Heard and attempted to gaslight the world by denying his abuse. It is long past time for Mr Depp's despicable conduct to end. Heard's attorney told AP. \nDepp's lawyer Waldman denied the claims and said it was Heard who abused his client. In an email to AP, he added \" The only way for Amber Heard to sustain her hoax is with more lies.\" \n\nSo that's all for today's video.
