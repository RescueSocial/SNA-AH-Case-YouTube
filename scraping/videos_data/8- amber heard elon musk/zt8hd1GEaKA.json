            "description": "There may be electricity flying between Amber Heard and billionaire Elon Musk amid the actress' high profile and nasty divorce from Johnny Depp.\n\nThe 30-year-old starlet is reportedly \"spending time\" with the mogul behind Tesla Motors and SpaceX, TMZ reported Thursday.\n\nMusk, who is also going through a divorce, and Heard have apparently been friends for years and have been seeing each other more in the last few months, according to the gossip site.\n\nTwo weeks ago they allegedly enjoyed a dinner date and last weekend, Heard and her sister hung out in Musk's hotel in Miami.\n\nReps for the stars did not immediately return the News request for comment.\n\nHeard filed for divorce from the \"Pirates of the Caribbean Star\" in late May \u2014 three days after his mom, Betty Sue Palmer, died.\n\nFour days later, the \"Danish Girl\" star appeared in court bearing a visible bruise on her face and alleged a history of domestic abuse throughout their 15 month marriage.\n\nShe was granted a temporary restraining order against the actor.\n\nMeanwhile, Musk's wife, actress Talulah Riley, filed for divorce in late March. Riley had first filed to end the marriage in 2012 but the rocky pair remarried in 2013.\n\nA year later, it was Musk,45, who wanted out, filing for divorce on New Year's Eve 2014. The papers were dismissed six months later.\n\nAmber and Elon have been friends for several years, according to TMZ, but since her split with Johnny, \u201cthey\u2019ve been spending a lot of time together.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cJust last weekend, Amber and her sister were hanging out in Elon\u2019s hotel bungalow in Miami. She had a 1-on-1 dinner at his L.A. house 2 weeks ago. She recently went to Elon\u2019s L.A. area office to spend time with him. And he\u2019s paid several visits to her home,\u201d a source told the news site.\n\nAt this time, no one in Amber\u2019s circle is calling it \u201cdating,\u201d but their extra time together seems super suspicious.\n\nInterestingly, Elon is also going through a divorce. His ex filed in March after they got married for a second time. Elon is worth an estimated $12.7 billion.\n\nAs you\u2019ll recall, Amber filed for divorce and got a restraining order against the Edward Scissorhands actor earlier this year, when she accused him of physically abusing her on a number of occasions. He has denied these claims, and their divorce is still pending.",
