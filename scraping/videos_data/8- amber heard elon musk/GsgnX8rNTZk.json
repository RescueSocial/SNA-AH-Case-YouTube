            "description": "Some billionaire girlfriend rules are quite reasonable but of course, when it comes to the genius Elon Musk, you know what it is \u2013 extraordinary! Have you ever thought about how it gonna be to date a billionaire? Of course, it won't be the same as the rest of us. But what you need to know is that most billionaires don't have dating rules but most of them do have one thing! \n\n#ElonMusk, #Grimes, #GirlFriendRules\n\nYeah! And one of those who set rules for their girlfriends is the Billionaire Tech Mogul Elon Musk. I do refer Musk to a genius because his thinking is beyond ordinary. So I\u2019m not that surprised he lays down rules to follow for whoever he chooses to be his girlfriend.\n\nElon Musk is one of the world\u2019s best-known billionaires. He\u2019s gained fame as the founder and CEO of SpaceX, the CEO, and co-founder of Tesla Inc., and as the co-founder of PayPal, just to name a few of his entrepreneurial accomplishments. \nHe is estimated to be worth a cool 184 billion dollars and that currently makes him the wealthiest person on the planet. Needless to say, there are many ladies out there who\u2019d love the opportunity to be Musk\u2019s girlfriend. And given that the businessman has a reputation for jumping from one long-term relationship to the next, he seems to always be making headlines for his high profile love life. \nObviously, the Tesla CEO knows what he wants when it comes to a dating relationship. If you are familiar with Musk, you should notice that he never likes to stay lonely; he doesn\u2019t waste time over a broken relationship before diving into a new relationship with fellow stars and that has made him the talk of the tabloids.",
