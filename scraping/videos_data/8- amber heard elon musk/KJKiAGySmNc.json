We give you a closer look in the lives of celebrities like Kanye West, Ed Sheeran, The Rock, Jay Z, Selena Gomez, Kylie Jenner, Kim Kardashian, Rihanna and 100s more.\n\nWith the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. \n\nEver since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.\n\nNow it turns out that Elon Musk might have helped Amber Heard pay her donation to the ACLU. That was supposed to be paid with money from the $7 million Amber Heard received from Johnny Depp in divorce settlement.. Let's break it down in today's video.\n\n#AmberHeard #JohnnyDepp #JusticeForJohnnyDepp #AmberHeardJail\u200b #AmberHeardCourt\u200b #JusticeForJohnny\n\nWe tell you interesting things about these Hollywood celebrities that you may have never heard before.\nSubscribe - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAmaiEYnoTgj-dmjp8DpepQ?sub_confirmation=1\n''THE CHANNEL GOAL IS TO GET ALL THE YOU TUBE PLAY BUTTONS\".
