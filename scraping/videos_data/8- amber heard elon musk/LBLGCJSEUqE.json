            "description": "They enjoyed a cozy breakfast together in late November, three months after splitting up.And on Thursday, Amber Heard, 31, and\u00a0Elon Musk, 46, were spotted leaving a lunch date at HomeState restaurant in Los Feliz.The former lovebirds shared a steamy goodbye kiss before going their separate ways.Before exchanging a smooch outside the establishment, Amber and Elon hugged each other closely.Interestingly enough, they chose to dine at HomeState - a Texas inspired breakfast and lunch spot; Amber was born and raised in Austin, Texas.For their Thursday meal together, Amber kept it casual in a textured gray coat over a classic white T-shirt.Amber added delicate earrings with her blonde locks pulled up into a high bun.The star, who was previously married to Johnny Depp, wore a touch of pink lipstick with a touch of blush on her cheeks.Elon, the founder, CEO, and CTO of SpaceX, cut a casual figure in his black jacket with a matching T-shirt.An insider close to Elon told Dailymail.com: 'Amber invited Elon to her favorite Texas breakfast spot.They shared a quick kiss goodbye.They are not back together.' Amber went public with their romance back in April via Instagram.She shared a couples picture of them - she posed with one arm on his shoulder as he showed off a red kiss mark on his cheek - matching her lipstick.The couple however called it quits in August - ending their year long romance.Elon had confirmed the split from the actress on her Instagram post as a lengthy comment; the handsome businessman even hinted at a future reconciliation.The Tesla founder wrote: 'Btw, just to clear up some of the press storm this weekend, although Amber and I did break up, we are still friends, remain close and love one another.' Elon, who is worth a reported $12 billion, continued: 'Long distance relationship when both partners have intense work obligations are always difficult, but who knows what the future holds.' The picture he commented on featured Amber using a fork to comb her red hair - emulating The Little Mermaid; Elon also wrote: 'v cute' with a heart emoji.Amber was reportedly 'devastated' after their relationship ended over the summer.An insider told The Mail On Sunday: \u2018It\u2019s all over between Amber and Elon and she\u2019s devastated.It was his decision.Adding: \u2018He ended it a week ago.He\u2019d heard certain things about her behavior that didn\u2019t sit well with him.'Amber can be very manipulative and selfish.Elon\u2019s back in LA while she\u2019s licking her wounds in Australia.' She was working on the superhero film Aquaman in Australia at the time; she stars as the Queen of Atlantis alongside Jason Momoa.The billionaire and the actress were reportedly 'not getting back together' when they were last seen together in November, according to\u00a0People.Days before their meet up, Elon opened up about the heartache from his split to Rolling Stones magazine.The businessman told how he was left 'hurting badly' and torn apart by their split as he revealed she had broken up with him.'I just br",
