            "description": "Amber Heard and Elon Musk Vacationing in Chile Together, One Week After Kissing Photos\n A  week  after  dismissing  reports  that  they're  not  a couple,  Amber Heard  and  Elon Musk  were  spotted  dining  in  Chile  together  on  Friday  night.\nA  week  ago  the  former  couple  sparked  rumors  that  they  were  back  together  when  they  were  spotted  kissing  after  having  lunch  together  in  Los Angeles,  but  the  reconciliation  rumblings  were  quickly  shut down.\n Two  days  after  break-up  reports  surfaced,  Musk  eventually  addressed  split  rumors  on  social media  on  Aug.  8,  writing,  \"Btw,  just  to  clear  up  some  of  the press  storm  this  weekend,  although  Amber  and  I did  break up,  we  are  still  friends,  remain  close  and  love  one  another.\"\nHours  later,  Heard  posted  her  own  Instagram  confirming  the  split  and  elaborating  on  the  breakup:  \"Being  in  the public  eye  means  having  to  explain  yourself  to  so  many people,  so much  of  the  time.  In  this  case,  I'd  like  to  remain  more  quiet.  Although  we  have  broken up,  Elon  and  I  care  deeply  for  one  another  and  remain  close.  Thank you  for  the  continued  support,  respect,  and  privacy  during  these  difficult,  very  human  times.\"\n While  reports  linked  the  two  as  early  as  summer  of  2016  following  sightings  of  them  together  out  in  South Beach  and  partying  in  London,  the  couple  didn't  go  public  with  their  romance  until  April  2017.\nIn  the  weeks  that  followed,  they  were  spotted  strolling  during  a  day  date  at  a  wildlife  sanctuary  in  Australia,  having fun  with  Musk's  sons  at  the  Sydney Opera House  and  walking  arm  in  arm  after  a  fancy  night  out.",
