            "description": "Just a few days ago, the first day of filming for Aquaman 2, entitled Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, finally started, and obviously, many were not happy about it. For starters, Warner Brothers decided to push through on their initial decision to keep Amber Heard in the newest DC Extended Universe movie franchise, despite the lsuit and all the drama with Johnny Depp that she is currently involved in. Because of this, many fans are campaigning to stop production of the entire movie, as they believe that not only does Amber Heard deserve for her movie to flop, but the whole Warner Brothers production as well. But the problem here is there will be many other actors that will be affected once people go against it, and that includes major actors such as Nicole Kidman, Patrick Wilson, Willem Dafoe, Randall Park, and of course, Aquaman himself, Jason Momoa. For many Jason Momoa and Johnny Depp fans, this is a pretty tough decision to make. Johnny and Amber are in not just a rocky situation these days, they are facing a huge case before them, and supporting Amber Heard\u2019s movie is basically supporting her. So, many fans want to know, what does Jason Momoa have to say about working with Amber Heard? Is he also tired of her drama? Does he think she is a good or bad person? Or will he defend her against Johnny Depp? Well, I guess you\u2019ll need to stick around until the end of this video to find out. But before that, please make sure you subscribe first, and hit that notification bell for more updates. So, let\u2019s begin!\n\nThe year 2021 may not be big for the DC universe, as movie theaters are still just reopening and many restrictions are still ongoing. As you all remember, Wonder Woman 1984 had been a much awaited film before the illness, but somehow this subsided the excitement. However, Warner Brothers remained hopeful for their second installment of the Aquaman movie. Despite the challenges that are uncertain by the time of its release, they are still going to push through on this major project, and in fact, they have already started filming the movie. Good decision, people might say. But there\u2019s one big catch in the movie that many fans did not love, and it\u2019s that Warner Brothers should really care more about one certain cast member. Just by the facts mentioned, you\u2019d already conclude that Amber is not cool at all. Despite all these occurrences, Warner Brothers still kept her and even gave her the role of Queen Mera, while the same production company let go of Johnny Depp from his supposed upcoming film Fantastic Beasts 3 that is also set to be released in 2022. Obviously, many fans are not happy. The first installment of Aquaman was no doubt a huge success, both commercially and cinematically. The movie, directed by James Wan, was a depiction of an entirely new world, and it was surreal how they put all of them together in a manner that would not bore anyone. Indeed, it was worth watching again and again. And the 2018 movie\u2019s success really reflected on its box office earnings, reaching 1.184 billion dollars, with a production budget of 160 to 200 million dollars. Because of the first film\u2019s success, fans became very excited for the second installment right away, but after the movie\u2019s success, case after case brought Amber Heard to the spotlight again, but this time in a very negative way. Now, obviously, people would automatically think that Warner Brothers would relieve Amber Heard from her role as Queen Mera. \n\nBut amidst all this craziness in the entertainment industry, fans have been wondering, what is Amber Heard like as a co-star? During the Johnny and Amber battle, many celebrities have already pointed out that Amber isn\u2019t exactly a truth-teller. A lot of film colleagues have stood by Johnny Depp through all these, defending him from Amber. But how about the insights of those who work with Amber? One of these celebrities is Jason Momoa, and he has got a lot to say.\n\nWell, much to fan\u2019s dismay, Jason Momoa reportedly has no problems with Amber Heard at all. Despite Warner Brother\u2019s rogue decision to keep Amber Heard, which might actually cause their new movie to flop, at least Warner Brothers is somehow trying to reduce Amber Heard\u2019s exposure. So let\u2019s talk about Jason Momoa. Jason will be back as Arthur Curry in the upcoming Aquaman 2 movie.\n\n But in the end, it\u2019s Warner Brothers\u2019 call, and after all, we just hope it won\u2019t affect the other actors that much. That\u2019s all for today, hope you enjoyed our video and we\u2019ll see you next time.
