            "description": "Hey guys, so some people have asked me to do a part 2 to my previous chatty video, this is as close as it will get to one unfortunately as I don't think I need to say anymore on the actual Johnny Depp/Amber Heard divorce case, I have done this one because people have asked questions about my fathers situation and I felt I needed to go into more detail as a lot of people still don't understand domestic violence, let alone, domestic violence against men. \n\nI have used Johnny Depp as an example of seeing signs only in this video, there were never any allegations made against Amber Heard from him or his team, but the signs I saw in him are of emotional abuse. \n\nThere have been statements to say that she was aggressive towards him on multiple occasions, you can find them by looking for them on Google.\n\nEmma Roberts abused Evan Peters, link - http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2366343/Emma-Roberts-arrested-domestic-violence-boyfriend-Evan-Peters-leaving-actor-bloody-nose-bite-mark.html\n\nSorry for the depressing video, but Domestic Violence is a taboo topic not discussed enough, especially when it is against men.\n\nOver 40% of DV victims are male, most shelters are female orientated and men do not get the same help as women do. \n\nIf you're approached by a male victim, or if there is something that you CAN do to help someone, please do help them, take them just as seriously as you would a woman, because abuse is not confined to just one gender.\n\nAnd please, be respectful when commenting, whether you agree with what I say or not, I am still a human, and I still have someone in this awful situation. Hurtful, disgusting comments will be reported and removed. \n\nThank you so much to everyone for your support on the last video, I can't believe how ultimately positive the response was.\n\nIf anybody is in this situation and you need to talk, i'm on twitter and instagram: \n\nT: @burnttautumn\nI: @autumonvenus\n\nI hope you all had a lovely Christmas. \n\nxoxo",
