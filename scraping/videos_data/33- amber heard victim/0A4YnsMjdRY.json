            "description": "Brittany Murphy and Julia Davis were victims of organized crime to stop whistleblowing about border control... If you see someone getting targeted, say and do something publicly to support them to prevent ONE more Brittany Murphy.\n\nBrittany Murphy died because she wrote/spoke up for & testified for Julia Davis. They tapped her and her husband's phones, surveilled her, caused them so much distress that she was prevented from working on Happy Feet.\n\nBrittany Murphy and Department of Homeland Security Whistleblower Julia Davis were targeted victims. Davis was a stuntwoman on the movie set. Murphy lost her voice acting role for Happy Feet 2 when rumors spread that she was \"paranoid\" about helicopters, people following, monitoring, and wire tapping. This is purposeful victimization.\n\nBrittany Murphy was killed with monitoring, simulated distress, then stimuli with trace toxins. They didn't screen right until her father did a private test. She died after showering from cardiac arrest in just her 30s. Her husband died shortly after.\n\nThe solution for victims is writing, interfering, reporting credibly, and seeing the patterns of targeting. The other side creates networks to isolate the victim.\n\n- Victims Discredited, Organized Crime, and Border Control -\n\nJulia Davis states nefarious entities want people to file reports to the police that people are following them in order to force evaluations. This discredits and victimizes them. There is absolutely no entity to report safely to when targeted, and all media will ignore them.\n\nBrittany Murphy was found to have 10 metals at high levels in her body by an independent, non-governmental connected lab from Colorado. Her husband died of the same sudden effects 5 months later.\n\nCircumstantial evidence points to Brittany Murphy and Simon Monjack being killed for being witnesses. Other whistleblowers have had relatives harmed, such as Kevin Ship.\n\nKevin Ship, a CIA Whistleblower, mentions, as does Julia Davis, that evaluations are done to discredit whistleblowers and people who are not being rescued. If not secrecy and persecution, then..\n\nThey were young. Brittany was 32 years old on December 20, 2009 when she died, and her husband Simon Monjack was 40 years old when he died May 23, 2010. How could young people have such weak immune systems to pass away from supposedly \"pneumonia,\" and within 5 months of each other?\n\nLabeling & coercion removes all survival instinct and ability to defend oneself against any harassment.\n\nBrittany Murphy was not in a hospital before her sudden attack, and the scene of her quick interview at the end shows she was not \"ill\" enough to be in bed.\nHer cardiac arrest was sudden, as was her death, and who would want to go to hospitals to see force?\n\nVictimization by deception to discredit is real. Anyone targeted is not believed, and re-victimized. More force and coercion makes a person worse and nothing can be changed. Anyone who is a victim of a stalking crime, organized crime, or a toxin crime can be psych victimized.\n\nBeliefs make people use force, which only reinforces victimization and perpetrators. It also removes people from work, due to their belief that people experiencing any hardship cannot handle a work or school schedule.\n\nIf you hear of a person victimized, try to stop the harassment, have them focus on goals, and expose the perpetrators.\n\nLet the truth be known that Brittany Murphy and Julia Davis were targeted people. \n\nNext time, do something:\n\nEDIT:\nAfter years of Research and seeing that the connections of distress, stimuli, toxicology, tech IoT electric, thermodynamics, AI, isn't understood by Frontlines, & that there's no Department of Rescue, that this is Organized Crime with Bad Private Investigators/agents likely\n(e.g., Ransom-Ware Claudestine Investigation Agency - law firms hire bad spies). \n*To be continued (always?)* \nOrganized Crime is obsessed over border crossings, & often don't report to IRS.\n\n2 - AH Case\n\"You should look at what Adam Waldman and the AI Bots do against Amber Heard - then how Rose McGowan tried to go onto AnonymousWorldwide recently, but never posted the audio, then had agents which stopped reporting by Journalists.... \nThey always try to set up people with homeland, then that makes people have issues helping, so instead, they get help from the UK, which always has to clean up the messes.\n\nBrittany Murphy's and Julia Davis's story (made a 2017 video on it) inspires me to interfere to prevent such another death from monitoring and set ups.... an ex staff partner 2 years ago sent a tweet saying they wanted to make lies about Amber's trips to the border (for Amnesty International/charity) and PIs...\nThat made me alert and add to the chat/create one.\nAmber had to hire Jennifer Robinson, Julian Assange's lawyer...\"\n\n#BrittanyMurphy #JuliaDavis #Whistleblowers #HumanRights #Truth #Gangstalking #TargetedIndividuals #Assange\n#crime #victims #Whistleblower #celebrity #disinfo #rebel #selfdefense #defendrights",
