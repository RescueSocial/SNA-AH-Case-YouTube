After a whirlwind romance with her boyfriend, she\u2019s on cloud nine after he made it official, proposing to her in front of all her family and friends. Cautious, but optimistic, Cynthia wonders if she can mend her roller-coaster relationship with friend turned foe Nene Leakes. Still elated from the wedding of her dreams, Eva Marcille is expecting baby number three, while juggling the ups and downs of her friendships, the challenges of pregnancy, and trying to find her dream home before the arrival of her baby. Always in high demand, Kandi Burruss\u2019 life shows no signs of slowing down as she expands her empire while expanding her family with the help of a surrogate. Her husband optimistically seeks to open more businesses, but with so many balls in the air, Kandi worries they won\u2019t have time to get everything done before the arrival of their newest family member. Always moving forward, Nene Leakes has reconnected with her husband, who is now cancer-free, but tensions rise when she is reunited with former friends to hash out past grievances. Porsha Williams is over the moon about her baby girl Pilar Jhena and couldn\u2019t be more excited to be a mother. Dealing with the aftermath of salacious rumors surrounding her fianc\u00e9's infidelity, she is faced with the cold truth that her happily-ever-after may be on hold until she can figure out where her relationship stands. Back and bolder than ever...Kenya Moore has finally gotten what she\u2019s always wanted with her husband and baby Brooklyn, but a fairy-tale ending isn\u2019t always what it seems, and despite her best efforts, her roller coaster relationship may be coming to an end. Although motherhood has been kind to her and she enjoys embracing her softer side, she will never walk away from a challenge or shy away from speaking her mind.   \n\n\nCAST: \nCynthia Bailey\nEva Marcille\nKandi Burruss\nNene Leakes\nPorsha Williams\nKenya Moore\n\nGET MORE BRAVO:\nFollow Bravo: http://bravo.ly/Twitter\nLike Bravo: http://bravo.ly/Facebook\nFollow Bravo on Pinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/BravoTV\nBravo Instagram: http://bravo.ly/Instagram\nBravo Tumblr: http://bravo.ly/Tumblr\n\nBravo Media is the premiere lifestyle and entertainment brand that drives the cultural conversation around its high-quality, interactive original content that focuses on the network\u2019s passion points of food, fashion, beauty, design, digital and pop culture.
