            "description": "The neighbouring kingdoms of Pei and Jing have an uneasy accord, with peace maintained by Pei\u2019s King, a self-absorbed chap who is amenable to Jing in all things. But when Pei\u2019s Great Commander goes rogue and tries to start a war, even Pei\u2019s King cannot stop what is unleashed in the hearts of both his soldiers and his spirited sister. It\u2019s a battle that has been brewing for decades, and now the time has come. But who exactly is this trouble-stirring Great Commander? The answer is found in a lost chapter of Chinese history. Under constant threat of assassination many nobles secretly employed surrogate men, known as \u2018shadows\u2019, who served their masters through impersonation, risking their lives and proving their loyalty by embracing death. For his latest Wuxia spectacular, Zhang Yimou collaborates with House of Flying Daggers cinematographer Zhao Xiaoding to create a mind-blowing visual design that revolutionises the colour palette, using water, calligraphy and constant reference to the yin yang symbol. Court intrigue, assassinations and shady motivations abound, and audiences can expect jaw-dropping combat, including the introduction of a new series of \u2018feminine\u2019 moves, and an umbrella-weapon that will be the envy of every Londoner.\n\nSubscribe: http://bit.ly/subscribetotheBFI\n\nWatch more on BFI Player: http://player.bfi.org.uk/\nLike us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BritishFilmInstitute\nFollow us on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/britishfilminstitute/\nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/BFI and join the conversation: #LFF",
