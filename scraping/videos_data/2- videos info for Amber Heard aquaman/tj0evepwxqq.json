Distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, it is the sixth film in the DC Extended Universe (DCEU). The film was directed by James Wan, from a screenplay by David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick and Will Beall. It stars Jason Momoa as Aquaman, who sets out to lead the underwater kingdom of Atlantis and stop his half-brother, King Orm, from uniting the seven underwater kingdoms to destroy the surface world. Amber Heard, Willem Dafoe, Patrick Wilson, Dolph Lundgren, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Ludi Lin, Temuera Morrison and Nicole Kidman appear in supporting roles.\n\nDevelopment began in 2004 but did not gain traction until Man of Steel was released in 2013. In August 2014, Beall and Kurt Johnstad were hired to write competing scripts. Wan signed on as director in April 2015, and in July 2016, the film moved forward with Beall's screenplay. The main cast was confirmed through 2016 and early 2017. Principal photography began in Australia in May 2017, taking place at Village Roadshow Studios on the Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia, with additional production teams in Canada, Italy and Morocco. Filming concluded the following October. Several vendors provided visual effects, ranging from high-detail hair simulations to the creation of CGI animals and locations.\n\nAquaman premiered in London on November 26, 2018, and was released in the United States on December 21. It grossed about $1.148 billion worldwide, making it the highest-grossing DCEU film, the highest-grossing film based on a DC Comics character, the fifth-highest-grossing film of 2018 and 20th-highest-grossing film of all time. The film received praise for its visual effects, production design, tone, action scenes, Wan's direction and Momoa's performance, but its plot and runtime were criticized. A sequel, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, is set to be released on December 16, 2022.\n\n-~-~~-~~~-~~-~-\nPlease watch: \"Death bed coffee for your head live show singing | powfu | HD song | with sub \" \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhHh7qwozjY\n-~-~~-~~~-~~-~-",
