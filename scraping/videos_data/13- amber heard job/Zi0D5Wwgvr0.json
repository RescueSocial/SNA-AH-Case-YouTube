            "description": "In celebration of Wonder Woman's release today, I decided to post a trailer of one of my favorite Spider-Man villains, Black Cat.\n\nNote: In this (Fan) trailer, Amber Heard is meant to be Silver Sable and I know Amber Heard is Mera, I originally wanted to use Sarah Gadon as Silver Sable but I strongly dislike to have a lot of masking in my videos and there were clips from an Amber Heard movie where she plays a spy with white hair so I decided to use that. \n\nWhen Felicity Jones and Sarah Gadon were cast in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 back in 2013, I was thrilled because I thought we were going to get introduced to Black Cat and Silver Sable, I didn't expect them to be the villains in the film but I thought they would have at least a major supporting role leading to their character's identity in the future but it obviously didn't happen since a majority of Jones' scenes were cut and Gadon had a very small role as OsCorp's computer. This is sort of how I picture a Black Cat film with Silver Sable, it's sort of a mixture of The Dark Knight Rises, Italian Job, and Thelma and Louise. I'm really intrigued by the idea that Black Cat works for Harry Osborn while he's in prison to enter OsCorp and steal the plans for Vulture project from the man who framed Osborn, Menken. Silver Sable works with Black Cat in the process while Spider-Man tries to find out more about them and stop them from stealing from others like banks, jewelry stores, etc. This takes place in The Amazing Spider-Man universe because it's been confirmed that Holland's Spider-Man won't be involved or even in the same universe as the Sony Spider-Man villains movies so I'm hoping it'll take place in Garfield's universe so that we can get the answers we were looking for since TASM 2. I'll also make a Venom project starring Tom Hardy soon. Sorry guys that it's taken me a while to post a video but I recently quit editing on my old editing software and I've been testing on all these new editing softwares and it took me a while to get used to them however, I am set with Pinnacle (still will use Premiere for coloring but not for editing) so I'll start having more and more videos come out very soon. \nI do NOT own anything and this is for entertainment purposes NOT profit.\nI used clips from\nCatwoman (2004)- Warner Bros\nSpider-Man 3 (2007)- Sony/Colombia Pictures\nWatchmen (2009)- Warner Bros\nLike Crazy (2011)- Paramount Vintage\nPage Eight (2011)- BBC \nThe Amazing Spider-Man (2012)- Sony/Colombia Pictures\nThe Dark Knight Rises (2012)- Warner Bros\nArrow (2012- )- Warner Bros/The CW\nBreathe In (2013)- Indian Paintbrush \nKill Your Darlings (2013)- Sony\nThe Great Gatsby (2013)- Warner Bros\n3 Days to Kill (2014)- Relativity Media\nThe Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014)- Sony/Colombia Pictures\nGone Girl (2014)- FOX\nDaredevil (2015- )- Netflix/Marvel Studios\nBatman: Arkham Knight (2015)- Warner Bros Games\nThe Man From U.N.C.L.E.
