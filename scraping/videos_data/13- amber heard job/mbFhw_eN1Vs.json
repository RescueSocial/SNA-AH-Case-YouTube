Amber Heard is a mom, welcoming her first child, a baby girl, via surrogate on April 8, Us Weekly confirms.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so excited to share this news with you. Four years ago, I decided I wanted to have a child. I wanted to do it on my own terms,\u201d Heard, 35, wrote via Instagram on Thursday, July 1. \u201cI now appreciate how radical it is for us as women to think about one of the most fundamental parts of our destinies in this way. I hope we arrive at a point in which it\u2019s normalized to not want a ring in order to have a crib. A part of me wants to uphold that my private life is none of anyone\u2019s business. I also get that the nature of my job compels me to take control of this. My daughter was born on April 8, 2021. Her name is Oonagh Paige Heard. She\u2019s the beginning of the rest of my life.\u201d\n\nThe actress was previously married to Johnny Depp from February 2015 to May 2016, and Heard considered her stepparenting role to the actor\u2019s daughter, Lily-Rose, 22, and son, Jack, 19, the \u201cgreatest gift.\u201d\n\nCheck out more Exclusive Interviews:\nhttps://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVmogfA5HIGmisWAX9ADHiobv4XmnC_zA\n\nGretchen Rossi Says \u2018RHOC\u2019 Audience Saw Tamra Judge\u2019s \u2018True Colors\u2019 After Shannon Beador Falling Out:\nhttps://youtu.be/iJ-1rvUePtU\n\nMama June Talks Instagram Hate, Toddler Beauty Pageant Advice and More Parenting Do\u2019s and Don\u2019ts: \nhttps://youtu.be/CSzhrkJjthc\n\nPaige DeSorbo on How Ex-Perry Feels About Their Relationship Woes on \u2018Summer House\u2019:\nhttps://youtu.be/SWSKmZXY51Q\n\nGarcelle says Erika Jane \u2018Showed Up\u2019 During Season 11 of \u2018RHOBH\u2019 She Was \u2018Honest\u2019:\nhttps://youtu.be/BMP_g9U5BIA\n\nZac Clark on Watching His Season Back, Crying on Camera and More Bachelor Regrets:\nhttps://youtu.be/4bOI7hYF-Sg\n\nSubscribe for more UsWeekly videos: https://bit.ly/33yer6O\n\nhttps://www.usmagazine.com/\nFollow Us Weekly on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly\nFollow Us Weekly on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/usweekly/\nFollow Us Weekly on Twitter: https://twitter.com/usweekly\n\nMost Popular Videos: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVmogfA5HIGn1cg4NuiR9F09GY9oILg8c\n\nBlac Chyna Reveals Which Kardashian Kid is Dream's Favorite Cousin: \nhttps://youtu.be/c98dR_NY9TA\nJill and Derick Dillard Talk Leaving Reality TV, Going to Therapy and New YouTube Channel\nhttps://youtu.be/bhytardubGM\nSister Wives' Christine Brown on Marriage to Kody, Jealous and More\nhttps://youtu.be/RnT2E2pe2O4\nSister Wives' Meri Brown on Relationship to Kody, Future of Their Marriage https://youtu.be/DZ2nSzLfVpw\nChase Chrisley Says He Will 'Definitely' Marry Girlfriend Emmy Medders\nhttps://youtu.be/Wgz0upcgC1U\n\n#AmberHeard #AmberHeardMom #AmberHeardMom #Mom #UsWeekly #News #Exclusive",
