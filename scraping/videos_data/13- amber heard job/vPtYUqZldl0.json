Possible cosmetic procedures such as a nose job, Botox brow-lifts, dermal fillers and a renowned skincare routine. (her favorite skincare products are linked down below)#MargotRobbie #Skincare #Plasticsurgery\n\nAbout Margot Robbie\nMargot has had a globally successful career in acting. Her acting career started when she was young and had graduated from Somerset College. Soon after graduation, she took some small roles, until she landed a regular part on the Australian soap opera show \u201cNeighbors\u201d. Soon after leaving the show, she moved to the USA and starred in a Rom-Com called \u201cAbout time\u201d, giving her enough recognition to get her breakout roles in the Worldwide success, Wolf Of wall street ( which grossed 392 million dollars worldwide), where she played the wife of the ruthless Stock trader, Jordan Belfort, played by Leonardo DiCaprio. Her next largest role was in the Super-villain movie \u201c S Squad\u201d (which took the box office by storm with 746.8 million dollars in revenue), playing Harley Quinn, a character that is now a fan favorite. She has starred in many works, but those are the most commonly known. Over her acting career, she has won many awards, and has been one of the highest paid actresses in recent times with a reported annual income of around $23.5 million.\n\nHer acting success led to her starting a business alongside her husband Tom Ackerley.

She also did some work for some Nissan car commercials. For now she is rumored to soon be starring in a live action Barbie movie, and an upcoming Pirates of the Caribbean reboot.\n\nAs far as her beauty goes, is it makeup, dieting, Genetics, or cosmetic procedures that keeps her looking young & radiant? \nMargot often tells people to make sure to add powerful sunscreen into their skincare routine to keep their skin looking flawless.
