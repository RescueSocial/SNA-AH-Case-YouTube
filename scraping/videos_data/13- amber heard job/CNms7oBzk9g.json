            "title": "Blake Lively TO REPLACE Amber Heard in Aquaman 2?!",
            "description": "Following the ruckus brought about by their previous marriage, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard\u2019s careers were expected to crumble, and their reputations in the blockbuster industry would not be a shock to collapse. Aside from the defamation lawsuit they are facing today, there are many other factors that should be credited for their failed romance story to spiral back to the top. For starters, as Johnny Depp lost his libel case filed against news publisher The Sun, he also lost his chance to reprise the role of Grindelwald in the upcoming third franchise of the series Fantastic Beasts. But despite Johnny leaving, or being forced rather, to vacate his role, Amber Heard was set to continue on to reprise her role as Queen Mera in the upcoming second franchise of the DC Extended Universe movie Aquaman 2, entitled Aquaman and The Lost Kingdom. Both movies are set to premiere in 2022, and both movies are going to be under Warner Brothers. When Johnny was fired from the Fantastic Beasts film, many fans protested. It was announced that unlike what most fans expected, Amber Heard would be reprising her role as the Atlantean Queen Mera after all, and obviously, this angered a lot of fans, which led to a petition for Warner Bros. to recast Mera\u2019s role. Unfortunately for them, despite garnering over 1.6 million signatures for the petition, Warner Bros. still pushed through with Amber Heard reprising her role. Because of this, even though Aquaman 2: The Lost Kingdom had started filming months ago, also signaling that their cast ensemble is final and no protestor can change that, fans, who let\u2019s be honest are the ones who have the majority say on this movie, are still turning their backs against the movie as long as Amber stars in it. And along with it, a lot of supporters of Johnny\u2019s side are also searching nonstop for the next Queen Mera who can replace Amber Heard even at the last minute, hoping that Warner Bros. will eventually change their minds. There were plenty of names surfacing on social media about female celebs who would be perfect for the role, including Emilia Clarke and Sophie Turner who have both been in action and even in the same HBO series Game of Thrones. But another vibrant name lately belongs to one of the classiest, most elegant faces of the century\u2026 Blake Lively. And what makes her the perfect Queen Mera? What if she replaces Amber Heard from the role? Well, here\u2019s what our imagination tells us, but before everything else, make sure first to hit that subscribe button and smash that notification bell for more updates. Now, let\u2019s begin!\n\nAlthough it is pretty obvious that Amber Heard should be fired from the Aquaman 2 sequel, the DC Extended Universe\u2019s film production company that was supposed to make this decision. Now, they are getting huge media backlash,  against one of their lead actresses, Amber Heard. Aquaman\u2019s second installment also stars Jason Momoa and other huge stars.\n\nBut what is keeping Warner Bros. head over heels for this actress who is currently dealing with a huge lawsuit in front of her, and a number of pieces of evidence against her. So, in the middle of this all, fans can\u2019t help but make their own bets on who would be the suitable replacement for her role as Queen Mera.\n\nBriefly in 2017\u2019s Justice League, Heard briefly debuted as Mera. Atlantean warrior and princess, she returns in 2018\u2019s Aquaman to help Arthur Curry, played by Jason Momoa. But the characters share a much richer relationship in the comics. As the credits roll, the first Aquaman movie teases a romantic future for Arthur and Mera. In all likelihood, the DCEU will continue this scenario, leading to a much more important role for Mera. So it is apparent that the next Aquaman film and the succeeding ones will need Mera to play a critical role. Since the first film, Heard has become a problem.\n\nIn the artwork, Lively can be seen wearing Amber Heard\u2019s Mera costume from the first Aquaman movie. The concept design does a fantastic job of showing just how easily Blake Lively could slip into the role of Mera. In fact, we wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she was originally in the running to play the Aquaman character before Amber Heard landed the role. Currently, there\u2019s no news to indicate that Lively will be taking on the role of Mera but should Warner Bros. and DC need a replacement, they know who to call.\nAquaman 2 will undoubtedly hope.\n\nThat\u2019s all for today, we hope you enjoyed that video, and if you did, don\u2019t forget to like, subscribe, and hit that notification bell for more videos like this.
