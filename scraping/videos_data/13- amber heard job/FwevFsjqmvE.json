            "description": "Amber Heard is a new mom. The 35-year-old actress took to Twitter and Instagram on Thursday, revealing that she welcomed her first child, a baby girl named Oonagh Paige Heard, with the help of a surrogate on April 8, 2021.\u201cI\u2019m so excited to share this news with you,\u201d Heard wrote alongside a photo of her holding her newborn. \u201cFour years ago, I decided I wanted to have a child. I wanted to do it on my own terms. I now appreciate how radical it is for us as women to think about one of the most fundamental parts of our destinies in this way. I hope we arrive at a point in which it\u2019s normalized to not want a ring in order to have a crib.\u201dHeard continued, acknowledging that she remains hesitant to share her personal life. \u201cA part of me wants to uphold that my private life is none of anyone\u2019s business,\u201d she noted. \u201cI also get that the nature of my job compels me to take control of this.\u201dAfter revealing her daughter\u2019s name \u2014 which may be a nod to Heard\u2019s late mother Paige, who passed away in May 2020 \u2014 the Aquaman star ended on a heartwarming note. \u201cShe\u2019s the beginning of the rest of my life,\u201d she added. Heard was previously married to Johnny Depp from February 2015 to May 2016. The two have since divorced and were subsequently embroiled in a legal battle that continues to this day.\n\n\nAll data is taken from the source: http://hollywoodreporter.com\nArticle Link: https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lifestyle/lifestyle-news/amber-heard-first-child-surrogate-1234976874/\n\n\n#AmberHeard #newsradio #newstodayworld #newsworldwide #newstodayfox #bbcnewsworld #",
