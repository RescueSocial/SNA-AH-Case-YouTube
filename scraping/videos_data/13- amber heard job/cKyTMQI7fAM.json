Disney had a change of heart and rehired the actor to continue to play his role as Jack Sparrow in the Pirates of the Caribbean 6. Not just this, it is well believed that Disney has expressed their total support for Johnny Depp and his legal team, as regards his legal battle with Amber Heard. \n\nNumber 5: The Discoveries\nHowever, Disney has had a change of heart to rehire Johnny Depp due to the discoveries of Amber Heard\u2019s deceit and lies by the effort of Johnny Depp and his legal team. Given this, Disney has decided not to release any form of sensitive information on Johnny Depp\u2019s time filming Pirates of the Caribbean 5 shot in 2017. \n\nNumber 4: Evidence \nAnother piece of evidence released against Amber Heard is the bodycam footage by the policemen from the Los Angeles Police Department who visited Johnny Depp and Amber Heard\u2019s house on the day of the incident. Four policemen visited the house in twos due to the double 911 call mistakenly made by Amber\u2019s friends. Amber called her friends saying that Depp was making threats at her and scattering glasses all around aiming to injure her. Unlike these reports, the policemen who visited the penthouse reported that the house had no sign of any form of disturbance whatsoever. \n\nNumber 3: Ambition\nWith all these, it is just very obvious that Amber Heard is stopping at nothing to bring Johnny Depp down to his knees. In pursuit of these, she had lied and tried a lot of tricks just to achieve this goal. She has been successful in some parts as Johnny Depp has been having difficult times getting jobs and roles since all the lawsuits, rumors, and scandals started. The popular one is Disney firing him from his role as Jack Sparrow in the Pirates of the Caribbean movie series. As of now, it is difficult to think about the Pirates of the Caribbean movie without thinking about Johnny Depp and the role he played in the movie. Ever since the first movie was released in 2003, he has taken on the role of Jack Sparrow and has done an incredible job.\n\nNumber 2: Speculations\nAfter losing the case to Amber Heard at first, Disney decided to put Johnny Depp aside without any plans on bringing him back. But this was proven wrong by the YouTube channel known as Viral Vision. They claimed that Disney wanted Johnny Depp back and also that they had already rehired him. The YouTube channel stated that according to their sources Johnny Depp had been rehired by Disney for a reboot version of Pirates of the Caribbean. But you watch that video, the person speaking did not mention anything about the sources the video was gotten from. They also said that Johnny Depp was being defended in court by Disney. But as the video went on, it was made clear that Disney had collaborated with external parties to facilitate Johnny Depp's return. But the truth of the matter is that Johnny Depp had not returned to Disney at that time and there were no signs of him returning. \n\nNumber 1: Rejection\nRegarding the subpoena from Amber Heard's legal team, Disney stated that they had not received anything from Amber Heard's team. Maybe Disney threw the subpoena away because of their lack of interest in involvement with Johnny Depp and Amber Heard's case. A lot of people lost interest in the Pirates of the Caribbean movie when Disney stated that they were no longer going to use Johnny Depp again. A lot of others also stated that they were not interested in seeing the next Pirates of the Caribbean movie if Johnny Depp did not play Jack Sparrow. People also started signing petitions to bring Johnny Depp back but Disney was not interested in having him at that time although the petition was signed by more than 400 thousand people. \n\nViral Film Talk is the #1 celebrity channel dedicated to bringing fans the latest celebrity news, best tv shows, movies, entertainment, and exclusive video commentaries & more.
