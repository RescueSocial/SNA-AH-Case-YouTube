It appears that the court has finally favored Depp after years of trials and court hearings, but why the change? What role does Amber Heard\u2019s divorce settlement have to play in all of this? \n\nAs for our question of the day: What is your favorite movie starring Johnny Depp? Mine was the \u201cFantastic Beasts\u201d movie series. Leave yours down in the comments below!\n\nIt seems like the ongoing legal dispute of the now-divorced couple, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard, has hit a breakthrough. Depp and his legal team have finally gotten the chance to see their continued efforts to fruition and whether or not Heard\u2019s 7-million-dollar divorce settlement was genuinely donated to charity. Before we get into the legal details, let\u2019s look into the past and see the complete timeline of their tumultuous relationship.\n\nIn 2009, Depp met Heard on \u201cThe Rum Diary\u201d set based on Hunter S. Thompson's book of the same name. Depp played Paul Kemp, a journalist who takes a job in Puerto Rico. While Heard played Chenault, a woman engaged to another man, whom Kemp is immediately smitten with as soon as he lays eyes on her. While we might think that the former couple would have fallen in love at first, it was the complete opposite.\n\nIn 2011, Heard told Vogue: \"Working with Johnny was torture. It was better than I ever imagined, which is really saying something.\" But oddly enough, in one of the court files, Heard wrote that she and Depp began dating \"around the end of 2011 or the start of 2012.\" But it was also in 2012 that Depp and long-time partner Paradis publicly announced their separation after 14 years of dating. But even after the breakup, Depp had two children with Paradis: Lily-Rose, now 21, and John Christopher, 18. In 2012, Heard reportedly also split up with partner Tasya van Ree simultaneously, okay, so maybe they fell in love after all. \n\nIn 2014, fans couldn\u2019t help but speculate engagement rumors when Heard was spotted wearing a beautiful ornate engagement ring. Well, Depp wasn\u2019t much for the mysterious surprises because he seemed to indirectly confirm the engagement in a video interview with The Daily Mail after discussing wedding planning and pointing out that he was wearing \"a chick's ring\" on his finger. \"It's probably a dead giveaway, isn't it? Not very subtle,\" Depp said. And after many years of dating, Depp and Heard finally tied the knot in a private ceremony in their LA home in 2015. \n\nBut not even three years into the marriage, divorce seems to be in the air. On May 23, 2016, Heard filed for a divorce and obtained a temporary restraining order against the Oscar-nominated actor. She accused Depp of physically abusing her during their relationship and said it was usually while under the influence of drugs and alcohol. This very much doesn\u2019t sound like the Johnny Depp we know and love. When filing the divorce, Heard even added that an incident occurred in which Depp threw his phone at her, leaving her with a bruised face. However, Depp has since denied these allegations and, through his representatives, said Heard was \"attempting to secure a premature financial resolution by alleging abuse.\"",
