            "description": "#Aquaman2 #Aquaman2Trailer #RESTORESNYDERVERSE\n\nNot only is Aquaman 2 getting ready to start filming Jason Momoa's glistening armor, but we finally have a title (details below). While plot details are scarcer than full bottles of booze around Arthur Curry, we have scrounged up a fair bit of details about the upcoming DCEU film.\n\nOf course, the film picks up where the first Aquaman movie left off, when Curry finally embraced\u00a0his role as the King of Atlantis. Aquaman already has a target on his back, put there by David Kane (aka Black Manta), who was rescued at the end of the first movie. Kane's headed to Atlantis and bringing marine scientist Steven Shin (played by Randall Park) with him.\n\nThe 63\u00a0best Netflix shows\u00a0to watch nextThe\u00a0best streaming devices, rankedHow to watch the\u00a0DC movies in order\n\nAquaman 2 cast\n\nThe main and confirmed cast for Aquaman 2 still seems a bit short, but most of the key players are returning. That starts with Momoa as Arthur Curry/Aquaman, and Amber Heard as Mera.\u00a0\n\nPatrick Wilson is reprising his role as King Orm, and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II is back in the Black Manta gear, but we'll explain more about them in the Villains section below.\n\nMost recently, Momoa's fellow Game of Thrones alumnus Pilou Asbaek (who was Euron Greyjoy in the HBO series) was reportedly added to Aquaman 2. His role has not been announced as of yet.\u00a0\n\nThe current cast is as follows:\nJason Momoa as Arthur Curry / AquamanAmber Heard as MeraPatrick Wilson as King Orm / Ocean MasterTemuera Morrison as Tom CurryYahya Abdul-Mateen II as David Kane / Black MantaPilou Asbaek in a TBA role\n\nPossible, but still unconfirmed, returns include Nicole Kidman as Atlanna and Willem Dafoe as Nuidis Vulko.\n\nAquaman 2 title\n\nAquaman and The Lost Kingdom\u00a0is the full title of Aquaman 2, as announced by director James Wan on Instagram. The Lost Kingdom is one of the seven kingdoms of Atlantis, and so may be Arthur Curry/Aquaman's job to find this land and restore it to a functioning part of the empire.\n\nAquaman 2 release date\n\nWhile we've been in a veritable sea of delays,\u00a0Aquaman 2 is currently scheduled for release in December 16, 2022. This date seems pretty far-out and sturdy.\n\nThat would fit with the details we got from Dolph Lundgren (King Nereus), who told a\u00a0Wizard World panel\u00a0that production is set to begin in Summer 2021.\n\nWe haven't seen any Aquaman 2 delays because of its original release date being so far into the future. That was made so because of DC's crowded release schedule.\n\ndown below, link release :\n\nhttps://m.imdb.com/title/tt9663764/releaseinfo?ref_=tt_dt_rdat\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100033620567501\nhttps://www.instagram.com/saputrafattah4?r=nametag\n\n\nFan Made, New, Trailer, aquaman 2, amber heard, jason momoa",
