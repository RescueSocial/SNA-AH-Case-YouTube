            "description": "Celebrities That Warned Us About James Franco\n\nJames Franco Is in big trouble and some celebrities are talking about their weird experiences with him. If you didn\u2019t know, James Franco has been exposed by numerous females saying that he has an alleged predatory vibe. Ouch.. That\u2019s not something you want said about you. Especially if it can ruin your career. Despite having tons of A list movies in his portfolio, the past few years have not been that good to James Franco as it seems like every year there are more details about his weird vibes. In 2014 a scottish teenager who was 17 came out and said that the actor said some pretty raunchy things to her despite her age. Since then, he has been involved in at least three different accusations from females. James Franco recently agreed to a 2 million dollar settlement in court which will be shared between the named accusers. Although Hollywood may never take James Franco back, some celebrities have said they don't want to ever work with him again. So let's get into how celebrities warned us about James Franco.",
