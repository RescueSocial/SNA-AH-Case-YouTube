She made her film debut in 2004 in the sports drama Friday Night Lights. After small roles in North Country and Alpha Dog, Heard played her first leading role in All the Boys Love Mandy Lane (2006) and appeared in The CW television show Hidden Palms (2007).\n\nHeard's breakthrough came in 2008 with roles in Never Back Down and Pineapple Express. She received the Breakthrough Award at Young Hollywood Awards. Her appearance in films such as The Informers, The Stepfather, Zombieland, and The Joneses brought her further attention. She next starred in John Carpenter's The Ward, alongside Nicolas Cage in Drive Angry, and alongside Johnny Depp in The Rum Diary, for which she won a Spotlight Award at the Hollywood Film Festival. In 2014 she appeared in 3 Days to Kill, and in 2015 in Magic Mike XXL and The Danish Girl. She played Mera in the 2017 superhero film Justice League, a role she will reprise in the 2018 film Aquaman.\nn 2011, Heard appeared as the female lead opposite Johnny Depp in the Hunter S. Thompson adaptation The Rum Diary, which received mixed reviews and was not a commercial success. Heard's other film release in 2011 was Drive Angry, a supernatural action thriller in which she was paired with Nicolas Cage. Film critic Roger Ebert stated that she \"does everything that can possibly be done\" with her character, a waitress who becomes entangled in an undead man's mission to save his daughter from a cult. In February 2011, she also appeared on the British television program Top Gear.\n\nHeard appeared in no new films until 2013, when she starred in the thriller Paranoia, the action-comedy Machete Kills, and the satirical drama Syrup. The latter was based on a novel by Max Barry, who called Heard \"amazing\" and stated that she \"annihilated that character. In a good way.\" Her only film release in 2014, action-thriller 3 Days to Kill, was a box office success.\n\nHeard had roles in four films released in 2015, which led James Mottram of the British newspaper The Independent to call it a \"watershed year\" in her career. She had a prominent role in the comedy-drama Magic Mike XXL as a photographer who flirts with Channing Tatum's protagonist; like its predecessor, Magic Mike (2012), the film was a large box office success. Digital Spy described Heard as \"a convincing girl-next-door type\" in their review. Heard also had a small supporting role as a ballet dancer in Tom Hooper's historical drama The Danish Girl (2015), which premiered at the 72nd Venice Film Festival to overall positive reviews. She also starred in the independent crime thriller The Adderall Diaries alongside James Franco, Christian Slater, and Ed Harris. Indiewire gave film a mixed review and stated that Heard was \"miscast\" but yet \"she displays much potential and has succeeded in a bid to be taken more seriously.\" Her fourth role in 2015 was opposite Christopher Walken in the musical drama One More Time; for the role, she took singing lessons and learned to play piano and guitar. International Business Times described Heard as \"talented enough to share a few heartfelt moments in a character that mostly operates on the defensive.\" Los Angeles Times called her performance \"superb\" and The Film Stage stated that Heard does an \"admirable job\".\n\nIn addition, Heard played the female lead in the Martin Amis adaptation London Fields, which was initially scheduled to premiere at the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival. It was pulled from the festival roster after director Mathew Cullen sued its producers, accusing them of fraud and of using his name to promote a cut of the film he did not support. The film's stars, including Heard, had also written to the producers, objecting to the cut that was seen at press and industry screenings at Toronto. London Fields and Heard's performance received highly negative reviews, and she stated that \"it was one of the most difficult movies to film and it has proven to continue to be difficult...I can\u2019t say I did her  justice.\"\n\nHeard played Mera, Aquaman's Atlantean queen, in the DC Comics superhero film Justice League (2017). She will reprise the role in a larger capacity in 2018's Aquaman.",
