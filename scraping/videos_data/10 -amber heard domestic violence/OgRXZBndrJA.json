            "description": "This is an edited clip/condensed version of Colonel Kurtz\u2019 interview with Marilyn Mansons former personal assistant, Paula. I\u2019ve condensed this video for the purpose of showing Paula detailing her experience with Johnny Depp & Amber Heard while they were married. I\u2019m not a professional video editor, so some of it may seem choppy, as I was trying to cut it down to the most important points Paula made.  \n\nIf you\u2019re interested in watching the full interview, here is the link for that:\n https://youtu.be/-t-1wygFTWs\n\nI highly recommend following Colonel Kurtz on her channel! She\u2019s got some great content, and puts a lot of heart and effort into her work.\n\nPeople need to know that Amber Heard is a dangerous individual, and Paula is the second person recently to come out with uncomfortable stories regarding Amber. There was another woman and model who recently came forward with allegations of sexual assault by Amber Heard. It\u2019s said she did a podcast that will be posted soon, after she gets a police report established, so please keep an eye out for that as well. \n\nColonel Kurtz Twitter Handle:\n@colonelkurtz99\n\nMy Twitter Handle:\n@nearlydear",
