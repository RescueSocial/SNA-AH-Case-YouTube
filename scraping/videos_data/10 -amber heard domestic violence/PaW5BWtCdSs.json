But this\ntime things went really harsh for Amber Heard. According to the latest reports,\nAmber Heard is at risk of facing jail time because now she is under\ninvestigation by the LAPD for perjury concerning the 2016 incident in which\nDepp allegedly hit his then-wife in the face. For now, Amber Heard is trying to\nget the case dismissed officially.\nI\u2019m going to break it down for you, but before we start, hit that subscribe button\nand make sure you stay till the end to know if the game is over for Amber\nHeard.\nAfter Johnny Deepp's defeat in the British High Court last year, his legal team\nhas plans to appeal. But this is more difficult than it seems because Amber\nHeard\u2019s legal team has tried to get the U.S.-based lawsuit dismissed, arguing\nthat the findings in the U.K. libel suit should be adopted. As for Johnny Depp\u2019s\nlawyer? He\u2019s calling it a \u201chail Mary.\u201d\nApparently, Amber Heard's legal team doesn't want to give up without a fight\nand they've filed a motion to stay discovery on the defamation claims and also a\nmemorandum in support of her motion for leave. Her team believes that due to\nthe libel case results, which found in favor of The Sun after that outlet called\nJohnny Depp a \u201cwife beater,\u201d that the judgment rendered should be applicable\nin the US as well. The motion reads:\nWith the finality of the Judgment, rendered after Mr. Depp presented his best\nevidence and arguments on the exact same factual issues assessed here, Mr.\nDepp should be precluded from seeking yet another bite of the apple, where he\nhas fully adjudicated his dispute and lost. Because of the UK Judgment, the\nentire world may now say, forever, that Mr. Depp is a \u2018wife beater\u2019 and has\ncommitted at least 12 acts of domestic violence against Amber Heard, causing\nher to be in fear for her life. In short, the UK Judgement, now final, permits this\ncourt to end the litigation.\nAccording to Johnny Depp\u2019s lawyer, Benjamin Chew, however, this is not the\nfirst time Amber Heard\u2019s legal team has tried to get the $50 million defamation.\n\nLet us know in the comments below, be sure to subscribe and we\u2019ll see you next time on the channel!",
