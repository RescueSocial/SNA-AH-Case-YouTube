Amber Heard literally started attacking Depp supporters, who, for the most part are SURVIVORS of Domestic Abuse. To me, I think these tweets are an embarrassment to the #metoo movement inserting herself yet again into a situation she is not involved with at all. If she wished to show her support of her friend, there is much more productive and graceful ways to do so, and for Wood's sake, I wish she would've been more tactful and not made her friend's story with abuse about her own case.

I want to credit them but couldn't find it as I've had this all saved on my phone for a WHILE now! Let me know so I can credit their work! Much love to ALL OF YOU! Please give me constructive criticism, my brother and I are long distance working on these so it does take several days of passing the videos back and forth to work on them! I know a couple photos are a little out of place near the end but by the fourth time we'd passed it back and forth we were pretty sick of watching me talk! hahaha! But let me know! And THANK YOU FOR WATCHING! And reading this if you made it this far LOL!",
