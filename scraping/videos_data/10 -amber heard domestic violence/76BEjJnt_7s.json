On the other side Amber Heard is getting equal amount of hate. \n\nBut it seems, she knows this is an opportunity and she is busy making the most of it, she is giving lectures on domestic violence, may be because she survived it and wants to change the world to be a better place, yeah only after charging $ 33000. \n\nHere is the quote from the source article: \n\nOut of everything you might think Amber Heard has lost, it is undoubtedly not work. The actor holds her ground in all her projects regardless of the massive hatred she is subjected to by the online users. While she still stands strong and continues to get on board for more movies, the latest reports tell us that she has unlocked one more money-minting avenue in her life.
