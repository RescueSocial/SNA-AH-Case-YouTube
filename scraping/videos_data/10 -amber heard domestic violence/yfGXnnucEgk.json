            "description": "Amber Heard\u2018s legal team, lead attorney Samantha F. Spector and co-counsel Joseph P. Koenig, just released a statement defending her and her actions throughout the past week in her allegations of domestic violence against Johnny Depp.\n\n\u201cAs the result of Amber\u2019s decision to decline giving an initial statement to the LAPD, her silence has been used against her by Johnny\u2019s team. Amber did not provide a statement to the LAPD in an attempt to protect her privacy and Johnny\u2019s career. Johnny\u2019s team has forced Amber to give a statement to the LAPD to set the record straight as to the true facts, as she cannot continue to leave herself open to the vicious false and malicious allegations that have infected the media. Amber has suffered through years of physical and psychological abuse at the hands of Johnny,\u201d the statement, provided to Just Jared, began.\n\n\u201cIn domestic violence cases, it is not unusual for the perpetrator\u2019s playbook to include miscasting the victim as the villain,\u201d the statement continued. \u201cIn reality, Amber acted no differently than many victims of domestic violence, who think first of the harm that might come to the abuser, rather than the abuse they have already suffered. Amber can no longer endure the relentless attacks and outright lies launched against her character in the Court of Public Opinion since the tragic events of May 21st. With her statement Amber hopes to give the LAPD the opportunity to conduct an accurate and complete investigation into the events of that evening and before. If that occurs, and the truth is revealed, there is no doubt that Amber\u2019s claims will be substantiated beyond any doubt, and hopefully Johnny will get the help that he so desperately needs.\u201d\n\nClick inside to read the remainder of the statement from Amber Heard\u2019s legal team\u2026\n\nFrom the beginning it has been Amber\u2019s desire to keep this matter as private as possible, even though LAPD officers responded to a 911 call made by a third-party. The LAPD officers viewed not only the disarray that Johnny had caused in the apartment but also the physical injuries to Amber\u2019s face. We filed the Petition for Dissolution of Marriage at the very end of the day on Monday May 23rd and we did not serve Johnny with the Petition at the premiere of Alice Through the Looking Glass that evening. We sent a letter to Johnny\u2019s counsel team the next morning making it clear we wanted to keep this matter out of the media. We then held off requesting a domestic violence restraining order as we knew that Johnny was out of the country.\n\nWe took the high road. Unfortunately, Johnny\u2019s team immediately went to the press and began viciously attacking Amber\u2019s character. Amber is simply a victim of domestic violence, and none of her actions are motivated by money. Amber is a brave and financially independent woman who is showing the courage of her convictions by doing the right thing against Johnny\u2019s relentless army of lawyers and surrogates.\n\nThe Family Law Court is not going to be influenced by misinformation placed in the social media based on anonymous sources. Amber is the victim. Amber is a hero.\u201d",
