The injuries were allegedly inflicted by Depp, 52, in December 2015. \n\nMs Heard has got a restraining order against the actor and claimed that besides the latest incident of violence on April 21, the actor was violent to him in the past as well. \n\nIn documents filed on May 27 to seek a temporary restraining order against Ms Depp, Ms Heard had alleged that during the \"entirety\" of their four-year relationship, \"Mr Depp has been verbally and physically abusive to me.\" \n\nShe described a December event that possibly correlates with the alleged timeline of these new photos. \n\n\"There also have been several prior incidents of domestic violence with Johnny, in particular there was one severe incident in December 2015 when I truly feared that my life was in danger,\" she had said in her court declaration. \n\nMr Depp's divorce attorney Laura Wasser claims that Ms Heard, who filed for divorce from mr Depp on May 23, just 14 months of marriage, is \"attempting to secure a premature financial resolution by alleging abuse.\" \n\nThe actor's daughter Lily-Rose, his first wife Lori Ann Allison and his ex-partner Vanessa Paradis had dismissed Ms Heard's allegations of domestic violence. \n\nAn LAPD spokesperson said the officers responded to a 911 call but determined there was \"no evidence of any crime\" at the scene. \n\nIn a statement on Tuesday, Ms Heard's lawyers said that she declined to make a statement to police at the time to \"protect her privacy and Johnny's career,\" but plans to make one and \"hopes to give the LAPD the opportunity to conduct an accurate and complete investigation.\"",
