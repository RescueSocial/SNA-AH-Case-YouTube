            "description": "\"Only 5 Years?\" Johnny Depp Reacts to Amber Heard Sentenced to Prison!\n\nIn today's video, we are going to be discussing Johnny Depp and amber heard's situation in regards to Johnny Depp's reaction to amber heard's court case. \n\nIf you\u2019ve been following the Johnny Depp and Amber Heard domestic abuse allegations since the story first broke in U.K. News Group Newspaper publication, The Sun, you undoubtedly already know that the situation seems to grow more contentious by the week. Most recently, after Pirates of the Caribbean actor Depp lost his right to appeal his libel case loss in London, Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) bodycam footage surfaced that seemingly indicated Heard might not have been entirely truthful in some of her domestic violence claims. The footage, which was from a 2016 incident in Mr. Depp and Ms. Heard\u2019s downtown Los Angeles penthouse apartment, showed that the residence was not, in fact, in disarray, as the Aquaman actress had claimed.\n\nAs for Heard, she is currently set to reprise her role as Mera in Warner Bros. Aquaman 2. Depp was fired by Warner Bros. and has been replaced by Mads Mikkelsen as Gellert Grindelwald in the Fantastic Beasts franchise.\n\n#amberheard \n#johnnydepp\n#JusticeForJohnnyDepp",
