            "description": "Johnny Depp and Amber Heard: A Timeline of Their Tempestuous Relationship\n\nThe divorce of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp is now final, and one thing\u2019s for sure: Heard didn\u2019t get any money out of it.\n\nShe settled the divorce out of court for $7 million, all of which she has now donated to charitable causes. She\u2019s splitting the sum between the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s efforts to battle violence against women and the Children\u2019s Hospital of Los Angeles, where she\u2019s volunteered for the past 10 years.\n\nAnd in a joint statement, both Heard and Depp affirmed that \u201cneither party has made false accusations for financial gain.\u201d\n\nIn other words: Heard is not a gold digger, and she did not accuse Depp of cutting off part of his finger and then using the stump to finger paint the words \u201cEasy Amber\u201d on a mirror because she thought that would be a cool quick way to make some cash.\n\nIt\u2019s a shame Heard felt the need to be so emphatic about the fact that she isn\u2019t lying about her domestic violence claims, but it\u2019s not surprising. Ever since she first filed for a restraining order against Depp in May, Heard has done everything we say domestic abuse survivors should do. She went to the police. She provided copious documentation. She went above and beyond to prove she wasn\u2019t in it for the money.\nPeople still insisted she was lying.\n\nAfter months of fighting, Amber Heard and Johnny Depp suddenly settled their divorce this week, with Heard donating all of the settlement money to charity.\n\nTheir relationship was a tabloid magazine\u2019s dream: Hollywood A-lister falls in love with up-and-coming ingenue on set. Later, as allegations of abuse emerged, coverage of their relationship took a noticeably darker turn, with lurid reports \u2014 and later video and photos \u2014 of violent outbursts and alleged physical abuse.\n\n\nHere\u2019s a look back at Johnny and Amber\u2019s tempestuous relationship.\n\n\nOctober 2009\n\nDepp and Heard met on the set of \u201cThe Rum Diary\u201d with Depp playing a journalist obsessed with Heard\u2019s character \u2014 a woman engaged to another man.\n\nJune 2012 \n\nDepp and Heard started dating after the actor split from his long-time partner, Vanessa Paradis.\n\nJan. 17, 2014\n\nPeople Magazine reported the couple was engaged.\n\nApril 7, 2014\n\nDepp showed off his engagement ring during an interview with ET, stating, \u201cIt\u2019s exciting to wear a girl\u2019s ring \u2026 I don\u2019t know, you know. It just fit.\u201d\n\nMay 2014\n\nA text message conversation retrieved by ET on June 1, 2016, reportedly showed Depp\u2019s abusive behavior toward Heard in May of 2014.\n\nFeb. 3, 2015\n\nDepp and Heard tied the knot at the actor\u2019s private island in the Bahamas.",
