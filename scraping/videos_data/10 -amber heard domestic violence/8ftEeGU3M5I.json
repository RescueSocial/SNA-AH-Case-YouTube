A photo of Heard with the baby nestled against her accompanied Thursday's (01JULY2021) announcement.\r\n ``I now appreciate how radical it is for us as women to think about one of the most fundamental parts of our destinies in this way,'' Heard said in the post. ``I hope we arrive at a point in which it's normalized to not want a ring in order to have a crib.''\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\nShe wrote that ``a part of me wants to uphold that my private life is none of anyone's business,'' but added the nature of her job ``compels me to take control of this'' by revealing the birth.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n``She's the beginning of the rest of my life,'' Heard said.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\nThe actor has faced a tumultuous period of her life, with her 2015 to 2017 marriage to Johnny Depp involving a spate of legal actions. \r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\nLast year, Depp lost a libel case against a British newspaper that accused him of domestic violence, with a judge ruling the allegations were ``substantially correct.'' In March, a British court refused Depp permission to appeal the ruling that he assaulted Heard, saying his attempt to overturn the decision had ``no real prospect of success.''\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\nDepp also is suing Heard for $50 million in Virginia over a Washington Post op-ed essay that she wrote about domestic violence. The trial in that case was recently delayed until April 2022.\r\n\r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives \u200b\u200b\r\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/145054bb194f4d25886045d9655f921d",
