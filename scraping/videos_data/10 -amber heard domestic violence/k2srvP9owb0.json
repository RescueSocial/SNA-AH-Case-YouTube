            "description": "AMBER HEARD Calls Out Media For Ignoring Marilyn Manson Abuse Allegations!\n______________________________________________\nFor more videos subscribe : https://bit.ly/2zoPgqj\n______________________________________________\nAmber Heard has condemned the media for \u201cignoring\u201d allegations against the rock star Marilyn Manson, who has been accused by a number of women of abuse. \n\nIn today's video we are going to discuss about Amber Heard calls out media for \u2018ignoring\u2019 Marilyn Manson abuse allegations. \n\nOn Monday (1 February), actor Evan Rachel Wood accused Manson of grooming and abusing her \u201cfor years\u201d while they were in a relationship. Several other women also came forward with allegations against Manson.At least 10 women, including actor Evan Rachel Wood, have spoken out against Manson since Monday, making allegations that include sexual assault, psychological abuse, physical violence and anti-Semitism. Manson has denied the accusations, calling them \u201chorrible distortions of reality.\u201d \n\nOn Thursday (4 February), Heard, who has been embroiled in a high-profile divorce battle with Johnny Depp, tweeted her support of Wood, while suggesting that the media had long turned a blind eye to Manson\u2019s behaviour.Sharing an article from The New Yorker suggesting there is a \u201cblind spot\u201d when it comes to allegations made against public figures, Heard wrote: \u201c...and yet, no one sees the trend here? Everyone wants to tag a bathroom wall, no one wants to understand the writing. Evan & I aren\u2019t the 1st to raise our hands. Are you done ignoring it?\u201d \n\nAfter a Twitter user replied to Heard\u2019s message with the single word \u201cfraud\u201d, Heard responded: \u201cWell I know a couple of over-indulged white male celebrities (who happen to be world famous) AND single, who are def in the market for some low rate ass-missing [sic], shall I intro you??\u201d \n\nEarlier this week (2 February), Heard\u2019s ex-husband Depp was permitted an oral hearing in his attempts to appeal a ruling by the British High Court over a newspaper column that described him as a \u201cwife beater\u201d. The hearing will be held in March.Heard has long accused the Pirates of the Caribbean star of domestic violence, something he has denied. After suing The Sun publisher News Group Newspapers and its executive editor Dan Wootton for referring to him as a \u201cwife beater\u201d in a column, Depp lost the case in December. A British judge declared that the claim was \u201csubstantially true.\"\n\nIn court filings, Heard alleged Depp, one of Manson\u2019s close friends, was verbally and physically abusive to her. In 2016, People magazine published photos that showed Heard with a \u201cbruised eye and cut lip\u201d stemming from an alleged domestic violence incident involving Depp in December 2015. Heard said she \u201ctruly feared for her life\u201d during that incident. In November, a British judge ruled against Depp in his libel lawsuit against a British newspaper that called him a \u201cwife beater.\u201d Heard testified in the case, alleging Depp repeatedly assaulted her, including head-butting her, hitting her and tearing out clumps of her hair. \n\nA petition to remove Heard from the Aquaman franchise, spearheaded by Depp\u2019s fans, has so far received millions of signatures.Heard condemned the campaign, while arguing that it will have no effect on her status within the superhero franchise. \u201cPaid rumours and paid campaigns on social media don\u2019t dictate [casting decisions] because they have no basis in reality,\u201d Heard said in November. \n\nSo that's all for today's video.
