            "description": "Amber Laura Heard (born April 22, 1986) is an American actress. Heard first gained mainstream recognition for supporting roles in the action film Never Back Down (2008) and the stoner comedy Pineapple Express (2008). In the following ten years, she acted mostly in independent films and small-budget productions, such as The Joneses (2009), The Rum Diary (2011), The Danish Girl (2015) and One More Time (2015). She's also known for her roles in horror and thriller films such as All the Boys Love Mandy Lane (2006), John Carpenter's The Ward (2010), Drive Angry (2011), and Machete Kills (2013).\n\nHeard had her first major studio role in the DC Extended Universe superhero film Justice League (2017), in which she played Atlantean queen Mera. She reprised that role opposite Jason Momoa in Aquaman (2018). The same year, Heard was named a global spokesperson for the cosmetics giant L'Or\u00e9al Paris.\n\nHeard was married to actor Johnny Depp from 2015 to 2017. Their divorce drew significant media attention as she alleged that he had been abusive during most of their relationship. After Heard publicly discussed being the victim of domestic violence in 2018, Depp sued her for defamation, alleging that she had been the abusive party. Depp also sued the publishers of The Sun in a related libel suit, with Heard as a key witness for the defendants. In November 2020, the High Court of Justice of England and Wales ruled that Depp had lost his case and that the majority of Heard's allegations had been proven to a civil standard.\n\nIn addition to acting, Heard engages in activism for causes such as LGBTQ rights and domestic and sexual violence awareness.",
