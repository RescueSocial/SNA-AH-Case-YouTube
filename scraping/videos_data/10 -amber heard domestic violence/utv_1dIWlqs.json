            "description": "Read more here: www.famefocus.com\nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/focusfame\n\n8 Times Talented Actors Were Rotten People!\n\nThe media tends to shed an ethereal light on many actors, however not all talented stars are actually good people. These stories will make you look at some of Hollywood\u2019s Heroes quite differently...\n\n1. Christian Bale\nThe Batman star was arrested for assault in July 2008, against... his own mother and sister! Bale became violent after his wife fell out with his mother and is known for his aggressive tantrums on film sets.\n\n2. Reese Witherspoon\nThe Wild actress and husband were pulled over for drunk driving when Reese asked meekly; \u201cDo you know my name? You are going to be on national news.\u201d She was arrested for disorderly conduct and obstruction of a police officer.\n\n3. Sean Connery \nHis first wife Diane Cilento recently described an incident in which Connery beat her unconscious. She revealed that the domestic assault ended their marriage.\n                                               \n4. Emma Roberts\nJulia Robert\u2019s niece took things too far and was arrested for domestic assault after bloodying her boyfriend and American Horror Story beau, Evan Peters.  \n                       \n5. Johnny Depp\nWhilst attending an Iggy Pop concert a fan got too close to Depp who called his security squad. Allegedly they ripped off the female\u2019s pants and pinned her to the ground, while Johnny turned a blind eye.\n\n6. Mark Wahlberg\nThe Entourage creator had been in trouble for violently racist assaults over 20 times before he turned 16! At 15 Wahlberg threw rocks and shouted racial epithets at African-American children, beat one Vietnamese man so badly he thought he had blinded him and was sentenced to two years in jail. \u201cI did a lot of things that I regret and I have certainly paid for my mistakes.\u201d Do you forgive him?\n                                       \n7. Mel Gibson\nThe Passion of the Christ director ruined his reputation after a sexist, ridiculously racist and very violent phone call to ex-girlfriend, Oksana Grigorieva. It wasn\u2019t the first time Gibson had been caught in a drunkenly racist rant.\n                                                               \n8. Michael Fassbender\nThe X-Men star horrifically abused his ex-girlfriend on multiple occasions. She claimed he threw her over a chair, broke her nose, dragged her alongside her car, twisting her left ankle and blowing out her left kneecap. She asked for $20,000 to cover her medical expenses however, the charges were mysteriously dropped. Maybe she was paid off by Fassbender\u2019s team\u2026\n\nWhich of today\u2019s celebs do you think is the most rotten?",
