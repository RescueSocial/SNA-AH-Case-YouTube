I have a lot to say in this video, some which may challenge beliefs, some which may reinforce them, but I just hope people are open to listening. As someone who dealt with a really toxic/abusive relationship myself, this is why men don't say anything and just keep quiet. I've included all sources I used down below, please do check them out. I believe they are important. After Johnny was asked to leave the Fantastic Beasts franchise, I really didn't want to keep this to myself. #justiceforjohnny #justiceforjohnnydepp #fantasticbeasts\n\nLink for Domestic Abuse Help\n\nhttps://www.thehotline.org\n\nCheck out the Lets Play Channel\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqUxQUAGade5ek_daIehdKw\n\nJoin the community\n\nhttps://twitter.com/DegenerateJay\n\nhttps://discord.gg/F2Guk4g\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thedegeneratejay/?hl=en\n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/degeneratejay\n\nAll Sources\n\nCourt Documents\n\nhttps://wixlabs-pdf-dev.appspot.com/assets/pdfjs/web/viewer.html?file=%2Fpdfproxy%3Finstance%3DgvjJLtqFTWPIz-7acdtMepGNYPSYdxjHZlZVPKAkHvk.eyJpbnN0YW5jZUlkIjoiMzQxZWY5OGUtZTBjZS00YzUwLWI4N2ItNGExODJiYjBiYzhkIiwiYXBwRGVmSWQiOiIxM2VlMTBhMy1lY2I5LTdlZmYtNDI5OC1kMmY5ZjM0YWNmMGQiLCJtZXRhU2l0ZUlkIjoiODBiMDgxNzEtY2U3My00NDg4LWIzNjktZmUzOTM0YjA1MDRhIiwic2lnbkRhdGUiOiIyMDIwLTA3LTIyVDE5OjI3OjMyLjQzMVoiLCJkZW1vTW9kZSI6ZmFsc2UsImFpZCI6IjQ3MDdlY2ViLWUwMTMtNGY0Yi1hMDIzLTM3MjkxNzExNjA4NyIsImJpVG9rZW4iOiJiNGFlNzhmZi0yZWJkLTA4ZDgtMGIxMi1iNDIxMWYwMGVjYzciLCJzaXRlT3duZXJJZCI6IjVkZjUwNTBkLTQ1ZWQtNGFlZS1hMTU5LWIxODY5ZGZiMjk0YyJ9%26compId%3Dcomp-kcxph0e6%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fdocs.wixstatic.com%2Fugd%2F5df505_72a55d0c9a0b4e919b4b509eed3052c4.pdf#page=1&links=true&originalFileName=Josh%20Drew%20Witness%20Statement%2012%20Feb%202020&locale=en&allowDownload=true&allowPrinting=true\n\nJD AH Talking about... using\n\nhttps://micky.com.au/johnny-depp-speaks-about-drug-session-with-ex-amber-heard/\n\nJD's exes defend him\n\nhttps://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/lovers-johnny-depp-defense-libel-case-70656836#:~:text=Two%20former%20romantic%20partners%20of,against%20British%20newspaper%20The%20Sun&text=LONDON%20--%20Two%20former%20romantic,he%20was%20violent%20or%20abusive\n\nAH voice recording suggesting people won't side with JD\n\nhttps://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7966723/Amber-Heard-ridicules-Johnny-Depp-claiming-hes-domestic-violence-victim.html\n\nAH - more nobody will believe you statements\n\nhttps://theblast.com/c/johnny-depp-amber-heard-audio-released-domestic-violence-hitting-punching-victim-recording\n\nAH talks about hitting JD\n\nhttps://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7947733/Amber-Heard-admits-hitting-ex-husband-Johnny-Depp-pelting-pots-pans-tape.html\n\nJD PB Texts\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/27/johnny-depp-amber-heard-threats-to-ex-wife-in-texts-london-high-court#:~:text=Texts%20allegedly%20written%20by%20actor,before%20we%20burn%20her!!!\n\nJD forced out of Fantastic Beasts\n\nhttps://www.news18.com/news/movies/angry-fans-want-justice-for-johnny-depp-after-he-was-asked-to-resign-from-fantastic-beasts-role-3053021.html\n\nNurse note detailing AH's addiction\n\nhttps://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8541557/Amber-Heard-admits-taking-MDMA-magic-mushrooms-Coachella-music-festival.html\n\nJD says AH painted on wounds\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/21/johnny-depp-amber-heard-painted-on-bruises",
