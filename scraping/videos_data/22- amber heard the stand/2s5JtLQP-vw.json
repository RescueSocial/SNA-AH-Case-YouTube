If you're confused by exactly what's going on then don't worry as we're gonna be breaking it all down and discussing the main book differences.\n\nObviously full spoilers ahead from here on out though I will keep some of the bigger elements of the book a secret to not spoil some certain surprises. If you enjoy the video please smash the thumbs up button and make sure you subscribe for breakdowns of the series every week.\n\nWith that out the way, Happy New Year, I'm your host Paul now let's get into the breakdown!\n\nOk so Episode 3 sort of fills in the back stories of some of the side characters that we've been introduced to and primarily we focus on Nadine, Nick and Stu meeting Glen Bateman.\n\nNow you may remember that last week we caught Nadine being drawn towards a planchette and this episode we see that the device ties back to her childhood. Similar to the source material, Nadine was an orphan but rather than living with her Aunt and Uncle like in the book we see her starting off in a home.\n\nThrough the Planchette, Randall Flagg is able to contact her and he clearly has had eyes on her from a young age. The villain carves into the floor \"Nadine will be my queen, we are in the house of the dead Nadine\" which yeah...you can have her mate.\n\nNow even in her adult version, Nadine is still a virgin and this is because throughout her life Flagg has contacted her and told her to save herself for him. Though many men have shot their shot some dark force has always swept in and scared them off.\n\nIn the present we catch her waking up in bed and to everyone's surprise Amber Heard hasn't pooped in it.\n\n\u25ba Artist Attribution\nMusic By: \"KaizanBlu\"\n\u2022 Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/kaizanblu/\n\u2022 SoundCloud - https://soundcloud.com/kaizanblu/\n\u2022 Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/kaizanblumusic/\n\u2022 TikTok - @kaizanblu http://vm.tiktok.com/aCYwfx/\n\u2022 YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUtx...\n\u2022 DOWNLOAD @ https://www.chilloutmedia.com/kaizanblu\nLicence: Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0)\n- Full licence here: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/...\n\u2022 Music released by: Chill Out Records @ https://goo.gl/fh3rEJ & https://www.LoFi-HipHop.com\n\n\u25ba Artist Attribution\nLofi Geek @Spotify: https://spoti.fi/3g16Pgr\nLofi Geek Official Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyD59CI7beJDU493glZpxgA\nArtwork @mb0sco",
