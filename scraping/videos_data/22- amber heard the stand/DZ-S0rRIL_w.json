            "description": "Amber Heard teared up as she braced herself for the last day of ex-husband Johnny Depp\u2019s libel trial. The actress said it was \u2018incredibly painful\u2019 to relive their breakup and \u2018preferred\u2019 not to be there. \u00a0 \u00a0Amber Heard struggled to hold back tears as she spoke to the press outside the courthouse before the final day of ex-husband Johnny Depp\u2018s libel trial, July 28. After three weeks of testimony, including from Amber, the court is to decide if The Sun is at fault for labeling the actor a \u201cwife beater\u201d in a 2018 article. \u201cI traveled here to the UK to testify as a witness to assist the court,\u201d Amber said. \u201cAfter obtaining a restraining order in 2016 and finalizing my divorce, I just wanted to move on with my life.\u201d \u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI did not file this lawsuit. And despite its significance, I would have preferred not to be here in court,\u201d Amber told reporters. \u201cIt has been incredibly painful to relive the break-up of my relationship, to have my motives and my truth questioned. And the most traumatic and intimate details of my life with Johnny shared in court and broadcast to the entire world. I stand by my testimony, and I now place my faith in British justice.\u201d \u00a0Since the trial began on July 7, the court has heard some wild accusations from both sides about what happened during Johnny and Amber\u2019s two-year marriage. The Pirates of the Caribbean star, 57, sued The Sun\u2018s parent company News Group Newspapers (NGN) and the paper\u2019s executive editor, Dan Wootton, over an April 2018 article, in which Wootton wrote that there was \u201coverwhelming evidence\u201d that \u201cwife beater\u201d Johnny abused Amber.  \u00a0Among the allegations to come out of the trial, was Johnny saying that\u00a0he decided he wanted to divorce Amber when she \u201cor one of her friends\u201d allegedly defecated in their bed. The Sun\u2018s lawyer claimed that when Amber once made fun of Johnny\u2019s \u201cWino Forever\u201d tattoo, he slapped her. Johnny denied this. Amber said in a testimony that Johnny also allegedly accused her of having affairs with her co-stars. \u00a0The court also heard testimony from Johnny\u2019s ex-fianc\u00e9e, Winona Ryder.\u00a0The Stranger Things star, 48, said in a July 16 statement that Johnny was never abusive during their four-year relationship, which ended in 1993. \u201cThe idea that he is an incredibly violent person is the farthest thing from the Johnny I knew and loved,\u201d Winona\u2019s statement said. \u201cI do not want to call anyone a liar but from my experience of Johnny, it is impossible to believe that such horrific allegations are true.\u201d",
