It is so selfish to take a beloved piece of nostalgia from the collective conscious and pervert it with your own stupid, nonsensical, computer generated, microwavable P.C. garbage. Robbing true fans of any hope for a decent retelling for now, @ least, another 30 years. Selfish and stupid. I have been SO DISAPPOINTED in the remake of \"The Stand\"... Nothing has been more grossly mishandled than Ezra Millers' offensive portrayal of Trash-Can-Man. However, I am personally APPALLED @ the horrible direction of Nadine's death. A terribly missed opportunity. The character deserved better. In the source material, her death and moreso her public defiance of Flagg are the pivotal beginning of a cascading series of events that weaken his power and allow his defeat. I decided to edit together a video homage to Nadine, as played (more accurately) by Laura San-Giacomo in the 1994 miniseries. I don't know what Amber Heard was doing, but Giacomo's Nadine is far superior. R.I.P. Nadine Cross.",
