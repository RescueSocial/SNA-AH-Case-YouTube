Just how difficult is it to do though?\n\nIn the video above, we explain how and where the glitch works, and its ridiculous process of setting it up. For this video alone, 10,800 weapons were duplicated just to understand and share how this glitch works. The ability to freeze arrows in place, lose entire body parts, and kill a gold Lynel with a flood of thrown weapons sounds enticing, but is it worth the mental stress of achieving the glitch?",
