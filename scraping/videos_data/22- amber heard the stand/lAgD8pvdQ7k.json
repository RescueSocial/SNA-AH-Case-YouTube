But after an article by The New York Times, the release of a video of the February confrontation, and increased attention from lawmakers, celebrities and civil rights activists, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation stepped in.  The police arrested two men, Gregory McMichael and his son Travis McMichael, on Thursday and charged them with murder and aggravated assault in the killing of Mr. Arbery. The state agency said Travis McMichael had fired the fatal shots. Days before the arrests, a video that appears to show the deadly struggle between Mr. Arbery and one of his pursuers went viral. The same day, the prosecutor handling the case, Tom Durden of Georgia\u2019s Atlantic Judicial Circuit, said that a grand jury should decide whether criminal charges are warranted for the people involved in Mr. Arbery\u2019s death.\n \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \nWelcome to Real Law Review by LegalEagle; a series where I try to tackle the most important legal issues of the day.
