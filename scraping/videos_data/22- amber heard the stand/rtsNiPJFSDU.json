But now there has been a new development regarding the evidence: body cam footage from the Los Angeles police department (LAPD) officers who responded to the 911 call. And this  evidence seems to change the direction of the case. So, what was on the bodycam footage and why it could change the whole case? \n\n\u2705 Like & Subscribe for more Celebrity Content!\n\nNobody expected this was coming but Johnny Depp's attorneys claim that never-before-seen body cam footage from the Los Angeles police department (LAPD) officers who responded to the second of two 911 calls proves that Johnny Depp wasn\u2019t the violent one in the altercation with his ex-wife. Moreover, it might be final proof that Amber Heard lied about the alleged brawl that took place in May 2016. Which means that not only the table drastically turned against Heard but that she might face serious consequences such as prison time very soon! Do you think this new evidence is enough to put Amber Heard behind bars?\n\n#AmberHeard #JohnnyDepp",
