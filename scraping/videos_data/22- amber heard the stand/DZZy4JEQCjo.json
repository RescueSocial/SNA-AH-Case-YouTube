            "description": "Despite some recent rumors that Amber Heard has been fired from Aquaman 2, this now doesn\u2019t appear to be the case. According to insider Daniel Richtman, talk that Emilia Clarke, who\u2019s been linked to the role of Mera before, is set to replace Heard, has no basis in truth. And although this news may not be taken as positively by some people as it will be by others, it seems that Heard\u2019s immediate career prospects and personal life are going to be shadowed by these sorts of stories for a while yet.\n\nOf course, in recent weeks, Richtman has also reported that the actress is angry at Warner Bros. for bringing in another female lead, reducing her screen time in the Aquaman sequel. However, she\u2019s apparently set to get a pay rise for her part in the movie, too, so it\u2019s hard to really know what\u2019s going on behind the scenes on the film. Meanwhile, campaigns to boycott it rumble on in the background, with the actress\u2019 legal battles with ex-husband Johnny Depp also set to resume this year.\n\nMera will next be seen as a supporting figure in Zack Snyder\u2019s Justice League cut, and there\u2019s even been talk that she could be upgraded to a more prominent presence in the League following the events of that picture. Furthermore, Heard can currently be found in the new version of The Stand on CBS All Access, wherein she appears as Nadine Cross, one of the more villainous figures on the show.\n\nGiven how the Heard-Depp controversy isn\u2019t going away anytime soon, it\u2019s hard not to see Aquaman 2 receiving a lot of scrutiny as it gradually heads into production. The studio have continued to back the actress in the last year, though, and it seems that she\u2019s still very much in contention for other major roles in Hollywood, despite negative online campaigns. For now, then, we can probably rule out a Mera recasting.",
