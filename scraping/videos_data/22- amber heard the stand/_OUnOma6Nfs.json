The actor's legal team has requested subpoenas for Amber's ex-boyfriend, spacex billionaire Elon Musk, and the ACLU in the latest move in Johnny's $50 million defamation action against Amber. Amber agreed to donate half of her $7 million divorce settlement to a non-profit charity. Johnny's attorneys believe they have proof that Amber lied about donating the money to charity and are demanding depositions from Musk and the Aclu representatives, as well as all paperwork related to their dealings with Amber.\n\n\ud83e\udde1 If you enjoyed this video please consider leaving a like and a comment telling us what you thought \ud83e\udde1\n\nHere on Viral Uncut we are all about the latest celebrity news and the hottest spill.
