She would not go through all the pain of making this public which involves: getting death threats, negative mental health effects and losing career opportunities if these allegations were not real. I stand with Amber and everyone that is against abuse should too. Unsubscribe if you disagree. I don't want people that disagree watching my videos. Thank you, Amber, for making this pubic. It was very courageous of you. When Johnny Depp loses in court, I know you will inspire other women to go public.",
