            "description": "While most of us will probably never get a chance to meet the Queen, it couldn\u2019t hurt to brush up on your court etiquette, just in case.  No one wants to wind up being thrown out of Her Majesty\u2019s dinner party, so you should remember the rules if you want to avoid making a royal fool of yourself. By the way, let\u2019s just assume right here that burping or some other release of gas is forbidden, so we\u2019ll stick to the main ones.\n\nDid you know, for example, that using French words is considered impolite when speaking with the Queen, or any member of the royal family? Of course, breaking the rules of etiquette probably won\u2019t get you thrown into the Tower of London in chains, or even out on the street, you should be on your best behavior if you want your royal rendezvous to go smoothly.\n\nOther videos you might like:\n9 Surprising Facts About Royal Nannies https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29qAMSFYYPM&\n20 Secrets Buckingham Palace Is Hiding from Strangers https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IewMi0uDjXY&\n10 Facts Proving Even the Queen Has Strange Habits https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJxRjVaIEFk&\n\nTIMESTAMPS:\nUnder Dressing 0:37\nShowing up Empty-Handed 1:18\nTouching the Queen 2:09\nOverly Casual Greetings 2:54\nSitting Down, Eating or Leaving before the Queen 4:02\nSpeaking Out of Turn 5:01\nAsking Personal Questions 6:06\nAddressing Royalty by Name 6:57\nUsing French Words 8:32\n\n#queen #royalfamily #brightside\n\nPreview photo credit: \nBritain's Queen Elizabeth II: Victoria Jones/PA Pool/Associated Press/East News, https://www.eastnews.ru/pictures/picture/id/75801650/i/41/t/127\nAnimation is created by Bright Side.\n\nSUMMARY:\n- You might think you look good in your tee shirt and jean shorts, and it might even be true, but that kind of outfit would get you thrown out of even the least formal royal gathering. \n- Everybody likes presents, and the Queen is no exception. The practice of presenting the Monarch with a gift is a tradition going back centuries, and respecting it is a great way to get on Her Majesty\u2019s good side.\n- Have you ever wanted just to run up and give somebody a hug? Most of the time there\u2019s no harm done, but when it comes to royalty, you\u2019re better off keeping your hands to yourself. \n- The correct way to greet Her Majesty is with a formal bow or curtsy. Don\u2019t worry, no one\u2019s expecting you to hurl yourself at the floor. Men are expected to bow from the shoulders, just lowering their heads out of respect. \n- It\u2019s very improper to get up and leave without permission, or to arrive late. But quite frankly, that\u2019s just good \u2018ol fashioned manners. \n- Before speaking to the Queen, it\u2019s important to take note of where exactly you\u2019ve been seated. As a rule, the guest of honor will be seated directly to the Queen\u2019s right, and it\u2019s customary for Her Majesty to address them first. In general, it\u2019s considered good form to let the Queen begin the conversation anyway. \n- You might be super curious to hear the truth about some royal family drama, but the Queen is definitely the wrong person to be hassling with personal questions. \n- While there have been some instances of fellow monarchs addressing one another on a first-name basis, unless you\u2019re King Harold of Norway, you shouldn\u2019t even think about addressing The Queen by her name.   \n- Another thing that\u2019s important to remember is that when speaking with the Queen, or any member of the royal family for that matter, it\u2019s considered impolite to use French words.\n\nMusic by Epidemic Sound  https://www.epidemicsound.com/\n\nSubscribe to Bright Side : https://goo.gl/rQTJZz\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOur Social Media:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/brightside/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/\n5-Minute Crafts Youtube: https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC\n\nStock materials (photos, footages and other):\nhttps://www.depositphotos.com\nhttps://www.shutterstock.com\nhttps://www.eastnews.ru\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFor more videos and articles visit:\nhttp://www.brightside.me/",
