LOVE Y'ALL\n\nLINK: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWLEUN6N34GqGaxxNQTAc3Q  \n\nThe 3 Missing Teens Who Got CHAINED In Their Friends Dads Basement..\n\nStay tuned for the strange case that happened around Lorain Avenue between 2002-2004 when three young women had vanished from the area! Subscribe to Anna Solves for more true crime.\n\nMichelle Knight disappeared on August 23, 2002. The authorities assumed she\u2019d left home because she was angry at losing custody of her son, and didn\u2019t look that hard for her. Because she was basically an adult. After fifteen months, they even took her off the missing person database!\n\nBut the local disappearances continued to happen. On April 21, 2003, Amanda Berry disappeared the day before her 17th birthday. She\u2019d been working at a Burger King, and had left there at about 7 pm that night. Nobody could find her.\n\nGina DeJesus was barely in her mid-teens when she was last seen at a payphone at 3:00 pm on April 2nd, 2004. Then she also vanished without a trace.\n\nWhile the usual searches went on, mainly for the last two women, Amanda\u2019s poor mom had eventually consulted a \u2018psychic\u2019. This fraud convinced her that her daughter had passed away. That\u2019s so incredibly sad. \n\nWhile the links between the cases were slowly being made, it looked like no trace of them would ever be found. At least not until there was a totally unexpected revelation.\n\nCharles Ramsey had lived in Lorain Street for a year. On May 6th, 2013, he was hanging out outside his house, eating a McDonalds meal, when something really crazy began to happen.\n\nThinking it was a domestic issue, Charles went over and tried to unlock the screen door for her, but couldn\u2019t get it to open very much. So he kicked out the bottom of the door. The woman emerged, and she brought a young girl out with her. \n\nWhat the hell was going on?\n\nFrantically, the woman explained to Charles that she\u2019d been held prisoner in the house. This is her 911 call:\n\n\"Help me I\u2019m Amanda Berry! I need Police! I\u2019ve been kidnapped and I\u2019ve been missing for ten years, and I\u2019m here, I\u2019m free now\u2026\"\n\nShe was one of the missing women! And the man who owned the house was a local man called Ariel Castro. So clearly he had something to do with her k*dnapping, right?\n\nWhen he learned this, Charles was more shocked than anyone else. He had NO idea about any of it. He\u2019d known Ariel Castro for over a year, and had frequently eaten barbeque with the guy. So this was basically the last person he\u2019d have expected to do something so awful. Keep watching to find out how this tragic story ends...\n\n#truecrime #disturbing #annasolves",
