            "description": "If you lived anywhere in Texas and most likely anywhere in the U.S. in 2017, you most likely heard of one of the worst church shootings to date. A man by the name of Devin Kelley, went into his former church and killed 26 people and wounding 22 others. Dubbed, \"Texas Church Massacre\", this is a horrific tragedy. In this video, I visit the church where this took place as well as show you all a small memorial which showcases each of the victims.\n \nIf you have any suggestions for any crime locations, infamous crimes or infamous people you want me to cover, (mostly around WA state as that is where I live but any state is fine) send me a message on facebook or instagram @ infamous crime locations. \n\nThank you for checking out my channel. If you enjoy crime related content and especially seeing me go to where these crimes happen, definitely subscribe and hit the bell to get notified of every new video. And as always, my name is Harmin and thank you for watching. \n\n#sutherlandspringsmassacre #visitingcrimescenes #texaschurchshooting",
