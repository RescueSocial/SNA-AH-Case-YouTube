ET's Nischelle Turner spoke to Cooper at the premiere of the Guillermo del Toro-directed crime thriller, where he shared how special it is to have his ex and the mother of his child, Irina Shayk, with him on his big night.\n\n\"It's very special,\" Cooper told ET of having Shayk's support as he celebrates the film's release.\n\nThe supermodel turned heads in a sexy all-black suit number, and while she didn't pose with Cooper on the red carpet, she did stop to take several photos with model friend Stella Maxwell. Shayk shared pics from the evening to Instagram and implied it was a date night.\n\n\"D nite of #nightmarealley \ud83d\udda4in my @burberry @riccardotisci17 \ud83d\udda4\ud83d\udc8b,\" she captioned a few pics.\n\nShayk's appearance at the premiere comes as no surprise after a source told ET last month, following a New York City sighting of the pair, that the two are getting along great.\n\nThe 35-year-old supermodel and the 46-year-old actor dated for four years before splitting in 2019. They share their 4-year-old daughter, Lea, with our source adding that the two are on the same page when it comes to raising the little one.\n\n\"Irina and Bradley have been in a really great groove in regards to co-parenting for a while,\" the source said. \"They both love Lea so much and want to be the best parents possible. A lot of Irina and Bradley's interactions and hangouts surround Lea and her schedule, but they also get together on their own.\"\n\nIn his new movie, the A Star Is Born actor-director plays Stanton Carlisle, a Mississippi man down-on-his-luck, when he meets a clairvoyant and her mentalist husband at a traveling carnival, who begin to turn things around for him.\n\nThe film not only had Cooper talking with a southern drawl, but taking on a new look, too, which included a 1940s style thick mustache, all worth it for the chance to work with Nightmare Alley's star-studded cast, which includes Cate Blanchett, Rooney Mara, Willem Dafoe and more.\n\nBradley Cooper attends 'Nightmare Alley' premiere at Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center on Dec. 1, 2021 in New York City.
