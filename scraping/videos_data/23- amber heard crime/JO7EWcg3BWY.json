Ye Wen (October 14, 1893-December 1, 1972) was a Chinese martial artist, representative of the Wing Chun style.\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, in Hong Kong, Yip Man was the first to start open teaching of kung fu Wing Chun, which until then remained a clan-based teaching. In Europe and America, he is also known as the teacher of Bruce Lee, who introduced the Western world to Chinese martial arts.\nIt is known that Ip Man modified and developed the technical arsenal of Wing Chun all his life, but his personal contribution is difficult to determine-primarily because many of his students continued to modify the technique, as a result, it is almost impossible to find a \"pure\" Wing Chun Yip Man; moreover, it is impossible to find a sample of kung fu of his teachers for comparison. In general, Yip Man still taught traditional Wing Chun and never claimed to create his own style.\n\nAmber Laura Heard (born April 22, 1986) is an American film and television actress. After a series of small roles in film and television, Heard had her first starring role in the horror film All the Boys Love Mandy Lane (2006). She first gained mainstream recognition for supporting roles in the action film Never Back Down (2008) and the comedy Pineapple Express (2008). In the following years, she appeared in films such as The Joneses (2009), The Ward (2010), The Rum Diary (2011), Drive Angry (2011), Machete Kills (2013) and Magic Mike XXL (2015).\n\nIn 2017, Heard joined the DC Extended Universe to play Atlantean queen Mera in superhero films Justice League (2017), Aquaman (2018), and Zack Snyder's Justice League (2021). In addition to acting, Heard has been a global spokesperson for the cosmetics giant L'Or\u00e9al Paris since 2018. She also engages in human rights activism.\n\nHeard was married to actor Johnny Depp from 2015 to 2017. Their divorce drew significant media attention as she alleged that he had been abusive through most of their relationship. He then sued her for defamation in 2019 after Heard wrote an op-ed discussing being a public victim of domestic violence. He also sued the publishers of The Sun in a related libel suit in England. In 2020, the High Court of Justice of England and Wales ruled that Depp had lost his libel case and that the majority of Heard's allegations had been proven to a civil standard",

Their divorce drew significant media attention as she alleged that he had been abusive through most of their relationship. He then sued her for defamation in 2019 after Heard wrote an op-ed discussing being a public victim of domestic violence. He also sued the publishers of The Sun in a related libel suit in England. In 2020, the High Court of Justice of England and Wales ruled that Depp had lost his libel case and that the majority of Heard's allegations had been proven to a civil standard"
