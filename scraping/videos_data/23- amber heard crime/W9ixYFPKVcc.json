            "description": "So since Dc is making a \"Birds Of Prey\" movie, with completely new origins for the team, I thought of doing the same with a slightly different roster. More specifically my team consists of Black Canary (Black Canary), Lady Blackhawk (Scarlet Johansson), Hawk (Alan Ritchson) and Dove (Minka Kelly). I would have included Oracle/Batgirl, but I could not find an actress who could play her. The villain is Slade Wilson a.k.a. Deathstroke (Manu Bennet). As for the origins, Black Canary is still Diana Lance but in this origin she has yet to discover her powers and she is also a deadly assassin, whose only goal is to find Deathstroke and kill him. Lady Blackhawk is a woman who comes from the past (through time-travelling) and by the time we meet her she has already formed a life and found her true love (this takes place 3 years ago). But unfortunately it is revealed that her husband is an agent of Slade and Diana will soon kill him, leaving Blackhawk alone, seeking revenge from the Black Canary. 3 years after this event happens Lady Blackhawk still searches for her husband's killer and Dianna for Wilson. Hawk and Dove are from the \"Titans\" universe, where they have already defeated Trigon and learned that a new crime boss has appeared (Slade). Finally, Deathstroke's story (I used Manu as the actor because we don't have enough footage of the DCEU one), continues from the post credit scene of \"Justice League\", trying to recruit more members for his Legion Of Doom. So, basically, by the end of the movie the team will have been formed, Dianna will have become a hero and Slade will have achieved his goal. My next trailer will be a Justice League/Birds Of Prey movie, a continuation of this one. Hope you enjoy!\n\nCredits below:\n\nTrack: So Say We All\nComposer: Harry Lightfoot\nAlbum: VOLTURNUS (2018)\n\n\u25aaOriginal Owners (\u00a9)\u25b6Audiomachine",
