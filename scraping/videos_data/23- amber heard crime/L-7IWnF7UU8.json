            "description": "Top 5 Celebrities Who Tried To Warn Us About Amber Heard\n______________________________________________\nFor more videos subscribe : https://bit.ly/2zoPgqj\n______________________________________________\nIt has been weeks since Johnny Depp has lost his libel trial against 'The Sun' which went on to accuse Depp on the grounds of being a 'wife-beater'. This not only tormented his character but also got him cancelled from a lot of upcoming projects. Needless to say, we feel really sorry for Depp. However, it is not only Johnny Depp who tried to warn us about Amber Heard. \n\nIn this video, we are going to be taking a look at 5 celebrities who tried to warn us about Amber Heard. \n\n5. Wynona Ryder: \nWell, we knew she'd be on this list. Wynona very famously dated Johnny Depp from 1989-1993. While the couple had a sweet yet messy relationship, they didn't really last long together due to the incompatibility between them. However, their friendship has stood the test of time and they have always went on to support each other. So when the situation with Amber Heard actually popped up, Wynona didn't hesitate to defend Johnny Depp by saying that her personal experience with Johnny Depp has been really wonderful. He has always been kind and helpful and hasn't showed any signs of violent behavior. \n\n4. Sia: \nSia's statements on support Johnny Depp have been the most recent we have seen any celebrity voice up for Depp's Defense. However, the singer surprised everyone when she voiced her support for Johnny Depp unexpectedly on Twitter. She started off by posting a video which included the leaked audio of Amber Heard talking about how she had lost it on Johnny in the past and then she went on to make this confession which made things even more clearer. Sia tweeted that although she doesn't like Depp for sporting a lot of unnecessary jewelry, it is very much clear that Depp has been a victim here and needs to be supported during tough times. But sia wasn't even done when she called out Heard's ex-boyfriend Elon Musk accusing him of supporting Amber Heard and that all of them shouldn't stay silent. \n\n3. Alysson Paradis: \nParadis family has clearly been a fan of Johnny Depp for a long time and it is quite evident that Alysson Paradis did not shy away from voicing her support in favor of Johnny Depp. She went on to show her support in the form of an Instagram post which showcased the two together with the caption stating Depp would always have a family in the name of Paradis' and that Depp's one of the funniest and comical guys one can ever meet. So if Depp's in-laws are actually going this far to support him, something about Amber Heard is definitely not right. \n\n2. Lily Rose Depp: \nLily Rose Depp did not stray even an inch when it came to protecting her father against the claims that had been made against him. She first posted a screenshot of an article from People which showed that LAPD had went to the couple's place however the police did not really find any concrete evidence of any crime going on. Then, she also went on to post a picture of her and her dad when she was just a baby captioning the photo by voicing her support for her father and that he's the best father and that she's very lucky to have him. \n\n1. Laura Divenere: \nWhile being a former friend of Amber Heard, Laura actually did the right thing by voicing her statement against Amber Heard in the court of law stating that she didn't see Heard's bruises after an alleged fight between Heard and Depp on May 21st, 2016. Even though Amber Heard tried to release a recording making the accusation false, Depp's lawyers included an E-Mail after the recording stating that Divenere had never seen bruises on Heard's body. \n\n\nThank you for watching.
