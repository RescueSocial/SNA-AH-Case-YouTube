Does this mean they found something? \n\nFrom what I learned about the Gabby Petito case when they found Brian Laundrie\u2019s remains, a professional had said that they absolutely will not bring this van out here unless human remains were found & same goes for the tent I believe, don\u2019t quote me on this.\n\nJust like the Brian Laundrie case, they set up a white tent & a crime lab van of some kind came out, I can\u2019t confirm if it is the same kind, so please do not quote me on this. \n\nI am not saying or confirming that they have found her, or something to do with Summer Wells case that is very crucial to her & her case, but, I am saying that from what I heard in this video, they do have a crime lab van out there & a white tent.\n\nI don\u2019t know what for, so, go to Crack Cases channel, & subscribe to their channel to get all of the updates about this, such as Ronnie Lawson going to make a statement soon, as I also heard from Crackin Cases. \n\nWATCH THIS FULL VIDEO HERE: https://youtu.be/8KVkGRaV8js\n\n*Video credits go to \u201cCrack Cases\u201d.\n\nSubscribe to their channel here: https://youtube.com/c/Crackin%E2%80%99Cases",
