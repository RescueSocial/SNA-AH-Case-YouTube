            "description": "Jennifer Lawrence is breaking her silence on the nude photo hack, saying that the incident was not a \"scandal,\" but a \"sex crime.\"\n\nThe 24-year-old actress appears on the November 2014 cover of Vanity Fair. Contributing editor Sam Kashner first met with the Oscar-winner on Aug. 13, but after nude photos were stolen from her iCloud and leaked online on Aug. 31, Kashner reached out again in hopes of giving the actress \u201ca chance to have the last word.\u201d\n\nAnd she had a lot to say.\n\n\u201cJust because I\u2019m a public figure, just because I\u2019m an actress, does not mean that I asked for this,\u201d she told Vanity Fair. \u201cIt does not mean that it comes with the territory. It\u2019s my body, and it should be my choice, and the fact that it is not my choice is absolutely disgusting. I can\u2019t believe that we even live in that kind of world.\"\n\nAfter the leak -- which claimed numerous other female celebrity victims like Kate Upton, Amber Heard, Kim Kardashian, Gabrielle Union and Victoria Justice -- Lawrence attempted to write a statement or an apology, but stopped. \"I don\u2019t have anything to say I\u2019m sorry for,\" she told Vanity Fair. \"I was in a loving, healthy, great relationship for four years. It was long distance, and either your boyfriend is going to look at porn or he\u2019s going to look at you.\u201d\n\nShe was disgusted by the gross violation:\n\nJennifer Lawrence breaks silence on nude photo leak 'It is a sexual violation. It\u2019s disgusting' Vanity Fair \n\nJennifer Lawrence has addressed the naked pictures of her that were leaked via a large-scale hacking in August. The actress was one of the first of over 100 celebrities to have been targeted in the scandal. Numerous photographs of Lawrence were distributed online, in what her publicist at the time called \"a flagrant violation of privacy\", adding that \"the authorities have been contacted and will prosecute anyone who posts the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.\"\n\n\"I was just so afraid. I didn't know how this would affect my career,\" she told Vanity Fair. \"Just because I'm a public figure, just because I'm an actress, does not mean that I asked for this. It does not mean that it comes with the territory. It's my body, and it should be my choice, and the fact that it is not my choice is absolutely disgusting. I can't believe that we even live in that kind of world.\" The 24 year old decided not to release a statement over the incident because \"every single thing that I tried to write made me cry or get angry. I started to write an apology, but I don't have anything to say I'm sorry for. I was in a loving, healthy, great relationship for four years. It was long distance, and either your boyfriend is going to look at porn or he's going to look at you.\"\n\nThe still anonymous hackers published the images via online forum 4Chan. The FBI and Apple are both conducting investigations into the apparent widespread invasion of personal accounts thought to be connected to the iCloud service.",
