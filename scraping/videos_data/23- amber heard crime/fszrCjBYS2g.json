But before we get to the video, if you like my video, please like and leave a comment so that the YouTube algorithm can catch up on it and suggest it to more people. Let's get started.\n\nIn a conversation with Diesel on Entertainment Weekly's new podcast 'EW's BINGE: The Fast Saga', host Derek Lawrence wondered if he could wrap up the original Fast and Furious movie in ten seconds. \u201cI live my life a quarter of a mile at a time,\u201d Diesel replied, a statement his character gave Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) during one of their first encounters. \u201cI actually remember, I think, the studio a few years ago, they commented on that scene and said, 'If this scene was a complicated scene then.'\n\nAmber Heard may be busy with the DC Extended Universe hit sequel 'Aquaman 2', but it looks like there's more work going on. As it turns out, reports reveal Heard could have a place waiting for him in the cast of the `` Fast and the Furious '' franchise, all thanks to Vin Diesel. It comes after Johnny Depp supporters plan to boycott Heard's upcoming film, as Warner Bros. decided to keep her on board as Queen Mera, but her ex-husband resigned as Grindelwald from the franchise. Fantastic Beasts ''.\n\nNo matter how much Depp fans and supporters would love to hear, it seems the odds for Heard are going nowhere. `` Aquaman: Necrus '' could begin filming in the summer of 2021, but new movie offerings are already rolling out.\n\nAccording to insider Daniel Richtman, 'Fast & Furious' star Vin Diesel is looking to find a role for the 35-year-old in a future film. At this point, it is only speculation. According to some reports online, Richtman does not give further details on his advice, so nothing more can be said about his professional relationship that may be ongoing. It might also make sense for Heard to accept the offer, as jumping between different multi-billion dollar movie franchises is a good idea at the industry level.\n\nIt's also worth noting that Richtman previously claimed Heard was in talks with actress Margot Robbie for a possible role in a female spin-off of Pirates of the Caribbean. She also said she would be part of the 'Fantastic Four' as Sue Storm, also known as the Invisible Woman and possibly even as the unnamed Disney princess who could be Rapunzel.\n\nOn top of that, reports also indicate that insiders have speculated that the actress will also be part of the Expanded Universe of Star Wars, a solo Mera series on HBO Max, a sequel to 'Drive Angry'. 'with Nicolas Cage, several projects of. Netflix and an Oscar-caliber article.\n\nHeard will also be busy working on \u201cFallen Angel\u201d. According to a report in Giant Freakin Robot, Heard will be seen in the action movie which sees her survive a helicopter crash only to find out that she is involved in a larger plot. It is promoted as his solo action film.\n\nNone of these projects has even come close to being confirmed or materialized so far. And since this is only speculation at this point, we can't be sure if Diesel and the rest of the 'Fast & Furious' film franchise group will share screen space with Heard until. until more details appear.\n\nAnd that's it for today's video.
