For some people, this is chatting in online rooms with different screennames pretending to be their favorite character or someone they admire. In 2005 for a man named Thomas Montgomery it was darker than that. Thomas Montgomery was 46 years old when an 18-year-old under the screenname \u201cTallHotBlond\u201d messaged him. Instead of revealing who he truly was, Thomas pretended to be an 18-year-old marine named Tommy and the pair started their online affair. Eventually, their affair would leave someone dead and leave everyone else untangling a web of lies.",
