            "description": "This is part of of my Amber Heard vs Johnny Depp series with Leslee Powers.  In today's show we will discuss examples of blame shifting and how Amber Heard has been doing this in the latest court case. Leslee has a series where she has been covering the details of the court transcripts.  In this episode Leslee Powers from Spiritually Empowered Coaching comes back to discuss examples of Amber Heard using blame shifting to propitiate her stories.  Leslee gives us an update on the recent court ruling.  We then discuss the importance of the $7M donation that no one can find documentation on.  Duane then talks about the different types of blame shifting.  They then tackle the question if Amber really knows she did anything wrong and what happens when you back a toxic person into a corner.  Leslee talks about how people ask her, \u201chow do you know who to believe?\u201d  Duane and Leslee then discuss how these people WANT something from their targets.  Finally they wrap up with talking about the importance of watching and believing the patterns of behaviors.\n\n\u274b Leslee Powers - [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsEaTDlh3kfgl17DnaRFW2g]\n\n\ud83c\udf99 You Get To Be YOU This Time - Podcast Series\nhttps://yougettobeyou.com/duane\n\nTo call into the show\n\u260e 1-424-373-5483 or 1-424-DSD-LIVE\n\nInternational Calling use this for free calling\n\u274b https://www.callinstudio.com/show/dsdlive\n\nSign up for text notifications\n\u260e Text \"DSDLIVE\" to (844) 598-0012\n\n\u260e For one on one coaching - https://www.dadsurvivingdivorce.com/coaching/\n\n\u274b Become a channel member! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUXEHz3OECVwLz1X-SNM4lw/join\n\n\ud83d\udcd6  Table of Contents\n00:00 - Start of show\n02:03 - What is blame shifting\n03:09 - Update with the recent court ruling\n04:49 - Where did the $7m \u201cdonation\u201d go?\n11:18 - Arguing about the argument\n15:54 - Curating the \u201cstory\u201d\n18:10 - You actually said that to Mr. Depp?\n19:47 - Audience poll - experience or interest\n20:47 - Does Amber really know she did something wrong?\n23:29 - Backing a toxic person in a corner\n26:06 - The trained DV officers are lying\n32:02 - But he gets intoxicated and blacks out\n35:33 - Projecting confidence\n39:07 - How do you know who to believe?\n42:50 - How often will the abused \u201cgo after\u201d the abuser?\n45:18 - When there are no kids do abusers leave you alone?\n48:10 - Amber wanted something from Johnny\n50:24 - When the stories just don\u2019t add up\n52:29 - Minimizing the feelings\n55:35 - The patterns of behavior\n59:19 - End of show wrap-up\n\n\u26a0\ufe0fDISCLAIMER - Links used in this description are affiliate links and if used a small commission will help support this channel.
