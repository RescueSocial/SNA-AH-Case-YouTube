            "description": "Amber Heard is reportedly under investigation for perjury after THIS LAPD bodycam footage was discovered. \n\nAmber and her friends previously testified under oath that two sets of police officers saw the injuries and destruction left by Johnny Depp after they claimed he hit Amber Heard with a phone and trashed their apartment, leaving a crime scene of broken glass, cutlery, fruit bowls and other tableware everywhere and wine spilled all over the corridor outside the apartment while kicking a hole in the door of a neighbouring apartment and chasing her terrified friend. \n\nThis footage was found and handed over to Heards own legal team in early 2021 after they requested it, backing up the sworn testimony of the officers that they saw no evidence of a crime and an uninjured Heard. \n\nDoes this footage benefit Amber or Johnny? Do cameras commit perjury?
