This toxic relationship had lots of traits in it that go along with Narcissism. I of course can\u2019t diagnose anyone but I can talk about the traits. Whew, it was exhausting just hearing about their relationship . Johnny Depp will be much happier when he is done having to deal with this stuff. He can then begin to heal. These kinds of relationships take a long time to heal from. Trauma work for CPTSD I think may be needed.  I mean he had the tip of his finger cut  off! \ud83d\ude31 What do you guys see happening next? Have you ever been in a toxic relationship before?
