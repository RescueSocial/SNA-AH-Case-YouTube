We make it easier for our users to connect with like-minded people and organizations to work toward improving the social cohesion of the world. Our ultimate goal is to motivate people to be socially conscious and kind-hearted on a consistent basis, so we as a global society can close the negative gaps on issues that are holding us back from connecting to one another. We are here to give people an environment where it is easier to help others who are in need, celebrate giving back, and live more meaningful lives. We work to produce easy to use products and services that support our organization\u2019s mission of connecting the world to social good. Or technologies are built to impact people from all aspects of life. It doesn\u2019t matter whether you\u2019re a student or a business person. We strive to create friendly platforms that allow every person in the world (no matter where they are in life) the ability to impact others in a positive way. Because at the end of the day, we believe that living in a world where neighbors, strangers, companies, friends, and family all support one another in an ecosystem of good is a better world.
