            "description": "Amber Heard has been fined for making a false report to law enforcement after she accused Johnny Depp of domestic violence. Heard admitted that she will pay $1000 and donate the same sum to a local charity in California. This looks like another big setback for Amber Heard, who is also fighting allegations of financial impropriety. The court cases are still ongoing but many names from Hollywood, as well as other parts of the entertainment industry, have come forward to share their thoughts on Heard\u2019s allegations. The public will always side with justice and equality; therefore it is important that both sides are revealed. \n\n#enforcement  \n#impropriety\n#allegations \n\nI do not take any ownership of the music displayed in this video.
