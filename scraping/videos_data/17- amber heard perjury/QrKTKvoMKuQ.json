            "description": "There was a time in the early 2000s when it looked like Rob Schneider was going to be the next Adam Sandler. A fellow Saturday Night Live vet, Schneider stole scenes in a few Happy Madison comedies, particularly The Waterboy (\u201cyou can do it!\u201d) and his solo star vehicle debut, Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo, was a smash, raking in over 90 million dollars worldwide. His follow-ups, including The Animal, Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo, The Benchwarmers and The Hot Chick (where he memorably switched bodies with Rachel McAdams), were critically savaged but still made money. Yet, the budgets got smaller. So he gradually started making his way to the DTV market while still appearing in the occasional Sandler flick, usually under heavy makeup and often portraying another ethnicity. \n\nSo what happened? Did Schneider\u2019s politics or style of comedy relegate him to a smaller audience? We take a look at his career in this episode of WTF Happened to this Celebrity, which shows that perhaps the notion of Schneider\u2019s decline is overblown, as the guy is still incredibly busy and undoubtedly a beloved MVP of Adam Sandler\u2019s Happy Madison ensemble.\nWTF Happened to this Celebrity is written by Brad Hamerly and Taylor James Johnson. Taylor James Johnson is also the editor, narrator and producer! \n\nDon\u2019t forget to let us know your thoughts on Rob Schneider in the comments!\n\nFor more MOVIE NEWS, visit: http://www.joblo.com\n\nSUBSCRIBE for more of all the LATEST JoBlo Videos here: https://goo.gl/R9U81J\n\nJOBLO YOUTUBE NETWORK:\n\u25ba MOVIE TRAILERS: https://bit.ly/3rVdsq8\n\u25ba MOVIE CLIPS: https://bit.ly/3k355GA\n\u25ba STREAMING/TV TRAILERS: https://bit.ly/37ifDMz\n\u25ba HORROR TRAILERS: https://bit.ly/3qsPxyc\n\u25ba ANIMATED VIDEOS: https://bit.ly/3pqYiaJ\n\u25ba SUPERHEROES: https://bit.ly/37nXgGd\n\u25ba JOBLO VIDEOS: https://bit.ly/2Zp4WDG\n\u25ba JOBLO HORROR VIDEOS: https://bit.ly/3bd7Voj\n\u25ba CELEBRITY INTERVIEWS: https://bit.ly/3dk7ISN\n\u25ba PARANORMAL NETWORK: https://bit.ly/2NvY58P\n\nSUPPORT OUR CHANNEL - PURCHASE VIA OUR LINKS BELOW:\n\u25ba AMAZON BEST SELLING MOVIES: https://amzn.to/3jWER8t\n\u25ba MOST POPULAR POSTERS: https://bit.ly/3s4sTfJ\n\nJOBLO MOVIE NEWS AND REVIEWS:\n\u25ba http://www.joblo.com/\n\nJOBLO ON SOCIAL MEDIA:\n\u25ba JOBLO MOVIE NEWS (FACEBOOK): https://bit.ly/3bbIFPf\n\u25ba JOBLO MOVIE TRAILERS (FACEBOOK): https://bit.ly/3dl9NxS\n\u25ba HORROR MOVIE TRAILERS (FACEBOOK): https://bit.ly/3jTWZzX\n\u25ba ARROW IN THE HEAD HORROR NEWS (FACEBOOK): https://bit.ly/3aqQ2D8\n\n#RobSchneider #WTFHappenedToThisCelebrity #AdamSandler",
