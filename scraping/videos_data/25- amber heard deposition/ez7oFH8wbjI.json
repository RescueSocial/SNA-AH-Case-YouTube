            "description": "Jared Drake Bell, the 34-year-old actor best known for his leading role on the 2000s Nickelodeon series Drake and Josh, has been charged with a felony in Ohio over an alleged inappropriate \u201crelationship\u201d with a teenage girl.\n\nAccording to the Cuyahoga County Prosecutor\u2019s Office, the teen was 15 years old at the time of the alleged Dec. 2017 incident. She filed a report with her local police department in Canada in Oct. 2018. This report regarded an incident that allegedly happened the year before at a nightclub in Cleveland, Ohio.\n\n\u201cCanadian authorities contacted the Cleveland Division of Police who conducted a subsequent investigation,\u201d said prosecutor\u2019s office spokesman Tyler Sinclair in an email to Law&Crime. \u201cThat investigation revealed that the victim, who had established a relationship with Bell several years prior, attended his concert in December 2017. While there, Bell violated his duty of care and, in doing so, created a risk of harm to the victim. The investigation also revealed that months leading up to the concert, Bell sent the victim inappropriate social media messages.\u201d\n\nIn addition to being an actor, Bell is a musician.\n\nBell pleaded not guilty at his arraignment on Thursday. The defendant is charged with attempted endangering children (a felony), and disseminating matter harmful to juveniles (a misdemeanor).\n\nBell\u2019s attorney Ian Friedman indicated that all facts will be revealed in court, but he has no additional comment, said a statement from law firm Friedman & Nemecek.\n\nEx-girlfriend Melissa Lingafelt said last year that Bell was verbally and physically abusive.\n\nHe denied wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cAs our relationship ended \u2014 more than a decade ago \u2014 we, unfortunately, both called each other terrible names, as often happens when couples are breaking up,\u201d Bell said in a statement to People. \u201cBut that is it.\u201d\n\n#DrakeBell\n\nRead More On The Case: https://lawandcrime.com/celebrity/drake-josh-star-pleads-guilty-to-crimes-involving-teen-girl-immediately-follows-conviction-with-instagram-concert/",
