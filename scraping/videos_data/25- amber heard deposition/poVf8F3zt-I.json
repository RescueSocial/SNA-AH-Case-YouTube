            "description": "Celebrities Speaking on How The Media Is Protecting Amber Heard \nJohnny Depp\u2019s career has faced some major blows due to his legal battle with Amber Heard. Over the past couple of months he has lost some very major roles in films. Some of the roles he has lost include the role of Grindelwald in the Fantastic Beasts franchise. This particularly happened when he lost his libel case causing Warner bros to ask him to resign.\nThen, not too long after, Disney stated that they were likely to reboot the Pirates of the Caribbean movie and were not likely to ask Johnny Depp to return as Captain Jack Sparrow. These are two major roles in two major movie franchises that Johnny Depp was kicked out of in a short period of time. While all this is happening to Johnny Depp, Amber Heard seems to have escaped the consequences of her actions and people are not happy about that. Many celebrities and fans have called out the media for showing support to Amber despite the evidence that has been brought against her.
