            "title": "Reckless Driving & Delivery Case: Deposition of Jimmy John's Corporate Representative",
            "description": "When you litigate against a large company, it's not always clear who you should talk to in order to get the company's official position.  A low-level employee isn't high-ranking enough to speak for the company, and the President or CEO might not know anything about your specific case, or might be unavailable.  To handle that issue, Rule 30(b)(6) requires that, upon request, the company must choose someone to answer questions on its behalf.  Under federal law, the citation is Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(b)6), and in Georgia it's O.C.G.A. \u00a7  9-11-30(b)(6).  This deposition is of such a person, often called a \"corporate representative\" or \"30(b)6) designee.\" \n\nWe handled a reckless driving & punitive damages case against Jimmy Johns in which a delivery person (a bicyclist) crashed into our client (a pedestrian), knocking him down and breaking his arm so severely that a plate and ten screws had to be inserted.  This video shows our deposition of Jimmy John's corporate representative.\n\nWe tried the case in the State Court of Fulton County in Atlanta, Georgia.  The jury returned a verdict of $167,000 for our client.  https://butlerfirm.com/two-successful-personal-injury-verdicts-in-three-business-days/\n\nWe\u2019d love to hear what you think!  It helps our clients if people watch these depositions and leave comments, because that helps us to know what jurors will take away from the depositions, and what questions jurors will have after watching them.  So please feel free to comment with your thoughts (good or bad) and let us know what other questions you wish we\u2019d asked.  That\u2019s why we post these depositions to YouTube.",
