            "description": "House impeachment managers and President Trump\u2019s lawyers have concluded their opening arguments in the Senate. The impeachment trial moves into the question period for both sides on Jan. 29, when senators submit questions in writing to Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. The chief justice will read questions out loud, alternating between the majority and minority for up to eight hours. \n\nTrump was impeached by the House of Representatives in December for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. Impeachment does not mean that the president has been removed from office. In the next phase, the Senate must hold a trial to make that determination. A Senate impeachment trial has happened only two other times in American history and once in the modern era. At the center of the Democrats\u2019 case is that Trump sought to withhold military assistance and an Oval Office meeting until Ukraine announced investigations into former vice president Joe Biden and his son.\n\nWatch the debate on Jan. 21 on the rules of the trial: https://youtu.be/yz_J8sfZVEE.\nWatch the first day of opening arguments on Jan. 22: https://youtu.be/ttkY4rQqBPw\nWatch the second day of opening arguments on Jan. 23: https://youtu.be/1PcqupKuKro\nWatch the third day of opening arguments on Jan. 24: https://youtu.be/WpmUGeWzuOg\nWatch the first day of Trump\u2019s legal team\u2019s defense on Jan. 25: https://youtu.be/WpmUGeWzuOg\nWatch the second day of Trump\u2019s legal team\u2019s defense on Jan. 27: https://youtu.be/uyp7UvBPsjc \nWatch the third day of Trump\u2019s legal team\u2019s defense on Jan. 28: https://youtu.be/u8Wf_9xDiSo\n\n#trumpimpeachmenttrial Read more: https://wapo.st/37D00xA.
