She was murdered at her home on February 22, 2014.  First he hit her in the head and broke her skull, then as she was unconscious or dying, he finished off the job by putting her in the cold swimming pool - as this would also make it difficult to determine the time of death (remember, he is a doctor).  This deposition was limited in scope.  \nMr. Cummings and Mr. Taylor, his criminal defense attorneys, limited the questions I could ask - and instructed him to plead the fifth to anything close to the murder.  Still a worthy watch!\nI took this deposition while representing a homeowner's association in a wrongful death suit filed by the personal representative of the estate of Samira Frasch.",
