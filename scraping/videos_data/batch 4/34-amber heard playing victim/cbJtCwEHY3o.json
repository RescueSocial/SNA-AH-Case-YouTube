            "description": "Linda Roberts and Mary-Beth Tomaselli were charged with the first-degree murder of their 85-year-old father, who authorities thought died of natural causes in 2015. The sisters \u2013 who escaped justice for four years \u2013 were caught after Roberts confessed in 2019 to a man she\u2019d had a sexual relationship with. Tomaselli slept with the same man!\n\nThe man, who has remained anonymous, recorded a conversation he had with Linda Roberts in which she confessed to killing her father with her sister. He recorded the confession on his phone and brought it to the local sheriff\u2019s office. The two sisters, Linda Roberts, 61, and Mary-Beth Tomaselli, 63, pled guilty to the second-degree murder of their father, Anthony Tomaselli, in 2015.\n\nThe unnamed man recently had an interview with People, comparing the incident with his ex-lovers to the play Arsenic and Old Lace. He referenced the comedic play as he reflected on the sisters\u2019 plot, in which they killed their father and framed it on natural causes. \u201cWho would suspect two old ladies killed their father?\u201d he joked to the outlet.\n\nThe unnamed man and Robert\u2019s confession, were able to piece together the full story. According to Detective Michael Bailey, Anthony Tomaselli, 85, was killed because he wouldn\u2019t move into an assisted living facility in his old age.\n\nBoth Linda Roberts and Mary-Beth Tomaselli noticed that their father\u2019s health and mental wellbeing were going downhill. After Anthony Tomaselli\u2019s live-in girlfriend passed, his state took a turn for the worse, but he still wouldn\u2019t budge.\n\nThat\u2019s when Roberts and Tomaselli took a page out of Joseph Kesselring\u2019s 1939 play, Arsenic and Old Lace, which tells the story of elderly sisters who murder old men in their home. According to reports, the sisters spiked their father\u2019s nightly cocktail with a lethal dose of sleeping pills. The attempted poison didn\u2019t do the trick, though, it only made their father sleepy.\n\nTo finish the job, the women placed a pillow over his head in an attempt to asphyxiate him. Then, Linda Roberts insisted that they \u201cget a washcloth and put it in his mouth,\u201d according to Mary-Beth Tomaselli. \u201cWe had to finish what we had started.\u201d\n\nThe next morning, the women played it off as though their father died of natural causes. They called 911 and reported that their father wasn\u2019t waking up, but that they had attempted CPR to no avail. Police did not suspect the elderly women, especially since Anthony Tomaselli had a long history of medical issues. The body was quickly cremated and the case was closed. Or so they thought.\n\n\u201cThere were no red flags,\u201d according to Detective Michael Bailey. \u201cNobody suspected anything.\u201d\n\nThen, a new lover, who had been in bed with both sisters, learned the truth. Linda Roberts came clean to him during a nightly rant. \u201cI can\u2019t take it anymore \u2014 I killed my father,\u201d she told him. \u201cWell, we did. We did it together.\u201d\n\nThe man recorded the confession on his phone and in 2019 both Roberts and her sister were arrested and charged with first-degree murder. Without the confession, however, the sisters likely would have gotten away with murder.\n\n\ud83d\udd35Hidden Camera - Woman Confesses to Euthanizing Her Elderly Father - https://youtu.be/eotXkCGfQ-U\n\n\ud83d\udd35Sisters Euthanize Their Elderly Father | Linda Roberts | Police Interrogation - https://youtu.be/cbJtCwEHY3o\n\n\ud83d\udd35Sisters Euthanized Their Elderly Father | Mary Beth | Police Interrogation - https://youtu.be/ob2IjnNi5rw\n\n\ud83d\udd35Ex-Boyfriend Who Slept W/ Both Sisters Police Interrogation - https://youtu.be/2sYFJvAVQK8\n\n\ud83d\udd35Another Secret Recording of Linda Roberts Tape - https://youtu.be/qXZLbUqTswY\n\n\ud83d\udd35Lauren Johnson | Mary-Beth\u2019s Daughter | Police Interview - https://youtu.be/Dvk7QF3pSR4\n\n\ud83d\udd35Doctor that Worked with Linda Roberts for 30+ Years | Police Interrogation - https://youtu.be/fUIwWP1DBvc\n\n\nJoin this channel to get access to Members-Only Videos and more:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFtml_GUKFWoYOV_B4xP1qw/join\n\nLike and Subscribe \ud83d\udd35BlueDot Court and Trials - \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLrH0PU-bK34PR4c5OTFGlQ\n\nMembers-Only Videos are located on the Membership Tab\n\n#BlueDotCrime #TrueCrime",
