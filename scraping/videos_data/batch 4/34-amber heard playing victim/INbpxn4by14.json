            "description": "Let\u2019s face it. Divorces are not only hard for the people involved, but are also messy, time consuming, and are pretty darn expensive. Especially if the divorcees are both huge people, there will be tons of dollars involved. But of all the messy divorces in the history of the entertainment industry, there will surely always be a couple that would dominate the list. From the scandalous split of Real Housewives of Beverly Hills cast Erika Jayne and her lawyer husband Tom Gerardi, to the heartbreaking separations of all time couple favorite Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, down to big industry names like Yolanda Hadid and David Foster, celebrity divorces are usually messy. And more often than not, they take up headlines for weeks. However, if there are two big names dominating the world of the ugliest divorces in Hollywood today, there might be no one else that may top off Johnny Depp and Amber Heard\u2019s divorce, which consequences are still being faced in an ongoing lawsuit up to this day. So of all these chaotic celebrity divorces, where do you think Amber Heard and Johnny Depp\u2019s situation fall down? Is their situation really topsy turvy enough to top the worst couples who got divorced? Let\u2019s find the answer to that in this video. But before anything else, make sure first to hit that subscribe button and smash that notification bell for more updates on Johnny Depp and Amber Heard\u2019s lawsuit case, and some other divorces that are dominating the internet today. Now, let\u2019s dig in!\n\nFirst, to be able to determine if Johnny and Amber\u2019s messy marriage and divorce really does qualify to top this roster of the ugliest Hollywood divorces, let\u2019s go back to the very beginning. Johnny Depp has been in the height of his career in the industry for many, many years now. This helped Johnny begin his acting career, landing more minor roles and then major ones. He also played a few roles with Helena Bonham Carter in many Tim Burton films such as Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Alice in Wonderland and Alice Through the Looking Glass, Corpse Bride, Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, and Dark Shadows. One of the most widely-known appearances of Johnny Depp that perhaps brought him the largest commercial and critical success was the Disney media franchise \u201cPirates of the Caribbean\u201d series, where he landed and reprised his lead role for all five movies that ran from 2003 to 2017.\n\nAmber Heard, on the other hand, started her acting career in 2003, first by appearing in two music videos, and then later on landing small supporting roles in three various television series. This then later on elevated her to more film and television roles, both supporting and lead actress. Her latest film that hit commercial success was the 2018 DC movie \u201cAquaman\u201d, where she co-starred alongside Jason Momoa as Mera, the Atlantean Queen. Johnny and Amber first ignited a spark between them when they starred together in the 2011 comedy-drama film, The Rum Diary. The on-screen love story between the two has quickly travelled to real life.\n\nIn 2021, the 50 million dollar lawsuit has progressed in court, and there has been evidence that are springing out here and there that are helpful to the case of the former couple, including the recorded phone call where Despite all the evidence, since the lawsuit has not yet reached its final stage, Johnny is still currently enduring the blow of this predicament to his career, as it was also announced by Disney that Depp was relieved of his role as Jack Sparrow, one of his most famous roles in history.\n\nAs Amber Heard\u2019s new movie, Aquaman 2, is about to be released by next year under the same production company that fired Johnny, the whole world of the internet is outraged. Because of this, the former couple\u2019s divorce that happened in 2016 and has been finalized in 2017 still remains to be a hot topic during these days. Every now and then, new information and updates are surfacing about the couple, new evidences circulate as well, so it\u2019s a little impossible for them not to hit the headlines all the time. In fact, Amber Heard even dropped some huge news just a couple of months ago.\n\nThat\u2019s all for today, we hope you enjoyed that video, and if you agree that Johnny and Amber\u2019s divorce counts as the worst, hit that like and subscribe button and smash that notification bell for more videos like this. \n\nRelated videos:\nAquaman 2 is DONE as EVEN THE MEDIA BLASTS Warner and Heard?!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPP3Zg7O0Q4\n\nHUGE Warner PANIC as Aquaman 2 FLOPS!
