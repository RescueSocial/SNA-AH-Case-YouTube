            "description": "became a \u201cMonster\u201d on drink and drugs, then beat, strangled and tormented his then-wife Amber Heard, she alleges in new court papers. \u00a0The actress, who was married to Hollywood star for just over a year until she filed for divorce in May 2016, claims in horrific detail that Depp repeatedly hit her, pulled out her hair, choked and nearly suffocated. \u00a0The allegations are made in a Virginia court filing in response to his \u00a338 million defamation lawsuit against her. \u00a0Depp\u2019s lawsuit relates to a 2018 piece written by Heard for the Washington Post in which she describes being the victim of domestic abuse but does not mention him in the article.   \u00a0His lawsuit claims she insinuates he was the abuser and that Heard\u2019s allegations are a \u201choax.\u201d \u00a0Heard, 32, has now responded by detailing numerous alleged incidents with Depp, 55, in court papers. \u00a0She states she began dating the actor in early 2012, \u201cAbout a year into our relationship, I began to witness Johnny abusing drugs and alcohol\u2026 On some occasions, when Johnny simultaneously used both illegal narcotics and prescription medications I have had to get him medical attention. \u00a0\"Whenever he was using, I worried for both of us. He would become a totally different person, often delusional and violent. \u00a0\u201cWe called that version of Johnny, \u2018the Monster\u2019.   \u00a0\u201cJohnny often would not remember his delusional and violent conduct after he came out of his drunk or medicated states. \u00a0\"Because I loved Johnny, I had believed his multiple promises that he could and would get better. I was wrong.\u201d \u00a0On the morning they boarded a private jet to fly from Boston to LA in May 2014, Heard claims Depp appeared to be already drunk and was clutching a bottle of Champagne. \u00a0\u201cOn the flight, Johnny ordered the flight attendants to give him an oxygen tank, and drank heavily. Johnny\u2019s handlers told me that he was upset that I was filming a movie with a romantic scene with James Franco the day before.   \u00a0\"Soon, Johnny began to throw objects at me. Instead of reacting to his behaviour, I simply moved seats. That didn\u2019t stop him. \u00a0\"He provocatively pushed a chair at me as I walked by, yelled at me, and taunted me by yelling out the name \u2018James Franco.\u2019 \u00a0\u201cAt some point, I stood up, and Johnny kicked me in the back, causing me to fall over. Johnny threw his boot at me while I was on the ground. Johnny continued to scream obscenities until he went into the plane bathroom and passed out locked in the bathroom for the remainder of the flight.\u201d \u00a0Depp allegedly apologised in a later text message, writing, \u201cOnce again, I find myself in a place of shame and regret. Of course, I am sorry. I really don\u2019t know why or what happened. But I will never do it again.\u201d   \u00a0 \u00a0His message continued, \u201cMy illness somehow crept up and grabbed me \u2026 I must get better . . . Again, I am so sorry, so sorry. \u2026 I love you and I feel so bad for letting you down.\u201d \u00a0Heard says Depp\u2019s assistant Stephen Deuters also messaged her, saying Johnny \u201cwas appalled.
