            "description": "january 2011\r\n\r\nToday Sheriff Royce Toney was supposed to speak out about the divorce suit where his name appears in\u2014during a scheduled deposition.\r\n\r\nBut Sheriff Toney stood up the divorce attorney for the other side by not showing up to the deposition\u2014now attorney Laurie Burkett slapped Sheriff Toney with a rule of contempt and other penalties, according to court documents obtained by NBC 10.\r\n\r\nBack in early December, businessman Larry Culp alleged that his wife, Laurie, and Sheriff Royce Toney had a secret sexual affair that lasted two years, according to a divorce petition.\r\n\r\nOn Jan. 21, Royce Toney was scheduled for a deposition at attorney Laurie Burkett's law office in Monroe, but he was a no-show.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, an attorney asked Sheriff Toney to bring bills, photos, and videotapes, which would support allegations that the affair happened in a variety of places, including the sheriff's personal office, the Rifle Range, and the sheriff's office's training facility.\r\n\r\nRoyce Toney's attorney, Brian Crawford, told NBC 10 that the sheriff didn't appear at the deposition because a judge hasn't ruled on previous motions and protective orders related to the case.\r\n\r\nOn January 7, the date both sides were scheduled to a hearing to determine whether the deposition would occur in the first place. But the sheriff's attorney says it had to be postponed because Laurie Burkett was sick.\r\n\r\nCrawford says Sheriff Toney would comply with a subpoena, as long as a judge determines there is a legal basis for the sheriff to testify.\r\n\r\nIn the rule of contempt attorney Laurie Burkett filed today, it states, \"It is clear that Royce Toney believes he can do whatever he wants in defiance of the court's orders.\"\r\n\r\nBurkett is asking that Sheriff Toney be found in contempt, and to reimburse Larry Culp for attorney's fees, and costs for violating the subpoena.\r\n\r\nBurkett is also asking that Royce Toney appear in court in front of a judge Feb. 15, to show why he shouldn't be found in contempt for disobeying a court order.\r\n\r\nOuachita Parish Sheriff's Deputy Scott Smith is also ordered to appear in Burkett's office to testify Jan. 28 next week.\r\n\r\nhttp://myarklamiss.com/fulltext?nxd_id=80296",
