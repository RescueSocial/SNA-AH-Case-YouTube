The 56 years old actor may be hot property in Hollywood now, but he hasn\u2019t always been so highly regarded. Many years of offbeat film choices earned him a reputation as an outsider and it wasn\u2019t until Pirates of the Caribbean came along that he really became a superstar. As a performer, Johnny Depp is unafraid to go the extra mile. He\u2019s always been willing to take on the characters that nobody else would dare. It\u2019s a quality that has earned him the respect of his peers and, even today, he remains a towering presence on screen.\n\n____________________________________________\n\nMusic in this video :  On The Way by Ian Post",
