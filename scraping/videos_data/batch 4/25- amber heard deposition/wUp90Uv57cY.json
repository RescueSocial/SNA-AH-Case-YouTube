Heard has used whatever she COULD to come off as the victim. Johnny Depp was immediately shut out from the world, and continues to be portrayed in a negative light, in the media. Fortunately for Depp, many people are able to see what the truth is, regardless. The issue for others like Marilyn Manson, if they are innocent, is that they are often declared GUILTY without question. I hope that one day we can stop CONVICTING people without question, right away. That is NOT to say some people ARE guilty, but we should research and find out.",
