            "description": "Clip # 3  The Katherine Sarah Morris Death Investigation - gone wrong.   \n\nIf you don't get the significance - this video was made in 2013. PROOF that for 6 years several Anne Arundel County police officers would lie to the Morris family and the public about why there are missing pieces of the surveillance footage of the death scene of Kathy Morris. But why? Please share this and stay tuned for more!\n\nA mother becomes private investigator and civil rights advocate following the mishandling of her daughters death investigation. The night Katherine dies her car was under the auspices of four surveillance camera's in a busy well traveled mall parking lot on a Saturday night, from approx 6 p.m. on May 5, 2012 to about 8 a.m. May 6, 2012 . From the night of May 5, 2012 the family is only given the footage from the camera that is the farthest away from the car. The mother views the footage she is given and finds that it appears to have been tampered with. When questioned in 2012 the police will claim the missing footage is because the footage would not play because of system incompatibilities.  Then for five additional years (from 2013 to 2018) they will tell the family and the public (including the FBI) that cameras were motion sensitive so there was no footage because there was no movement in the parking lot where Katherine's body is found.  Then in October of 2018 the Chief of Police Timothy Altomare states the missing video was deleted but offers no further explanation.  Where does the truth start and where does it end?  This video has been edited for time and is the deposition of Chief Gary Lyle a 27 year veteran of the Anne Arundel County Police Department with a background in special investigations. He is being deposed under oath by the mother of the victim, Marguerite Morris who is becoming a well known advocate calling for greater police accountability and transparency.  The full length unedited version is available on youtube.  So what happened out there and when will someone on the police force speak up?  Do all ares concerning black lives matter?  Recently the Chief of Police Altomare is caught on camera during a public hearing appearing to wink and smile at the States Attorney as the Rev. Marguerite Morris comes forward to ask a question as if her efforts are an inside joke.  Whats that about?  During this same public hearing Chief Altomare says any officer found to be untruthful will be without a job.  Really?  Do black lives really matter in Anne Arundel County Maryland? No call for accountability - there will be no change.  I know I am not alone.  Got a story email forkathyssake@gmail.com  Want to help?  Visit forkathyssake.com and donate.",
