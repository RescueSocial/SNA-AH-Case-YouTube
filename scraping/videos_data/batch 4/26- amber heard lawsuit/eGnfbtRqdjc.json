The judge said Depp put Heard \u201cin fear of her life\u201d during what she described as a \u201cthree-day hostage situation\u201d in Australia in March 2015.\nDepp\u2019s barrister, David Sherborne, has asked the appeal court to \u201cset aside the judgment and order a new trial\u201d if permission to appeal against Nicol\u2019s judgment is given. In documents filed with the appeal court on Thursday, Depp\u2019s lawyers claimed Nicol\u2019s ruling was \u201cmanifestly unsafe\u201d.\nDepp\u2019s legal team claim Nicol \u201cfailed to undertake any, or an adequate analysis, of Ms Heard\u2019s shifting account, despite the importance of consistency as a consideration of a witness\u2019s testimony\u201d.\nSherborne, said Nicol \u201cconcluded that the appellant was guilty of serious physical assaults without taking account of or even acknowledging that Ms Heard had been untruthful in her evidence, without testing her account against the documentary evidence and the evidence of other witnesses, and without making any findings that he disbelieved those witnesses\u201d.\nThe barrister also argued: \u201cThe conclusion which flows from an overall assessment of the judgment is that (Mr Justice Nicol) decided to find for the \u2018victim\u2019 but failed to provide the necessary analysis to explain or justify that conclusion.\n\u201cAlso he excluded relevant evidence from his consideration, ignored or dismissed as irrelevant matters that substantially undermined Ms Heard, made findings unsupported by the evidence, and failed to assess whether her allegations could withstand proper scrutiny",
