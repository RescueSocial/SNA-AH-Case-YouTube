We were going to play in the hot tub and make an obstacle course for the whole family but while dad was getting ready the TV turned on and my mom and I saw that aliens were attacking Pirate Island!! So mom and I sprung into action and went to go take care of it and we left dad and note saying we needed to get some supplies!! Dad then said that he would film a video of him setting up the hot tub and he would wait until we got home!! When he opened up the hot tub he found a surprise!! A mermaid named Melody!! She swam up from the sewer and found herself stuck in our hot tub! While my dad was talking to her he found out that she was 5 like me! He wanted to help her get back home so he gathered her up and took her inside to feed her! My dad gave her some human chips and that turned her into a human!! My dad didn't know about that secret!! He then talk her how to walk and how to be a human! She was silly and thought a fork was for brushing her hair and she thought that Niko's Valentine box was a real shark! My dad said me and her would get along!! My dad then took her to pirate island and threw her back to the sea!! I hope that I can meet her one day!!\n\nmy last video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFQypT6wugg\n\nmy dad's last video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJsQD-kIk0\n\nBye vlog *pshhhhh*",
