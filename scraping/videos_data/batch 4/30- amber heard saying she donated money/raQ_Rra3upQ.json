            "description": "A Toyota Master Diagnostic Technician takes you on the journey of a car's certification process at the dealership going through the full Certified Pre Owned car inspection and reconditioning process.\n\nSo are you Buying a Certified Pre Owned car? In this video I will walk you through the entire process of certification for Toyota Certified Vehicles.\n\nCertified Pre Owned cars go through a very thorough inspection to make sure that first it meets the standards set by the manufacturer. And most importantly that it lives to the expectations of the new owner.\n\nCertified Pre Owned cars are usually more expensive that conventional used cars because of the inspection and reconditioning process that they go through.\n\nI'll first explain the important differences between Certified cars and regular used cars. Then we'll start the process on the Sales department side on what they do before they even request certification from the Service department.\n\nOnce the Sales department does their due diligence to make sure that this car is worthy of certification then it heads over to the service department and the inspection journey begins.\n\nThe first thing in any technicians agenda for the Certified Inspection is surprisingly to knock the car off certification believe it or not. We want to make sure that this car doesn't have deal breakers. Things that would disqualify this car from certification regardless if it can be repaired or not.\n\nThings like major accidents, Poor maintenance history or even excess wear and tear.\n\nCertified inspections leave nothing unchecked. The meticulous inspection needs to be followed through to the end because unlike traditional used car inspections, Certified Pre Owned Cars involve the manufacturer in their certification process.\n\nThe information in this video can actually be used to check used cars. I shared many tips here that I hope you will find useful in your next used car shopping experience.\n\nFollow the channel on Social Media :\nhttp://www.facebook.com/thecarcarenut\nhttp://www.instagram.com/thecarcarenut\n\nCheck out the channel Merch store\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEKt2bUDBoRUw3wpPpDOUaA/store\n\nSupport the channel on Patreon:\nhttp://www.patreon.com/thecarcarenut\n\nMake a one time donation to the channel:\nhttp://www.paypal.me/CCNdonate\n\nCheck out the amazon store:\nhttp://www.amazon.com/shop/thecarcarenut\n*as an Amazon associate, I earn from qualifying purchases.\n\nMailing Address:\nThe Car Care Nut\nP.O Box 2850\nOrland Park, IL 60462\n\n#thecarcarenut #toyota #usedcar #lexus\n\n0:00 Intro\n0:29 Overview\n2:26 Pre-Inspection Checks\n4:17 Service Department Inspection\n6:28 Body Inspection\n12:49 Mechanical Inspection\n15:10 Under Car Inspection\n17:41 Getting Ready to Certify : Maintenance Inspection\n21:03 Function Check\n23:46 Inspection Completed.
