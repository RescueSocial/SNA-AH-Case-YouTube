Snacks, medicinal compounds and beverages are strongly recommended.\n\nThe streams can be used to relieve frustration, stress and hysteria when correctly applied.  Do not use on unexplained calf pain.\n\nNote that this channel may occasionally feature loud drunken opinions and rants, and that they are purely personal opinions and not formal statements.\n\nIf superchat is enabled, please only contribute small amounts like buying me a drink at the bar.\nThe channel can also be supported on Patreon, giving extra streams and better interaction with the main channel, while also providing a way to share new videos if I upset someone and get my channel deleted.\nhttps://www.patreon.com/bigclive\n\nThis channel is for live streams and face videos to let the main channel stay focussed on bench videos.  You can find the main channel here:-\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtM5z2gkrGRuWd0JQMx76qA\n\nThe best way to enjoy these videos after the live stream is probably to have them playing in the background like a radio for a bit of company.",
