In the United States, a slander case is already due to be heard this year. Depp sued Heard for slander in Virginia after she penned an op-ed for The Washington Post in 2018 in which she described herself as a domestic violence victim, though she never listed Depp by name. The actor is claiming damages in the amount of USD 50 million.\n\nAfter the suit was held in Amber's favor, the Aqua man actress took to twitter to brand Johnny's lawyer \"short,\" and she's now sent tweets to fans who are against her. \u201cI'd rather be short than an abusive gold digger,\u201d one fan responded to the diss. \u201cIt's nice to be objective about your goals,\u201d Amber replied.\n\n#thishappened #amberheard #johnnydepp",
