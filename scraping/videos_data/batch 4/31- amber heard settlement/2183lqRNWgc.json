That decision came after three weeks of hearings where the court heard sensational claim and counter-claim from both parties about violent outbursts which each accused the other of committing.\nIn March this year, Depp's legal team applied for permission to appeal the High Court ruling upheld that he was a wife beater and to rely on further evidence. His lawyers said Heard's claim that she had donated her divorce settlement to charity was a \"calculated lie\".\nDepp has also filed a $50 million defamation lawsuit against Heard in a Virginia court over an opinion piece she wrote in The Washington Post.\nHeard is also known for playing Mera in DC Comics' 2018 superhero film \"Aquaman\", opposite \"Game of Thrones\" actor Jason Momoa in the title role of the half-human, half-Atlantean character.\nShe is set to reprise the 'queen of the sea' role in version 2 of \"Aquaman\", slated for 2022. The character also features in 2017 action adventure \"Justice League\".\nHeard is also a human rights activist and #MeToo campaigner.\nIn October 2018 she told a United Nations audience in Geneva that Hollywood falls \"way behind\" when it comes to human rights and has a responsibility to change.\n\n.......................................................................................\n\nFollow Us: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVraSltSET7CHmEulDTqMXA\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/newzeepk\nTwitter:      https://twitter.com/newzeepk\n\nWatch \"Princess Leonor, Spain's future queen, delivers her first speech with ENG SUBs\"\nhttps://youtu.be/OuCclSJLIxI\n\nCheck out our playlists to view the latest videos and don't forget to subscribe to the NEWZEE YouTube channel for daily video updates.\n\nMust Share Your Thought in Comments!",
