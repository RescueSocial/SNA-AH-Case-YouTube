            "description": "Johnny Depp accused Amber Heard of punching him twice in the face back in 2016 and now News bits has obtained the photo of his injuries, which is being used as part of his new lawsuit against his ex-wife.\n\nThe accusation was made last year as part of a libel lawsuit Depp filed against a U.K. tabloid for calling him a \u201cwife-beater.\u201d\n\nDepp claimed on the night of April 21, 2016, he was late for Heard\u2019s 30th birthday dinner. When he returned home, Depp claimed Heard was upset and began criticizing him. He claims he was reading in bed when Heard became \u201caggressive and violent, punching him twice in the face.\u201d\n\nDepp says an employee of his then took the photo \u2014 which shows Depp with a shiner under his left eye \u2014 the next day.\n\nDuring the couple\u2019s legal battle, Depp\u2019s security guard, Starling Jenkins, testified about the night in question, though he did not witness the alleged attack. He said Heard had been celebrating her birthday at the couple\u2019s apartment with some friends.\n\nJenkins said his shift ended at 11:00 PM, right around when Heard\u2019s guests were leaving, and Depp had not yet returned home.\n\nMusic: https://www.bensound.com/",
