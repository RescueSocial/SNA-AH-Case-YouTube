She even was nominated as a global spokesperson for L'Oreal Paris. She even dated Elon Musk for a year until early 2018!\n\nAmber Heard had things going good for her until the controversy struck and her whole career braked to a halt over allegations that she abused Depp and he was the victim of abuse during their marriage.\n\nThe entirety of Hollywood was split into two, one favoring her and one favoring her ex-husband during this scandal. When she stepped out as a victim of marital abuse, she got a lot of support and concern from all fans. \n\nSympathy went to Depp and most of the production houses didn't want any of them to be broiled in controversy after casting. Heard lost her role in Aquaman 2 and expressed her deep disappointment and Depp stepped down from his role as Grindelwald in the Crimes of Grindelwald movie of the Fantastic Beasts franchise. \n\nJohnny Depp was first married to Lori Allison and later got engaged to Jennifer Grey but finally proposed to Winona Ryder who was his co-star. He was so obsessed with her, he tattooed \u201cWinona Forever\u201d on his right arm. \n\nBut that didn\u2019t work out and he instead hit it up with Vanessa Paradis and has two children with her. Paradise and he separated in 2012 and then walked Amber Heard into his life.\n\nAmber Heard was dating Tasya van Ree in the 2010s and they broke up in 2011. There was a charge against her for misdemeanor and domestic violence, but Ree later said that it was just over-sensationalized.Heard met Depp in 2012 on the sets of a movie and they dated and even lived together for three years. They then got married in 2015. \n\nWithin 7 months, in 2016, they filed for divorce. But it wasn\u2019t just divorce, she pressed charges against him for verbal and physical abuse under alcohol influence. \n\nHeard went ahead to release pictures and evidence of her abuse which garnered more outrage. They alleged that their relationship was passionate and volatile but forever bound by love. They said that they did not do this for the money and yet, Johnny Depp had to pay Heard an amount of 7 million US dollars, which she donated to the Children's Hospital in Los Angeles.\n\nFans thought that was it, everything had settled, but Heard published an op-ed in the Washington Post where the narrative was about her as an abuse victim. It did not mention Depp in any way, yet he took action and slapped a libel case on her. In a huge twist, he accused Heard of physical abuse, provided evidence, and said that all her claims were a hoax.\n\nThis was all that Depp wanted, he started to sue all the articles that labeled him a \u201cwife-beater\u201d and other claims but the High Court of Justice voted in Heard\u2019s favor and said that his claims of the whole thing being a hoax was not justified. Depp decided to appeal the decision and in order to give his all for it, decided to step down from his role in Crimes of Grindelwald and was replaced by Mads Mikkelsen. Boycott Amber heard\n\nAfter the call by the actor to contest Heard's claim, fans showed massive response by flooding Twitter with DeppMovieNight and Deppcember where they organized a 24-hour movie marathon to show WeStandWithJohnnyDepp.\n\nDue to their massive activism in Depp's aspect, they generated an online petition to get Heard removed from Aquaman 2 which succeeded and she was very heartbroken about it. Such was the huge controversy in Johnny Depp's life. \n\nThe mic drop comes because Amber Heard's lawyers quit. This was quite the turnaround as at this crucial junction it is unheard of for lawyers of great distinction to quit. Roberta Kaplan is a high-profile lawyer and her withdrawal from the case and letting Heard take up the services of another counsel called Elaine Bredehoft from Virginia is quite shocking. Depp seems to be moving on and has the case to persist in the case. Depp's defamation lawsuit against Heard will be commenced in the spring of 2021.  clevver news  johnny depp amber heard  amber heard aquaman 2\n\n#AmberHeard #JohnnyDepp #JusticeForDepp #TheSpotlight #AmberHeardExposed #Depp #Heard #Aquaman2 #JasonMomoa",
