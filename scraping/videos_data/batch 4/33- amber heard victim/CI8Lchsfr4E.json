Who\u2019s in danger - the woman, or the man?\n\nThis is the question support worker Christine asks herself when she decides to make her female domestic abuse service available to male victims...and perpetrators. How can she distinguish the survivors from the abusers - while still offering a safe space for women?\n\n\"Victim or Perpetrator?\" is the first full-length drama to explore domestic abuse in all its forms, across different ages - and across different genders.\n\nInspired by many real-life cases of abuse, the stories of people who've tried to help female & male victims, and the debate surrounding several celebrities (including Johnny Depp and Amber Heard)  - Secret Stories C.I.C presents a professionally recorded full-cast adaptation of the acclaimed 2019 stage play by Michael Beakhouse.\n\nThe radio drama is available to anyone who might find it useful via Spotify, Soundcloud and all major podcasting platforms.\n\nSupport for male survivors is available via Mankind Initiative (01823 334244), Both Parents Matter (0333 050 6815); and Break The Silence (www.breakthesilence.co.uk), who will also published Lee Marks' book \"Break The Silence: A Support Guide For Male Victims Of Domestic Abuse\" on 30th November 2021.\n\nSupport for female survivors is available via the National Domestic Abuse helpline (0808 2000 247), Women's Aid (https://www.womensaid.org.uk) and Refuge (0808 2000 247).\n\n\u201cVictim or Perpetrator?\u201d featured Peter Tavener as Jason and Derek Hogarth; Victoria Paterson as Christine, the Judge, and the Waitress; Belinda Duffy as Scarlet; and Michael Beakhouse as Alex. The play was recorded and mixed by Spriggan Productions.",
