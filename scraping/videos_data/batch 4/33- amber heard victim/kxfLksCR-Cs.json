Speculations regarding the actress\u2019 rumored firing became rife after an audiotape where she admitted to abusing her ex-husband, Johnny Depp made headlines.\n\nIn the lengthy clip, Heard and Depp are engaging in a heated argument. Heard taunts the Pirates of the Caribbean star and tells him that no one would believe that he\u2019s a victim of domestic violence. As of late, the heads at DC have not yet revealed their decision when it comes to Heard. But there are rumors that Heard\u2019s screen time in Aquaman 2 will become limited if she continues to appear in the sequel.\n\nTom King Teases 'Insanely Ambitious' Unannounced Project\nhttps://www.cbr.com/tom-king-unannounced-project/\n\nTom King has announced that he's nearly finished a new limited series, which, according to him, is one of the most ambitious projects he's ever worked on.\n\nTom King offered no details about the project; it remains to be seen if this is a project with DC Comics or a creator-owned project he is developing. He has, however, teased a Watchmen project multiple times.\n\nFemale-Focused \u2018Star Wars\u2019 Series From \u2018Russian Doll\u2019s\u2019 Leslye Headland In Works At Disney+\nhttps://deadline.com/2020/04/new-star-wars-series-female-led-leslye-headland-russian-doll-disney-plus-1202915221/\n\nDisney+ is developing a female-centered Star Wars series that will be written and showrun by Lesley Headland, a co-creator of Netflix\u2019s Emmy-winning dramedy series Russian Doll.\n\nIt marks the latest Disney+ original series in the Star Wars universe, following the successful The Mandalorian created by Jon Favreau which is already underway on Season 3 ahead of its Season 2 bow. That too has a strong female element in Gina Carano\u2019s butt-kicking shock trooper-turned-mercenary Cara Dune.\n\nTwitter 'Cancels' Adam Driver\nhttps://www.cbr.com/twitter-cancels-adam-driver-with-new-hashtag/\n\nSome Twitter users are trying to \"cancel\" Star Wars' Kylo Ren actor Adam Driver. The hashtag began trending on April 20, apparently in response to a 2019 New Yorker interview in which Driver talked about how, at the age of 18, he joined the Marines after the Sep. 11 terrorist attacks. Adam Driver was medically discharged from the Marines and later enrolled in The Julliard School. \n\nDC Comics' Batman to Continue in June\nhttps://www.cbr.com/batman-92-june-james-tynion-iv/\n\nBatman writer James Tynion IV has revealed when Batman #92 will hit shelves as DC attempts to go back to normal amid the industry shutdown.\n\nWith DC Comics' physical releases being put on hold as a result of the industry-wide shutdown stemming from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, one title that has been of particular interest is Batman #92 -- which was originally scheduled for release on April 1. Batman series writer James Tynion IV has now confirmed the new issue is set to arrive sometime this June.\n\nDC Expands Digital First, New Titles Arriving Daily\nhttps://www.cbr.com/dc-digital-first-essential-reads-expansion/\n\nDC has announced it's expanding its DC Digital First publishing program, with a number of new titles arriving daily.\n\nThe titles arriving during the first week of the expansion, previously exclusive to the DC Giants, include Superman: The Man of Tomorrow, by Robert Venditti, Batman: Gotham Nights, featuring a story by Brad Meltzer, Jim Lee, and Alex Sinclair with a second story by Larry Hama, and Wonder Woman: Agent of Peace, by Amanda Conner and Jimmy Palmiotti.\n\n#amberheard #starwars #AdamDriverIsOverParty\n\nContact Thinking Critical: \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Wes_from_TC\nEmail wesdigscomics@gmail.com",
