            "description": "A year after her death, most people remember Amanda Todd from her YouTube video, holding up hand-written pages describing how one mistake in front of a webcam led to her torment by bullies at school and online.  But beyond that viral video, the fifth estate reveals a more complex and disturbing story about what happened to the B.C. teenager driven to suicide in October 2012 \u2013 not just bullying, but the deliberate sexual extortion of a 15-year-old girl by online predators.  the fifth estate host Mark Kelley goes deep into Amanda\u2019s world, with never-before-seen videos and web chats from two personal laptops that her family shared with the fifth estate. With in-depth interviews from her mother, father and friends, Kelley reveals the untold story of The Sextortion of Amanda Todd.\n\nOriginal Airdate : November 15th, 2013\n\nFor more on the fifth estate : http://www.cbc.ca/fifth\nFollow us on Twitter : http://www.twitter.com/cbcfifth\nLike us on Facebook : https://www.facebook.com/thefifthestate",
