Heard believes Johnny\u2019s alleged drug, alcohol and prescription med usage contributed to his alleged abuse. \u00a0\u201cJohnny\u2019s relationship with reality oscillates, depending upon his interaction with alcohol and drugs,\u201d reads the court doc. \u201cAs Johnny\u2019s paranoia, delusions and aggression increased throughout our relationship, so has my awareness of his continued substance abuse.\u201d \u00a0Depp\u00a0filed a $50 million defamation lawsuit in Virginia last year\u00a0after Heard \u2013 his wife for just over a year until they separated in May 2016 \u2013 penned a Washington Post op-ed about\u00a0her experience as a victim of domestic violence. While Depp was not named in the piece, he insisted it was strongly inferred he was the perpetrator. Heard responded by detailing the \u201chorrific\u201d abuse she allegedly suffered at his hands. \u00a0Johnny\u2019s attorney responded to the IME request saying it makes no sense to run a test today when the couple\u2019s past is what\u2019s in question. \u00a0\u201cThis is a defamation case in which Mr. Depp does not allege that he suffers from any mental disorder or condition,\u201d his lawyer responded. \u201cThus, Mr. Depp\u2019s mental condition is not \u2018in controversy\u2019 nor does good cause exist under the rule for an IME of Mr. Depp. \u00a0\u201cIt is a preposterous notion that an IME now would shed light on Mr. Depp\u2019s mental state at the time of Ms. Heard\u2019s abuse hoax back in 2016. Ms. Heard\u2019s effort treads a well-worn path of victim blaming using the pretext of mental health. By Ms. Heard\u2019s tortured credibility logic, current IME\u2019s would also be warranted for all the dozens of eyewitnesses who have attested to the various facets of the hoaxes they witnessed years ago.\u201d Share this:",
