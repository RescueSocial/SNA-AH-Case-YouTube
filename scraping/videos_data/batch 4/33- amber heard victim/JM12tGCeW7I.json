The full version was recorded by Johnny Depp and Amber Heard during their marriage (September 2015). The full recording is being used as evidence in the Johnny Depp v The Sun UK libel case. Depp decided to sue The Sun for publishing an article where they brand him a \u2018wife-beater\u2019, for abusing his then wife, Amber Heard. \n\nWhen the cut-up/edited 46 minute version leaked in January by Depp\u2019s team, it was made to portray a certain narrative and was used as propaganda. It was leaked 6 months before the trial began and used to lead people and potential jurors to believe that it was somehow an official piece of evidence, which it was not. It was incomplete.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to read the official case documents, they can be found here: https://www.nickwallis.com/depp-trial\n\nThis recording was obtained through CourtTV and can be found here: https://www.courttv.com/news/amber-heard-witness-statements-depp-blamed-the-monster-for-physical-verbal-abuse/\n\nYou can listen to the FULL recording here: https://youtu.be/k9pbrBmHI58\n\nComments are disabled to combat abuse.",
