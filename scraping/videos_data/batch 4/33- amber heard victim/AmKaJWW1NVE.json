She just might be shooting herself in the foot since testifying against Johnny Depp in court is breaking the NDA they both signed.  This has no bearing on the 7Mil she received from Johnny that she apparently donated to charity...that 7Mil was the legal settlement from the divorce since they did not have a prenup.

Johnny has been there in London testifying\non his own, and if she shows up they might share a courtroom together.  That won't be pleasant for Johnny but this is what narcissists like Amber plan well.  She is trying to make Johnny fall apart and crumble at her feet.  He's not going to do that at this point, as far as I can see, but it's  pretty clear that she's banking on it.  After all, he didn't want to bring her down in 2016, he wanted to settle out so they could both come away unscathed.  He loved that woman deeply.  However, a lot can happen in four years and we're now in 2020.\nJohnny Depp, I have no doubt, will stand his ground and show that these text messages were mere rants to a friend and not actual threats.  Amber was the abuser and he was the victim, but  he's not a victim any more.  He's fighting back and not leaving any stone unturned.",
