I'm really excited to show you this giant surprise!! My dad and Mom told me that there was something BIG happening at our house but they didn't tell me what to expect!! My Dad and Mom thought it would be a great idea for me to search the house looking for a new surprise gift!! Little did I know that while I was looking upstairs with my Mom my dad was downstairs getting everything ready!! Once everything was ready to go my dad called us down and set us on the couch to reveal the giant surprise!! He went to the door and let in OUR VERY OWN UNICORN!! The Mini Unicorn trotted inside our house and I was so excited!! I thought the Unicorn was the Surprise but I then found out that the Unicorn actually delivered the surprise!! My very own giant Uni-verse Unicorn  Emoji Cloud with a lot of surprises inside!! I was so thankful for this and was really excited to open up these toys!!  When I opened up the box I saw a lot of little uni-verse cloud with cute faces on them!! We read the instructions and it said that when dunked in water the clouds dissolve to reveal bags filled with collectible unicorn toys!! We started to dunk the clouds and play with the toys and they were so much fun!! I can't wait to play with them again!!\n#UniverseSurprise\n\nmy last video - MAGIC LOVE POTIONS!!
