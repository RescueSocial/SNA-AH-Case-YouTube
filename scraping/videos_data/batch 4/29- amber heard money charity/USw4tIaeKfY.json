B~Love then asked India Marie if she feels obligated to leave the room when he has company. Then he tells a story about changing a car tire and battery. In B~Love\u2019s relationTIP, he talks about Christmas lists and being surprised when you get what you asked for. While, in WWID, India Marie answers a listener letter about the preferred sex of a child.",
