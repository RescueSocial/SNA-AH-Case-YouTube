            "description": "Amber Heard filed for divorce from Depp on May 23, 2016. Five days later, she obtained a temporary restraining order against him, stating in her court declaration that he had been \"verbally and physically abusive\" throughout their relationship, with the latest incident of violence having taken place only two days before she filed for divorce. In response, Depp's lawyers alleged that she was \"attempting to secure a premature financial resolution by alleging abuse\". Over the following three months, Heard's lawyers provided information to the media on other alleged incidents of violence during the relationship, and images of her injuries from one incident were published by People. A settlement was reached on August 16, 2016, and the divorce was finalized in January 2017. Heard dismissed the restraining order, and they issued a joint statement saying that their \"relationship was intensely passionate and at times volatile, but always bound by love. Neither party has made false accusations for financial gain. There was never any intent of physical or emotional harm.\" She was awarded US $7 million, which she planned to donate to the American Civil Liberties Union and the Children's Hospital Los Angeles. As of December 1, 2016, she had not yet completed the donation;  A Forbes contributor has reported that this was likely due to the tax implications of such a charity gift (depending on whether she herself received the money from Depp in the legal category of a \"gift\" or it was \"structured as alimony\", according to California Divorce Code Section 1041).  In April 2018, the Children's Hospital Los Angeles reported that Heard donated between $1 million and $5 million to the organization in 2017. Amber Heard dated Elon Musk for about a year, until August 2017.",
