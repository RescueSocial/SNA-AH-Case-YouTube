Depp, who characterized Heard as a gold digger while claiming her accusations that he was violent towards her were a hoax, lost the case. A few days later, the actor announced he was resigning from Fantastic Beasts 3 after pressure was brought to bear by the film's producers.

Depp and Heard married in 2015 after meeting on the set of the 2011 film The Rum Diary. Heard filed for divorce in 2016, alleging that the actor had been verbally and physically abusive throughout their relationship. Their divorce was finalized in 2017, with Depp asked to pay $7 million in settlement, which Heard pledged to donate to charity.",
