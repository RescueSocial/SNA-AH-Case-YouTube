            "description": "Amber Heard told London's High Court today how her then-husband Johnny Depp snorted lines of cocaine and drank whisky while accusing her of having an affair with 'a gentleman I hardly knew'. Heard said Depp had 'gotten it in his mind that I had these affairs and he wouldn't leave until I admitted it', on her final day of evidence in the Pirates of the Caribbean star's libel case over allegations of domestic violence. She has accused Depp of verbal and physical abuse throughout their relationship - allegedly punching, slapping, kicking, headbutting and choking her, as well as displaying 'extremely controlling and intimidating behavior'. However Depp, 57, who is not expected in court until noon today because he is attending a meeting about a future film project, says he was not violent towards the Aquaman actress, 34, claiming it was she who attacked him. During her evidence, which began on Monday, Heard has claimed Depp pushed Kate Moss down a flight of stairs and called the feces found in the couple's bed after her 30th birthday 'absolutely disgusting'. Her sister Whitney Henriquez, who previously lived in one of five penthouses owned by Depp in the Eastern Columbia Building in Los Angeles, is due to give evidence this afternoon.\n\nOriginal Article: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8551829/Amber-Heard-arrives-finish-testimony-Johnny-Depp-libel-trial.html\nOriginal Video: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/video/news/video-2215860/Video-Day-Thirteen-Johnny-Depp-Amber-Heard-arrive-High-Court.html\n\nDaily Mail Facebook: http://facebook.com/dailymail\nDaily Mail IG: http://instagram.com/dailymail\nDaily Mail Snap: https://www.snapchat.com/discover/Daily-Mail/8392137033\nDaily Mail Twitter: http://twitter.com/MailOnline\nDaily Mail Pinterest: http://pinterest.co.uk/dailymail\nDaily Mail Google+: https://plus.google.com/+DailyMail\n\nGet the free Daily Mail mobile app: http://dailymail.co.uk/mobile",
