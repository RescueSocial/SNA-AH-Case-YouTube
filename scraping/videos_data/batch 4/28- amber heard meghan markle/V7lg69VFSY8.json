            "description": "#johnnydepp #amberheard #justiceforjohnnydepp\n\nHey everyone! Welcome back!\n\nI know some are wondering where I've been.  I followed the UK trial very closely, and am preparing some really big elements for upcoming videos.  I'll give everyone an update on the channel soon. Thank you for your patience!\n\nIn the meantime...here is the full video of Johnny Depp angry over his stolen millions, while Amber secretly records him.  The chopped up and edited version was leaked to TMZ almost 4 years ago, to the day.  Notice now at the end, Johnny does what Amber hates most and leaves, while she laughs at him.\n\nSee you all soon!\n\nNick Wallis Website (with documents and transcripts from trial):\nhttps://www.nickwallis.com/depp-trial\n\nMy Twitter: @ThatBrianFella\n\nMy Instagram: @IncrediblyAverageBrian",
