Especially for Johnny, it's been hard since he lost two major roles, one in the new and upcoming Pirates of the Caribbean movie, and one in the Fantastic Beasts as Gellert Grindelwald. Amber on the other hand hasn't been so unlucky as her role in Aquaman 2 has been untouched. Following the announcement by Warner Bros. that she would be cast in their forthcoming film, Amber Heard feels like she has won against Johnny Depp, and believes her future is safe. But who knows, Depp fans are currently fighting hard to get her removed claiming they would even \"not watch the movie\" if Amber's role as \"Mera\" persists. But for now, it seems like she is safe.\n\n#AmberHeard #JohnnyDepp #Aquaman2",
