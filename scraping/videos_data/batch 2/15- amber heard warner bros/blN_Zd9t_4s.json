            "description": "It cannot be denied that Johnny Depp and Amber Heard\u2019s failed marriage tops a long list of the worst divorces in the history of Hollywood today.  And in Johnny Depp and Amber Heard\u2019s case, the consequences of their tumultuous marriage still feels its blown up to this day, after it started in 2016. That\u2019s a pretty long time. Yes, after almost five years of going back and forth in court, they are still in it. And during these five long years, the two have been supported by their own fans, friends, co-workers, and families. However, in terms of supporters, it is pretty obvious that Johnny Depp has a lot more advantages than his former wife. And in terms of celebrities with huge names in the industry, Johnny Depp seems to be also winning their hearts. Due to these ongoing court rulings and scandals involving these big names in the industry, the case is greatly affecting Johnny\u2019s career, and one example was when he was asked to resign from his role as Grindelwald in the third installment of J.K Rowling\u2019s Fantastic Beasts film trilogy that was supposed to be released in 2022.  Due to this, many other actors perceived this as \u201cunfair\u201d treatment of Depp, many stars stepped out to defend him. Many fans, friends, and co-stars defended him and what was shocking was even his previous lovers and wives stepped up to speak for him, even two of his former flames Vanessa Paradis whom he had two children with, and Winona Ryder, his love team and long time girlfriend in the 90s. Yet, as the issue continues to grow bigger and bigger, it involves more and more people as well, and more and more celebrities continue to arise and speak out on social media about the issue. So who are these brave celebs who are not buying Amber\u2019s lies? Watch this video to find out. But before anything else, please make sure to hit that subscribe button first and ring that notification bell for more updates on the infamous Johnny Depp and Amber Heard upcoming trial. Now, let\u2019s dig in!\n\nAs the trial is coming near, the issue that has somehow been buried deep in the internet has recently surfaced once again, and guess who\u2019s been the subject of ridicule these past few weeks, or months, rather? You guessed that right, Amber Heard. Amber seemed to have been losing more and more of her supporters. Then there was evidence of her having affairs with an actor and a multi-billionaire, James Franco and Elon Musk. But what upset most people was the fact that Johnny Depp was forced to step down from his role as Grindelwald in the upcoming third franchise of the film trilogy \u201cFantastic Beasts\u201d. But now that Johnny has been removed from his role, people\u2019s fury shot directly at Amber Heard, as she was going back to reprise her role in the second franchise of the DC Extended Universe film Aquaman, despite the lawsuits she is currently facing. Some even started a petition to request Warner Bros. to fire Amber Heard, the same way they did to Johnny. \n\n1. Penelope Cruz\nPenelope is a Spanish actress known for her beauty and her portrayal of sultry characters. She achieved early success in Spanish cinema and quickly established herself as an international star, co-starring with Johnny Depp in Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides and Blow. As his co-actor, Penelope supports Depp from the start.\n\n2. Sia\nSinger and songwriter Sia has also voiced her \u201cpublic support\u201d for Johnny Depp as the actor prepares for his defamation trial against ex-wife Amber Heard. The singer, unprompted, shared her support for Depp in a Twitter post which read: \u201cJust showing my public support for Johnny Depp.\u201d\n\n3. Kevin McNally\nKevin Robert McNally is an English actor, who has worked in theatre and radio extensively, as well as in film and television. For Disney, he plays Joshamee Gibbs in the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, being one of the three actors to appear in all five films.\n\n4. Sharon Osborne\nSharon Osborne was one of Johnny\u2019s first supporters even from the start of the Johnny and Amber Heard issue. She was also one of the many celebrities who stood up against British news publisher.\n\n5. Paul Bettany\nLet's move on to Jonny's co-star from the 2010 movie The Tourist, Paul Bettany.\n\nJohnny continues to earn more and more supporters. Apart from this, fans and other celebs who support the actor also continue to add up in number, especially as the release of Aquaman 2 draws near, bearing the face of Amber Heard in a lead role as Queen Mera, alongside famous faces like Jason Momoa and Nicole Kidman. \n\nThat\u2019s all for today, and if you enjoyed that video, and smash that subscribe button and notification bell for more videos like this.\n\nRelated videos:\nHUGE AQUAMAN FAIL as WARNER PANICS and WRECKS THE BRAND!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKTXRB77tew\n\nAquaman 2 Director PANICS!
