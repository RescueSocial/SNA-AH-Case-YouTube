But that might not be the case, as WB reportedly thinks that Amber Heard Petitions are artificially inflated. \n\n\nIn today\u2019s video, we\u2019ll tell you what WB reportedly, has to say about Amber Heard petitions. \n\n\nAmber Heard recently suggested that the barrage of online campaigns being launched against her were secretly funded and paid for. The star, told EW that \u201cpaid campaigns\u201d on social media will not prevent her taking up her role in the sequel, which will see director James Wan return alongside Jason Momoa as the title character.\n\n\nWarner Bros.\u2019 decision to remove Johnny Depp from the Fantastic Beasts franchise has caused much controversy online, with many calling for him to be reinstated and for his ex-wife Amber Heard to be fired from the DCEU instead. While Depp\u2019s recent UK libel case went against him, there\u2019s a lot of passionate support for him on social media. In fact, one Change.org petition to get Heard removed as Mera from Aquaman 2 has just hit 1 million signatures.\n\n\nYou\u2019d think that would be enough to make WB sit up and pause, but one report is claiming that the studio is not taking the swell of support for Depp and against Heard seriously, which might annoy a lot of people. \n\n\nThe petition to remove which crossed 1.2 million signatures on Change.org, making it one of the most signed petitions on the platform so far. However, the executives at Warner Bros. Pictures think it\u2019s all been inflated and doesn\u2019t reflect what people really think.\n\n\nWe\u2019ve seen it happened earlier than with the Marvel Cinematic Universe\u2019s Captain Marvel, when trolls did all the things, to downvote Carol Danvers\u2019 origin story into oblivion. And whereas some sections of the fanbase nonetheless haven\u2019t reconciled themselves with the truth that Brie Larson is a part of the franchise for the long term, just a little on-line backlash didn\u2019t cease the film from incomes over a billion dollars on the field workplace.\n\n\nNow, Geekosity\u2019s Mikey Sutton claims that Warner Bros. are of same perception that in the case of the relentless want from numerous corners of the web to see Heard booted from her position as Mera in Aquaman 2, they usually don\u2019t have any intention of asking her to step down simply because Johnny Depp has been trending at numerous factors over the past couple of weeks.\n\n\n\u201cThey see it no in another way than the boycott of Marvel Studios\u2019 Captain Marvel movie, which proved to be ineffective because it introduced in over a billion to Disney,\u201d says Sutton. \u201cThey imagine it\u2019s artificially inflated and almost certainly politically motivated. They don\u2019t base their selections on internet chatter.\u201d\n\n\nWarner Bros continues to remain silent on Amber Heard \u2018s status. Much of the public believes that Warner Bros may be afraid of the public backlash of letting Heard go. \n\n\nMikey Sutton also says, \u201cthe answer is the same now as it was then: there are no plans to have Heard fired. Whether Warner Bros. eventually is scared off from the Twitter attacks on Heard and lets her go is unknown. But what I\u2019ve been told is quite the opposite.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWarner Bros. removing an actress who was the victim of spousal abuse will create even worse PR, executives fear, despite what she is also being accused of,\u201d says Sutton.\n\n\nHowever, that may be part of the reason, but the majority of the reason is that Heard\u2019s contract with Warner Bros makes it almost impossible for them to let her go. \n\n\nWhat are your thoughts on all of the news with Heard and Depp?
