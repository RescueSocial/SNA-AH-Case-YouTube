And man! She went hard on Jake Gyllenhaal with the re-release of her album Red in November 2021. So, what did she reveal about that infamous relationship? How did Jake really use her? We have all the juicy details!\n\nWhen Taylor Swift and Jake Gyllenhaal first started going out some 11 years ago, little did we know it would inspire some of her best songs! And little did she know just how much it would break her. The Grammy award-winning singer is making headlines after releasing the recorded version of her fourth studio album Red earlier this month. The 20 track album includes \u201cAll Too Well,\u201d a ten-minute track detailing the heartbreak that followed a failed relationship. Now, are heartbreak songs anything new? Not at all. In fact, what is Taylor Swift without her heartbreak songs?\n\nSwifties were more than overjoyed when Taylor finally released Red (Taylor\u2019s Version) as part of her ongoing effort to regain control over her work. And they were also more intrigued when Taylor brought up more details from her past, especially her relationship with Jake!\n\nThe release of Red (Taylor\u2019s Version) is a big deal in itself. While the original album featured 16 tracks when it was released in 2012, the latest has been hailed as a masterpiece by critics and fans and features new musical collaborations with bigwigs including Ed Sheeran, Phoebe Bridgers, and Chris Stapleton.\n\nIt also features nine songs she wrote back in 2012 but didn\u2019t make the cut\u2026 until now.
