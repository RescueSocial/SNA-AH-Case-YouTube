Since then fans have been relentless in finding fault in everything she does ,and voicing their support for the \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" star.\n\nHeard's recent interview with\u00a0Access Hollywood\u00a0about her new miniseries, \"The Stand\" is no different. It received more dislikes than likes on YouTube. It has 269,000 dislikes and only 2,145 likes as we speak. Most of the over 90,000 comments are repeated accusation ,directed at the actress for allegedly lying ,about being a victim of domestic abuse.\n\n\"She is NOT a victim\" someone wrote and quoted what the actress said, in leaked audiotapes of her conversation with Depp, \"They won't believe you,because you are a man.\"\n\n\nWhile the 'Access' YouTube clip of Amber Heard does demonstrate, how disliked she is.The fact it got over a million views is a win for them engagement wise.",
