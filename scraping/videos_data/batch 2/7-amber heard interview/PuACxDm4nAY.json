            "description": "Johnny Depp Speaks Out About Amber Heard | Johnny Depp Interview (Trend Craze)\n\nThis week, American actor Johnny Depp lost a libel suit he filed in London, suing the newspaper The Sun for running an article that called him a \"wife beater,\" a reference to his relationship with ex-wife Amber Heard. It was an ugly case, dragging both actors' private lives into the spotlight. And it was a complicated case; each accused the other of abuse. But there was a clear winner, other than the tabloid paper: domestic violence victims.\n\nThe two debate the degree to which Heard injured Depp. At one point, Heard tells Depp she was hitting him: \"Babe, you're not punched. I don't know what the motion of my actual hand was, but you're fine. I did not hurt you, I did not punch you, I was hitting you.\"\n\nBut Depp went a step further in May 2019, saying that \"while mixing prescription amphetamines and non-prescription drugs with alcohol,\" Heard \"hit, punched and kicked me. She also repeatedly and frequently threw objects into my body and head, including heavy bottles, soda cans, burning candles, television remote controls and paint thinner cans, which severely injured me.\"\n\n\u00bb\u00bb \u00bb\u00bb \u00bb\u00bb \u00bb\u00bb \u00bb\u00bb \u00bb\u00bb \u00bb\u00bb \u00bb\u00bb \u00bb\u00bb \u00bb\u00bb \u00bb\u00bb \u00bb\u00bb \u00bb\u00bb \u00bb\u00bb \u00bb\u00bb \u00bb\u00bb \u00bb\u00bb \u00bb\u00bb \u00bb\u00bb \u00bb\u00bb \u00bb\u00bb \u00bb\u00bb \u00bb\u00bb \u00bb\u00bb \u00bb \u00bb\u00bb \u00bb\u00bb \u00bb\u00bb \u00bb\u00bb \u00bb\u00bb \u00bb\u00bb\n\nDo you know all the things about Johnny Depp?
