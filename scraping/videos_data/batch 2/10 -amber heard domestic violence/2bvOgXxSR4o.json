Actor Johnny Depp \"threatened to kill\" ex-wife Amber Heard \"many times\", the US actress has claimed. She described a \"three-day hostage situation\" during which she claimed Mr Depp was on a \"drug and alcohol binge\". Mr Depp, 57, is suing the publisher of the Sun over an article that referred to him as a \"wife beater\" - but the newspaper maintains it was accurate. He denies 14 allegations of domestic violence on which News Group Newspapers is relying for its defence.\n\nMurtaza Ali Shah is one of the leading reporters in Pakistani media, covering Pakistani political, social and cultural affairs from London.
