            "title": "Domestic Abuse OF Amber Heard - Ex-Staff Partner of Johnny Depp (Jane Doe)",
            "description": "Domestic Abuse OF Amber Heard according to ex-Johnny Depp Staff's Partner. She said her partner was there to see the marriage in 2014/2015 up to a 2017 NDA.\n- Jane Doe says Amber Heard was kicked, hit, and was crying after fights with Depp. She said her partner and other staff checked on her. The full 140 or so screenshots are at: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Gy4Pw8yoPVsY3T2VZs_ZQp_9_-FMYwIE?usp=sharing\n\nTo prevent domestic abuse - GET INVOLVED! Believe early, let them escape early. We created a petition to SUPPORT AMBER HEARD: https://www.change.org/p/amber-heard-supporters-we-support-amber-heard-in-aquaman-2\n\n\"Mo*ster\" as staff called Depp was used also by this Jane Doe and said 7 people were watching these tweets. They were even called to stop talking to us and to not support either side. She mentioned Amber was kicked in the UK, island, and other places.\n\nDivided, she said she knew Depp and his staff, but not Amber Heard.\n\n- The Jane Doe mentioned emails that she couldn't share now after the March 29 & April 1 screenshots, script writers, inability of Amber to audition, the Jane Doe going to Oscar/Emmy parties, celebrities hiding bruises while going to events as common, and more...\n\nAmber Heard is a CRIME VICTIM which should also be a protected class.\n\n- Slideshow of the tweets and messages with music.\n\nBackground: \nI did not know anything about Heard or Depp prior to Depp's March 2019 lawsuit for defamation. I started to learn and defend Amber in this situation, then this Jane Doe was looking on Twitter, and she decided to support Amber Heard.\n\nShe did not want screenshots, however, if someone is going to talk about domestic abuse and know it occurred, then I think it should be said and exposed. Los Angeles is very behind and unsafe about equal rights, women's rights, worker's rights (e.g. pay, networking, NDAs), and more. It can cause a chain reaction.\n\nThis slideshow shows Jane Doe clearly knew more than any AH fan did. Jane Doe said there was fighting from both sides, but they clearly saw Depp as the oppressor, Amber as the victim/survivor, and people are taking situations out of context. Several people lost jobs when he threatened Trump.\n\nMake your own decision from these tweets and messages, but I think Amber Heard is the victim here. Also, a person can fall down or get hit, and have no bruises, especially if with young skin. They can take time to show up. To make a victim REQUIRE bruises is going too far. Coercive Control goes beyond this to emotional, financial, and legal. It shouldn't have to get physical.\n\n*Also, limo drivers may have negative stories on many stars on the screen. One, e.g., I recently heard from one of their relatives in Sedona that Depp is mean...\n\nThe \"Jane Doe\" repeatedly changed their usernames on Twitter, but it's the same person.\n\nDuty to Rescue and Duty to Care:\n(Honestly, when I got these messages in April, I didn't really sleep and I got up early and screenshotted them before they temporarily deactivated their account (they would deactivate, lock, and change usernames). I am a defender because I believe in \u201cDuty to Rescue\u201d law which makes me feel liable if I see something wrong or unethical. I didn't/do not want to be socially responsible if it was not shown, and I didn't believe investigating because of harmful imposter PIs taking it out of context and threatening humanitarian work and lives).\n\nIf someone is in a harmful relationship, they should leave that relationship. The best way is to walk away. \"Better off without you anyway.\" To really prevent, though: People have to do something with Duty to Rescue and Duty to Care. Women are often told that they should forget their violence, that it's not believed, and it's not stopped early. See something, DO something. We have over 90,000 views of \"Men Help Woman Being Beaten by Husband in Parking Lot\": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyD0aouGM2Q\n\nWe also got the database fixed for the article on Amber's friend calling 911 for her. It was not showing up: http://refinery29.com/en-us/2016/06/113149/domestic-violence-911-call-famous-friend.\n\nStop NDAs hiding discrimination, crime, and abuse:\nHarvey Weinstein used NDAs and networking to silence his victims. Depp put his staff and Amber Heard onto NDAs. NDAs should be about intellectual property, not relationships. It's silencing victims and creates victim blaming. A 2017 law nearly came into effect to stop NDAs. \nI am glad the ACLU and Times Up are helping Amber Heard.\n\nI Stand with Melissa Benoist (Supergirl - CW/WB):\nNot long after editing and adding DC/WB to emails for the petition, Melissa Benoist came out about domestic abuse. We cannot prove the timing, but also \"I Stand with Melissa.\" We Stand with you, Amber. https://www.change.org/p/amber-heard-supporters-we-support-amber-heard-in-aquaman-2\n\n#AmberHeard #JohnnyDepp #DomesticAbuse #DomesticViolence #Hollywood #LosAngeles #Staff #PayUpHollywood #TimesUp #ACLU #AntiCrime #AntiViolence #Aquaman #Mera #Supergirl",
