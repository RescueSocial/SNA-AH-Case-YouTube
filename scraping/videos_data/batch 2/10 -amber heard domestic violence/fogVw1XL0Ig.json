On May 26, 2015, his representative stated:\n\n\"Given the brevity of this #marriage and the most recent and tragic loss of his mother, #johnny will not respond to any of the salacious false stories, gossip, misinformation, and lies about his personal life. Hopefully, the dissolution of this short marriage will be resolved quickly.\"\n\n2.Amber alleged Depp of domestic violence and the court granted her restraining order against Johny.  On May 26, 2015, Amber was seen with bruised face coming out of the court. \nThe sources told the news channels it was not the first time Johny had hit his wife. It was only the latest incident. \n\n3.Venessa Patridge pens a note denying Amber\u2019s domestic violence allegations against Johny and comes to his defense. \n\n\"I believe with all my heart that these recent allegations being made are outrageous,\" claiming, \"In all the years I have known Johnny, he has never been physically abusive with me and this looks nothing like the man I lived with for 14 wonderful years.\" Likewise, Lily took to Instagram and shared a childhood photo of her and her dad, along with a note that read, \"My dad is the sweetest, most loving person I know, he's been nothing but a wonderful father to my little brother and I, and everyone who knows him would say the same.\"\n\n4.Comedian Doug Stanhope claimed that Amber is blackmailing Depp. \n\n\"Amber was now going to leave him, threatening to lie about him publicly in any and every possible duplicitous way if he didn't agree to her terms,\" he said. \"Blackmail is what I would imagine other people might put it, including the manner in which he is now being vilified.\"\n\n5.Amber's lawyer slams Doug Stanphone\u2019s blackmail accusations.\n\n\"[The] allegations against Ms. Heard are absolutely and unequivocally false,\" adding that the claim she's blackmailing Johnny \"has no basis in reality and is nothing but the typical celebrity muckraking for profit.\"\n\n6.At the request of Amber\u2019s attorney Police are called to Amber and Johnny's home. But both of them were not present.\n\nOfficer Tony Im of the Los Angeles Police Department told the media that the officers simply stood by to \"ensure that only the items listed in the court order were being removed.\"\n\n7.Amber withdraws her petition for spousal support back from the court.\n\nAmber, who previously wanted $50,000 per month from the Johny Depp, says the request is being \"used against me to distract and divert the public away from the very serious real issue of domestic violence.\"\n\n8.Johnny Depp requests the court and media to leave the matter out of the public eye. He files a request to keep divorce details private.\n\nHis attorney, Laura Wasser, argued that although Amber has the right to have knowledge about his finances, the media does not. \"Johnny is merely trying to protect the documents and information Amber seeks from unwarranted disclosure to the media and other individuals not involved in the case,\" her statement in the official documents.\n\n9.Amber Heard accuses John Depp of stalling their divorce.\n\n\"[Depp] and his counsel's demand for the execution of these two non-disclosure agreements which impose undue financial hardships and burdens on [Heard] are nothing but blatant threats by [Depp] and are illustrative of his continued attempts to thwart real progress in this case,\" they read.\n\n10. #johnnydepp and #amberheard  settle their divorce.\n\n\"Our relationship was intensely passionate and at times volatile, but always bound by love,\" the two said in a joint statement to TMZ on Aug. 16. \"Neither party has made false accusations for financial gains.
