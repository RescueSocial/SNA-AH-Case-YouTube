Their divorce is nasty. She has several charges of abuse against him. Still Amber arrived with her first face-off with Johnny's lawyer. Johnny's ex Amber Heard arrived for her deposition at 11:30am, an hour and a half late and the paps-well they were ready to pounce. Depp, however, faces some serious claims. Amber says she is the victim of domestic abuse and Johnny gave her this black eye in May. \n\n\"It's basically going to be a he said, she said-his word against hers,\" says Christopher C. Melcher, a top family law attorney, who has represented stars like Katie Holmes during her divorce from Tom Cruise. \nHe doesn't represent either party in this case, but says Amber has a tough road ahead. \"To approve a permanent restraining order, she has to establish that Johnny hit her, stalked her, harassed her-things like that.\"\n\nAmber filed for divorce in May, just a month earlier this was their last appearance together, a PSA. \nJohnny and Amber recorded this awkward apology, apparently a part of a settlement for allegedly smuggling their dogs into Australia.  \"Declare everything when you enter Australia, \" Johnny Depp replied in his PSA. \n\n\"The parties were married for 15 months. I would imagine a divorce case in this situation would take longer than the marriage itself,\" states celebrity divorce attorney Christopher C.
