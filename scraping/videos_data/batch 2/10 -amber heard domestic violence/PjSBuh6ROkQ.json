            "description": "\"Johnny Depp wants to prove that Amber submitted a fake hair to court\".\n\nIn May of 2016, actress Amber Heard  accused her husband Johnny Depp of hitting her with a phone and assaulting her. She posted pictures of injuries to her face and filed for divorce.\nHowever, a leaked audio about their abuse and divorce  chronicle made some QUESTIONS AND SHOCKING REVELATIONS.And the most significant question is that whether Amber Heard is a Pathological Liar.Johnny Depp is holding on these facts and wants to prove to the court that amber is a Pathological Liar.JOHNNY DEPP WANTS TO PROVE THAT AMBER SUBMITTED A FAKE HAIR TO COURT.In Amber\u2019s court filing,  part of her statement wrote.  \u201cHoping to avoid the violence, I tried to calm Johnny down.\u201d \u201cAnd then I went upstairs to try to remove myself from the situation.\u201d\n\u201cJohnny followed me, hit me in the back of my head.\u201d  \u201cGrabbed me by my hair again.\u201d\n \u201cGot in front of me on the steps, and then dragged me by my hair up the last few steps.\u201d \nDepp tells a much different version of the same story in his declaration, with the building manager Kevin Murphy confirming some of the claims.  Murphy  testified that, \u201cHeard\u2019s face was utterly uninjured and unmarked.\u201d \u201cShe appeared to be makeup free, as they spoke face to face.\u201d\n\u201cShe is  in good light the day after she alleged the brutal attack.\u201d He also stated that Heard showed him the clump of hair on the floor but not the place that hair was pulled from. Then, upon viewing the hair image submitted to the court versus the one he saw, and photographed, Murphy said that he believed they were different clumps of hair. JOHNNY WANTS TO PROVE THAT HE DIDN\u2019T CUT OFF HIS OWN FINGER AS AMBER CLAIMS. According to Amber's version of the event. Johnny, who was drunk and high on ecstasy, smashed several bottles and windows.  He also slammed a plastic phone against the wall unit.  She claims a piece of one of the items cut off a portion of the middle finger on his right hand. Amber's version goes on ... she's a painter and had dark blue paint in the room.  She claims Johnny dipped what remained of his forefinger in the paint. And then he used the gnarly digit to write various words on a mirror.  It includes \"Billy Bob\" and \"Easy Amber.\"\nAmber had done a movie with Billy Bob Thornton and she claims Johnny accused the 2 of sleeping together. It is something she strongly denied. She added that he accused her of infidelity with other men as well. Amber's people say Johnny didn't get medical help for nearly 24 hours. The doctors could not reattach the fingertip. She said they used a flap from his hand to sew on a new tip.\nHowever, this is Johnny Depp\u2019s  story. He said  that he nearly lost his life to MRSA after she threw a bottle of vodka at him and severed his finger.  Depp claims he severed his finger back in 2015 not because he was partying with friends.  He also claims he had to undergo multiple surgeries as a result of this attack. \u201cWhile I was in Australia filming a movie approximately one month after I married Ms. Heard.\u201d \u201cOn a day where my then-lawyer tried to discuss with Ms. Heard the need that she sign a post-nuptial agreement with me.\u201d  \u201cShe went berserk and began throwing bottles at me.\u201d\n\u201cThe projectile\u2019s impact shattered the bone in my finger and entirely severed the tip of my finger.\u201d\nA photo submitted with the filing show's just how severe the injury was.  Depp is clearly missing a large chunk of his finger.  \u201cI had to have 3 surgeries to reconstruct my finger and contracted MRSA three times.\u201d  \u201cI feared that I would lose my finger, my arm, and my life,\u201d states Depp in his declaration. JOHNNY WANTS TO PROVE THAT HE DIDN\u2019T HIT HER SO BAD THAT THE BED BROKE.\nHeard had claimed on December 15, 2015  that her ex-husband beat her up so badly that the actor was so violent that he \"broke the bed in the process.\"  However, after the incident, multiple witnesses said that they saw Amber in good light the day after the alleged brutal attack. JOHNNY WANTS TO PROVE THAT  SHE LIED BY CALLING A LESBIAN POLICE OFFICER A \u201cHOMOPHOBIC\u201d. Amber Heard's ex-girlfriend Tasya van Ree has claimed the officers who arrested her for domestic violence appeared to be \"homophobic\". But that doesn't seem to be the case. The star's former lover said the incident in 2009 was \"misinterpreted and over-sensationalized by two individuals in a powerful position.\u201d However, there were reports that arresting officer Beverly Leonard is actually gay woman.\nShe has proudly posted pictures with her partner on Facebook a few years ago. As well as appearing at Pride weekend in the past.  \n#JohnnyDepp \n#AmberHeard\n#JusticeForJohnnyDepp\n#metoo\n*************************************\nThis presentation contains images that were used under a Creative Commons License.
