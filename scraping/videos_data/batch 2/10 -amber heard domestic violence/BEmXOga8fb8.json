            "description": "\"Would you save her\"? We Support Amber Heard and Melissa Benoist. They are Not Bulletproof! They are crime victims of domestic abuse. Our petition was shortly edited and emailed to DC/Warner Brothers before Melissa came out about domestic abuse! SIGN THE PETITION to SUPPORT AMBER HEARD in Aquaman 2: https://www.change.org/p/amber-heard-supporters-we-support-amber-heard-in-aquaman-2\n\nThe Geek Buzz shows that Melissa, Supergirl of the CW/WB, defended herself against abuse, and we are happy she has support: https://www.thegeekbuzz.com/news/supergirl-star-melissa-benoist-survivor-domestic-violence/\n\nAmber Heard was one of the first or only people to state she was domestically abused as the larger victim. Amber dealt with the mobs against her, and likely because of that, Melissa is able to come forward even if there were two-way fights. \n \nWe stand with Melissa and We stand with Amber... They're NOT bulletproof. \n\n\"With these pajamas and hair, it must mean I'm 'bulletproof'\" - Amber Heard in IG video: https://twitter.com/AmberHeardIT/status/1203988651820101632?s=20\nWhile looking tired, she's getting up from her bed, similar to her experiences... She's not actually bulletproof and frequently people will put in metaphors and hidden messages on their social media, because they're unable to be public today. \n\nThis photo with a pillow is interesting, since it escalated in the fights to her waking up to a bloody pillow which was seen by IO Tillett: https://www.instagram.com/p/B6EHDuthyjF\n\nWill you be the change?\n\n\"Life is not always what it seems.\" - Melissa Benoist...\n\nWe also refer to Amber's charity & activism. It's olympic about how many nonprofits Amber is involved with and many who did not have public support.\n\nThere's also an article that maybe Mera of Aquaman will get a Spin-Off movie. We hope that is true....  https://www.thegeekbuzz.com/news/amber-heard-reportedly-getting-her-own-mera-spinoff-movie/\n\nTo prevent domestic abuse - GET INVOLVED! Believe early, let them escape early. \nWe were told to not screenshot a partner of ex-JD staff's tweets and messages, but we DID. We were also told to not create a petition, but we DID.  They supported Amber and said she was kicked, hit, and crying. They were on NDAs and stopped interfering: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Gy4Pw8yoPVsY3T2VZs_ZQp_9_-FMYwIE and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2qFCFd-5C8\n\nJane Doe said in those screenshots: \"celebrities hiding bruises while going to events is common...\" \"Sad, but true.\"\n\nIf you don't support victims now, then the agenda to silence them will continue. \nDuty To Rescue and Duty to Care...\n\nWe also got the database fixed for the article on Amber's friend calling 911 for her after seeing her injuries and that she woke up to a bloody pillow before on a previous day.
