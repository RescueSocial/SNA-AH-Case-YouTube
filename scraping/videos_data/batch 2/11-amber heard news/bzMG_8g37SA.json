            "description": "Johnny Depp's ex-fiancee Winona Ryder is set to appear at the High Court in London today in support of the actor's sensational libel claim against a newspaper over an article that labelled him a 'wife beater'. Depp is suing The Sun's publisher News Group Newspapers (NGN) and its executive editor Dan Wootton over an April 2018 article which alleged he was violent towards ex-wife Amber Heard during their tumultuous relationship. Stranger Things actress Ryder, 48, who had a relationship with Depp, 57, in the 1990s, will give evidence in support of the actor's case over a video link from Los Angeles this afternoon. Also today, the court is due to hear from actress and advocate for the #MeToo movement Katherine Kendall, who claims she was 'misquoted' in The Sun's article. In the left photograph, Heard is front centre with her girlfriend Bianca Butti, her lawyer Jennifer Robinson and her sister Whitney Heard.\n\nOriginal Article: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8524775/Winona-Ryder-stand-Johnny-Depps-libel-trial.html\nOriginal Video: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/video/newsalerts/video-2210962/Video-Day-Seven-Johnny-Depp-Amber-Heard-arrive-High-Court.html\n\nDaily Mail Facebook: http://facebook.com/dailymail\nDaily Mail IG: http://instagram.com/dailymail\nDaily Mail Snap: https://www.snapchat.com/discover/Daily-Mail/8392137033\nDaily Mail Twitter: http://twitter.com/MailOnline\nDaily Mail Pinterest: http://pinterest.co.uk/dailymail\nDaily Mail Google+: https://plus.google.com/+DailyMail\n\nGet the free Daily Mail mobile app: http://dailymail.co.uk/mobile",
