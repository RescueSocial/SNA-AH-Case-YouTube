            "description": "Rather than describe a a self-explanatory video, I want to let you know about a post that went up on Patreon yesterday. Titled \"2001: The Ascension of Jeremy Dewitte,\" the post chronicles Jeremy's transition from run-of-the-mill single-conviction police impersonator to the Serial Police Impersonator we all know. The Ascension was set in motion on August 29, 2001, when Dewitte was arrested yet again for impersonating a police officer, and the title became official just a few months later when Jeremy pleaded no contest to the charges. Jeremy was sentenced to, among other things (including jail), intensive psychiatric treatment.\n\nOcoee Police Department was the arresting agency in that case, but public bodies don't retain records forever, and they destroyed their records from Jeremy's arrest years ago. Same deal with the State Attorney's Office and the Clerk of Courts. All they have is basic case information. The narratives have long-since been destroyed.\n\nBut sometimes things work out, and this happens to be one of those times. The destroyed case records are available now on Patreon.\n\nSome excerpts:\n\n\"Thomas said that he called Dewitte at 1600 hours and Dewitte identified himself as a police officer working undercover at the mall as a Cingular Wireless employee.\" [Reality: Jeremy was working at a mall cell phone kiosk. The end.]\n\n\"Dewitte later gave us consent to search his bedroom at 1500 Tangerwood. There, Officer Loyko and myself, along with Darwin Simcoe [Jeremy's probation officer at the time] observed countless law enforcement books, magazines, patches, badges, batons, and police-like duty belts, one of which contained a gun holster in which a BB gun - black in color - was discovered.\"\n\nThe complete story of what Jeremy did and how he got pinched is available now on Patreon. If for any reason that's not your speed, the complete post, along with the case records, will be available for free midweek in the same place.
