And it doesn\u2019t seem to be coming to an end anytime soon since it just gets all the more unclear and confusing over time. Amber Heard will reportedly be facing jail time because of all the years that went down in their marriage. But why exactly? \n\nI know you\u2019re curious too but first, hello everybody! Welcome back to another one of our juicy celebrity videos. If you\u2019re new here, please do hit the subscribe button to see more from our channel!\n\nDevoted fans can\u2019t seem to fathom Johnny Depp as someone who needs to defend himself and asking for help against his ex-wife because right from the very beginning, Amber Heard was able to convince people that she was the one in the wrong. The battle between the two ex-spouses has been going on for years now yet both sides have been seeking justice for what they seemingly endured depending on the version of the truth you believe. \n\nIt seemed quite difficult and unfair since both of their careers were entirely shaken, with Johnny Depp getting fired from his role as Grindelwald in Disney\u2019s Fantastic Beasts franchise and Amber Heard fueling rumors about getting replaced from her role as Mera in DC Comic\u2019s Aquaman. As the lengthy case went on, many have stepped in one the issue and came into Johnny\u2019s defense notably his ex-girlfriends Winona Ryder and Vanessa Paradis offering their testimonies. And with what came down was how it has become clear that Amber Heard has been creating a false narrative with what really happened the whole time regarding her accusation towards Depp being the predator and abusive one in the relationship. \n\nAnd need we say more on the red flags on Amber Heard\u2019s questionable behavior? The actress was also accused of pocketing a $7M divorce settlement from Depp that she initially promised to be donated to a charity. \n\nMoreover, according to a video published by CourtTV, during their libel case trial, Amber Heard was claiming to be repeatedly abused physically and emotionally by Depp. The \u201cAquaman\u201d star put on quite a show when demonstrating these past situations that took place between them in their whirlwind relationship. She tried to flip every situation for her to prove her accusations against Depp. \n\nIt seemed like an ultimate goal for her to achieve in this mess is to have Johnny be seen as a predator and for a little while, that did actually happen. However, with recent developments in the story, the only truth that is clear to the people about this lingering case is that the longer it goes on, the more obvious it is that the star is the one who is behind all the lies, and Johnny Depp was the actual victim overall.  \n\nIn addition, things might be going in a different direction soon given the new evidence and requests manifesting. Before the situation had deepened, Amber Heard represented herself in the public saying she was the face of the \u201cMe Too\u201d movement concerning victims speaking out against their abusers. And it gets even more embarrassing for her since it has been revealed that the actress falsified a scene of the alleged destruction she suffered at the hands of her ex-husband.  \n\nAnd it gets even more ironic that Amber\u2019s reason behind separating herself from Depp was the very same thing she did to Johnny - abuse. As a result, the actor lost substantial project deals and was exposed to public mockery with magazines and tabloids calling him a \u201cwifebeater\u201d, which led him to sue multiple publications on that matter.",
