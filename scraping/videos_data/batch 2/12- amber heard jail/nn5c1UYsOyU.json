            "description": "On July 16, 2018, two Cuyahoga County, Ohio corrections officers restrained, punched, and pepper sprayed Chantelle Glass\u2014a mother of three jailed over an out-of-state traffic warrant\u2014for asking to make a phone call. This video shows the torture and some of Ms. Glass's suffering afterward as jail personnel failed to properly decontaminate her. It also shows jail personnel's indifference to and amusement at Ms. Glass's suffering.\n\nOn July 9, 2019, The Chandra Law Firm filed in the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas civil-rights claims on Ms. Glass's behalf against Cuyahoga County and corrections officers Robert Marsh (who restrained and punched Ms. Glass) and Idris-Farid Clark (who pepper-sprayed her).\n\nThis torture incident took place less than two months after Cuyahoga County Executive Armond Budish demanded and obtained the firing of Nurse Gary Brack for blowing the whistle to County Council on jail conditions.",
