            "description": "Woman not wearing pants in court video.\n\nA black girl from Kentucky was humiliated by jail officials when she was brought into a courtroom without pants, leaving a Louisville judge in disbelief.\n\n\u201cAm I in the Twilight Zone right now?\u201d Judge Amber Wolf asked on courtroom video Friday afternoon. \n\nThe female defendant in the video was in jail for failing to complete a diversion program for a prior shoplifting charge. During her time at Metro Corrections in Louisville she said she was never given a uniform and was forced to spend her time there without pants or feminine hygiene products.\n\nWolf immediately began making phone calls to Metro Corrections officials in the video, outraged over the treatment of the woman.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not trying to embarrass you, I\u2019m very sorry,\u201d Wolf told the defendant in court. \u201cCan we get her something to cover up with? Anything, anything, anything. I don\u2019t care what it is.\u201d\n\nSteve Durham, a spokesman for the jail, told local station WDRB that the woman had not been in custody long enough to receive a jail jumpsuit. She had been in the jail for three days prior to her court appearance.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d Wolf can be heard saying on the phone. \u201cI am holding her here until she is dressed appropriately to go back to jail. This is outrageous.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is her only charge ever,\u201d Wolf added. \u201cShe should have been in jail for maybe a day, tops.\u201d\n\nJail officials contend that the woman was wearing athletic shorts covered by a long shirt, according to WDRB. The defendant told the judge other inmates at the facility were also being denied proper clothing and basic hygiene products.",
