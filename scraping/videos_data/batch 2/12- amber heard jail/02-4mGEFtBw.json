Well, well, this isn't true at all. It's Johnny Depp who's been suffering. Dealing with all kinds of torture and psychological abuse was an unfair time for JD.\n\nBut past cases were more than a thriller soap opera with all sorts of twists and turns. Amber Heard has already won her case against Johnny in the UK, after which she wants to tell the fact that Johnny Depp accused her in her .\n\nAccording to Amber's lawyer, Depp frequently committed domestic violence against her. This is a supplementary demand for issues, and Johnny Depp cannot win any proceedings.\n\nAs a result, Depp's accusations against Hard will be rejected as a whole. However, this was revealed in her Fairfax County Docket submitted on April 13th, and now this subject has been taken over from her April 11th, 2020.\n\nAmber Heard tried to manipulate evidence and testimony, but the Pirates of the Caribbean Star seems to be true on his part. There is a lot of drama in this turmoil. Johnny was a quiet man, and his ex-wife also supported him on many suspicions, but by Amber Heard, all good things are all in vain.\n\nWell, she was pretty young during her TV debut. In 2017, Heard joined the DC Extended Universe, where she was the Atlantic Queen Mela in the superhero movies Justice League (2017), Aquaman (2018) and Zack Snyder Justice (2021). Played.\n\nThe movie was released all over the world and made huge profits. In addition, Aquaman Star was also a spokesman for his Parisian brand cosmetics L'Or\u00e9al in 2018.\n\nShe also appeared to be part of the cast of Bret Easton Ellis' new book, but the film failed. However, her informal failure did not affect Amber's career, as Amber maintained a very balanced personality since she entered the industry as a television actress.\n\nHeard officially came out in 2010 and gave her opinion on her sexuality. The actress said, \"I haven't written about myself in any way. I have a relationship with a man.\u201d\n\nReturning to the undiscussed drama, Amber Heard could face four years of imprisonment for her actions in the battle between her and Johnny Depp. The story begins on the day when Herad decides to accuse Johnny of domestic violence, followed by a defamation case. As a result, the results of the defamation proceedings have not yet been published and the hearing is in 2022. Postponed to the year.\n\nAfter the trip, Heard accused Johnny Depp of committing domestic violence on her. However, in response, Johnny Depp denied the heavy and unbelievable remarks from his ex-wife \n\nHowever, Amber never considered Johnny's statements and brought her proceedings to . Apart from misplacing evidence, Amber is in trouble because of her ridiculous behaviour.\n\nHowever, cleverly, Amber got out of this claim by stating that she was unaware of the Australian government's strict laws on pets and didn't want to interfere with the authorities. As a result, she was able to escape the accusation until the Australian government decided to investigate the case again.\n\nFearing to lose his job, Amber's manager became a companion to her misbehaviour. While answering the other side of her story, Amber disagreed with her manager's confession before the , and she didn't even threaten him. But that's not all, it's still in progress, and no decision has been made yet. \n\nHowever, the couple divorced in 2017 and will meet each other in a proceeding. Isn't it love? The defamation proceedings were postponed to 2022.\n\nAs an important fact, Johnny's team has begun looking for fragments of evidence to help win not only Johnny's defamation proceedings but also many other proceedings filed by Amber Heard.\n\nAmber Heard has already won a libel proceeding against Johnny Depp, but the ball isn't on Amber's anyway. Johnny Depp's team is on a mission to prove that Amber Heard's misplaced evidence is beneficial to Johnny Depp's case. \n\nIt is clear that Amber has put the in the wrong place and attempted to cheat by hiding important evidence.
