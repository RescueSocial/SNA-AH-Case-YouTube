This clearly shows that Amber Heard is lying. You will hear what the judge had to say to Amber Heard. It is the newest piece of celebrity news.\n\nWhile some celebrities prefer living a quiet life away from the public, others just have so many scandals following them. In this video, we are going to talk about Johnny Depp and Amber Heard, who have been on each other\u2019s throats ever since they split up and how Amber Heard might be facing jail time for one mistake she made in all this.\n\nWith the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases.
