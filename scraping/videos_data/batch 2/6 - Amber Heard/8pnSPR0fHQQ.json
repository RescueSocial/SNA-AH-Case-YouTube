Fans are upset that Amber Heard is not fired from the movie in the same way that her ex-husband Johnny Depp was dropped from the Fantastic Beasts franchise, where he had played the dark wizard Grindelwald. And now it seems that with the controversial reputation that Amber Heard has, the film has every chance of failure. And if the massive failure happens, how would Jason Momoa going to respond with his income at stake?\nThe divisive and public divorce between Amber Heard and Johnny Depp resulted in allegations of domestic ab*se by both parties, with Amber Heard initially winning widespread sympathy for her claims. When the whole thing started, the whole world believed Amber Heard that she was a victim and she even wrote an op-ed for Washington Post about being a domestic a*se survivor. She called herself a \u2018public figure representing domestic ab*se\u2019 and she said: \u2018I feel the full force of our culture\u2019s wrath for women who speak out\u2019. \nBut then, after Johnny Depp aired his side of the story, social media opinion swung in his favor. Moreover, many evidences proving that Amber Heard was a liar surfaced and people realized they executed the wrong person. Johnny Depp also lost a civil suit against British tabloid The Sun in a case centered on a 2018 article that referred to him as a \u201cwife-beater.\u201d But fans already understood who is the wolf in a sheep\u2019s clothing. \nBut Johnny Depp\u2019s career was already over. He was fired from several roles, including the role of wizard Grindelwald in the Fantastic Beasts franchise and the Pirate Captain Jack Sparrow. He recently even spoke up about cancel culture and stated that Hollywood is boycotting him for nothing and that it is unfair that his career is ruined. \nHowever, Amber Heard\u2019s career is fine. She is still a L\u2019Or\u00e9al Paris ambassador, has been invited to huge events like Paris Fashion Week and she still plays a role of Mera in Aquaman 2. When it became clear that JD\u2019s reputation and career is over, fans couldn\u2019t just sit and do nothing. So, they decided to remove Amber Heard from the Aquaman 2. They created an online petition calling on Warner Bros. to remove Amber Heard from the upcoming comic book tentpole \u201cAquaman 2\u201d. Despite the fact that the petition has garnered over 1.6 million signatures and was fast approaching the 2 million mark, it didn't help at all.\nAs for the Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom producer Peter Safran, he said the campaign had no bearing on Amber Heard\u2019s role in the forthcoming movie, saying on Deadline\u2019s Hero Nation podcast that he doesn\u2019t \u201cthink we\u2019re ever going to react to, honestly, pure fan pressure. You gotta do what\u2019s best for the movie. We felt that if it\u2019s James Wan, and Jason Momoa, it should be Amber Heard. That\u2019s really what it was. One is not unaware of what is going on in the Twitter-verse, but that doesn\u2019t mean you have to react to it or take it as gospel or accede to their wishes. You have to do what\u2019s right for the film, and that\u2019s really where we landed on it.\u201d\nAs for Amber Heard, she said in November that she was \"super excited\" to return as Mera in \"Aquaman 2\" and she wasn\u2019t really bothered by that petition at all. She also shared multiple photos on her Instagram preparing to the role of Mera. Here is the photo of Amber getting ready in gym for Aquaman 2. And here is another photo of Amber wearing Mera\u2019s suit. She captioned the photo: \u2018Forgot my pajamas #tbt #aquaman2\u2019. She also addressed the protests in a statement to Entertainment Weekly when the hate comments slammed her in the face: \"Paid rumors and paid campaigns on social media don't dictate [casting decisions] because they have no basis in reality\".\n\nSo, now I want to know your opinion. Do you think Amber Heard\u2019s reputation will affect Aquaman 2 movie? If so, do you think Jason Momoa will really sue her? Let me know your opinion in the comments section down below.
