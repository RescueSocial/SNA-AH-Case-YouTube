            "description": "Amber Heard Furiously Reacts To Johnny Depp Calling Her Out On Live TV!\n\nSubscribe to Binge Watch -  http://tiny.cc/bingewatch\n\nWATCH NEXT \ud83d\udc47\n\nAmber Heard Booed And Humiliated As Her Show Flops\u2026\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Klv09j42dS8\n\nRelated videos:\n\n\"I LIED\" Amber Heard Apologies to Johnny Depp (IG LIVE VIDEO)\n\nhttps://youtu.be/pLYxM0ztStg\n\nAmber Heard FURIOUS AT Johnny Depp Calling Her Out On Live TV - VOWS TO GET REVENGE | The Gossipy\n\nhttps://youtu.be/4uwjYXZ_Zi8\n\n\nIt is a pattern. Every time Johnny Depp speaks at any public event, Amber Heard posts something on her social media. This time response from Amber Heard came only a few hours after Johnny Depp had decried \u2018cancel culture\u2019 before receiving San Sebastian\u2019s top prize. Was it a coincidence? Or Amber Heard can\u2019t stand the idea that JD is still loved by millions of people?\nIt seems like Johnny Depp and Amber Heard\u2019s legal battle has taken another place to fight each other. Not in a court, but in real life and on social media. And Amber Heard is yet again the one who attacks JD for no reason! \nOn September 22 Johnny Depp was invited to the San Sebastian Film Festival to receive a Donostia Award. It is great to know that although the entire Hollywood is boycotting him, Johnny still manages to get some awards during such difficult times! To list all the awards and nominations Johnny Depp has received in the past, we need to create another video, so let me just mention that he is a living legend!\nHis career started at the age of 21 as one of Freddy Krueger\u2019s victims in A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984), and over the years, a relationship with the audience crystallized in the early 90s with his lead roles in multiple movies. But his biggest role ever is undoubtedly, a Captain Jack Sparrow! There\u2019s no person alive who doesn\u2019t like this crazy and funny captain! Johnny Depp has played writers, undercover cops or outlaws, almost always misfits, and he has actually starred with the most famous actors ever! Like Pen\u00e9lope Cruz, Kate Winslet, Morgan Freeman, Michelle Pfeiffer, Leonardo Di Caprio, Angelina Jolie, and many, many others! But now\u2026 Even for all his merits and roles, his life has unpredictably changed, due to the legal fight with his ex-wife Amber Heard and Hollywood took the position of boycotting the actor, because he was slandered and called a \u2018wife beater\u2019.\nYou all already know this story, so we won\u2019t be repeating it again, so let\u2019s jump straight to the latest updates on JD\u2019s life and career. It's been the third time Johnny Depp visited the Festival following his fleeting appearance in 1998 with Terry Gilliam, and his visit in 2020 for the participation of Crock of Gold: A Few Rounds with Shane MacGowan. Every time JD appears on public events, he makes his fans crazy about him, and this time around his speech literally left the crowd stunned. \nAfter he took the stage and the audience greeted him with a thunderous ovation, Johnny began his speech talking about his battered reputation and condemned cancel culture amid his ongoing legal woes with his ex-wife, Amber Heard. Due to the fact that Hollywood is currently boycotting him, Johnny Depp said that \u2018no one is safe\u2019 and stated: \u201cIt can be seen as an event in history that lasted for however long it lasted, this cancel culture, this instant rush to judgment based on what essentially amounts to polluted air\u201d.\nTrailing off again while, presumably, looking for the right words, he shifted a bit, expressing that in his opinion, \u201cIt\u2019s so far out of hand now that I can promise you that no one is safe. Not one of you. No one out that door. No one is safe.\u201d \u201cIt takes one sentence and there\u2019s no more ground, the carpet has been pulled. It\u2019s not just me that this has happened to, it\u2019s happened to a lot of people.\u201d\n\u201cThis type of thing has happened to women, men. Children have suffered from various types of unpleasantries. Sadly, at a certain point they begin to think that it\u2019s normal. Or that it\u2019s them. When it\u2019s not.\u201d\n\u201cI believe that if you are armed with the truth, then that\u2019s all you need,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if a judgement\u2026has taken some artistic license,\u201d he chuckled, perhaps referencing his unsuccessful bid to overturn a judge\u2019s ruling in his U.K. libel case.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBinge Watch - Binge Watch is the best source of the latest celebrity news.
