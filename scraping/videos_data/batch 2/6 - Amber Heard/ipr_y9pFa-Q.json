Apparently, Jason has finally reached his limit and has started taking action so Amber Heard finally leaves her role as Mera in Aquaman 2.

Jason has also tried to stay away from Amber\u2019s personal life not to get involved in her drama. But recent revelations seem to indicate that Jason has had enough and has started to take matters into his own hands to remove her from the movie. But how exactly has he been trying to push her away? \r\n\n#AmberHeard #JohnnyDepp #JasonMomoa",
