Now, the tables have turned and recently Amber Heard failed big time! L\u2019Oreal Paris invited Amber Heard to model for the Le Defile L'Oreal Paris Womenswear Spring/Summer 2022 on Paris Fashion Week. But Johnny Depp\u2019s fans were not happy to see her there so they booed her!\nThe annual Paris Fashion Week is back and better than ever as the designer presentations hit the streets of Paris. The event began on September 28 and closed on October 6. This event is always amazing, glamorous and so many fashionistas and influencers are looking forward to it. As always, the iconic fashion event continued to host an array of famous faces dressed to impress in their best attires. From Oscar-winning actress Helen Mirren to the most recent Cinderella, Camilla Cabello, the event had a seat for everybody at its table. But there was someone who was not really wanted to be seen\u2026 everywhere. Yes, that\u2019s Amber Heard who we are talking about.\nEver since Amber Heard began her vicious Johnny Depp career ruining plan, people all over the world want her to be sued, punished and closed in prison. She literally ruined Johnny Depp\u2019s life and career and many people think that\u2019s unfair that someone like Amber Heard keeps on getting roles, having fun and being invited to really special events like Paris Fashion Week.\nJust before showing up at such a huge event, Amber Heard took to Twitter and shared a photo of herself getting her hair and makeup done as the cosmetics and skincare giant L\u2019Or\u00e9al Paris celebrates the 50th anniversary of its slogan \"Because you\u2019re worth it.\" In the photo, portions of Amber Heard's blonde hair are wrapped around brushes as a team of hairstylists blow-dries her tresses.\n\"It takes an army (of hair brushes). BTS from @lorealparisUSA @loreal lorealparis 50yearsofworth worthit,\" Amber Heard captioned the photo, without mentioning when the image was taken. And guess what, Amber Heard was mocked by some Twitter users just for posting this photo! \nSomeone accused her of sharing sharing a pic from 2019, posting side-by-side images of the actress before and after getting ready. \"Not Amber Heard posting backstage photos from Sep 2019 w/L\u2019Oreal to make it seem like she is relevant and working in 2021. Girl, your jewelry told on you,\" the person wrote. But the person was absolutely wrong\u2026\nIn a follow-up post, Amber Heard shared a video of herself talking about the famous L'Or\u00e9al tagline. \"50 Years Of Worth is an anthem of action,\" she says in the clip. \"It's an anthem of our power, our importance, our value, and a reminder that it's worth fighting for.\" And of course, this one was also attacked by mulriple Johnny Depp\u2019s fans.\nBut what about Amber Heard\u2019s appearance on Paris Fashion Week? Well, her appearance on the most amazing event of the fall in Europe has left fans raging. Amber Heard hit the runway on October 3, alongside Mirren for \u201cLe Defile L\u2019Oreal Paris Womenswear Spring/Summer 2022.\" Amber Heard wore a baby pink jumpsuit with feathered slitted sleeves and a deep neckline, complete with floaty drape details stemming from the waist. Yes, let\u2019s be honest, she looked good! But despite the fact that she looked good, fans were there not to estimate her looks. \nWhile the actress rocked the runway, many were left wondering how she had been allowed to attend in the first place. Well, it is well-known that Amber Heard has been L\u2019Or\u00e9al Paris face and ambassador for a while now. And people are said to be disappointed that Amber Heard remains a spokesperson for beauty brand L'Oreal. She was among the brand representatives who walked the runway on Sunday. And it\u2019s not the first time when L\u2019Oreal Paris shows their support to Amber Heard. When it became clear that Amber Heard was the one, who abused, L\u2019Or\u00e9al Paris posted a picture of Heard as part of their WomenMakeCinema series. And the company described Amber Heard as an actress who \u201chighlights that a woman\u2019s inner beauty is what we should value the most.\u201d\nBut many fans / followers of L\u2019Or\u00e9al\u2019s page were quick to point out the absurdity of supporting an abuser, let alone to portray her as an empowering role model for women. And fans even went that far so they called for a boycott to the brand, threatening to never buy L\u2019Or\u00e9al (or their affiliate brand, Maybelline) again.\n\n\n\nBinge Watch - Binge Watch is the best source of the latest celebrity news.
