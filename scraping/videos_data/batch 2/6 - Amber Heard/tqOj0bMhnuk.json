In the video, the \u201cAquaman\u201d star is holding onto her baby as she tries a green juice. Oonagh looks precious wearing a beige onesie with rainbows on it as she looks around the room. \u201cYou can take the gal out of LA, but you can\u2019t take LA out of the gal #notajuicer,\u201d Amber captioned the post. This is the first video Amber has shared of her daughter since she announced her birth last Thursday. \u201cMy daughter was born on April 8, 2021. Her name is Oonagh Paige Heard. She\u2019s the beginning of the rest of my life,\u201d she wrote on Twitter.",
