Amber Heard has officially apologized for everything because what I\u2019m about to show you is going to blow you away. The judge seemed to be absolutely done with Amber Heard and her lawyer and we got the whole transcript over here. I\u2019m going to read through the most relevant and important parts and you\u2019ll see within a minute how Amber Heard literally lost that one. I don\u2019t think anything else could have happened that would show more clearly than this that Amber Heard is lying, at least. I\u2019m not just saying that; once you hear what the judge had to say to Amber Heard, you\u2019ll actually be surprised.\n\nHere on Film Streak we are all about the latest spill in Hollywood!
