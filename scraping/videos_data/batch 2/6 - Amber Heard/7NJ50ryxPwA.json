Johnny and Vanessa had a whirlwind romance and only three months after they started dating, she became pregnant with their daughter Lily-Rose Depp.\n\n Their son Jack was born three years later. Johnny Depp said in the interview that fatherhood has \"changed everything\". The family did their best to maintain a low-key existence, keeping their lives under the radar as much as possible. Despite his current status as a loving father, Johnny was once known for his rebellious behavior.\n\nParadis and Depp surprised the world when they announced they had \u201camicably separated\u201d in 2012. Both had previously talked about the strain that their conflicting schedules had on their relationship.
