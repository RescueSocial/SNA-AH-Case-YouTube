            "title": "Johnny Depp Scores MAJOR WIN In Case With Amber Heard! Amber Heard Johnny Depp Lawsuit Updates!",
            "description": "It has indeed been a great week so far for Johnny Depp fans, when he scored a huge victory in the recent events relating to his $50 million dollar defamation case against former wife Amber Heard. Just recently, a big win in Johnny Depp\u2019s team was celebrated when the Virginian court held his case against Amber announcing that they will be looking into the missing report of donations that Amber Heard claimed to have given to a charity. That $7 million dollars that the actress had vowed to donate is actually nowhere to be found. So where has it gone? This $7 million dollars is part of Amber Heard\u2019s divorce settlement money from Johnny when the couple officially split in 2017. So what had really been the result of these recent judge rulings and what awaits the former couple after this huge victory for Johnny Depp? Let\u2019s find all that out in this video. But before anything else, make sure to subscribe to our channel first and hit that notification bell for more updates on the famous Johnny Depp - Amber Heard million dollar case. Now, let\u2019s begin!\n\nAfter the divorce was finalized in 2017, it might have seemed to be the end of it all. But nope, the real chaos for the former couple was just about to start. Despite all the evidence continuing to surface about Johnny and Amber\u2019s real marriage life story, including the recorded phone call where Amber admitted to hitting Johnny, the alleged affairs of the actress with actor James Franco and mega businessman Elon Musk, which later on was somehow proven true because the two did actually date for one whole year after Amber\u2019s divorce with Johnny, and the missing $7 million dollar\u2019s worth of divorce settlement that was promised by the actress to be donated to charity. All these allegations and evidence against Amber Heard were all disregarded by the UK newspaper company The Sun, calling Johnny Depp a name that until now rings untrue for the actor. Because of this nickname given to him by a British tabloid, he filed for a libel case, to which he unfortunately lost. But what\u2019s more of a bummer in that event was that Johnny lost his chance to reprise his role in the 2022 third installment of the Fantastic Beasts series. Johnny\u2019s team defended and is continuing to claim that Amber is viewing herself to the public as a victim rather than a perpetrator. And that her allegations were part of an \"elaborate hoax to generate positive publicity\" for the actress. \n\nBut lately, there has been recent progress in the Johnny Depp \u2013 Amber Heard case. As you remember, Amber Heard tried not only one, not even two, but three times to get Johnny\u2019s defamation case to be dismissed at court, defending that Johnny Depp already lost his libel case against news publisher The Sun, so that should count, right? But the judges seem to be full of Amber\u2019s lies too and they even warned her that she\u2019d receive serious consequences if proven that she was just wasting the court\u2019s time. Meanwhile, if Amber had this card with her of a lost libel case against a UK news company, but Johnny also had his own game card, and that is the missing $7 million dollars\u2019 worth of donation from her divorce settlement with the actor. Yes, you heard that right. For Amber to prove that she was not really just after the 58 year old actor\u2019s wealth during their marriage and split, she pledged to donate half of her divorce settlement to charity. Which she did\u2026Kidding! No one really knows up until now where that huge sum of money went, which helped Johnny win a legal ruling from a New York judge that will force the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) to reveal how much money his ex-wife, actress Amber Heard, actually donated to them after Amber claimed that she donated half of it. Johnny and his lawyers believe that the Aquaman actress has been lying about the size of her donation, and they believe that proving that she lied will be a major factor in the upcoming suit against Amber that will make it to court in Virginia next year. The donation amounts matter because one of the reasons that the judge gave for believing Amber's version of events over Johnny's was that one of the Fantastic Beasts actor's biggest claims was that Amber only married him for his money. It is also significant as the promised donation was cited by a judge in the UK while deciding on a libel case brought about by Johnny against publishers of The Sun. In February, Amber Heard had already stated that she had donated the divorce settlement money to charity.\n\nJohnny Depp has endured a lot so far.
