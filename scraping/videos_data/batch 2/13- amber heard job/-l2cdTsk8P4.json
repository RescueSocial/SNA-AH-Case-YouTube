Their case grows more heated everyday and it can be seen that the effects of the case are only distressing Depp even more. Everybody doubts his personality and character, and he struggles to show that he is not what people think. If you paid attention to him at some points in his life, he sort of warned, even if you didn't know what was happening to him.\n\nThe first warning sign might be a bit controversial, but it's something that needs to be said because of the two of them. Amber bombed him with what appeared to be love. What's weird is that shortly after he began dating, Amber heard, Johnny Depp's career began to go off on a tangent. Something clearly wasn't right in his life.  It was clear that she had an agenda, namely to get married to Johnny in order to progress her own career and/or to benefit financially, and she knew how to bring it about.\n\nIt is clear that Amber Heard was the one who filed for divorce from Johnny Depp. At one point, Amber alleged that Depp had physically abused her during their relationship. It was in fact quite shocking to his fans as well as the people who worked with Depp, as this side of Johnny was never witnessed by them.  When Amber provided the court with such reasons, Depp denied these accusations and even stated that all this was being done by Amber in her best interests, and not his.  Johnny Depp made a statement that Amber Heard was the abuser. Initially, everyone was siding with Amber, but eventually the truth about her violent nature came out.\n\nDepp had filed a defamation case against Heard. In an article published by the Washington Post, Amber Heard shared her feelings about Johnny Depp, using explicit content, damaging Depp's image, leading to the beginning of the $50 million law suit against Amber Heard. Many believed that it was all a joke, that she orchestrated this to gain the public's attention. But she got away really fast with that. With the content of the article being attacked, the lawsuit did not end. Over the years, several more elements have been added that have proven to be useful proof in support of Depp.\n\nJohnny Depp released audio of Amber Heard and himself talking about the abuse. The audio leaks seemed to be an interesting development which puts Heard in the spotlight. In the tapes, Amber Heard and Johnny Depp can be heard attempting to solve their marriage issues. In one part of the tape, Depp accused Heard of punching him. This tape was surely a big step in proving Depp\u2019s innocence. At this point, Heard was truly exposed for who she was, including all her anger issues and violence she was claimed to have. This was one of the most solid forms of proof that helped enable him to be proved as the innocent in this messy trial.\n\nAmber posted the photo of herself, claiming that Johnny had hit her with an iPhone. Amber went to court and received a restraining order against Johnny Depp. On investigating further into Amber\u2019s bruises, they seemed to be fake, because the next day she made an appearance with no trace, not even a single scratch on her. Did she think the truth wouldn't come out at all?\n\nIf Amber Heard truly was the one to have faced being physically harmed but why was Johnny Depp\u2019s finger left severed? Johnny Depp describes a time where Amber threw a couple of bottles at him. Depp goes into detail on what happened and how his finger was injured due to it. When questioned about his bandages later by Dakota Johnson, Johnny Depp answers vaguely. He avoids the question with a joke. Later, Amber has admitted over audio that she did in fact hit Johnny with a bottle and hurt his finger. This was out as a part of the ongoing lawsuit filed against his ex-wife. \n\nDepp did a fabulous job in the movie \u201cAlice Through The Looking Glass\u201d. His fans were quite enlightened with his presence on the day of its premiere, but the same cannot be said about Johnny Depp! Unfortunately, we all assumed his speech to include his dark humor which he constantly brings out from time to time but indeed many believe it to be a cry for help. \n\n#BluffCentral #AmberHeard #JohnnyDepp #JusticeForJohnnyDepp #AmberHeardAbuser #MeToo",
