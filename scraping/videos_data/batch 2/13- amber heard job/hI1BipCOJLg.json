You have 10 days from the date you file for a marriage license to tie the knot in Oklahoma.

Reportedly only close friends and family will attend the ceremony. \n\nJames Franco has agreed to pay more than $2 million to settle a class-action lawsuit filed by former students alleging that female students at his Studio 4 Film School were sexually exploited. The lawsuit alleged that Franco\u2019s acting and filmmaking school was actually a setup to provide a stream of young, impressionable women for sexual and financial exploitation. The former students claimed that Franco and his partners encouraged actresses to disrobe for explicit sex scenes and those who did were given preferential treatment. \n\n\r\nBecome a Fan! - http://Facebook.com/HollywoodTV \r\nFollow Us! - http://Twitter.com/HollywoodTV \r\n\r\nHTV is on the job 24/7, covering celebrity events including  Tribeca Film Festival, The Screen Actors Guild Awards, Sundance, NY Fashion Week as well as all the red carpet movie premiers in Los Angeles and New York.",
