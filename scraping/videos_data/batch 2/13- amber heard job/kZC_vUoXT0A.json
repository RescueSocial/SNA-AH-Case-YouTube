So, get your daily dose of laughter with Jethalal, Taarak Mehta, Daya, Champaklal and their neighbors in Gokuldham Society.\n\nAbout Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah:\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe show is inspired from the famous humorous column 'Duniya Ne Undha Chasma' written by the eminent Gujarati writer Mr. Tarak Mehta. This story revolves around daily happenings in \"Gokuldham Co-operative Society\" and covers topical issues which are socially relevant. The show predominantly - revolves around 'Jethalal' (Dilip Joshi) who is an uneducated Gujarati businessman. Your 'Taarak Mehta' (Shailesh Lodha), is his neighbor. 'Jethalal' finds a friend and philosopher in 'Taarak Mehta' and often goes to him for advice whenever he is in trouble. Jethalaal's family includes his simpleton wife 'Daya Ben' (Disha Wakani) and a mischievous son 'Tapu' (Bhavya Gandhi / Raj Anadkat). Tapu is a menace and a constant source of trouble to all the members of Gokuldham. They have often warned 'Jethalal' to reform 'Tapu' or else be prepared to leave the premises. Lost hopes of being heard by his son push Jethalaal' to call his father 'Champaklal' (Amit Bhatt) from the village. This was his great idea of leashing some control over the mischievous Tapu. The opposite happens and the grandfather joins hands with the grandson to make life a roller coaster troublesome ride for Jethalal.\n\nCast:\n---------\nDilip Joshi as Jethalal Champaklal Gada\nDisha Vakani as Daya Jethalal Gada\nRaj Anadkat / Bhavya Gandhi as Tipendra Jethalal Gada (Tapu) \nAmit Bhatt as Champaklal Jayantilal Gada\nShailesh Lodha as Taarak Mehta\nNeha Mehta as Anjali Taarak Mehta\nTanuj Mahashabde as Krishnan Subramaniam Iyer\nMunmun Dutta as Babita Krishnan Iyer\nMandar Chandwadkar as Aatmaram Tukaram Bhide\nSonalika Joshi as Madhvi Aatmaram Bhide\nNidhi Bhanushali / Palak Sidhwani as Sonalika Aatmaram Bhide (Sonu) \nGurucharan Singh/ Balwinder suri as Roshan Singh Harjeet Singh Sodhi\nJennifer Mistry Bansiwal as Roshan Kaur Roshan Singh Sodhi\nKavi Kumar Azad / Nirmal Soni as Dr. Hansraj Hathi \nAmbika Ranjankar as Komal Hansraj Hathi\nKush Shah as Gulabkumar Hansraj Hathi (Goli)\nShyam Pathak as Popatlal Pandey\nSharad Sankla as Abdul\nAzhar Shaikh as Pinku \n\nProduced By: Neela Asit Modi, Asit Kumarr Modi \nSpecial Thanks: Mahesh Vakil, Indu Tarak Mehta\nSet Design: Jayant Deshmukh\nOn-Air Promotion  ( SAB): SAB OAP\nCostume Designer: Alka Mehta\nCostume Stylist: Ekta Brahmbhatt\nSound Recordist: Shakeel Mansuri \nCameraman: Aamir Virani\nProduction Head: Arvind Marchande\nProduction Controler: Vinod Shishupal\nBackground Music: Sunil Patni\nOnline Editors: Vishal Tambe, Sandeep Singh \nExecutive Producer: Jatin Yogesh Bajaj\nEditor: Dinesh Gosavi\nCreative Supervision: Krunal Khakhkhar\nOperation Head: Sohil Ramani\nDirectors: Harshad Joshi, Malav Suresh Rajda\n\nTelevision Adaptation and Designed By: Asit Kumarr Modi\n\nMore Useful Links :\n * Like us on Facebook : http://www.facebook.com/tmkoc.sabtv\n* Follow us on Instagram : http://www.instagram.com/taarakmehtakaooltahchashmahnfp\n * Follow us on Twitter : http://www.twitter.com/tmkoc_ntf\n* Visit us at : http://www.tmkoc.com\n\n#tmkoc #taarakmehta #tmkocsmileofindia",
