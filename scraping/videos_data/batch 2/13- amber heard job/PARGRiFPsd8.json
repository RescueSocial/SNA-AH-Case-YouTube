Then I am sorting and editing (In Final Cut Pro X studio) clips in order to make the best watch experience for you guys :) I use different stock footages (both free and paid), clips of videos that I can find related to the video and search images to visualize the narrative and story that I\u2019m trying to tell - I do Cuts, Slow-Motions, Play-backs, Reverse plays and add elements, images, memes and much more. \nThen comes the WRITING.. I am trying to use DRY english humor and COMMENTATE/REPORT/REACT about all the moments happened in the video to make it more entertaining and super-pleasurable to watch!\nAnd of course you all know my funny intros and especially outros you all love for each video - each one is different with some kind of funny voice impersonation :))\nMy good friend with perfect english voice helps me to Voice Over all the videos, because my english and voice are not even close to his - Thank you McRiddle!\nThen I research and add background music that most fit to the topic and i do play a lot with volume editing, cuts, sounds etc. to make it sound perfect.\nAfter all this is sorted together I start FINAL editing and revising of the video - I do more Cuts, Slow-Motions, Play-backs, Reverse plays and add more elements to get the best final output.\nThe commentary/editing style is unique and adds value by putting it into my own style and commentating all the clips stating my opinions/making it funnier in addition to a myriad of edits to the videos which transforms the work making it different and unique each video.\nI literally spend 8-14 hours everyday by producing my videos and i love it! ))\n-----------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 1.
