            "description": "Today\u2019s video is on the handsome and charismatic actor, Johnny Depp. I will be going over his facial structure and what features make him to be considered one of the most attractive men in Hollywood, and to see if his face is natural or achieved through cosmetic procedures. Some possibilities are Invisalign braces, tooth crowns, gold overlays, even some rumors of veneers. Whatever work he had done on his teeth, it was most likely done by a cosmetic dentist who is specialized to be an Orthodontist or Prosthodontist.\n\nJohnny Depp is an american actor born on June 9th, 1963 in Owensboro Kentucky. He is the youngest of four children. He was born to Betty Sue Palmer, a waitress, and John Christopher Depp, A civil engineer. Johnny was encouraged from a young age to express himself, and soon was involved in music and theater. Over his life he has made strides to extend his abilities in being an actor, producer, musician and even an entrepreneur. He founded his own film production company called infinitum Nihil.\u00a0\n\nJohnny\u2019s acting career took off with his first big roles in movies such as A Nightmare on Elm street, and then the show, 21 Jump Street. Later he became the highest paid actor ever, at the time, for his role in The Pirates of the Caribbean series. Over his entire career as an actor, he has amassed a net worth of over $200 million dollars and his movies have grossed over $8.7 billion dollars worldwide. #johnnydepp #Johnnydeppamberheard #sponsoredvideo\nThat is a lot of money to make. He has in more recent years been investing his money in a more diversified portfolio of Residential and commercial real estate, including some private islands.\u00a0\n\nJohnny Depps is known for his very handsome and stoic facial features. He has very strong cheekbones that are razor sharp. tHe rest of his face, including his jaw, are well formed and frame his face in a beautiful way. His face is topped off by his huge brown eyes that seep soulful essence. He was naturally born with a face that sells and is simply more attractive than the average man. There is only one major change that I can tell he could have possibly had, and that is a small rhinoplasty to remove some bulk from the bridge of his nose. Even then, I question if that is the case or not.\u00a0\nJohnny does have some things going on with his teeth. They are natural and have not changed much over the years, however the shape of some teeth could indicate teeth grinding while sleeping. Johnny Depp also has a love for gold onlays on his teeth and is seen with them throughout the years. These are usually placed by a prosthodontist, where they use 14k gold, or a resin that appears to be gold. He most likely chose 14k gold. The gold bonds to the Crown of the tooth and covers the normally exposed tooth enamel. Unlike most Hollywood elite, I do not suspect he uses teeth whitening solutions or teeth bleaching. So that's something natural about his teeth.\u00a0\n\nIt is possible that he had some straightening done to his teeth when he was younger or later in his career, he could have used clear teeth aligners such as invisalign to change his teeth to be straighter. Usually done with a trained orthodontist. However, with those things being easy to hide, it is hard to know unless there was a clear difference in how his front teeth looked, which there has not been so far.\u00a0\n\nVideo Credits:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ShMqtHleO4\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBlN0aIiRE8\n\nThis video contains a sponsored mention \"Idea Austin\"\nTop: https://www.prettylittlething.us/yellow-second-skin-square-neck-sleeveless-thong-bodysuit.html?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=google_shopping_usa&utm_content=usa&utm_term=product_target&sv_campaign_id=2060148132&istCompanyId=b972e4de-de58-4ac9-9a3c-d255a815fef9&istFeedId=48a9adb1-6dc5-403b-88e6-f2c612356ac6&istItemId=wiqqwqqxr&istBid=tzww&gclid=CjwKCAjw1K75BRAEEiwAd41h1KIstMUCUezUs7XV6afUZDAGUBOL3H_K6nEwD5YN1hwQdj4L5kBMfBoCEMoQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds\n\nEverything talked about in this video is MY OPINION ONLY and not actual medical facts about the individual represented here.\n\nPlease know that although I have a very informed opinion based on my own experience I am not an EXPERT or a Doctor.
