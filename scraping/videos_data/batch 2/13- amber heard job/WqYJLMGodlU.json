Amber Heard is now facing several allegations based on the content of this body cam footage. The body cam evidence was presented in April. Johnny Depp said that the body cam footage and his testimony are proof that Amber Heard started the whole series of lawsuits with lies that he abused her physically. Johnny Depp was reported by Amber\u2019s allies, with evidence, to have thrown the phone at Amber\u2019s face and also scattered their penthouse kitchen. However, the police claim through the videos gotten from their body cameras that the evidence of damage like broken glass, smashed wine, and damaged candelabras were all gotten from different places because they had actually been to the penthouse. The initial policemen that visited the penthouse told a completely different story from what the others claimed to see. The cops said that when they got to the property worth about 1.5 million dollars, they saw no significant injuries, nothing in a state of disarray or destruction and no sign of disturbance whatsoever. The newly released video clip of the bodycam of the cops now serves as evidence of the lack of credibility of Amber Heard\u2019s claims, as regards Johnny Depp domestically violating her. The LAPD, taking a very close and diligent look at the bodycam, confirmed that there was no evidence of disturbance inside the building. \n\nNumber 4: Amber Heard committing Perjury\nWith the current turn of events, Amber Heard might now be investigated by the LAPD for perjury. This is because her claims can no longer be believed to be true with the new sets of evidence in the case. Of course, this might be so as what she said in the court under oath contradicts the LAPD officers\u2019 statements backed up by the bodycam videos. What she has done by telling a lie under oath is called Perjury, and this offense is committed by people who have skeletons in their cupboard. \n\nNumber 3: Liar\nIf after a thorough investigation by the LAPD, Amber Heard was found out to have committed perjury, then that makes her a very big liar. That would also mean everything she has spoken and testimonies regarding her case with Johnny Depp might as well be lies. This would cause a drastic change in the direction of the case before this happened. If the LAPD finds enough evidence to back up the fact Amber Heard lied under oath and committed perjury, she has the potential to be arrested and also serve jail time. \n\nNumber 2: Johnny\u2019s Stand\nCases like that of Johnny and Amber such that are hard to hear about or experience as someone you once loved and cared for suddenly becomes a stranger to you and hurts you. This case has been going deeper and darker since its inception and Johnny has maintained his innocence throughout everything that has happened. He has taken a lot of hits as a result of the problems he was having and court cases with Amber Heard, which he seemed guilty of until recent developments. He was sacked by Disney removed from his role as Jack Sparrow in the legendary series, The Pirates of the Caribbean. Even though Disney later gave him his job back, that doesn\u2019t overrule the fact that they sacked him in the first place because of the scandal he was involved in with Amber Heard. He lost a lot of roles because studios did not want to associate with him just like Disney.\n\nNumber 1: What next?\nSo, what happens now? We wait. Based on how this case has developed, no one can say 100 percent that this case cannot be turned around in a whole different direction by another evidence surfacing from nowhere. So all we can do now is wait and see how things turn out with the LAPD investigation on Amber Heard\u2019s perjury. If found guilty, this might be a huge turning around for Johnny Depp. We hope that whatever happens from here, gives a better direction to this long-lasting case.\n\nViral Film Talk is the #1 celebrity channel dedicated to bringing fans the latest celebrity news, best tv shows, movies, entertainment, and exclusive video commentaries & more.
