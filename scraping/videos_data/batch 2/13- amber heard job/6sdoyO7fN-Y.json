In her statement, she stated that she did not see any bruises on Amber after her alleged fight with Johnny on the 24th of May 2016. It is clear that Amber was lying. \n\nNumber 9: Sia \nOut of nowhere, Sia popped up on Twitter where she made it known that she was in support of Depp. She tweeted and I quote; \u201cJust showing my public support for Johnny Depp. He is clearly the victim after hearing those tapes.\u201d Sia just wants to see Amber brought to justice and the truth is everyone does. \n\nNumber 8: Penelope Cruz\nPenelope Cruz said that although many years had passed and they had made numerous movies together, she saw him as an awesome friend. She also said that she was impressed with his unique sense of humor, his brilliant mind, and his kindness. She also mentioned that she was grateful for the time Johnny spent with her while she was pregnant. There is a low chance someone who did something that kind would hurt anyone. \n\nNumber 7: Vanessa Paradis\nVanessa Paradis clearly defended Johnny by saying that the statement Amber made against him was a lie. In her statement, she also mentioned that she had known Johnny for more than 25 years and that they raised two kids together which she really loved doing. She mentioned that through those 25 years, Johnny was a kind, attentive, affectionate person. \n\nNumber 6: Winona Ryder\nWinona Ryder publicly pledged her support for Johnny. She said that she could not wrap her head around the accusations and knew him as an honest and good man. She also said that he was an incredible, caring, and loving guy who protected her and also the people he cared about. She really pointed out that Johnny was a complete gentleman when they were dating.\n\nNumber 5: Paul Bettany\nPaul Bettany supported Johnny on Twitter by tweeting that he had known Depp for many years and that he was the most gentle, kindest, and the sweetest man he had ever known. \n\nNumber 4: Lily-Rose Depp \nLily-Rose Depp did a really good job defending her father against Amber Heard\u2019s claims. She posted an old picture of her and her dad when she was a baby. She captioned it stating her dad was a wonderful father to her and her brother. With all this, she just wanted everyone to know that there was no proof of anything and Amber just kept on making false claims. \n\nNumber 3: JK Rowling\nJK Rowling made a public statement after deciding with the studio executives not to remove Johnny from the Fantastic Beasts movie sequence. According to this statement, the studio recast Depp after hearing the claims made against him. JK Rowling also said that Amber Heard was hiding things and the fans did not know the complete story. This made her side with Johnny Depp. Filmmakers feel more comfortable working with a particular set of cast till the end of the film and the crew responsible for Fantastic Beasts were really happy to have Johnny be a part of them.  \n\nNumber 2: Javier Bardem\nJavier Bardem decided to make a statement in which he mentioned that aside from the fact that he loved Depp, he had also been a complete gentleman and a caring friend towards him and his family.  He also said that he was with Johnny because he saw a loving and caring person, and an extraordinary person who was willing to help anyone in need. \n\nNumber 1: Amber Heard\u2019s parents\nThis one came as a shock, and you will not believe what happened. It all started with some leaked text messages between Amber\u2019s parents and Johnny where they clearly stated that they were not comfortable with what happened. Amber Heard\u2019s parents also pointed out that the true motive behind what Amber was doing was extortion and not abuse. Amber\u2019s parents also told Depp that Amber\u2019s lawyers were the ones responsible for him being sued. From the text messages that were leaked, we can all see that Amber\u2019s parents did not believe what their daughter claimed had happened.  \n\nViral Film Talk is the #1 celebrity channel dedicated to bringing fans the latest celebrity news, best tv shows, movies, entertainment, and exclusive video commentaries & more.
