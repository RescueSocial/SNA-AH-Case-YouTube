            "description": "\"Amber Deserved It\" - James Franco Reacts To Johnny Depp Victory In Court\nThe battle between Amber Heard and Johnny Depp is raging on still, and in fact it's been going on for so long that apparently it's going to be getting a 2-part documentary on Discovery+. Yes...that is real, and it's going to be something...yeah that's as good as we can make that description. The problem though is that as compelling as that documentary is going to be, it's highly possible that the trial itself won't be over! As even now, there are things in motion to stir up the trial when it ACTUALLY happens in April of next year. Including a key witness which might spell doom for Heard. We'll break it down for you\n\nClick HERE To Enter The GIVEAWAY! https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbiT0LUIbQj6CQScvWHJeKQ?sub_confirmation=1\n\nAnd there you have it, everyone! A look at the situation that is going on with Amber Heard and Johnny Depp and how these new witnesses MAY go and change things up for the trial when it comes. Do you think that anything coming out in the next few months will seriously affect the verdict? Or do you think these two are going to go dancing in circles for as long as it takes until one of them finally bursts? And will you watch the documentary when it comes out?
