            "description": "Johnny Depp and Amber Heard are one Hollywood couple that makes sure to give back. The pair, who are currently in Brazil for the Rock in Rio music festival, took time out of their busy schedules on Thursday to help more than 200 Brazilians hear for the first time. The couple partnered with the Starkey Hearing Foundation to help distribute hearing aids to those in need. Amber fought back tears as she watched Johnny place the life-changing device on a young girl while she wrapped her arms around another. Later that night, Johnny brought some of those fans to watch his band, Hollywood Vampires, perform at the festival so they could hear music for the first time.\n\nhttp://www.popsugar.com/celebrity/Amber-Heard-Johnny-Depp-Brazil-September-2015-Pictures-38555671\nhttp://www.wochit.com\n\nThis video was produced by Wochit using http://wochit.com",
