            "description": "PLEASE, READ ALL THE DISCRIPTION BELOW. IT'S IMPORTANT. THANKS.\n\nThis video shows just facts. Johnny Depp and Amber Heard do make a beautiful, lovely and discreet couple and they just want to live their lives, and their love. They don't care about what people think or about the ridiculous made up tabloid stories.\n\nThey like to stay with each other, they like to do things together. And they like also to wear each other's things. It's not corny. It's romantic, poetic, beautiful and pure. That's what couples in love use to do.\n\nIt's a serious relationship, not just a fling or an affair, like some people thought last year. And that \"on-and-off\" thing was also a tabloid lie. They've  been together for almost two years, as you can see in the pictures we have on this video.\n\nAnd forget words like: \"cheater\", \"home wrecker\", \"mid life crisis\", \"gold digger\" and things like that, because all those things come from tabloids and all those rumors are absolutely untrue, as this video proves to you.\n\nThe former couples (Johnny and Vanessa, Amber and Tasya) just grew apart. And Amber has NOTHING to do with Johnny's breakup with Vanessa, in 2011.\n\nIn June-2012 Johnny Depp's publicist Robin Baum confirmed that he had split from Vanessa and that it was amicable. The confirmation came many months after the fact.\n\nWe have Johnny's own words. He gave an interview to Rolling Stone Magazine (July-2013 issue) and told that his relationship with his ex was difficult. \"It was not easy for me, not easy for her.\" He explained: \"the trajectory of that relationship... you play it out until it goes, and a thing takes to another\". He also said that the end of the relationship doesn't stop the fact that \"you care about that person, that their are the mother of your kids, you'll always know that person, and their will always be in your life because of those kids\". So, he said that he made things as better as possible. See? He respects his ex. He is a gentleman, he never said bad things about any of his exes. EVER. And the children accepted that break ups are \"part of life\" (as Johnny said). \"It's normal. You don't have to hate each other\", he said on a TV show.\n\nVanessa also said that the relationship was difficult. She said that even though she was still in love with him, she was unhappy. She also said that something didn't work in their relationship from the beginning. \"If something in your love doesn't work in the beginning, it will never work\". She said in a French interview recently that \"love in first sight exists but soon or later it ends\". And once she said, two years ago (when, as  we know, they were breaking up) that their relationship was complicated, like a Rubik cub. \n\nAll these proves once for all that Johnny's former relationship did not work (and it seems that there were serious problems and differences since the beginning) it was not Amber's falt. Not at all.\n\nAmber appeared in Johnny's life to bring him love, happiness, health, youth, spice and warm!",
