            "description": "Johnny Depp arrived at the High Court today to hear evidence from his security team and property managers as his high-profile libel case continues over allegations of domestic violence by his ex-wife Amber Heard. The court is due to hear evidence from Malcolm Connolly, part of Depp's security team; Tara Roberts, the property manager at Depp's Bahamas home; and Hilda Vargas, Depp's housekeeper at his Los Angeles properties. Heard's assistant Savannah McMillan is also due to appear, one day after Depp, 57, finally finished giving evidence and claimed that allegations of domestic violence made by Heard, 34, 'mirrored' her abuse towards him. On the final day of his evidence at the Royal Courts of Justice in London yesterday in his libel case against The Sun, Depp said: 'It seemed like everything she would accuse me of was something she had done to me.'\n\nOriginal Article: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8520761/Amber-Heard-Johnny-Depp-High-Court-day-six-libel-trial.html\nOriginal Video: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/video/newsalerts/video-2210186/Video-Day-Six-Johnny-Depp-Amber-Heard-High-Court-London.html\n\nDaily Mail Facebook: http://facebook.com/dailymail\nDaily Mail IG: http://instagram.com/dailymail\nDaily Mail Snap: https://www.snapchat.com/discover/Daily-Mail/8392137033\nDaily Mail Twitter: http://twitter.com/MailOnline\nDaily Mail Pinterest: http://pinterest.co.uk/dailymail\nDaily Mail Google+: https://plus.google.com/+DailyMail\n\nGet the free Daily Mail mobile app: http://dailymail.co.uk/mobile",
