            "description": "Ms Heard, who started her third day of evidence this morning, claims the megastar actor, 57, and his allies have tried to 'embarrass and harass me and the people around me, including potential witnesses' ahead of his extraordinary London libel trial. In a new witness statement published today, the actress, 34, said she was 'eager for this trial to proceed' claiming her ex-husband's 'campaign has affected my professional life, my personal life and my well-being. It has been extremely upsetting'. She said: 'Johnny is so much more powerful than I am, in every way: physically, financially, and professionally. By leaving him I escaped the physical abuse, but for the past four years he has used his power and resources to continue the harassment and abuse'. She added: 'I have been subjected to a campaign of targeted online abuse on social media, as well as online petitions calling for me to be removed from any future sequel to Aquaman and from my association with L'Oreal'. Today Ms Heard is expected to give her final evidence with her ex-husband feet away as the biggest English libel trial of the 21st century comes to a head.\n\nOriginal Article: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8547817/Amber-Heard-arrives-stand-Johnny-Depp-case.html\nOriginal Video: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/video/newsalerts/video-2215052/Video-Day-Twelve-Johnny-Depp-Amber-Heard-arrive-High-Court.html\n\nDaily Mail Facebook: http://facebook.com/dailymail\nDaily Mail IG: http://instagram.com/dailymail\nDaily Mail Snap: https://www.snapchat.com/discover/Daily-Mail/8392137033\nDaily Mail Twitter: http://twitter.com/MailOnline\nDaily Mail Pinterest: http://pinterest.co.uk/dailymail\nDaily Mail Google+: https://plus.google.com/+DailyMail\n\nGet the free Daily Mail mobile app: http://dailymail.co.uk/mobile",
