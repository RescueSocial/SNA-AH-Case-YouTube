            "description": "Celebrities React To Johnny Depp Winning In Court & Being Rehired... | VS Amber Heard\nJohnny Depp has been in an interesting place as of late. He's getting to make movies again (though in a very independent way), and while his court case is still raging on, the momentum does feel like its shifting in his favor.
