            "description": "\u25baElon Musk Speaks About Having a Baby with Amber Heard\nWe're going to inform you that Elon Musk has spoken out regarding allegations that he is the father of Amber Heard's baby. So let's get started. Amber Heard has a child. The performer, 35, is praising the entrance of a young lady months after ex-boyfriend Johnny Depp's defamation lawsuit, which included her, was dismissed. On Thursday, a source told Page Six that Heard had been passing in infatuation with her daughter, Oonagh Paige, whom she named after her late mother Paige. After Heard was told she would never be able to bring her own children's companions into the world, Oonagh was born on April 8 with the help of a proxy. We got this information from a source close to the celebrity. Oonagh is totally beautiful and amber's shocked. She generally realized that she needed to be a mother and this is her most noteworthy desire. She's so appreciative of the brilliant lady who brought Oonagh into her life.\n\n\ud83e\udde1 If you enjoyed this video please consider leaving a like and a comment telling us what you thought \ud83e\udde1\n\nHere on Viral Uncut we are all about the latest celebrity news and the hottest spill.
