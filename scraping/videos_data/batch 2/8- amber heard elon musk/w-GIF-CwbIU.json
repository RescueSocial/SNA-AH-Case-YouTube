            "description": "Have you heard what's happening with Amber and Elon? Amber Heard is reportedly getting very serious with billionaire boo Elon Musk!\n\n\nAmber Heard definitely got an upgrade! But Tesla billionaire Elon Musk has to be pretty happy. Sources say the guy has been waiting for Amber since 2013, after they met on the set of Machete Kills.\n\n\nMusk and Heard are both recently divorced. Elon Musk was married to Talulah Riley. They were married in 2010, got divorced in 2012 and remarried in 2013. The two called it quits again in March of this year. Prior to Talulah Riley, Musk was married to Justine Wilson; they shared six children. One unfortunately passed. Amber Heard, on the other-hand, recently had a very messy divorce with Johnny Depp involving abuse allegations.\n\n \nDoes anyone smell that musk? Must be love in the air!",
