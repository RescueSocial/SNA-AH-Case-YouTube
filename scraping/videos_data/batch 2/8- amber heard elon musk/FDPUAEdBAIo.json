Heard\u2019s family friend Jennifer Howell insisted in a court declaration that the \u201cJustice League\u201d actress\u2019 late mother, Paige, revealed her daughter\u2019s paranoid secret early last year, according to DailyMail.com. \u201cPaige shared with me while I was visiting [Amber\u2019s sister] Whitney that Elon Musk had gifted a Tesla or multiple Teslas (not sure if it was one or more), but Amber found out that they were \u2018bugged,'\u201d Howell said, according to the documents obtained by the Mail. The mom claimed that the 49-year-old Tesla founder \u2014 who was accused in court of seeing Heard while she was still married to Johnny Depp \u2014 was \u201ccontrolling\u201d during their affair, Howell reportedly stated. In comparison, Depp, 57, was an \u201cangel\u201d or a \u201csaint\u201d to Heard \u2014 and the family wanted to see them reunited, Howell told Depp\u2019s lawyers in a statement as part of his $50 millio",
