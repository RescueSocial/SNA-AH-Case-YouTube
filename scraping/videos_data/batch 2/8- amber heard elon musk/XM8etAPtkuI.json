            "description": "From a sweep-you-off-your-feet kind of romance, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard\u2019s love story has taken a messy turn in just a few years. Five years after Amber Heard filed for divorce, the fight between the former couple is still ongoing. And even though the divorce had been finalized four years ago, the chaos that their marriage brought is far from over. Being a celebrity is a strange thing, as your personal relationships can become very public affairs. Amber Heard and Johnny Depp know this all too well, as the former couple is consistently making headlines due to their ongoing legal battle. But they made it to the headlines again, this time bringing another high profile witness\u2019s name with them\u2026 Elon Musk. Elon Musk is an entrepreneur and business magnate. He is the founder, CEO, and Chief Engineer at SpaceX; early stage investor, CEO, and Product Architect of Tesla, Inc.; founder of The Boring Company; and co-founder of Neuralink and OpenAI. A centibillionaire, Elon Musk is the richest person in the world as of September 2021. So yeah, there is no doubt there that Amber Heard would replace Johnny Depp in a split second just to get some of that. After all, wasn\u2019t she accused of marrying Johnny Depp for his money once? So this is no news to everyone. What seems to be the news is the fact that Elon Musk might appear on the most awaited Johnny Depp and Amber Heard trial. Why, you ask? Well, there is a whole load of history we have to go through to understand, so make sure you stay until the end of this video. But before anything else, make sure to hit that subscribe button first and smash that notification bell for more updates. Now, let\u2019s begin!\n\nAmber Heard and Johnny Depp have been battling in court for years now, and are showing no signs of slowing down. Especially not now. There has been tons of evidence in the past years that may be helpful for the case, like the proof through phone records that Amber was really the one who hurt Johnny, the alleged affairs of Amber with actor James Franco and mega businessman Elon Musk, which somehow turned out to be true because right after she divorced Johnny, she latched onto Elon for a whole year. \n\nBut, there has recently been another update on the excruciatingly long wait for the Johnny Depp - Amber Heard trial. This was when it was reported that someone deeply connected to Amber Heard will potentially and finally be brought to stand. Even early this year, a few more months before the first supposed trial in Johnny Depp\u2019s $50 million defamation lawsuit against Amber Heard was set to finally start, the pink-slipped Fantastic Beasts actor wanted Elon Musk and the American Civil Liberties Union to be pulled into the case. In the Musk subpoena, Depp\u2019s lawyers at Brown Rudnick LLP have 24 requests that essentially cover \u201call communications between you and Ms. Heard regarding Mr. Depp.\u201d In the first ACLU subpoena, \u201ctopics\u201d sought basically have the same scope, with emphasis on donations, the defamation suit and conversations about \u201cthe relationship between Mr. Depp and Ms. Heard.\u201d You might be wondering what do Elon Musk and the ACLU have to do with the case that Depp launched against his ex-wife in March 2019 over a late 2018 Washington Post op-ed she penned? Well, Elon Musk dated the Aquaman actress for a while after her marriage to Depp collapsed in 2016. \n\nAfter this subpoena, it looks like the megabusiness man is going to grace the court after all. Making the most amount of headlines today is the list of people who will enter the witness box for their testimony in the Johnny Depp vs Amber Heard row. The top most name is Elon Musk. Elon Musk, creator of Tesla, SpaceX, PayPal, among many other companies, reportedly had a relationship with Heard after her divorce from Depp and is now being reported to be involved in the court case. Well, they had been together for at least a year, so that makes sense. \n\nSo how did Amber and Elon Musk\u2019s relationship really go back then? How did they meet? And what happened to them now? In 2010, Elon Musk said he would \"rather stick a fork in my hand than write about my personal life.\" But the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX is a fascinating figure, and over the years, he's opened up here and there about his childhood, his parents, and his relationships. Elon Musk, who was 50 at that time, began dating actress Amber Heard, 35. A source told the Mail On Sunday at the time: \"It\u2019s all over between Amber and Elon and she\u2019s devastated. \n\nThat\u2019s all for today, we hope you enjoyed that video and if you did, make sure to hit like, subscribe, and hit that notification bell for more videos like this.
