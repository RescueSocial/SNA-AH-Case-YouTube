So everyone knows about Elon Musk by now. The Robert Downey Jr. Ironman character is based on him to some extent and he's building reusable rockets for NASA, has his electric car company and solar city the company that has just started putting solar shingles on houses. Many of you don't know this but Elon Musk outside of creating Paypal was very close to bankruptcy with his Tesla car company. I'm not trying to \nbelittle his achievements because he's trying to make existing technology more efficient. Companies are going to launch things into space and people are going to drive cars. If he can make those things more energy efficient then so be it but even with all the government subsidies he gets most people are forgetting that big oil and other car companies get government money or tax breaks. So if NASA wants to give him money that's their business. What I do want to talk about is his involvement with Johnny Depp's ex wife Amber Heard. I knew there was something going on between Elon Musk and Amber a few years ago when he was in the process of divorcing his second wife Tululah Riley a second time. They were spotted going in and out of hotel rooms together and that's when I knew they were having a relationship. They both cheated on their partners no doubt and got together. About a month or two ago Elon posted pictures of the two of them out at a night spot. For a highly intelligent guy he certainly has a very hard time figuring out women and female nature. There was a quote a while back where he said that he was willing to devote a certain set amount of time in his life to a relationship because he was busy doing other things and he had a hard time understanding that women have a desire to monopolise a man's time instead of only spending the allocated time he planned out to begin with. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n10 images licensed and paid for through BigStock.com.
