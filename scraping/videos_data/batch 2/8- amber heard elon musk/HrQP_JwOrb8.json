            "description": "Elon Musk has denied that he had a \u2018three-way affair\u2019 with Cara Delevingne and Amber Heard. It has been alleged in a deposition from one of Amber\u2019s friends in her ex-husband Johnny Depp\u2019s lawsuit against her that the trio spent the night together in November 2016.  However, Musk, 48, has now hit back at the allegations, and also denied that he was involved with Heard, 34, while she was still married to Depp, 57.  In a statement to Page Six, the Tesla mogul said: \u2018Cara and I are friends, but we\u2019ve never been intimate. She would confirm this.\n\n\nhttps://metro.co.uk/2020/06/19/elon-musk-denies-threesome-cara-delevingne-amber-heard-12873985/",
