Musk even called the pandemic quarantine facist.\nIn an interview on CNBC's \"Squawk Box,\" Gates criticized Musk's controversial comments on the virus and implied that Musk shouldn't be speaking about the pandemic at all. He said,\n\u201cElon\u2019s positioning is to maintain a high level of outrageous comments,\u201d Gates said. \u201cHe\u2019s not much involved in vaccines. He makes a great electric car. And his rockets work well. So he\u2019s allowed to say these things. I hope that he doesn\u2019t confuse areas he\u2019s not involved in too much.\u201d\nMusk, the South African born billionaire was enraged by Gates' remarks and mocked him on Twitter. He jokingly posted multiple tweets about Gates, including \u201cBilly G is not my lover\u201d and \u201cthe rumour that Bill Gates & I are lovers is completely untrue.\u201d\nMusk defended himself against Gates\u2019 comments, saying he\u2019d spent time with Harvard University epidemiologists \u201cdoing antibody studies\u201d and noting Tesla\u2019s work with CureVac.\nLater in an interview with  journalist Kara Swisher Musk said bluntly that \"Gates said something about me not knowing what I was doing. It's like, hey, knucklehead, we actually make the vaccine machines for CureVac, that company you're invested in.\"\nElon Musk, however, is involved in fighting the coronavirus. The billionaire redirected Tesla resources to source and produce ventilators. He also teamed up with the German biotech firm CureVac to make a device to aid in vaccine production. Bill Gates, on the other hand, who is also a known philanthropist, is also the investor in CureVac and pledged US$100 million to fight the virus via the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\nMusk has frequently downplayed the severity of the virus and strongly criticised stay-at-home orders. He promoted the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for the virus, falsely said that children are immune to it, and questioned data regarding coronavirus deaths.\n\nCopyright Disclaimers\n\u2022 We use images and content in accordance with the YouTube Fair Use copyright guidelines\n\u2022 Section 107 of the U.S. Copyright Act states: \u201cNotwithstanding the provisions of sections 106 and 106A, the fair use of a copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies or phonorecords or by any other means specified by that section, for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright.\u201d \n\u2022 This video could contain certain copyrighted video clips, pictures, or photographs that were not specifically authorized to be used by the copyright holder(s), but which we believe in good faith are protected by federal law and the fair use doctrine for one or more of the reasons noted above.\n\nelon musk, elon musk bill gates, elon musk gates, bill gates, elon musk vs bill gates, elon musk bill gates fight, tesla,  tesla news, elon musk news, tesla update, tesla live, elon musk update, elon musk tesla, tesla elon musk, spacex, spacex news, spacex live",
