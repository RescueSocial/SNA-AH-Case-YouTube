            "title": "Comic Doug Stanhope To Amber Heard: Your lawsuit is 'bullshit'",
            "description": "Stanhope insists her legal action is \"bullshit\" because he was merely defending his friend in a post on his website - not penning a explosive op-ed for TheWrap, in which he claimed the actress was blackmailing her estranged husband.\n\nAppearing on The Howard Stern Show on Monday (20Jun16), the 49-year-old said he put his thoughts down in a post on his website six days after Depp and Heard officially split last month (May16).\n\nHe told Stern, \"The title was 'At a Loss for Words...' TheWrap got it as an exclusive, however that worked, and said, 'Amber Heard Is Blackmailing Johnny Depp - This Is How I Know'. I didn't write that f**king title. I didn't put that stupid tabloid title in there. I'm a better writer than that, so I don't know if it's hinged on that, I don't know how much of it is spite.\"\n\nHeard has called the piece \"highly defamatory\", but Stanhope insists his pal Depp was happy with it: \"I had no contact with him (Depp) until he texted me after that went out and said, 'Hey, thanks for being honest'. He didn't know that was going out. I was a little petrified because it kind of made him look like a b**ch.\"\n\nAnd Stanhope isn't taking Amber's legal attack too seriously, smiling, \"The idea of some Hollywood supermodel lady winning all of my s**t... She would be locking the doors driving down my street even without seeing a person. I live on the Mexican border in this dirty pothole-riddled neighbourhood.\"\n\nThe comic reveals his pal Depp gave him a heads up about the split and suggested Amber might accuse the actor of abusing her when the two friends spent time together on 21 May (16).\n\nStanhope told Stern, \"He was alluding to the fact that she was going to do something like this. She didn't come out until a week later that that happened. But it happened that night, and he was alluding to she's going to do something like this.\n\n\"I think what she's trying to do is make me shut the f**k up, because I can't say anything about it, and now I'm talking more.\"\n\nHeard, 30, filed her defamation lawsuit against Stanhope on 3 June (16). Her lawyers accused him of trying to \"divert public attention away from the true facts regarding Depp which caused their marriage to fail, namely, that Depp repeatedly abused Heard throughout their marriage, at times to the point of her fearing for her life.\"\n\nAudio Courtesy of \"The Howard Stern Show\"",
