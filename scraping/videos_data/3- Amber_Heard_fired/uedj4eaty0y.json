            "description": "Despite the rumors saying otherwise, Amber Heard has not been fired from the DCEU's Aquaman 2 and will continue to play Mera in the franchise. The rumors suggesting Amber Heard has been fired from\u00a0Aquaman 2 have been debunked. Heard plays\u00a0Xebellian princess Mera in the DCEU, ever since her first appearance in 2017's\u00a0Justice League. She went on to have a prominent role in 2018's\u00a0Aquaman and will reprise the part next month for\u00a0Zack Snyder's Justice League. Additionally, Heard is expected to return for\u00a0Aquaman 2, which will once again star Jason Momoa as the titular hero and is slated for release in December 2022. Plot details are still being kept under wraps, and filming is expected to begin this summer. On Sunday, unverified reports of Heard being fired from\u00a0Aquaman 2\u00a0emerged online and led the actress to trend on social media. This is hardly the first time rumors of Heard's firing have spread, seemingly stemming from her brutal and public battle with ex-husband Johnny Depp. Both Depp and Heard have contested the other was physically and verbally abusive during their relationship. In the fall, Depp was fired from Warner Bros.'\u00a0Fantastic Beasts franchise, which led to fan outcry online. Depp's departure also caused some to wonder why Heard wasn't receiving the same fate. Continue scrolling to keep readingClick the button below to start this article in quick view. There's no telling what may happen in the future, but so far, Heard is sticking with\u00a0Aquaman 2. THR staff writer Ryan Parker took to social media to state he's been told by a \"reliable source\" that the reports of Heard's alleged firing are \"inaccurate.\" Parker offered up no further information. As the initial rumors regarding Heard being fired did not stem from a reputable source, it isn't surprising they're being debunked now. Oftentimes, stories of certain actors either being cast or let go from projects will take on a life of their own on the internet, but they end up being untrue. Heard and\u00a0Aquaman 2 is an interesting case, in that the controversy surrounding the actress could very well result in some changes, similar to Depp's situation with\u00a0Fantastic Beasts. However, as it stands right now, Heard will continue to play Mera in the DCEU. This news will likely be met with a great deal of mixed reactions. Those who stand by Heard will be relieved to hear she's still a part of\u00a0Aquaman 2, while others who think Heard is the aggressor in her relationship with Depp will be displeased. A petition calling for Heard's removal from\u00a0Aquaman 2 gained traction in December and crossed one million signatures, signaling there are some who would like to see her fired. This is a delicate situation, and one that will likely lead to more developments in the future. Only time will tell how it pans out.\n\n\nAll data is taken from the source: http://screenrant.com\nArticle Link: https://screenrant.com/aquaman-2-amber-heard-mera-fired-rumors-debunk/\n\n\n#AmberHeard #newsus #newstodayoncnn #newstodayabc #newstodaylocal #newstodaycnn #",
