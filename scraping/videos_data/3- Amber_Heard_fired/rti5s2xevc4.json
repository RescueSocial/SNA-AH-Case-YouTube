Aquaman starred Jason Momoa as Arthur Curry, Amber Heard as Mera, Willem Dafoe as Vulko, Patrick Wilson as Orm the Ocean Master, Dolph Lundgren as Nereus, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II as Black Manta, Nicole Kidman as Atlanna, Ludi Lin as Captain Murk, and Temuera Morrison as Tom Curry. The applauded role played by the gorgeous Amber Heard has a separate fan base. However, the personal life of the actress is shadowing her professional life.\n\nThe controversial divorce of the actress with Johnny Depp has affected both. Not all love stories have a happy ending. So was the case with Aquaman's \u201cMera'' and \u201cJack Sparrow\u201d of the Pirates of the Caribbean. They had met on the sets of \u201cThe Rum Diary\u201d. People magazine reported that Depp and Heard were engaged after a picture emerged of the actress wearing an ornate engagement ring which was later confirmed by Johnny Depp in a video interview with The Daily Mail. They married in 2015 in a private ceremony. After a year Heard filed a divorce case in court claiming that she is a victim of domestic abuse. On May 23, 2016, Heard filed for divorce from Depp and also obtained a temporary restraining order against the Oscar-nominated actor. She alleged that Depp had physically abused her during their relationship, and said it was usually while under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Moreover, she also said that at the time of filing for divorce, an incident had recently taken place in which Depp threw a phone at her leaving her with a bruised face. However, a police spokesperson told People that an investigation into the domestic incident radio call found that no crime had taken place.\n\nDepp denied these accusations and said via his representatives that Heard was attempting to secure a premature financial resolution by alleging abuse. With the internet left polarized, the case peaked when Depp lost the libel case against The Sun,a tabloid newspaper in the UK. . Following the sparked controversy, Johnny went into hot waters and lost important roles including a role from his movie \u201cFantastic Beasts 3\u201d. Disney also cleared that he will not be a part of The Pirates of the Caribbean franchise as well.\n\nHowever, leaked audio and several testimonies turned the tables and showed the true colors of Heard. The leaked audio call showed that the situation was otherwise and it was Depp who was the victim actually, not Heard!  Amber heard whose beauty has mesmerized millions has been portrayed now as beauty with the evilness inside. Consequently, a petition was signed by more than 1.8 million people to remove Heard in Aquaman. Johnny\u2019s fans were outraged and asked for justice for him as he is one of the most beloved actors in Hollywood with several memorable roles.\n\nThe fans of the movie Aquaman wanted the Warner bros to replace her with another actress. The names suggested were Emilia Clarke and Dakota Johnson. The majority of the fans want Emilia Clarke as Mera in Aquaman 2. Emilia already has a successful career and is known for her roles in the seasons game of thrones, Dom Hemingways, Sole: A Star Wars story, Voice from a Stone, Terminator Genisys, etc. Fan-made art of Emilia as Mera in Aquaman 2 took Twitter and other social media platforms by storm. A majority of fans found her suitable for this role and wanted to see her in the upcoming movie. An image posted by \u2018valentin romero art\u2019 shows Emilia Clarke donned in the hexagonal suit for the Mera role with an underwater crown. The suit was designed in purple color to give her costume a different look for Aquaman 2.  Another artist BossLogic also posted a digital artwork depicting Emilia as Mera. An Instagram user @jph_photoshop, shared his work and the fans flooded his comment box with praise with many of them wishing that Clarke could play the role.  DC marvel also shared a side-by-side image of Heard and Clarke as Mera on his Instagram handle.\n\n\n#BluffCentral #AmberHeard #JohnnyDepp #JusticeForJohnnyDepp #EmiliaClarke #Aquaman2 #QueenMera #MeToo",
