            "description": "Consequences Amber Heard Is Facing (Justice For Johnny Depp)\nThe Johnny Depp and Amber Heard court drama made a major plot twist when Johnny Depp filed a defamation lawsuit against his ex-wife. He not only claimed that she lied in court, but also that she was abusive toward him. However, the actors will need to wait even longer to get an official court ruling. If the court rules in Johnny Depp\u2019s favor, Amber Heard could be facing serious consequences.\n\nThe possibility of Amber Heard going to jail already has fans asking who would replace her in Aquaman 2. And even if she doesn\u2019t get sentenced to jail time, based on the information that Johnny Depp has already released to the public, many fans have petitioned for Amber Heard to be replaced in Aquaman 2 regardless. Rumors have even started swirling that Emilia Clarke would be her replacement. Be sure to watch the whole video and see what lies Amber Heard has been hiding all these years!
