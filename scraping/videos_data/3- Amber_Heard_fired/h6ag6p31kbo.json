But can the same be said about her personality? After all that went down between her and Johnny Depp, people are thinking twice about believing her to be the angel, or is she truly just an angel in disguise?\n\nWe have just one word to describe Johnny Depp and Amber Heard\u2019s marriage. TOXIC. In fact, it was so toxic that Johnny had his finger severed, resulting in him rushing to the emergency room to get his misplaced finger reattached to his hand. Imagine that level of toxicity!\n\nApart from all the drama going on, many are pretty glad they actually got a divorce and ended the trauma for not only both of them but also the fans that were shipping them to be goals prior to the terrible court scenes. \n\nJack Sparrow has been missing for quite some time and we all by now know why. For those of you who aren't aware why to watch further ahead to find out the real reason behind Depp\u2019s absence from the film industry. \n\nDepp is said to be a great person on and off-screen. This was quite believable to all until his ex-wife Amber Heard played the role of victim accusing him of being the unimaginable - A Domestic Abuser. This not only broke his spirits but sabotaged his career simultaneously.\n\nThe sad part is that Depp lost his role in the upcoming The Pirates of the Caribbean movie, as well as his role as Grindelwald in Fantastic Beasts due to this one blatant lie.\n\nHell broke loose amongst his fans. They wanted JUSTICE. Just like every single person on earth has a voice to be heard, the fans gathered up to declare one strong message to the film industry, especially Warner Bros. Change.org was the platform they all targeted to make sure that Depp deserved the justice to the time spent in guilt when he actually wasn\u2019t.\n\nAlas! Amber was finally cornered. News on her scandal blew up. She was on every piece of gossip and what was written about her wasn\u2019t at all good. This infuriated her and she took to the media in a very immature way, laughing off the matter at every instance to bursting into fits of anger when people stated that Warner Bros would sue her. \n\nShe clearly was delusional when she stated that absolutely no one could kick her off the Aquaman 2 squad, when all she is, is a cast member and nothing else. \n\nBut would Warner Bros. wish to lose millions in case they don\u2019t switch their cast?\n\nFans have apparently voiced their concerns on how they would boycott the movie by not giving it the hype they gave to the first part if Amber Heard was cast as Mera. In fact, they claimed not to watch the movie at all and this is quite a worrisome shift of events at Warner Bros. but worry about.\n\nEmilia Clarke as we mentioned earlier, is everyone\u2019s holy grail on this subject. The chemistry the Khaleesi and Drogo had is unforgettable, leaving fans to wonder how that would play out if she was to play Mera in Aquaman 2. \n\nShooting for Aquaman 2 is expected to start in the summer of 2021, but the cast is being quite quiet on the subject. The politics that are going on behind the screens yet are left unknown causing us to wonder what Emilia has to say about this.\n\nEmilia has said nothing through words but has actually shown us some evidence that the Mother of Dragons may actually have already been asked to play the role. The best part to this being, she may have even said yes. How do we know that?\n\nWell, a few of her fans, or rather paparazzi, have claimed to have seen her parading around with red hair. Some have even stated the red hair was accompanied by an attire that was green. \n\nI guess that's proof enough that something big is being hidden from us which may or may not be Aquaman 2 related. \n\nJason Momoa has clearly been hushed by Warner Bros. It\u2019s either that or he personally doesn\u2019t like to get into feuds with his co-actors and prefers to be a man of peace. But whatever may be the reason, from the looks of it, he isn't going to crack anytime soon.
