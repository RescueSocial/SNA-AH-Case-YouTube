People started thinking deeply and realized\nthe irony of Amber Heard\u2019s career. She wasn\u2019t exactly the most well- known actress, until\nshe met the man who was already extremely popular in Hollywood. It made so many fans\nthink that Amber Heard benefited from marrying Johnny. Amber started to gain more\nattention in the public eye via her appearances in movies like \u2018Justice League\u2019 and\n\u2018Aquaman\u2019 and she actually started getting more and more great roles than ever before.\nAmber and Johnny dated for years before finally getting married in 2015, but that\u2019s when\nthings started to reveal their true nature. It also made people suspicious as their marriage\nlasted only one year.\nJealousy, anger, ab**se, lies - the things which filled this marriage from the start and\nobviously, that\u2019s not a good combination for those who want to be a happy couple. But things\nstarted to get intense in the worst way, when in 2016 Amber filed for divorce from Johnny\nand also obtained a temporary restraining order against him. She alleged that Johnny had\nphysically ab**ed her during their relationship, and said it was usually while under the\ninfluence of dr**gs or alc***ol.\nShe alleged that at the time of filing for divorce, an incident had recently taken place in which\nJohnny Depp threw his phone at her, leaving her with a bruised face.\nJohnny Depp denied these accusations and through his representatives said Amber Heard\nwas \"attempting to secure a premature financial resolution by alleging ab*se.\" But by that\ntime no one believed Johnny Depp and his career started falling apart.\nIn December 2018, Amber Heard wrote an op-ed for The Washington Post saying she was\nab*sed. In this op-ed for The Washington Post she spoke about the treatment of women in\ndomestic ab*se cases.\nShe wrote: \"I became a public figure representing domestic ab*se, and I felt the full force of\nour culture's wrath for women who speak out.\" After that the newspapers labeled him as an\n\u2018ab*ser\u2019 and \u2018wife beater\u2019 And In 2019, Johnny Depp sued Amber Heard for $50 million for\ndefamation over the WaPo article.\nThe suit said that Amber Heard \"is not a victim of domestic ab*se, she is a perpetrator,\" and\ndenied that Johnny Depp ever ab*sed her. Instead, the suit said that Amber Heard's\nallegations were part of an \"elaborate hoax to generate positive publicity\" for the actress.\n\nJohnny Depp's lawyers said: \"The op-ed depended on the central premise that Ms. Heard\nwas a domestic abuse victim and that Mr. Depp perpetrated domestic violence against her.\"\nAnd that\u2019s when things really got intense and Amber\u2019s true nature started to reveal itself.\nFinally, Amber Heard\u2019s claims of ab*se started to be revealed as false one by one. First of\nall, the police spokesman revealed that an investigation into the domestic incident \u2018radio call\u2019\nwhich Amber Heard stated previously, found that no crime had taken place.\nPlus,Johnny Depp had his own proof that Amber was lying. Mainly, Johnny had a recording of a time when Amber ab*sed him.\nIn January, phone recordings obtained by the Daily Mail were released. In these recordings,\nAmber Heard admitted to \"hitting\" Johnny Depp.\nAmber is heard saying: \"I'm sorry that I didn't ... hit you across the face in a proper slap, but I\nwas hitting you, it was not punching you. Babe, you're not punched.\n\"I don't know what the motion of my actual hand was, but you're fine, I did not hurt you, I did\nnot punch you, I was hitting you.\"\n...\nNow I want to hear your opinion about Amber Heard. Do you think she is the one who played\nthe victim card to get sympathy and tried to frame an innocent man?
