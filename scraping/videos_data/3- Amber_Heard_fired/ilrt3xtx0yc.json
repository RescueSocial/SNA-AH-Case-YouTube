            "description": "AMBER HEARD finally FIRED from AQUAMAN 2!\n______________________________________________\nFor more videos subscribe : https://bit.ly/2zoPgqj\n______________________________________________\nIt seems as though Emilia Clarke might have signed in to replace Amber Heard in Aquaman 2, which comes from a recent article in Forbes. Game of Thrones star Emilia Clarke suits up as Mera to replace Amber Heard in a stunning new concept design for Aquaman 2.\n\nIn this video we will be discussing the replacement of Amber Heard in Aquaman 2 by Emilia Clarke. \n\nJohnny Depp was forced to step away from his role as the main villain of the Fantastic Beasts series after losing his libel case related to the abuse allegations made by his ex-wife Amber Heard. Since Depp alleged that Heard was also physically and emotionally abusive towards him in their relationship, many fans would like the Aquaman star to leave her role as the comic book icon Mera in the DC Extended Universe movies. While it would probably be easier for Aquaman 2 to just jettison the character entirely, some suggested Emilia Clarke to take over the role of Mera as a way for the sequel to move forward without any story-related issues.\n\nDigital artist BossLogic took the idea and ran with it. In his latest concept, BossLogic reveals what Emilia Clarke could look like as Mera for Aquaman 2. It\u2019s hard to deny that the former Game of Thrones star looks the part, as the new outfit the artist puts her in immediately gives her a regal look. Clarke\u2019s acting talents would definitely be a big step up for the DCEU and Game of Thrones fans would be wholly excited to see the British star reunite with Jason Momoa. \n\nFrom what we\u2019ve gathered in the last several months, Amber Heard is returning to make Aquaman 2 and Warner Bros. is not inclined to get rid of her. She is a domestic abuse survivor in their eyes and worthy of a spinoff film, especially when DC Films doesn\u2019t have as many leading female action heroes as Marvel. A petition calling for Heard to be fired and replaced with Emilia Clarke keeps gaining signatures but Heard and the studio aren\u2019t taking it seriously.\n\nBut according to Forbes, it now seems that Warner Bros. has also fired Amber Heard from the DC Extended Universe to replace her with the Mother of Dragons. While no official confirmation has been released from Warner Bros. regarding Clarke\u2019s casting, the decision can work wonders as it will once again reunite Clarke with Jason Momoa. In Game of Thrones, the pair shared the screen as a couple which led to the earlier speculations of Clarke replacing Heard as Mera in the DCEU.\n\nFrom some recent rumors that Amber Heard has been fired from Aquaman 2, this now doesn\u2019t appear to be the case. According to insider Daniel Richtman, talk that Emilia Clarke, who\u2019s been linked to the role of Mera before, is set to replace Heard, has no basis in truth. And although this news may not be taken as positively by some people as it will be by others, it seems that Heard\u2019s immediate career prospects and personal life are going to be shadowed by these sorts of stories for a while yet.\n\nOf course, in recent weeks, Richtman has also reported that the actress is angry at Warner Bros. for bringing in another female lead, reducing her screen time in the Aquaman sequel. However, she\u2019s apparently set to get a pay rise for her part in the movie, too, so it\u2019s hard to really know what\u2019s going on behind the scenes on the film.\n\nHeard-Depp controversy isn\u2019t going away anytime soon, it\u2019s hard not to see Aquaman 2 receiving a lot of scrutiny as it gradually heads into production. The studio has continued to back the actress in the last year, though, and it seems that she\u2019s still very much in contention for other major roles in Hollywood, despite negative online campaigns.\n\nAnd that's all for today's video.
