Thanks for visiting my YouTube Channel! My channel stars me, Trinity, and my little sister Madison, and sometimes my mom and dad! This is a family-friendly channel! We do lots of challenges, 3AM Skits, Calling Videos, Mailing Myself Videos, and more!\n\nWe've grown up watching different YouTube channels and like making videos 'talking' to their YouTubers. We both love YouTube!. We have learned so much watching YouTube on our tablets we've had since before we were 1yr old! We do family fun crafts, costume dress-up skits, challenges, toy reviews & playing, and other popular YouTube skits! Our' favorite toys are Shimmer & Shine, Shopkins, LPS, My Little Pony, & Oonies! We love to sing and dance, and Trin enjoys gymnastics and dance classes!\n\nThanks again for visiting our channel.
