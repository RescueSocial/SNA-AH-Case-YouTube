In May 2016, she filed for a domestic violence restraining order against her, accusing him of abusing her. Depp rejected the requests and the former couple settled their divorce out of court in August 2016.\n\nDepp had previously claimed that Heard, 35, had failed to donate the money while she hoped to overturn her ruling in her \"women rapist\" defamation case against The Sun in the UK earlier this year. Depp's lawyers argued that the judge got carried away by Heard's charity promises.\n\nIn response, Heard's legal team said she had done \"nothing dishonest\" with her donations to the two charities and \"promised to pay more than 10 years\", which, they added, was \"understood\" by the ACLU.\nTo back this up, Heard's attorneys provided their own evidence, which they said showed that the Aquaman star actually gave a total of $ 950,000 to the ACLU and $ 850,000 to the children's hospital through anonymous donors.\n\nAnd that\u2019s all we know for now.
