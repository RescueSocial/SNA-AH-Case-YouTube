            "description": "Amber Heard was granted 7 million dollars after splitting from Johnny Depp and promised she would be splitting the entire payout equally between two charities; the ACLU which stops violence against women and the Children\u0092s Hospital of Los Angeles\r\n\r\nHowever, the 'Danish Girl' star thinks that Depp should be paying more as he gets a tax deduction for sending the money to them directly.  Amber\u0092s rep said in a statement, \"If Johnny wishes to change the settlement agreement, we must insist that he honour the full amount by donating 14 million dollars to charity, which after accounting for his tax deduction, is equal to his 7 million payment obligation to Amber.\" \r\nThe rep then added, \"We would also insist that the full amount be paid immediately and not drawn out over many years\".\r\n\r\nA good deed on Amber's part, but she had better be using the money purely for charity, because Johnny Depp fans are extremely upset.",
