            "description": "Amber Heard slams Johnny Depp in court after he REFUSES to make good on their $6.8 million divorce settlement because she wrote an open letter about domestic violence.\nThe divorce settlement between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard has fallen apart, leaving the deal hanging by a thread, DailyMail.com can exclusively reveal.\nThe $6.8million settlement was close to being finalized in the last few days but Depp refused to pay the money at the 11th hour.\nNow, according to bombshell legal documents seen by DailyMail.com, it appears the actor is stalling because he's furious over public comments his former wife has made about domestic violence in recent weeks.\nDepp, who paid an initial $100,000 to two charities, is holding back on paying Heard the millions of dollars she has publicly vowed to donate to good causes.\nHeard has promised to give the American Civil Liberties Union money for their work to stop violence against women, and the Children's Hospital Los Angeles will also receive a share.\nBut Depp's stonewalling leaves both organizations wanting - effectively penalizing the people they help.\nThe legal paperwork, obtained exclusively by DailyMail.com, reveals that because of the halt Heard's legal team is hitting back with a formal 'Request for Order' to the judge in the case in the hope that it will force Depp's hand once and for all.\nIn the documents filed with Los Angeles Superior Court, Heard's lawyers have asked the judge to act against Depp, 53, and enforce the terms of the settlement - known in the legal world as 'Deal Point Memorandum'.",
