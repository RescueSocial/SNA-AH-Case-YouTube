And no broken bone under that bruise... imagine a broken nose or broken ribs...<br><br>So lol let&#39;s not forget that anything broken swells up a lot ontop of the bruising.  So yes you can throw makeup over your skin to cover up the discoloration but you cant cover up bruising with makeup.  Also when she stretched out (literally hung from his neck) to kiss Johnny no one, I mean NO ONE! (Even on heavy meds) would habe been able to do that it would be so excruciating.  Most people with broken ribs cant lift their arms over their head its eye level and lower and they cant bend their midsection, no twisting, bending over, leaning...  Shes HANGING from her arms and arching her back.  <br><br>On her other photo she is leaping in the air and turning her midsection towards the camera... again excruciating pain she could not have been able to move like that with broken ribs if she truly had broken ribs.  Yes people can mask pain for a photo but meds dont take away everything not without a dr prescription and x rays to see that they are indeed broken.  She had no evidence, no photos, no x rays, no CT, no MRI, only a nurse note that said she disnt show any signs of injury or bruising...  all these photos were candid, meant for personal remembrance, theres no evidence of facial swelling, no evidence of broken ribs or swelling anywhere really she is so thin any swelling would be very noticable on any of her arms and legs.  Theres nothing.  <br><br>Shes all smiles and fun meanwhile Johnny is the one that looks like someone that just went thru an ordeal and isnt too comfortable being around the person responsible.  Fake smile, tense, wearing a lot of clothing and sun glasses.  He looks to be the one that may have injuries seriously... pay attention to his posture (very rigid, Johnny has always been loose and comfortable infront of cameras he has an aura about him, in these he seems so uncomfortable and unhappy) look at his facial expressions and how he doesnt lean into amber when she hangs on him look at his posture and face...  these photos to me show a beaten man and there uncomfortable to see.",
