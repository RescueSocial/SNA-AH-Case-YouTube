                    "textOriginal": "Johnny Depp is an animal rescuer, he treats his women very well, loves children  goes to kid's hospitals to help them and enjoys it..he's an obvious empath....Amber is cocky, skittish and constantly putting her hands on ppl. She's  slapped and pinched ppl. She's mean and mouthy. An obvious Narcissist.  In a cage fight Johnny would leave....Amber would be like bring it.....bring it. I've watched  JB for along time and knew he was an amazing person.  Amber rubbed me wrong the first time I saw her. I said the only thing that would make Aquaman better would be to chuck  the cold ___ & get someone else!!!",
