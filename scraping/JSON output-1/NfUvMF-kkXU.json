How did Raquel get into the condo without JD seeing her if there is a secret entrance upstairs that connects the condos? Wouldn&#39;t JD see her coming in from the entrance upstairs because he was there too? I&#39;m not trying to poke holes or anything, I just want his statement to be completely solid....maybe I missed something lol",

It was my first thought when I heard about it first time,   Nothing did ever something to belive, its so easy to remove every layer of lies...  Nobody in their state of mind can belive anything Amber is telling anybody, its allmost to easy, im actual\u00e6ly chacked a court in London ever belived any statement from her, Just looking at her bodylanguage, facial mimic, The U.K. Courts are a joke...    they all have to loose their licence to be judge, Its so bad a scam all who belived any of this needs to be removed from this planet, its overcrowded,we cant have so narrow-minded and mentally challenged people using resources needed by other people not insane Egomaniac Psycho Powertrippers on huge amounts of drugs...    Damn the UK judge have to be jailed for his part oin this case, he has a big part in allmost ruining Johnny&#39;s life....     really nice to have that Floor plan when listen to it again....    its all so insane I get mad at these morons with aparently no brain,what did the judge think..   are people really that stupid, I know im used to know much with fotografic memmory and an IQ of 162, all my simultanious thoughts being in 3D viewing from all angles, from 4-10 people/personallities...   I very rarely meet people like me, 1 of 20-50 mil.   I actually allready have one thing Proven to be right, all other scientists in the world has learned in their edeucation it was impossible, I thought it all over a couple of times and told it to my cousin who was a professor, he just said Christian you to clever... and looked strange at me, he is now dr. Tech.  and have proven with  4 other University&#39;s how it actually was possible, they as I said broke the world record in getting data through a semi-conductor...   I say theres many who now has to be jailed...    I admit I have a funny side of personallity, I think all of us very knowledged people have something, but strangely Its like we can see theres something we share, without thinking of it. we Look at eachother in a special way when passing eachother, I have tried that on University of Technoligy and similar places...   only very few times in my 47 year..   Im chocked anybody even with less knowledge than me and the narrator. juist an avarage IQ 100  can easy solve this. thats why im so chocked the Judge in the UK dont want some real evidense...   IQ 100 or 162 I dont care Its so obvious, I cant belive the Stupitity of the UK and US court system....    how stupid and with no evidence the judge just react in instant bliss...   luckely theres to much evidence to blast her through the galaxy. we need something better than the poor Justice systems we have today, im not better than other people, I learn fast and have some mental power to use...    But all is so obvious, she is a lying bitch...   how can any be so stupid..   from cops to minister of justice all have to go...",
                    "textOriginal": "Just what I thought, ofcause she was in the other condo all along..  It was my first thought when I heard about it first time,   Nothing did ever something to belive, its so easy to remove every layer of lies...  Nobody in their state of mind can belive anything Amber is telling anybody, its allmost to easy, im actual\u00e6ly chacked a court in London ever belived any statement from her, Just looking at her bodylanguage, facial mimic, The U.K. Courts are a joke...    they all have to loose their licence to be judge, Its so bad a scam all who belived any of this needs to be removed from this planet, its overcrowded,we cant have so narrow-minded and mentally challenged people using resources needed by other people not insane Egomaniac Psycho Powertrippers on huge amounts of drugs...    Damn the UK judge have to be jailed for his part oin this case, he has a big part in allmost ruining Johnny's life....     really nice to have that Floor plan when listen to it again....    its all so insane I get mad at these morons with aparently no brain,what did the judge think..   are people really that stupid, I know im used to know much with fotografic memmory and an IQ of 162, all my simultanious thoughts being in 3D viewing from all angles, from 4-10 people/personallities...   I very rarely meet people like me, 1 of 20-50 mil.   I actually allready have one thing Proven to be right, all other scientists in the world has learned in their edeucation it was impossible, I thought it all over a couple of times and told it to my cousin who was a professor, he just said Christian you to clever... and looked strange at me, he is now dr. Tech.  and have proven with  4 other University's how it actually was possible, they as I said broke the world record in getting data through a semi-conductor...   I say theres many who now has to be jailed...    I admit I have a funny side of personallity, I think all of us very knowledged people have something, but strangely Its like we can see theres something we share, without thinking of it. we Look at eachother in a special way when passing eachother, I have tried that on University of Technoligy and similar places...   only very few times in my 47 year..   Im chocked anybody even with less knowledge than me and the narrator. juist an avarage IQ 100  can easy solve this. thats why im so chocked the Judge in the UK dont want some real evidense...   IQ 100 or 162 I dont care Its so obvious, I cant belive the Stupitity of the UK and US court system....    how stupid and with no evidence the judge just react in instant bliss...   luckely theres to much evidence to blast her through the galaxy. we need something better than the poor Justice systems we have today, im not better than other people, I learn fast and have some mental power to use...
