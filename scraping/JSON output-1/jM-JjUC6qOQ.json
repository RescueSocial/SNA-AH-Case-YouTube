The hair-pulling story was that of genuine DV victim Kate James. Mr Depp actually DID have injuries caused by Ms Heard. Black eye (nearly swollen shut) in public, a cast on his hand after a bottle she threw at him severed the end of his finger, and a scar on his face where she put a cigarette out on his skin. She never had any damage. This fact was attested to by her friends, makeup artists, photographers and a tv show host. And she was charged with assault for attacking her wife in public (an airport). The police arrested her. The wife refused to pursue the case and the charges were dropped. This case is nothing to do with taking sides. It&#39;s about justice.

You have nothing on your channels that can controvert that Johnny didn&#39;t throw a phone at the &quot;it&quot; and hit &quot;it&quot; in &quot;its&quot; face. It isn&#39;t new news that people face to face with her saw absolutely no bruises. No charges were ever filed against Johnny because she told the police she was fine. The place was pristine both inside and out. No broken nothing all over the place. Nobody cleans wine and shards of glass up from multiple bottles in multiple areas including out in the hallway and walls. She was serene and comfy when cops arrived and there were no signs of abuse, bruises, on her, nothing. She has zilch medical proof. Johnny, on the other hand, has got medical proof that she lopped his finger off. You can&#39;t do that with a cellphone lol. But, his hand resting on a marble armrest you can quite easily. That&#39;s where they found his finger too. She was frantic in that audio. She knew she fkd up bad. Put a cigarette out on his face. She was literally trying to scar, deface, and break him, in the attempt to arouse him to rage hoping he would assault her. He did not. People like her find ways to drive themselves over the cliff. I don&#39;t wish that for her, but, she&#39;s never going to be truthful so she will get dragged this coming year. But don&#39;t worry. I&#39;m sure Elon will come to the rescue. She&#39;s conned him into thinking it&#39;s personal between him and Johnny haha. His vanity will be spotlighted.",
