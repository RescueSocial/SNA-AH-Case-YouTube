They could even use different shades of red. But I hope they don\u2019t just make it a copy of what Heard\u2019s hair was. Amelia looked so good as Khaleesi. I think she has naturally dark hair so they could even do some deep dark colors. And streak it. Like maybe a deep dark purple and then green at the bottom of a very long wig would look very pretty. I have seen that done on a mermaid look. And it\u2019s looks great. They could even do a golden flame look if they decide to stick with Shades of red, and use gold flecks and gold hair jewels. It would look stunning, and maybe put lighter red gold flame streaks in it against a darker shade.",
