Everytime she talked sh*t about me, it was because somehow I was a useless POS who never did anything right and I was always wrong and I was so terrible for it blah blah blah. I know what it&#39;s like to have a woman make you look like the bad guy when truly, you&#39;re the victim... I haven&#39;t dated in 3 years thanks to that BS experience that I was in for 5 FREAKING YEARS! What a waste of my time... I mean, yeah, sure, maybe I wasn&#39;t best guy, although I was her best since I was the nicest she&#39;s always told me... she always told me I was her best, but yet she&#39;d scold me for no good reasons... although I will admit there were times where I was a BAD person in our relationship, but that wasn&#39;t OFTEN, I tried to be the good guy which 99 percent of the time, I was... but there were times where I was not, this is true... although my God was I treated like garbage. I never realized it until being broken up for a few months. She apologizes about how toxic she was even to this day and still tells me I was her best BF ever... so that&#39;s something... but still practically nothing. I don&#39;t trust women anymore hardly... I may as well go gay, but I can&#39;t really do that... lol that would be impossible for me. :/ :P \ud83d\ude05\ud83e\udd23",
