None said she should end up on the streets, but she, with her job, with the message she could convey, must not be left alone when those kind of, not only, accusations come out. With Depp they did the only thing the should&#39;ve, at that moment, they fired him immediately when she accused him of domestic abuse. It wasn&#39;t a punishment, it was a signal for the rest of us people. They were wrong and maybe they should&#39;ve handle it with more class and cautiousness but, eve if I didn&#39;t believe it possible for him to be an abuser, from the beginning, I think he losing his role of Captain Jack was the right move in that moment, with what we knew back then. When a person have a job or a position extremely delicate (like a doctor, a teacher, or a public figure with a lot of resonance) better safe than sorry. The thing I cannot stand is that he received an harsh but right treatment, she isn&#39;t going through the same path, people are in denial even now that proves have reached the public. In Italy we have a saying that explain my point about how we judge and how we expect others to be worth of a good judgement, it&#39;s about the Emperor Julius Caesar&#39;s wife, we say: &quot;...To be like Caesar&#39;s wife&quot; (You/they/someone have to be like Caesar&#39;s wife) And it have this meaning: Caesar&#39;s wife not only should be above all suspicions, but also she should APPEAR above all suspicions. Because her role (as an example) was so important for the name and the honor and credibility of the Empire that she shouldn&#39;t put herself in any potentially dangerous or promiscuous or debatable situation, ever. So it&#39;s my opinion that when someone is in a certain position, even the slightest suspect should be treated harder, with more cautiousness, faster, because it can have larger consequences (like emulators). A shop assistant can keep his job if he&#39;s suspected to have punched his wife, court will provide private justice for them, but a prime minister, an actor, a doctor etc, are different figures, that&#39;s why I used the ch*ld molestation example, to compare the gravity of the two and yes domestic abuse it&#39;s a very serious matter, just here in Italy, every 2-3 days a woman is killed by her partner or her ex....even now that we&#39;re quarantined, it&#39;s unbelievable, and still the society is helpless because women don&#39;t talk about it (it&#39;s not just a social behavior, it&#39;s instinctive to not let other knows that you are someone&#39;s victim, because predators always attack wounded animals) and also, men do not believe so many of them are abusive. Nowadays the problem, but thank good is in the open!, is that females are doing exactly what some men always have had the chance of doing (add they&#39;re bigger and stronger than us, so they&#39;re more lethal) and that&#39;s why it is SO important to talk about males victims and how it works, it&#39;s not a gender thing, it&#39;s a target thing, and that rightful indignation men are experiencing now, is the right step to recognize that anyone who is allowed to be abusive, anyone who can have easy victims, is going to act like that sooner or later and becoming very dangerous. For years men told women we were exaggerating...we weren&#39;t, and now we have a horde of crazy females who learned this sh*t from some abusive men and are turning tables, making more victims...so it&#39;s important that females are fighting for men and men star fighting for women, we all should be against abuser, even the suspected ones...with proper but clear step in cutting them out of society.",
