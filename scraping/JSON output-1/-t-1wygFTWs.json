I&#39;d probably not come out of that terrible situation my family was going through alive. My family was broken in the process, but we&#39;re all much better today. My children have a halfway decent relationship with their father and I have a new career. Once we all got some sleep things got a lot better. I left science and now work in human services. I really didn&#39;t expect to find him as Marylin Manson. Brian&#39;s speech is vulgar like that, but he&#39;s so normal. His two jerk buddies who helped him I love too. I only figured out the name of one of them. I&#39;m still unraveling. Whiney, I&#39;m gonna find you too. I miss them they were my dysfunctional family of strangers. I hate to see the allegations of abuse against him because they invaded my privacy and were like you know your husband&#39;s abusing you right? He didn&#39;t do half the things these ladies accuse Brian of. If Brian was so upset over the abuse I was going through and was so angry when children were abused and sooo opinionated about how kids should be raised, he didn&#39;t do it.
