You have been very open minded and seem focused  on the  evidence instead of the &quot;gory&quot; details.  On Feb 6th a girl named Greta Aurora released a video detailing her experience when she stayed with MM for a weekend.  She said he was very attentive and gentle and that she had a great time.  She mentioned he bit her and she bit him back and he stopped biting.  The other thing she said  has massive consequences!  She said that she was sent a letter/email last year in Oct. 15 from Illma Gore and Evan Wood to discuss the new  Phoenix Law that Evan and Amber Heard were working on (more on this disastrous  law in a future post).   When Evan came out and finally named her abuser after 5 years on Feb 1st, 2021,  she had nine other accusers  already lined up and with all of their stories in major newspapers and magazines.  MM&#39;s manager, his record company, and TV show had all cancelled him by  later that afternoon.  THIS WHOLE THING HAD BEEN pre-planned, organized and timed for maximum effect.   Evan is right about one thing - WE NEED AN INVESTIGATION!     I have always disliked Evan Wood ever since she came out to support Amber in 2016.  Now many people were fooled by Amber at that  point.  However,  Evan knew Johnny really well then and she was aware that he was a kind, gentle person and she also knew, like the rest of Johnny&#39;s inner circle, that Amber was a crazy,  viscous, violent out-of-control alcoholic subject to fits of rage.  She still picked Amber.",
