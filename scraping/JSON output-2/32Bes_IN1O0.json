Borderlines are more likely to get violent than the general public that is free from serious personality disorders that significantly affect quality of life. And I\u2019m not saying all with BPD are abusive. I\u2019m just being honest. My dad\u2019s second (now ex) wife and my former best friend both have BPD. They were emotionally abusive; one was also physically abusive! This can happen when you have an unstable sense of self, a deep-seated fear of abandonment, are impulsive, get wild mood swings and angry outbursts, are irrational. Just listen to Amber Heard\u2026 she acts out in rage; she has angry outbursts and is both emotionally and physically abusive! Then listen to her change her story in court. She\u2019s a blatant liar. Watch her smirk and roll her eyes. She\u2019s manipulative, lacks empathy. She has a real fear of abandonment and an unstable sense of self. She\u2019s  incredibly self-centered, out of touch. If you look into this, you\u2019ll see Live Abuse Free is spot on in her analysis of Amber Hard, who is pretty classic BPD.",
