You do bring up a good point that if teeth were knocked out you would have a pretty extensive dental bill. And if that were the case it will be a day where she was stuck at the dentist, no such time gap is on her schedule.  there are elevator videos clearly showing her flirting with pretty much everyone.  her claim of not owning a car has been disproven, not only that but Johnny Depp bought her a car or two.  there is zero evidence that anything of violence has come out of Johnny. Even his former girlfriends and people he had relations with a point out he is very passive. Please do not assume because he is a guy that he would be a aggressor.
