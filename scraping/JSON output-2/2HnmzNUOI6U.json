She is uninsurable because all the controversy and the risk something else that is damaging could drop in the future. He said the part that was untrue is that Emilia replaced her. That is a rumor at this point. AH being fired is technically a rumor, but it is one that he said has been confirmed by a source but he is trying to get confirmation from other sources to officially announce it. My own opinion is that if Amber had any current projects or any projects on the horizon she would not be in her current shape. The fact she&#39;s &quot;let herself go&quot; adds credence to the likelihood she was already fired. All her lies are catching up to her and her PR machine can&#39;t spin their way out of it.",
