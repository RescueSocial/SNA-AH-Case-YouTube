One day she got a bruise, looked more like a pimple that got rubbed on to much. Then her bruise was on right side, and then on the left. I&#39;ve studied body language for more than 10 years. And Her whole way of expressing her self is so fake. You can compare her mental state like the victoria secret karen. Both acting childish, with violence when they dont get their way. I&#39;m pretty sure Amber been doing this for years and always been positively confirmed in it untill now. She screwed up big time and i&#39;m going to cheerish the day the judge will destroy her.",
