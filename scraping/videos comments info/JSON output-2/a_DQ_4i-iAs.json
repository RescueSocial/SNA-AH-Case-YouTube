Always heard good things about him and love his acting. My respect slipped a bit when he left his longtime partner and kids, then married Amber Heard. I thought he had made a terrible mistake at the time and it seems like I was right. At some point, when he decided to get political, he made a remark about an actor shooting a president that didn&#39;t go over well with me, but looking back, I suspect that was Amber&#39;s influence at the time. Now, after all this stuff with Amber, it seems to me she was the root cause of all his problems.",

How is this still a question on who\u2019s the abuser?! How has this case not been solved? How is her career thriving while his is ending? ALL of his ex\u2019s came forward to tell everyone that JD was NEVER abusive to them and always kind! HOW with ALL of this proof, is she still the victim?! How has she not LOST the case yet?! I\u2019m completely baffled! This is the most ridiculous thing I\u2019ve ever heard and seen! She is nothing but a complete and total psychopath who gets off on ruining the lives of anyone who dare try to get her out of their lives!

If it were possible for her to get away with, she would have killed him and even then with the way this BS case is going she might have gotten away with that too!!! She\u2019s absolutely loving this! I can\u2019t believe that someone can be soooo damn twisted, disgusting, psychotic towards someone who gave them nothing but love! She deserves to have the exact same done to her! She deserves to lose everything and more! Someone needs to beat her a$$! She is an absolute disgusting, waste of flesh, oxygen, and space who needs to be taken down! She cannot just do this to a beloved, innocent, kind man! Johnny\u2019s only fault was marrying this POS! She is a truly horrifying psychopath who now knows she can get away with something this disturbing so this makes her even more dangerous! FUTURE VICTIMS BEWARE because there are absolutely going to be more victims! Please for the love of god someone take her down and give her a taste of her own psychotic medicine!!! Take her down before she can do this to anyone else! She has been proven to be a big fat liar many times! She says herself how she got the bruises painted on her face to screw him over! She\u2019s disgustingly toxic and manipulates him into thinking he\u2019s at fault too! <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23freejohnnydepp\">#freejohnnydepp</a>",
