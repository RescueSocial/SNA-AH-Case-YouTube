                    "textOriginal": "My husband and I are both survivors of DV in a previous marriages. We called it long before Johnny went public with it. Once you've been in a relationship like that yourself you see the body language in other relationship quite clearly & the body language of these 2 was like a neon sign on the Vegas Strip. Even among the glitz & flashiness of other celebrities the fact that she was abusing Johnny stood out. \nWhat she is doing is the classic move abusers pull.
