It is provocative and he hides in bathrooms  to play the victim like a six year old. She spews her feelings out all over the room and rants in a very painful way. He does not hear her very well. No he does not have to stay when he feels it is abusive. He spars with troll salad. Let us count the fallacies!  It is how abusers exert power and control.  We see how he behaves when he does not know he is being filmed such as in the kitchen. He does not share his values. Perhaps he feels he is not supposed to talk about business to her. Maybe he feels she will not understand and will kick him when he is down. There is nothing pathological anti sharing the story of the ex. There is no proof she was exploiting him. She obviously sincerely cares. It is not what love bombing is. This lie she has no feelings is the omniscient certainty of the narcissist. It is projecting narcissism onto her. He seems to want the tapes and is using this tape to prove to the audience she is a stupid crazy bitch and is planning on exposing her?  It is not appropriate to have her confess to Travis his employee who is loyal to him. It is a power imbalance and Travis is neither neutral nor an appropriate counselor. Is she living in a prison with professional police?  She took and ambien and is losing it. How much does the addiction and mood swings have to do with her pain and confusion?  He plays the  strawman arguments that throw her under  the bus and repeatedly indicates to the audience she is a stupid crazy bitch. They disagree whether it was a punch. Who exaggerated the physical violence first?  Does she minimize his own abuse and exaggerate hers?  It is common for wives of addicts to feel extremely uncomfortable when he associates with others in a gang that revolves around him and hatred and abuse is directed at her. He cringes publically with her like Uriah heep. It is a way to direct hatred and abuse at her like a sociopath. It is odd that a psychiatrist diagnosed<br>Him  with  add only and her as a narcissistic sociopath borderline bipolar. Nonsense. Living with drunks is crazy making. Her comments are verbal abuse. Her metaphors are obnoxious. Her intense emotional expression is dominating. And overwhelming. It is immature. Describing his way of distorting reality in such a cruel and obnoxious way is so insulting. Insulting loved ones is not normal. She has a right to remain silent with Travis and decide together who to discuss this episode with. She took an ambien. They can make people do crazy things. Perhaps she is giving him a good reason to storm out for once. We can see in the kitchen episode the way he said bye that he is being sadistic and knows the effect. There are better choices. At the same time he is obviously having an extreme business crisis. his concern  tho should be for her emotional safety and he has no business falsely accusing he to being selfish. Her questions and the  way she is describing her perceptions of reality are ok.  He should ask her the Motivation for filming instead of rushing to judgement. And level with his motivations for filming. Labeling her a gold digger was sick. Marry a child and then constantly accuse her of being a user?  He does not level about the verbal abuse. No she shouldn\u2019t be expressing hurt and anger all the time and we don\u2019t hear the cause. It is disturbing that her mother inferred amber plays games and told Johnny she loves him and not to tell her daughter they spoke or she will lose her daughter. This is a problem woman. Showing up two hours late to the wife\u2019s birthday party is not ok whether you text or not. With professional assistants one would think scheduling would be handled properly. She is kept in an insecure state and constantly chasing and wanting to understand each other. She risked sharing intimate feelings and so shy about it and now it has been published with ridicule and contempt. The mob out to destroy her is outrageous and devastating. Here we see openly what goes on with so many beautiful women covertly. Obviously he was smearing her as a witch from the beginning and here is the witch-hunt. If he was talking about killing her or only death would break them up it can get play on a persons mind. She could stay and she couldn\u2019t leave because of his false associations she is a phony. It is a double bind and can cause psychosis. He traps her in corners in the audio repeatedly and is the king of fallacious questions.  There is a difference between behavior that leads to distrust and being an inherently untrustworthy  person. Behavior doesn\u2019t always signify WHO YOU ARE. it is too bad she did not read the recovery literature and face<br>Her own demons. This is a wounded child and despairing and shamed to the extent of rejecting God and the faith. It is a hopeless drunks only hope. Contempt before investigation is unfortunate. Reading a few books does not make you an educated intelligent person. Discussing beautiful things came off as empty somehow. There is no point evaluating audios of fights when no one is able to recognize logical fallacies and it just goes to show how sick most of these psychologists are. It is unethical for these therapists to be diagnosing her so cruelly. These two are bright people and both caring and it is a heartbreaking tragedy and the generation gap is significant. She is a woketivist and seems to confuse arrogance and domination with being opinionated and strong. Much of her dialogue is actually weakness and maladaptive defense mechanisms. It is understandable she went to extremes at the courts. The writing was on the wall. Literally. Depp I hope continues to throw himself into aa and it is sad she wasn\u2019t wiser and more supportive of his efforts to maintain sobriety. He has got to let go of the vengeance and desire to destroy and focus on his mental health. Her decision to go to the courts was a<br>Moment of mental clarity and there is truth to the concern that a victimized woman is hated immeasurably for speaking up against a popular and powerful man. His request if his powerful sister to get heard fired was sickening. No one can say what character defects will or will not be removed. The last chapter is not written. This is a young woman and we see the vile condemnation of her and the sick mob at war and the unbelievable lies and distortions.  It is a witch-hunt. No it was not some big lie that she refused to confess to Travis. The assistant claiming he was just bullshitting and mollifying her is extremely problematic. No one deserves that. Depp might not think it\u2019s wrong to trade her or whatever he did but if she doesn\u2019t like that sort of thing he can respect her preferences. There is nothing wrong with her taking her career seriously and obsession with it is not necessarily pathological. It is very obvious she was in love with depp and cared very deeply. It is really too bad these cool guys think it is so superficial to lament how hard she worked on the marriage. It is not evidence of superficiality but a very trusting soul. Some might question the extent of Depps love. Actually. Calling her a c and a b and a funny one was very sad to see. Perhaps he does not remember the innocent ears. There is plenty of other behavior that gives Hollywood pause. The sick description of her was profoundly disturbing and makes one wonder why he hates trump so much. And the hubris involved with imagining oneself the murderer of the president. The fact he despises cowboys seems like perhaps he is yet another man who was taught to hate himself with a split psyche and is actually deeply prejudiced against children like the very young amber heard. Loving someone because she is a c and a b is a sign of reversed polarities and you wonder if he is the one who is not who he is pretending to be. People who excuse amd justify  that kitchen incident and the let\u2019s burn amber game are a dime a dozen. There are plenty of maniacs who will exploit and enable alcoholics and co-sign bullshit. And keep him on his rigid role giving and receiving adulation and pity in a repetition compulsion. It is narcissistic supply and a nihilistic vampire viper fest. Feasting on this lamb to the slaughter. It is common for everyone around the alcoholic to hate the wife and shift all blame to her. He is not the leader who is able to define her defects and explain more functional behavior. The beautiful blonde in Hollywood always seems to get overt or covert annihilated after them. What a shame her setting an example of rejecting the reality of God. Hope she is not on psyche meds. There is something called q96. And diet for the gut brain connection. She deserves protection and care not this unbelievable contempt.  No he had no business leaving when he caught  her filming his horrible behavior. There was no excuse for that bs. He doesn\u2019t know the difference between right and wrong. The exploiters are not his friends. She had a hard time getting away. His rage and false accusations were extreme psychic attacks. She is all bravado. She should pray.",

People who excuse amd justify  that kitchen incident and the let\u2019s burn amber game are a dime a dozen. There are plenty of maniacs who will exploit and enable alcoholics and co-sign bullshit. And keep him on his rigid role giving and receiving adulation and pity in a repetition compulsion. It is narcissistic supply and a nihilistic vampire viper fest. Feasting on this lamb to the slaughter. It is common for everyone around the alcoholic to hate the wife and shift all blame to her. He is not the leader who is able to define her defects and explain more functional behavior. The beautiful blonde in Hollywood always seems to get overt or covert annihilated after them. What a shame her setting an example of rejecting the reality of God. Hope she is not on psyche meds. There is something called q96. And diet for the gut brain connection. She deserves protection and care not this unbelievable contempt.  No he had no business leaving when he caught  her filming his horrible behavior. There was no excuse for that bs. He doesn\u2019t know the difference between right and wrong. The exploiters are not his friends. She had a hard time getting away. His rage and false accusations were extreme psychic attacks. She is all bravado. She should pray.",

When she is yelling shit to me or telling my siblings shit that they shouldn&#39;t put up with, I stand up to her. She then uses an intimidation tactic like making her voice deeper and quieter, threatening to take away everything that makes me happy, glaring at me as if to say, &quot;try me&quot;... so obviously, I do the stupid impulsive thing (cuz no way in hell is she going to make me scared or make me back down or revoke the thing I am standing up against) she reverts to yelling and throwing things at me, pushes me down the stairs and into walls, slapping me, ect. I do not back down. I know this is my fault for &quot;prodding the bear&quot; but the more she tries to hush me the more I refuse to stand down. I also believe that in no way shape or form, no matter how mad or irritating your child can get, should you hit a child. <br><br>The most recent incident I became aware of her abuse was when I remember her very clearly pushing me down my stairs. I looked up at her, horrified. I had no words. She had no remorse as if she could hear what I was thinking, and told me, &quot;oh, stop being a drama queen.

                    "textOriginal": "I just realized my mom does this exact same thing... When she is yelling shit to me or telling my siblings shit that they shouldn't put up with, I stand up to her. She then uses an intimidation tactic like making her voice deeper and quieter, threatening to take away everything that makes me happy, glaring at me as if to say, \"try me\"... so obviously, I do the stupid impulsive thing (cuz no way in hell is she going to make me scared or make me back down or revoke the thing I am standing up against) she reverts to yelling and throwing things at me, pushes me down the stairs and into walls, slapping me, ect. I do not back down. I know this is my fault for \"prodding the bear\" but the more she tries to hush me the more I refuse to stand down. I also believe that in no way shape or form, no matter how mad or irritating your child can get, should you hit a child. \n\nThe most recent incident I became aware of her abuse was when I remember her very clearly pushing me down my stairs. I looked up at her, horrified. I had no words. She had no remorse as if she could hear what I was thinking, and told me, \"oh, stop being a drama queen. You tripped, stop victimizing yourself.\" At first, I tried convincing myself that it was just an accident. Or that I was just being \"dramatic\". But then, very slowly, I was able to separate reality from fantasy. As soon as I could after any incidents, I would write down everything I could remember.
