The video was taken the same day, he found out he lost 650 million dollars and was within days or weeks of his mother's death! She is evil! Plain and simple. The YouTube channel Incredibly Average does a great analysis of the tapes that have been released. Everyone should check it! She is f-ing crazy!!! He just lost 650 million dollars, his mother just died and he finds his crazy wife is trying to video him to frame him! I know this is an older podcast, I hope you guys have changed your views",
