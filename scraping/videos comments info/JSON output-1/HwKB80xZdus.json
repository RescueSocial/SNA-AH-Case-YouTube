She is telling different stories not even the same one. She says she cannot remember what she just heard on the tape. She is an actress used to memorizing lines for films. That should not be hard not remember what she just heard herself say it on the phone and what she says two minutes ago on the stand in her testimony.   The tapes I have heard and the video I saw her play of JD show her acting like a vindictive person. I would say he was tired of her fighting over things . They could have discussed it and said how she was not happy because he visited his neighbor.  After awhile you get to the point it is better not to be in the vicinity of the abuser. You work a lot and  with draw into your self. You feel like your world is spinning out of control and there is nothing you can say or do to stop it. You just give up. If it is not  good together it cannot be bad alone.",
