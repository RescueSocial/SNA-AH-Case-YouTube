Any woman using this excuse to humiliate or take revenge on her partner, the people who enable her, any woman who IS the abuser and turns the accusation on her partner, deserve to be publicly called out and ashamed, because they undermine the huge effort made to protect victims of this sort of abuse.

Instead they're greatly concerned that a spokeswoman for the Me Too Movement would  manipulate her story for her gain, demonizing a man who she abused, causing distrust of actual victims of domestic violence, both men and women. Not only that but anyone watching her interview in court, listening to her secret recordings can hear and see how she lies constantly, manipulates those around her, controlling where the conversation goes to try to make her seem less abusive. But anyone who has been through anything of the sorts can see that she is a liar, which doesn't help when she verifies that he always leaves before she gets physical. Besides, it just doesn't make sense that he would beat her when he can just pay for a divorce and get a new girl, he obviously loved her for long enough to not give up on their relationship even during the hard times. Also, his drunken anger turned to passing out or hiding from her in other rooms Does Not compare to her vitriolic attitude to him and everyone around her.

191,UgwIwHML0iNP9WziU454AaABAg,Haven't been a big fan of debb for awhile now.. All Movies have been terrible since 2008 lol that was the year they really started to Aline with an agenda. Or was more obvious. Amber heard is a hottie... Terrible human being. Neither should be cancelled because of their relationship issues.. That being said. Amber heard should just move into porn she's have alot more respect and support in that industry... Debb unfortunately just needs drink himself into the sunset at this point. His acting has falling off. His health is terrible and he can't barely talk these days so just get out with what respect you got left... Hollywood is dead. Celebrities have become propaganda mouth pieces.    I am a fan of justice so I was following this cause I knew that bunt would squeak out of it ontop.

The cast has to get nervous enough that they go to the studio and demand they recast her part because the negative press is going to badly damage the movie at the boxoffice.

449,UgzzXqOU48woym3nVlJ4AaABAg,"I’m a Potter fan, the books, and the films. I liked the first installment of Beasts, but I was most excited about Depp stepping in as this wonderful villain. I like the 2nd, Beast too, but mostly because we got to see far more of Depp as Grindlewald. He really did the part so flawlessly, and he looked fantastic! Now I will not bother with anymore of these films, and without Depp, all interest is lost. Of course I believe Depp, and as a survivor of domestic abuse, I feel safe in saying that I don’t believe he ever raised a hand to her. Sure, it definitely looks like they had a toxic relationship, and neither was good for each other, but that doesn’t mean Depp is a wife beater, and nothing that I’ve seen thus far proves anything that Jackal has said, quite the opposite actually. Heard reminds me  far more of my abuser than a “sister survivor”. That’s just my honest reaction to all of the evidence, the recordings, and the court transcripts. Nd I actually believed her in the beginning. Yet frankly, unless I hear that an actor is harming children, I could care less what they do in there private lives. I like films, not celebrities . I think WB made a huge mistake. I didn’t even know who Heard was until she began this fiasco, and I didn’t even know that Depp had left his last girl. I just don’t pay attention. Heard does not have a lot of star power. Honestly, they could put any beautiful woman in her role, and it won’t make a lot of difference, but replacing a true talent like Depp can destroy a film. I won’t be seeing either WB film, or any film from WB. I think their work practices are heinous. I won’t be seeing any new Pirate films going forward without Depp either, and I can’t believe Disney would even bother.  The film industry is struggling enough.

He should have moved on when these things happened first. But it is ridiculous how this ... boycott against his carrier doesn't count as harrasment. Or since it happened already, how it doesn't apply to both of them, how it is so partial.

613,Ugy7f31cwpCGenKW2jd4AaABAg,"People will see Aquaman 2. Probably not in such big numbers as saw the first one, but they'll still go if Amber Heard is in the cast or not. More would go if she wasn't, as there wouldn't be any negative buzz, even if the film is just ''okay'. But people will go, it will still make money.  However, people absolutely, positively, will not go and see a 'Pirates' film without Captain Sparrow. It will just seem like a cash-grab tribute act. Like 'the Mask 2' or 'Blues Brothers 2000' or the 'Ghostbusters' remake. To be honest, the brand had become tired anyway. Like Terminator and MIB and Transformers, it doesn't matter what you do, it's the law of diminishing returns in action. It won't make a billion again but, with Captain Sparrow,  it might have still made 6 or 7 hundred million worldwide. Without him, it will be 330 million worldwide, tops, so it will lose money after marketing. That's just a fact. Fantastic Beasts is in trouble. JK Rowling has alienated the woke crowd. Warners have now alienated the anti-woke crowd. Anybody who doesn't feel that it is essential viewing will just be turned-off by all the negative publicity it will receive from the partisans that filters into the mainstream through osmosis. The last film wasn't well-received. The next part already doesn't seem essential. The problem is that they're all being led by Marketing departments that think 'clicks' translates to bums on seats, and it doesn't when those clicks aren't actually just about the film (tv series, whatever) itself. People are 'interested' in seeing a car crash, but nobody wants to be sat in the back seat for one.",kris hall,0,2020-11-13T15:22:14Z

She is the daughter of a hereditary Lord, and is also in charge of the Royal Jockey Club. 

It was just a coincidence that the lockdown was imposed in March just after the Cheltenham festival, which has something like a million people visiting the town for a week long horse racing event.

I guess we'll see, but I don't see a Pirates of the Carribean without J.D. and although I haven't watched the last Fantastic Beasts, since they kind of established the look of J.D. as Grindewald, they'd have to put out some bullshit shenannigans to explain why he changed face.

As a survivor of dv I am standing with many other survivors who may or may not have been able to get justice in their own lives but they are fighting for justice in this.  I am watching this 16 hours after you put it up and there's now over 1 million signatures on the petition! The reason WB fired Johnny is because they are sinking and they are sinking fast.  They used the travesty in the UK as their excuse so that the media narrative will not focus on the mass exodus and the newest round of firing within.  So considering the position that WB is in,  I think they will definitely be getting rid of the turd.  They simply can't afford for 1 million plus people to boycott this movie if it is green lit.  That is the only thing I don't like,  with all of the press around the petition and the fact that they are in debt so deep (150 million I think) they might scrap the movie all together and I don't want the other actors to suffer because a abuser is part of the film.  As for Pirates ☠ there's a rumor that Jerry Bruckheimer wants Johnny back and as you said,  Johnny is Pirates ☠  as for Margo R.

As for me i hear pirates of the carbian...theme song plays, ships mast sales into port and Captain Jack Sparrow dismebarks it is between that and "" you will always remember this as the day you almost caught Captain Jack Sparrow""

Could i see any other character leading the franchise i doubt it there have been other good characters but none that play the lovable rouge as well and that means you strike off in a new direction or you try to copy amd that for me is probally going to be Captian Jack was better....assuming i ever watch another pirates moving not containing Johnny Depp",var kesh,0,2020-11-12T21:15:12Z

1222,UgzGSRyhLIo3-_0kR8h4AaABAg,"The movie is called ""AQUAMAN"" not ""MERA"".  

If nearly 2 million online petitioners didn't move HBO to re-do season 8 of Game of Thrones with different showrunners.  And, Game of Thrones is HBO's biggest Cash Cow that generated over $3 Billion in Net profits for HBO, what makes you think WarnerBros is going to cave in?

The only way Amber Heard is not on Aquaman 2 is if Amber Heard has contractual issues with WarnerBros.  Nothing else.

Petitions may have had real teeth back in the 1970s when they called on the network to bring back the Bionic Woman after they killed her off in the Six Million Dollar Man.  People were really attached to her character, such as, young girls, kids who were hospitalized and adults who just fell in love with Jamie Summers(Bionic Woman).

If WarnerBros gives in, that would be setting a precedent, such that, Hollywood will not be able to create a film/tv show without having it go through a committee of millions of people.  That does not make sense.  You will have a million different ideas of where a show/film should go.

Don't be like Disney.  Disney painted themselves in a corner when they decided to be only family friendly.  Disney made their bed.  They have to lie in it.  So, of course they will hire and fire based on the room temperature of the fans.  WarnerBros is not all family friendly.  Netflix is not all family friendly.

Be who you are and stick to it. And, stop throwing your friends, family and actors under the bus if they find themselves in some trouble because ""FANS"" won't like to see them in your film.  That's stupid.  That's how great talent gets lost and goes missing.

Johnny hasn't had a fair shake yet, and he's not likely to get it in the rigged system.
Despite his proof of her wrongdoings, he's been fired TWICE now, and she's been allowed to continue her work without so much as a stern talking to. He's not going to get a fair win here, and it's obvious.
It sucks, but this is the shit that men have to put up with now. The only thing we can hope for is that this situation somehow brings the clear bias in the forefront for everyone to see plainly, though I doubt that will happen either.

Regardless of what the media wants to spin, for this company to remain consistent with their continuous statements of not supporting people with records of domestic violence, they must fire Heard as she is a proven domestic abuser by her own words.  

If they keep Amber Heard, they are basically saying ""women caught domestically abusing their partners cannot be held accountable...""
