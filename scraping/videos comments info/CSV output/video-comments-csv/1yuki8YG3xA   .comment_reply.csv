Yes.  That's part of why I feel that the best approach is to recommend to people that everyone that they only engage in sexual activity while sober or at least avoid doing it while significantly inebriated.  And that way, we can make it a gender neutral message that doesn't really blame anyone, but just acknowledges the reality that people are more likely to make ill-informed choices if they're under the influence.",2021-07-11T19:08:55Z,1

What would think about just advising people to not engage in sexual activity, both men and women, while under the influence?  While it's true that sex offenders can still commit their crimes without being under the influence, it does that they are sometimes more willing to cross boundaries and such when they are under the influence.  Accordingly, I think it may be best to advise everyone to be sober when involved in sexual activity.",2021-07-11T17:33:43Z,0

A rapist is going to rape whether a person is wearing clothes or not.  Dressing modestly doesn't make it somehow harder for a rapist to rape, nor doesn't it really make it less likely for them to rape.  Rape is usually premeditated,  and is also usually motivated by anger towards the victim, or a desire to assert oneself over them.  It's not usually motivated by being sexually attracted to the victim.",2021-07-10T22:36:55Z,0

Maybe I'll shoot her a link to Miss Watson, her dad ( a year younger than me) voted for Trump so there's some conservative influence there.  Plus I like Hispanic family values.  4/5 of the last women I've dated weren't white, the other was just a ho, wait' no she was Hispanic too, just light  I'm not fond of white women so much anymore, they seem to suck up the socialism a lot easier because they never lived it.

 Who knows frankly? 

These sentiments, perhaps, may be driven by Lookism to a reasonable degree, as people tend to be more forgiving towards those they find attractive. Even the opinions of jurors and judges do not seem to be spared the effects of our sensitivity to beauty or aesthetics.

For example, and to the advantage of young women ( though not exclusively in every case), features of neoteny may promote feelings of bonding, feelings of trust and lack of culpability for one's actions in others. More specifically, consider the following;

Big, round and lightly coloured  eyes may be perceived as juvenile, innocent and empathic, whilst, on the other hand; smaller, sharper and darker eyes may be perceived as suspicious, sinister or predatory. 

Charisma, status and notoriety, or put crudely: social proof,

 may influence people's opinions of others to a considerable extent, and I would wager that, for women, this is more readily factored into their opinions of any given man than vice versa. 

Furthermore, what culture or subculture are we observing here, what are the values espoused by the media it produces, and, thus, by the people with whom those are engaged?

Setting aside the analysis, though, for people on the receiving end of their false stories and accusations, the best functional approach is just to treat them as liars.

What I was getting at, however, was that radical feminism has shot themselves in the foot by outright insulting men when they do find an avenue to seek help and work to destroy the services that are designed to help men find the help they need when they also defend the point of toxic masculinity in this context as an inherent problem. In short, I was pointing out the hypocrisy. 

Coincidentally, in Australia, men are just as likely to seek help for mental health issues as women are, so in an Australian context toxic masculinity holds no water.",2021-01-02T20:30:53Z,1

She keeps having these episodes where her brain just literally doesn't shut down at night and she'll get maybe 2-3 hours of sleep a night (I would know because I get woken up while she's up cleaning or doing stuff around the house at 3-4 AM for a whole week). After a few days of getting very little sleep while her mind is constantly running she really breaks down and she'll start hallucinating that she's conversing with actual spirits of the dead among or starts thinking she's dead and in the afterlife.

Yet despite this, anti male affirmative action is still rampantly practiced here.  The law is still stacked against men and not a murmur from the ""equality advocates"" in adjusting this.  But not yet in the physical, outdoor arenas. It seems that the more unpleasant the work ithe less the ""equality"" crowd are interested in taking it on.  So these are still left to men. So where equality of performance still applies the fields are segregated naturally. Women do naturally better at certain tasks, men readily concede this and choose not to enter them but feminists won't admit this and insist on quotas and down graded performance standards. In order to get equality of numbers we get an inequality of performance. (But still the same pay.)
Perhaps the ultimate icon of this is Google where an internal review showed they were paying the middle management (the human resources/inclusivity crowd, -mostly female) more than the code writers (the folks that create the wealth that pays the wages / bills) who were almost entirely men. Going affirmative action in the code writing dept does not work. Here performance is mandatory. (Pun not intended).",2020-12-21T17:49:58Z,0

As if that doesn't make it hard enough, you then have to prove intent, which it's self is nearly impossible, and that they published it purely as a malicious act against you.

It was in UK, so the news doesn't get quite as much protection as the US, but it's still pretty much the same requirements. If you want you can add in the questionable impartiality of the judge, but whether you subscribe to that or not it's pretty easy to see how he could lose, regardless of his guilt.

To be honest most of the trial had nothing really to do with the suit, pretty sure it was more for the theatrics than the case it's self. They wanted to make Depp look guilty, and failed spectacularly, but his actual guilt was never relevant in that suit so they had to settle for him just losing the case and hope people didn't look into it beyond that. Sadly, it worked for a frightening number of people who are convinced losing the case equated to him being guilty.",2021-03-15T18:30:37Z,1

560,UgzOS1I8-Xc8Tc5dvW14AaABAg,John Rew,"@DOOM SLAYER I'm very concerned with the welfare of men. I have two sons.  I am not , however, convinced that anyone is coming to save us.  I see men as the real nurturers in that they nurture the entire society.  Part of the evidence for this is that men are the only ones expected to absorb violence and sacrifice their lives.   I envision this as a large group of people huddled together, women and children are on the inside of that group protected from the outside by a layer of adult men.  On the inside of this group is warmth and protection from the outside environment.  To be on the outside you must be resilient against the cold, heat and violence. Those on the inside may seem all fuzzy warm and of course close to the children but it is the hard and resilient outsiders who are taking the blows and sacrificing. They are the true nurturers, the first line of defence without which the rest would be doomed.  Now that we have artificially calmed the environment the insiders are poking their heads out and saying ""you outsiders have been oppressing us"". ""look we didn't need you after all"".  There are two problems with this attitude. The outsiders have evolved to resist the environment so insiders will not be able to compete with them.  The insiders are still somewhat protected through the transfer of resources and the reservation of safe spaces. 
No one is going to protect men . We are the protectors.  I think MGTOW is a great idea .  But it's harder than it seems . We are programmed to be the outsiders . A rule of thumb is ""if you wouldn't do it for a man don't do it for a woman"".",2020-12-26T07:33:34Z,0

It is against the law someone to get lower salary if they have exactly the same qualifications, the same post and the same working hours. The reason women are sometimes paid less for the same job is because they do not take the full 8-hour shift or take less overtime because they have other business to attend to. By law two people with the same qualifications, same position and same working hours, they must have the same salary. If they don't then the employer is breaking the law and the employee can easily sue them for that.

""Feminism"" especially this extreme type of ""believe women and never believe men"" or women getting special treatment in these cases of domestic violence while men are ""guilty till proven otherwise"" insults me and my intelligence as a woman who believes that I can do better than just playing the universal victim with ""feministic declerations"" and wish for actual equality.

And to be clear I am all about equality.
