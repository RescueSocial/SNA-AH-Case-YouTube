I think what he means is that unlike ‚ÄòDeadpool‚Äô and ‚ÄòLogan‚Äô, the MCU aren‚Äôt allowed to have creative freedom because even though they can add bits of creativity, they have to follow according to Kevin Fiege‚Äôs plan. Mostly, all of the MCU are sci-fi movies (excluding The Winter Soldier) or comedy. Apparently, ‚ÄòDoctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness‚Äô was planned to be a horror film by Derrickson but he left the project due to creative differences. Yes, I‚Äôm aware that Sam Raimi (The Evil Dead and Drag Me to Hell) is directing the film but despite that, the sequel is going to be a part of a multiverse crossover and have only bits of horror elements added to it.
