I'm not saying that lightly - proving allegations to be false is nigh impossible, and a not guilty verdict is nowhere near enough. However, if it is proven that the allegations were maliciously false, not just unproven or mistaken, the accuser has no excuse for trying to ruin someone's life through lies. For attempting to bring the full force of the state down on an innocent person, the accuser should get a taste of their own medicine - with the same punishments if found guilty.",2020-08-01T11:26:18Z,0

Hes too calm and collected and he knows it. I just kept saying. No it's not John. It's her. I knew it from the start. From day one. Hes not like that. She is. Hes not. And they still raised a girl. Look at his daughter. Shes all over her dad with love. Hes not it. Amber is. U dont see her doing that to her mom. Shes not up there oh my moms sweet too. No. Shes like saying nothing about her mom. She just sticks up fr her dad. I wld too anyday. Her dads innocent of violence. Maybe having to protect himself from Heard. Yah hes cool. I've always known that. Look at edward scissorhands. Theres proof. Anybody else wld be like. Omg how do u do this. Johnny, he just dealt with it. And beautifully I might add. I think edward scissorhands is one of my favorite movies. Hes so calm and collected in the movie. She works with him so well. And he finally gets hands. And he doesnt know what to do with them bc hes so used to the other things. Anyways. Good movie. One of johnys best. I love that movie. Yes I do.",2020-07-19T16:28:44Z,0
