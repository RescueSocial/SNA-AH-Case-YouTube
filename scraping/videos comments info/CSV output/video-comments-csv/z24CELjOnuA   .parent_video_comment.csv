Depp has been his worst own enemy.  Musk is a friend of Heard and helps her - his decision.  I don't agree what is happening to Manson.  The women knew what they were agreeing too.

58,UgwZ1CWpdMcRQbMScIN4AaABAg,"Exactly! I concur.
I couldn't figure out why would someone who is ''so smart'', ''so influential'' etc. play this stupid, pathetic, dumb role in the unnecessary and diabolic attack on an innocent 'brother'. Why would doing the right thing, respecting another's marriage (even if or especially when it's in a downward spiral), putting yourself in another's shoes and help them up rather than hurt them  be the decision to choose? But I also know that education, riches and influence do not automatically travel with good character, class or thoughtfulness. These have to be worked on and it's always easier to work on things and others than on oneself. So, I determined that he was always jealous of JD and maybe felt small in relation to him so he seized the chance to make JD smaller. Only they are in different fields and there is room at the top for both of them and a lot more... so his actions are just low and dirty. I guess insecurity is stronger for him. But that is just me trying to make sense of his pointless part in this situation.

Basically, he is not so dissimilar to Mr. D.
Probably they have much more parallels than others of us.

However, the fact that said M, for whatever reasons, now stands up for this person H shows that M lacks in a special way to distinguish right from wrong, good from evil. 

How can a human being, who is of pure intention, participate in the destruction of another person, even if only as a supporter. Especially when the aggrieved party, in this case Mr. D, has just brought so much good through his works for especially many, often underprivileged, young people, adult dreamers, but also you and me?

93,UgxiapF2D7XZAAy8VNp4AaABAg,Musky's affair at JD's home a month into the marriage-really upsets me.  it's so disrespectful - and lazy (get a hotel room).  Having JD's elevator key to the penthouse - disturbing.  I also question if he was involved in the ACLU targeting JD which blew up JD's reputation.   I wonder how deep he is involved in ruining JD's reputation and how much he has paid or is continuing to pay to AH. But in texts with AH - she lies to him and says she was ab*sed by JD and he offers security.  so he was not part of the scam.    he has admitted to asperger's - having a disability can make him easier to manipulate.   He has a swollen face with injuries when out with AH - supposedly after breaking up with her.  He is the richest (or almost the richest) man in the world - he is a mark for a con-woman. I think she played on his jealousy of JD and pushed him to help her.

I thought why does that guy name sound familiar. Well we all changed physically over the years but that name. So I looked over past photos of years gone by on the internet and well it was him whom I met in 08 after his first and before his second wife. My impression he was sweet, professional and I felt protective. Timing was wrong though and how we met was very random. I have been watching a lot of videos and still think back of my first impression. I wish that guy stayed with his second wife the woman he met right after me. I do not know why he picked the nameless one and the others. I am not him. You are saying what a lot of people have on their minds. I wish all of this never happened but the reality is that it did. I still envision the younger man and I wish he maintained that. I think somewhere in his mind he wish he did as well.",Pisces P,0,2021-05-30T13:12:00Z

First thought, the level of grandiose here is probably at an all time high. I don't think I've ever seen someone's level of self importance so bloody high that they believe their opinion on another's choices is their business, and their right to not only formulate strong opinions on, especially in this context, but also and more importantly that they believe that they should make a video, addressing this person.¬†


What sort of insecurity & psychological obstacle is it that you hold, Kurtz? I'm genuinely asking because this right here seems to be impulsive and it has potential in backfiring on you.¬†

You are beyond in need for a self evaluation. And I don't mean any disrespect.¬†


I'm worried about your focus, well being and the status of the health in your marriage? Is he away from home alot? Do you feel alone in your views and you need to be heard? Is this why you're always posting your videos far too many times everyday?¬†

I have to tell you that doing that doesn't make any difference. Besides why do you need a bigger audience so badly? Why do you feel like not enough people agree with you?¬†

Or maybe it is that you don't feel like enough people disagree with you?¬†


I'm thinking it's a combination of both dependening on your mood. Your audience is there for you, to confirm your thinking is normal and to judge how many it seems to ""upset people"" feeds your need tor the boredom in your life.¬†

And the fact that your husband probably cannot stand any of this subject.¬†


Your YouTube audience supports your obsession on all of this. You can tell.¬†


Girl, I'm warning you now, you're digging a hole. Nobody needs to know your opinion on their life that you are misled to believe you know anything about.¬†


I want to hear you speak on the human flaws of your own life instead. Show us something real. Show us something human and vulnerable and that has the possibility of you losing your audience.¬†

Do something brave and bold.¬†

This isn't it. This is honestly and extremely uncreative, rude, arrogant and pompous.¬†

Elon is the geek with a chip on his shoulder. Here is my theory, for what it's worth:

1st, Elon is jealous because he'll never be Johnny Depp. His, class, his style, his modesty and sweetness, utterly unattainable for Mr Musk. 
And 2nd, I think he embarrassed himself in the beginning with AH;  having an affair, paying the charities, believing her stupid stories. Then, when it all came to light, I think, for him, it's easier to just let Amber run her course, give her the lawyers and walk away, than to stand up and admit he did a bad thing. That money is peanuts to him. He can afford to bankroll the whole thing and pretend it's not happening. And it's uncomfortable. Of course it is. Elon Musk, taken for a fool by AH? Imagine!

All the crapola with the ACLU is coming out anyway, so maybe now is actually a good time for Elon to be truthful about his relationship with AH. I believe that Elon was duped by AH and trusted her version of events ,and thought he was saving her from Johnny. But as with absolutely everyone, he must have realised the truth about her some time ago. He was lucky to get out from her clutches, but I think he still cared for her and she likely had dirt on him , as well as the fight over the embryos. I bet she thought she had Elon over a barrel with the embryos - but that did not work out. His companies are likely to suffer from all of this, but he needs to clear an innocent man and he has been enabling AH to hurt JD. As I said Elon was likely acting in good faith at the beginning but that has not been the case for a long time. He will do better to come clean now rather than wait for more and more to come out and harm him anyway.

He serves his Masters who run the propaganda machine, manipulating him on how to act and what to say like a soulless little marionette puppet. What goes around comes around Elon..., Karma has got its sights set, and there's a special place in Hell reserved for people like you. There Is No Escape from Universal retribution Elon.

240,UgxmWUDNFb4_tqC6iZR4AaABAg,"The Musk Rat,
He's been taunting Johnny with Amber because he thinks he's the bigger man, because she's manipulated him into thinking that. He may be book smart, he may have a high IQ but he is basically a nasty teenage boy.The Nerd grew up and stole the captain of the football teams girl... pft nope that girl used him to get back at her handsome popular gifted  ex just like he used her to show everyone he can out do the hot guy too.
He's an egomaniac and he give 0 fcks about how Johnny feels. There's some evidence that shows he was desperate to meet Amber and manipulated meetings even when he knew Johnny was on the scene it did NOT stop him. He is as bad as she is! He acted like he was riding in to save the damsel in distress but he was always doing it for his own ego, his own selfish reasons.",Deb,0,2021-05-30T05:28:47Z
