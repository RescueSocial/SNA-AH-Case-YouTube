You hear one side of a story and then you insist on hearing the other's side to make your own rational conclusion and compare the facts.


In the meantime you can of course be supportive of the person who comes forward about being abused but you will not destroy someone's life in an act of self justice (ever because that's illegal but especially not with the other side not being able to defend him/herself.)

All she had to do was stop saying her abused her. But no, she enjoyed her victim status too much. She called his bluff by writing that article on being abused last year and now she's paying the price.  She was used to walking all over him and thought she still could. He is now suing her to prove his innocence.  He could have done it then.  He's always had the evidence.

Shis is angry with him because walked away from her when she got violent instead of staying and maybe being forced to fight back which he didn't want.  She called him a baby for calling his security guard in to stop her attacking him including telling Johnny he should sleep with his security.  Said no one would believe him if he told a judge and jury she was the only one being violent by saying I only weigh this much, no one will believe you.  When he said you punched me, she said I only hit you I didn't punch you (but he had bruises). Admited throwing pots and vases at his head.  When he complained his son was being told at school that his father beat up his wife, she replied well my family and friends are getting threats, ignoring his son's bullying. She lost her temper often on those tapes.  There's much more but you'd have to listen to them both in total to hear it all.  He is calm the whole time. He has a lot of evidence including police and other witnesses to back his claims that he was never violent but she was. He also had evidence from witnesses that the bruises she showed in court to get a restraining order were not there when she was taping a show the day before the court date including from a makeup artist on James Cordon's show.

If it wasn‚Äôt he wouldn‚Äôt have been fired by Disney (and now they‚Äôre trying to reboot PoTC with a new Captain Jack Sparrow which will BOMB - even if the movies started getting a little worse - though I LOVED the 5th one and only think the 4th is a bit shaky but decent), and lost other roles. He‚Äôs fortunate Rowling believed in him as he plays Grindelwald quite well (I still have to see the 2nd movie as I was recovering from nearly dying when it came out, but just the little bit at the end of the 1st movie sold me). But who knows what roles he lost. Especially as he‚Äôs a talented actor who gets overlooked by the Academy - I was really hoping he would win when he was nominated for playing Sweeney Todd in ‚ÄúSweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street‚Äù. He was AMAZING in that role. The whole cast was, even Sasha Baron Cohen (who originally was to play Freddie Mercury instead of Rami, but they kept butting on artistic and story differences) who does his own singing (and can sing DAMN high notes). That film is so under-appreciated with it‚Äôs fairly faithful adaptation of the original musical, and it‚Äôs star power. Still my favorite Sondheim musical (even though ‚ÄúInto the Woods‚Äù is very good, and Disney didn‚Äôt do too bad adapting it, with slight tweaks that were okay so younger audiences could see it), and I can‚Äôt choose between it and ‚ÄúHamilton‚Äù as my favorite musical. I‚Äôve seen A LOT of musicals, and/or listened to A LOT of musical soundtracks, and though they are vastly different, it‚Äôs hard to choose between them as they both have so many strengths.

And I will always argue that Disney‚Äôs two ‚ÄúAlice in Wonderland‚Äù movies (that ironically had a lot of the ‚ÄúSweeney Todd‚Äù cast in it), were good movies, and I adore the collectible doll of Cohen‚Äôs character from the second movie my parents got me (as they couldn‚Äôt find the Mad Hatter). And I will always argue that Depp‚Äôs Mad Hatter portrayal, even down to the character and costume design (both of which I do often, though at the moment not professionally), is magnificent and I can‚Äôt think of another actor who could have done it better. Though secretly, part of me wonders what Hatter we would have gotten if Joaquin Phoenix did it (but made sure it was in a tone suitable for younger audiences).",2020-02-08T03:36:18Z,1

557,Ugxcm-bN-YpXlDnbCOx4AaABAg,Valar Morghulis,there are no 'ifs' here. if you listened with comprehension you'll know who the abuser is. so suddenly just because she is a woman now we all have to 'wait for more'. you are not being attacked. people contradicting your opinion and stating facts that you misunderstood is not attacking you.  it's called pointing out the obvious.,2020-02-10T04:56:18Z,0
558,Ugxcm-bN-YpXlDnbCOx4AaABAg,Teresa Niswander,"@Valar Morghulis I believe that too but was attacked for stating that when the abuse story first broke. Even when I mentioned her previous arrest for domestic violence, they would state that it doesn't matter and that we should believe all women who say they were abused. So I try to be more careful with my statements online - I am hoping that someday a person can give their opinion without being attacked for not following what other people believe it right.",2020-02-08T03:47:35Z,1
559,Ugxcm-bN-YpXlDnbCOx4AaABAg,Teresa Niswander,"@JellyBabie1984 I do not believe her. I made comments to that fact when this first came out and was attacked for not believing a woman. I saw the photos where she had no bruises at (the day after the attack with the phone that she stated left her with swelling and bruising) and then when she knew paparazzi were around, would have bruises that mysteriously kept moving on her face. I also brought up the fact of her previous domestic violence arrest and people would just dismiss it. I have never met her, but got a weird vibe from her whenever I would see photos or videos of them together - something just seemed so off to me.",2020-02-08T03:45:30Z,2
560,Ugxcm-bN-YpXlDnbCOx4AaABAg,JellyBabie1984,@Teresa Niswander Why are we all believing the lady who barely got away with hitting her ex girlfriend in the first place without proof. Witnesses saw her being abusive to her ex but they claimed oh it's sexism or homophobia and the charges got dropped. She is manipulative individual.,2020-02-08T03:29:32Z,3
