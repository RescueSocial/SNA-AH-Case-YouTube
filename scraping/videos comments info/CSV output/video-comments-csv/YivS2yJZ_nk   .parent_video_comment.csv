From that point on you are always going to have that group that (regardless of the evidence proving you innocent) are convinced in their thick brainless skulls that you did and that despite evidence saying otherwise the still think you are and shoulda been guilty.

Australia is free of rabies and other canine diseases which are common in the USA.  Bringing the dogs here without proper procedures was bad enough.  Sending them out to a dog grooming salon was beyond the pale.  Her dogs could have spread diseases via Australian dogs coming in contact with their fur, saliva or urine.

If you work for such people, check everything you are given BC your private emails so you have back up evidence and don't just sign any NDA without having your own solicitor check it over and amend it so that you cannot lie for them in a criminal matter.
There are many other rich people who are not famous you can work for.

Our island continent has saved us from most of these but the quarantine ensures this situation remains. Australians generally knew this info when I was younger but I don't know if the kids do now. Imagine something getting loose in a land where almost every home has either a dog or a cat or both. We have less than 25 million permanent residents & one of our larger exports other than mining is produce, or beef & lamb & wool. Our beef, sheep & native animal numbers are far higher than human population. None of these animals have immunity to the illnesses animals overseas have.
From the RSPCA's website: ""There are over 29 million pets in Australia and we have one of the highest pet ownership rates in the world. Approximately 61% of households in Australia own pets, with dogs being the most common (40%), followed by cats (27%)."" I'd suggest their cat numbers are outdated & outback where dogs are used in herding on large stations many of these animals wouldn't be chipped. You call these places ranches btw but a ranch in Australia is a farm. Our cattle & sheep stations are in the hundreds of thousands of acres. Quarantine here is a very serious business.

Either way, it's paper thin, and I doubt the Australian legal system will go for trying to get her to come back to Australia.

She wielded her power and status like a weapon and deserves every foul thing and misfortune that comes her way, and then some.  She is a repulsive human being.  She is human garbage in fact.  A simple mistake or bad call can be overlooked, but this is a series of repeated misgivings that she has perpetrated time and time again over her career, so this can't be overlooked or overstated.

She needs to be held accountable to the highest extent of any laws applicable.

She considers herself above it all and needs to be reminded in the most appropriate and most direct manner possible that she is a nobody in the eyes of law.  She is just as common as the rest of us and just as accountable.  That her fame and status holds no sway whatsoever and will not curry her any favor within the legal system.

What is headed her way is a culmination of her lifetime of bullshit and fuckery.

I couldn't be happier about that if I had scripted it myself.

The section where it says the dogs would have to fly in the commercial hold means cargo hold. This isn't an elite concern.
Pets do frequently die when traveling in cargo hold section of the plane. This can be due to shifting cargo, temperature drops that are extreme, stress without anyone even checking on the animals, reduced oxygen in that section of a commercial flight. 
This is NOT an elites only concern. I am a dog breeder and WILL not deliver my puppies to their new families via cargo hold travel. It happens much more frequently than people realize, fatalities of pets traveling in this manner. 
Its an elite issue that she didn't just place her dogs with a kennel or dog sitting service at that point.

Is perjury serious?

Yes.¬†

Perjury is regarded as a serious criminal offence because it negatively impacts on the ability of the justice system to get to the truth. It has been said that it is an offence that¬†‚Äústrikes at the heart of the justice system‚Äù.¬†
Penalties for perjury are usually quite severe. It is very common for jail sentences to be imposed for those convicted of perjury. The length of that jail term will depend on the nature and circumstances of the perjured evidence""

The offence of perjury consists of deliberately giving false testimony in a judicial proceeding. In Queensland perjury is codified in Section 123 of the Criminal Code 1899. If a person has been lawfully sworn in as a witness and knowingly make a false statement that could affect the result of the proceeding, they can be charged with perjury. This is the case whether the person is an adult or a juvenile. Perjury is a very serious offence as it can undermine the integrity of the judicial system and result in miscarriages of justice. the maximum for perjury is imprisonment for 14 years (Section 124).",Oscillate Wildly,0,2020-10-24T01:32:44Z

1095,UgwVSSUHTnag8h8iT-Z4AaABAg,"Get your facts straight before you post.  In Australia Commonwealth FEDERAL Law and Queensland STATE Law are two different things.  Five years is the maximum for perjury under Federal Law under which she is being investigated, but true if she was being tried under State Law, which she is not, the maximum is fourteen years for perjury.  So the fourteen years is false information.  You don't usually mess up but maybe you are just click baiting.

New Zealand is literally a unique location on the Earth and its law system is heavily centered on conservation. The ten-day quarantine is actually super light considering it's in place for people to recognize parasites and diseases in the animal because they can spread extremely fast unchecked. Most NZ wildlife also has literally no sense of danger owing to a complete lack of predators larger than a spider, and that isn't hyperbole. Snakes? Nonexistent. Wolves? Nope. Big cats/cats at all? Negative. You can quite literally just pick up a kiwi bird at times if you're lucky. Dogs already have a stigma in NZ and taking a ratting dog there is a hard sale out of the gate.

The probation system tries to make room for people who have worse crimes than Amber's.. i bet you she does 2yrs and 1 day.. i was robbed by two guys and they were caught-complete strangers beat me to an i nch of my life. I was kicked in the jaw causing my upper teeth to rip straight thru including the nerve of my bottom lip- plus my orbital bones in my ocular Left Eyewear crushed in the corner of my eye next to my nose and now since I had a serious surgery on my right eye with a titanium plate surgery that lasted 6hours cause the broken bone fell into my sinus so it had to be removed from my mouth along the upper gums above the teeth- sewed that up, then the rest was from being choked out unconsciously where I woke up with one eye shut and blood everywhere because my lip bled like a bitch. The guys must have thought they killed me cause all that they took was my Samsung smart phone I guess so I couldn't call 911.. there was money on the table a brand new lap top, led smart TV, and a pressure washer.. these guys saw me spending thousands and when I called a cab to go home they just so happened to be in the front seat.. after I was dropped off the two came over to beat me up and take whatever they could but nothing else.. idk what had happened when I came to-but then I re n embered the cab and t he police went after her and she gave up her boyfriends name and the other name from him.. the one in the cab who Orchestrated the robbery got 5yrs but only did 2yrs and 1 day. The other guy who walked in second was the guy who kicked me in ghe face and he set to serve 15yrs when he gets out of prison for his part. Kicking a guy in the jaw while i was on all four and i looked over and saw his feet coming in and as i b slowly came up-BANG! The other huy then jumped on my back with me in a choke hold-lights out.. i was in icu for 4days.. ive got there info where they live and I will find them one day and pay a little visit.. justice will be served and swiftly in the same manner as they did to me.. i was nice enough b to allow the guy from the cab in to usevthe phone but what happened to me wasn't expected.
