Thank you for those punctuation marks, I did already have them all at my disposal but congratulations, your point has been made. We must all use correct punctuation marks even in the comments of YouTube videos, just in case someone doesn't know when to naturally take a breath in a sentence. Now as you have rightfully pointed out my error I wish to return the favour. I WAS NOT INTERACTING WITH YOUR COMMENT. If you actually read my first comment it says that I found it funny to take offence at the presenter, stating his own belief. Whilst YOU may not have stated whether or not you were personally offended, the two people replying to your comment absolutely stated that they were indeed personally offended by his comment, hence every time I replied to this comment thread to you directly your profile name preceded my comment/reply. As I wasn't actually responding to your comment when your name came up admittedly I was a little confused what you were asking of me with your comment of ""I'm sorry, Sir, do we know each other"". Perhaps I should have reminded myself of the original comment but, alas, I did not. Unaware of whether you were agreeing with me or insulting me I posted a quote from a meme I found humorous, assuming that whatever you meant would most probably end there and I could get on with my day, however the initial misunderstanding seemed to have spurred us both on to trade barbs. You are correct that my posts seem to assume your possible religion and I don't disagree as far as I am concerned other people's religions are none of my business until they start spouting scripture in a non theological discussion, however considering your exception to one comment that to me was just a slightly humorous observation about the hypocrisy of some religious people, it seemed a fair observation at the time. As to your 'who hurt you' and references to my assumed passion on the subject, followed by what seems like suggestions of me being lazy? I would say it's pretty fair to suggest we have both cast assumptions on the other. Lastly I would just like to say I don't know you, and you don't know me so whilst all the passive aggressive taunts of 'who hurt you' and 'what are you really upset about' and honestly the weird reference to coronavirus was not upsetting to me, I feel could be upsetting to others if you respond to other people in a similar way who seem to disagree with you. I truly hope this is not insulting to you as I feel no ill will towards you and simply that you mistook a comment that was not being directed towards you, as such.
( I know this comment is very long, considering your apparent discomfort in my previous lack of punctuation, and in order to quell this ridiculousness I felt the need to be concise.)",2020-09-10T19:28:55Z,0

So I‚Äôll just say this, 
Unfortunately for you, we don‚Äôt know each other. Therefore, you couldn‚Äôt possibly know my religious beliefs, overall views or what I do when I interact with people. 
However, for some reason unbeknownst to me, your comments have been permeated with assumptions, sarcasm and what YOU believe to be insults. All of this MERELY because I outlined the logical precautions of ‚Äúopinion-based journalism‚Äù and how it can divide one‚Äôs audience. 
I‚Äôd hate to see that happen because I LOVE Inform Overload (which is probably about the only thing we have in common üòú).
