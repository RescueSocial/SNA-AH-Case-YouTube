The friend then called 911.  When police and a domestic violence expert arrived, they checked Amber, and found absolutely no signs of any physical abuse on her.  Amber had also told the friend that Johnny had trashed their penthouse, and broken several bottles of red wine.  She said that there was broken glass and red wine spilled all over the carpet of their penthouse and out in the hallway.  The statements by the policeman and domestic violence expert can be found online.  Body cam footage taken by a second team of police officers to respond that night show that there was no signs of broken glass or spilled wine anywhere in the hallway, or in Johnny and Amber’s penthouse.  The body cam footage is on YouTube.",2021-08-01T02:13:51Z,0

   It's scary cause if you think what if a person is like this, who could i really be marrying here? But ofcourse most people just dont think that way, they simply go with it, follow their heart all that.

My 2 experiences 15yrs apart were also both made more difficult by the fact both men were prominent in their communities, while I was an outsider, similar to this situation here. I got my restraining order on him, had to move, then became a recluse.

13,Ugz4OZe9G6uV1Gkwc7B4AaABAg,lulu in hollywood,"I am not commenting on whether she or he is lying, only your comments that victims of abuse always act a certain way. Below is a couple things I wrote on another comment, there’s no way to encapsulate & explain for people who don’t wish to understand, but there’s plenty of instances where they don’t act like u think they should. Some abusers specifically are drawn to strong women, fiery personalities who don’t take crap & stand up for themselves, but are also fiercely loyal caregivers. You start out normal, then have these wild breaks in reality but keep her from leaving.. once you’re in love it’s almost too late. Especially if you’re married and he has an addiction that may leave her afraid to leave, afraid to stay, was the case for me. If you’ve ever lived with someone who lies like this (think Donald trump level lying) My abuser was acting crazy for hours would kick me across the room. The next time he came at me I pushed him back not even hard to get him away from me but because he was out of his mind black out drunk, he wildly stumbled back fell over the side of the bed and dove headfirst hitting and breaking his nose against the nightstand. It was comical in its exaggeration. Of course I was immediately by his side- I barely pushed him off me, I didn’t want him hurt, the damn fight started bc he was hurting himself!. Half a second later he was on top of me thrown me on the bed screaming how I was trying to kill him with his hands around my throat. He still shows people that scar to prove I was abusing him (of course I’m his angel that saved his life.. until I accuse him of something he DID). A couple tiny nail marks on his wrists because he was grabbing me by the hair and wouldn’t let go? He would exaggerate EXACTLY like she described he does. You all should be ashamed of yourself the way you send hate & vitriol when u do not know the truth. Psycho to take your admiration of a public figure this far. 

I have lived opposite an abuser, and I have worked with victims of abuse as well as their abusers. I have no dog in this fight, I am clear I do not have enough personal knowledge at this time. But trauma takes all forms. Especially when that person may have had other traumas earlier in their life (many victims of certain childhood abuse can go into a cold detached state under extreme stress or emotional distress... Many people act wildly different than you would expect… Even YOU are likely to surprise yourself as to your reactions in any given situation that is highly stressful or traumatic- even if you’ve been through something like it before.. 

For me, there were times I was in situations that were so big of a mindfuck… This man was bat shit crazy and doing the most insane things (how did I get here??), but surrounded by people who worshipped him and therefore they only saw what he wanted them to see (really most of them had been trained to look the other way & lie for him for decades). I am a woman who stands up for herself ironically, and even I fell into this trap for far too long. I got sucked into something so toxic that I stayed and fought back rather than leave. In part because whenever I tried to leave he would stop me and not allow me to, in part because I knew any given second of any given day he was knocking on deaths door and my leaving could alter the course of an entire family that I loved. Armchair critics like to pretend they know everything. Maybe she is a psycho, but I’ve seen enough of Depp to see TEXTBOOK malignant/covert narcissist traits that especially come out on drug benders. Was I an abuser bc my ex had occasional small nail marks? Well.. he’d just kicked me across the room & then grabbed me & wouldn’t let go. Yes I sunk my nails in. Or what about the time I slapped him? After months of insanity followed by sane moments, after everything he told me to do to “wake him up when he gets like that” that he promised would work didn’t work.. I confessed I wanted to just slap him shake him awake. He told me even though that would NEVER happen again, I should’ve slapped him. Finally after hours of psychosis in the middle of Ecuador, I did that. He responded by choking my esophagus &slamming me to the hard ground hitting thick tumbler glasses with my head which shattered against my head on the soft bed behind me lol. I have brain injury which he knows, which means further head injuries are especially bad for me. I almost lost consciousness. But then before I knew it-  I was up, screaming at him about what just happened (not what I would’ve expected myself to do).. Not running away, not cowering in the corner sobbing. But I was not free to leave, I was worried & actually both in danger for my life & his. I was covered in bruises 100% of the time when we were together. I started recording as a means to listen back & make sense bc your sense of reality gets so skewed & everything is such crazy chaos- I also recorded in hopes of showing him what was happening. But if parts of those recordings got used out of context, & he had more $$ And fans than I do, some would choose to believe whatever they want. Having said all this, I haven’t listened to this audio yet & make no correlations to her behavior with mine. Another thing though is ppl don’t account for how much reality can be different from audio. Crazy eyes violent behavior, what just was said or done BEFORE the recording starts... just all the ways Gaslighting by highly skilled and/or sick people can change perception entirely. 

Lastly, I will point out that false accusations of this kind are statistically dwarfed by legitimate ones. And the abuser’s handbook is ALWAYS to accuse the accuser, whenever possible. I once got a restraining order on a stalker. It was so screwed up I had to be responsible for serving the papers & until they are served they’re not in effect! I made one friendly phone call to his assistant casually asking his whereabouts (bc if he got tipped off & not served, I knew he would be coming for me). I didn’t indicate anything to her however, I was genuinely afraid of tripping this guy’s crazy wire further. I showed up in court & he was counter suing me. Had affidavits of his employees saying I called & harassed. Had his landscaper say I was by his house., none of which was true.  I wasn’t even served, but he had someone say they served me! The judge DIDNT CARE. It was an obvious boy’s club, he didn’t even let me speak at the court hearing initiated by me! HIS lawyer spoke, judge made decisions, I kept getting scolded for interrupting- I would get my chance.. which never came. Just being in the same building as this man was such a trauma in my body (I have ptsd).. On the outside I was mostly robotic or I wouldn’t have been able to function. Had I had to go back to court multiple times, & this kind of stuff was happening AS WELL AS PUBLICLY.. I have no idea how I would’ve behaved. And neither does anyone else. 
(That last part was in response to previous comments about her behavior at a deposition.. she was an “obvious” sociopath bc she was eating during & not sobbing & small while answering questions. The judgement is just sick)",2020-11-27T01:13:20Z,2

16,UgzNprXl_iiB_UuR8Ut4AaABAg,Stephen Creevy,"@lulu in hollywood I've listened to all the tapes, all documents over 200 pages. Seen the footage and the facts we do know. Fact: her lawyers intimidated witnesses requesting they change their statements. Fact: The LA police who responded to her call said she was unharmed and in completely fine condition. Fact: even her own make up artist said she has no marks. Fact: Amber was arrested in 2009 for domestic violence, Depp doesn't have a history of violence. Fact: all of depps ex wife's have come out to support him, saying there was no violence in the 14 and 4 years they were with him respectively. Fact: Amber was having financial difficulty, she asked Depp for 50k a month, he said no. He also had evidence she was sleeping with other women. The infidelity alone would have hurt her claim for divorce settlement. If she claimed abuse, she could still get the money. Dude, she has admitted to her abuse on Multiple tapes, she's seen starting these fights in 87 different videos. She forged documents that's been proven. The nurse in Australia phoned her family and said amber's gone crazy, starting fights and throwing bottles. The security guard said she always starts the fights. Their neighbour said she was unharmed the night she calmed he hit her. One of her own witnesses turned against her and her own sister is on tape being asked why she lets amber best her up all the time. She has motive and the evidence is against her. So I didn't ""choose"" to believe her. Choice was taken out of it. I simply cannot believe her. If it wasnt like this, I'd be on her side.

Johnny sounds like him. And Amber sounds like somebody who’s caught up in a toxic relationship but so incensed at his bullshit she’s talking to him like this.
