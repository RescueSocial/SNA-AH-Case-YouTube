Some you may not. 
The court dropped a LOT into the public sphere, HOURS of it, so I'm working on cleaning it up, amplifying it, and hopefully documenting the entirety. I'll add it in videos and also into a playlist to help people find ALL the evidence attached to the trial. 

In the video I also said two hours, but that wasn't correct for ALL of it. Its two hours on this specific set of recordings. There's more, and I'm looking at potentially converting it all here so its all compiled and easily found.  The reason  is because the media gave you SNIPPETS. They took TINY pieces and THEY CALLED THAT COMPLETE. They left out the ""pots and pans."" They left out ""the abuse."" They left out the the lies. The manipulation. And a lot more. 

ALL OF THIS also belongs to two trials, and will not only be in the Depp/Sun trial, but also in the Depp/Heard 2021 trial. 
PLUS Heard mentioned another 50/51 audio tapes that the court hasn't seen. So there's a LOT MORE I'm assuming we haven't seen.
 There's also all the testimony that isn't carried over into videos. The AH declarations, all 7 of them. The Depp ones, all three of them. and on and on.I'm not sure how much of that I can put into these since they're SO LONG, but we'll see.",ThatUmbrellaGuy,294,2020-09-17T14:39:49Z

And when he says 'enough', and tells her to leave she doses him up with Xanex and gaslights him.
At this point I think if there was video of him beating her with a metal bar, I would STILL be on his side.

See I was married for 15 years and he was very emotionally physically and mentally abusive and it was horribly abusive. So once I finally seen it and I got the hell out of there I can understand and sympathize with Johnny. And to hear her repetitively over and over on certain words but the sentences are always changing, that‚Äôs gaslighting at its best. The manipulation is epic and then when she tries to cram all the words together you can catch certain things that she says. How she twist it. It goes from ‚Äú you never fight for me, you never come to me, you never extend the olive branch, you just split, you just jet, you just bail‚Ä¶ And then it goes you used to let me fight, we used to fight well argue I can‚Äôt figure out what has changed? I can tell you what changed... nothing! He is very calm, relaxed and listening to her. So it makes it harder for her to try to pull it over on him. And when he it‚Äôs not sure if something he‚Äôll question it, she does not like that. My heart  really really hurts for him, I can understand all of his feelings that he was feeling the pain after constantly questioning yourself why what did I do wrong why is this happening to me etc. etc. Oh Johnny is one of the most beautiful creatures actually he is the most beautiful creature to ever walk this planet. I would give anything just to be in his presence, to even have my dream come true of him taking a picture with me saying hi to me anything and I would just give him the biggest hug you could ever give somebody because he definitely deserves that and more he deserves the galaxy.

JD is AH's coping mechanism and paradoxically  her ""high"". She feels power when she is blowing up and probably cannot last more than a few weeks without a major melt down. He has gotten into the trap of being the one to peel her off the ceiling. This is a dangerous place to be as a man. As soon as you pull back and set limits and boundaries on behavior you are willing to deal with that will drive the one with (anger mgmt issues) over the edge.  If someone is leaving it is an act of self preservation.  Many times the only way to deal with a hostile situation is to safely leave the location and it sounds like JD was doing just that.

157,UgwBQM6cpv8c6nIuIyt4AaABAg,"It is just so bizarre to me how she is begging for fights like they used to have. Most people want to not fight or say what he's saying about talking in place of fighting. This whole dynamic does not paint her as a victim at all. She definitely seems like the aggressor and uses so many known manipulation tactics (especially refusing to send whatever tapes he wants so he has to take her word on what happened). She ignores his valid questions. And I just can't think of a victim begging her abuser to fight like they used to. Also I don't think that abusers are generally the ones to try and leave the fight like she's so mad at him for doing. I also think that its responsible of him to be leaving when he feels like he might get provoked into reacting with violence. I think that's a very valid reason to walk away from an argument and to have the clarity to realize that he's getting to that point instead of just getting swept up in the heat of the moment really counters her drugged up and out of it portrait she's trying to paint of him. I just feel so bad for him, he sounds so defeated and I hate how hard he is having to fight to undo the label of abuser that she slapped on him and to some people thats how they will always see him now.",TangerinePuppet5040,0,2021-01-11T09:45:15Z

If a person is terrified for her life why is she upset when he leaves? If shes so scared she should be happy he ""splits"" she says she is bothered when he leaves. If Australia was so traumatic why did she say it was wonderful. She says she always jumps straight to the finish line cos he leaves so that sounds to me she attacks him before he gets chance to leave. These tapes are a psychiatrists wet dream
The only thing she says that I actually agree with her is that he does the right thing, the admirable thing by leaving, its probably the only honest thing that's ever left her lips and she even said that mockingly.
He was a career boost, a cash cow, a punching bag to her and that's all.

When he brings up her DV (and often his attempts to stay away from it) she calls him degrading names and minces words.  She says she fought for their marriage, but if this is how she did it, clearly she was only discussing physical violence.  She clearly doesn't know what it's like to fight for a marriage, doesn't understand how to communicate, nor how to be honest with her significant other and least of all herself.  The gaslighting in this conversation is pretty amazing, even from this B-list actor.  Additionally, even when he says to her ""don't insult me like that"" when she tries to put him down, he still stays calm and says ""please"" at the end of the request/statement.  Also her response to his pointing out her lying to someone (Travis?) is rather telling and she fights pretty darn hard to avoid having that person come back to resolve the situation.  Yet she doesn't outright deny that she lied to this person everytime he says, ""I watched you lie"" to him and then she changed the topic at every possible chance until she is able to do it.",Got2Bespoke,0,2020-10-10T05:37:39Z

 And everybody knows that Johnny Depp has an addiction to drugs and alcohol. I am sure during the 14 years he was with Vanessa Paradis that he even had issues.

If he was a violent drunk that would‚Äôve shown up numerous times. But clearly, IMO, She also had some serious problems as well. The only difference is when she ties one on she becomes an angry drunk. If you listen to the tapes from Australia she is so whacked and delusional. 
And if you notice in the tape he is unbelievable calm but she gives him a Xanax. If someone has an alcohol and drug problem why would you give them another pill.

Have you noticed he says sorry for not remembering certain times, have you heard her if you want to be married to me, and she actually says she stays annoyed most nights, after fights, he stays locked in the bathroom cos he's frightened. How can she blame him for flights, and it is hard to sort your head out and not let go cos he's hurt, you can't blame, blame is one person arguing and furloughing stuff hurting the person. Like he said she's lost her marbles never a true word said. Poor man living with that, he most of wondered what happened when she started to show the true colours. But you can't live with someone who beats you up. She sounds like the exocist think someone needs to look for the 666 on her head",Jenifer Barns,0,2020-09-27T09:04:01Z

He just said he'd rather walk away as he doesn't want to hit out, there we have it, she's a nasty person whose violent. He so deserve better, and so much more, he's an intelligent person, she however isn't that bright, and he's a bully, and extremely foul mouthed, and is trying very hard to make him out to be and idiot.

I've listened to this twice.. once before trial and once just now. Context makes this so much sadder. Testimony from unbiased witnesses and Heards conflicting stories conflict against what she says in this very video! I hope they type it out. I tried to list the bullshit highlights below.

What I got from the recording this time is that she got married to him purposefully for ""security"" and tried REALLY HARD to get Depp to flip out physically on her so she could blackmail him for the rest of his life and fortune (the nuptual then post nuptial agreements and Will that they were fighting about for before and after the wedding). Being a sane ADULT he didnt bite. He loved her. And to protect himself and her, he left when shit got crazy. She wasn't getting what she wanted (BLACKMAIL MATERIAL) so she threw fits. Epic ones. And gaslighted, manipulated, and controlled anyone and everyone she could, down to the help.

Here are the highlights I wrote down as I listened this time. Thanks for providing this BTW, this exact audio clip posted long ago by you is what got me interested and looking into Johnny Depp and his innocence.

This case and these tapes are going to be put in psychology text books for centuries to behold. 

""I get so mad because you run away every single fight!"" -amber turd

""You sitting here talking to me is the biggest grandest gesture you've shown me in all time"" -Amber after he married her WITHout a Prenuptial agreement because she threw such a fit about it. And giving her an entire Penthouse FLOOR of prime Hollywood real estate.

""That's how it's been for months now, I am the bad guy always fuckin up and you're always on me for being honest with you."" -Amber re: (verbal abuse)

""Why haven't you been coming to me and being the bigger person thanking me for being the bigger person?"" -Amber
""I just did recently! Don't you remember Venice?"" -Johnny
""Im not.. going to call you a liar I.. dont remember.. Listen if we are going to start to argue about that we aren't going to get anywhere let's look at the bigger picture."" -Amberü§îüòë

""I can't blame myself for going straight to the fucking finish line like [I did] yesterday because of how's it's been! When that's where you automatically drive it?"" -Amber

""Australia was so good for so long"" -Amber Heard
But she testified in court that he broke her nose, threw her against the counter choking her, threw her around with glass everywhere that cut her feet and body, punched kicked ripped her clothes off, threw her through glass doors that shattered, and abused her for days in a ""hostage situation"" during which time she had a phone and tablet and security guards all over to reach out to for ""help"" but was ended with HIM LOSING A FINGER.
She testified he missed work. He testified he didn't have work that day. 

""Do you not remember earlier how you were so different you allowed us to fight! We could actually fight!"" -Amber

""You're not allowing me to react!"" (violently) -Abuser I mean Amber

You threw me out of the bed!"" -Johnny
""Why wouldn't I when I thought you were going to slip away?!"" Amber has abandonment issues Heard

""You get on something and you won't get off of it!"" -Says the woman who threw a can of paint thinner right at Depps forehead (which bled) then tracked him down on the premises when he escaped in a car to lie down on a couch in the groundskeeper office, then summarily continued to yell at him and blocked his car while he screamed leave him alone, and in return screamed horrendous insults at him, slapped him repeatedly when he tried to leave her presence, then trashed the house with her art supplies when he did get away from her thanks to the help of Body Guards. 
All while on holiday with HIS KIDS. 
WHO HAD TO WITNESS THE AFTERMATH! (Supplies and property destruction everywhere).. ON CHRISTMAS!! üòùüòïüò´

""Keep being an asshole"" -Amber when he asks legitimate question 

""Stop defending yourself"" --says the most epic gas lighter outed this century

""Travis to the Rescue!"" --when Depp asks someone to come verify she hit him by confronting her to the face with a witness there. And she lies.

""What's your excuse for running away when there ISN'T a physical fight?"" üòÇ
-Amber 
who then *hands Significant Other Xanax unprompted

[In a nutshell]
I can't say insulting shit to you or hit you and i can't trust you not to run away when I get violent! -Amber

""What you do is in the morning is say I'm sorry."" -Johnny
""No I do it in the evening too! On the plane I came to you, and Venice, in Toronto, and San Francisco..the 7 different bathrooms [he hid from her in].."" 
-Amber

""On the plane in Rio you were losing your marbles."" -Johnny 
""Think about it. You hold onto everything I say during fights!"" -Amber
""No that shit's hard to forget."" -Johnny
""I did not say 100 percent of the time that I am perfect. You know what I'm saying is true."" -Amber
Argument didn't flying so..
""I understand how shitty (last nights physical fight) that got and my part in it."" -Amber

""I've seen you control yourself more. You get so fucking edgy and you get so mad and stay mad! I've seen you clearer than this, better than this. I'm not changing and you aren't and if you choose to stop it, I can't set myself up to be separated from you."" -Amber psycho Heard

""Why can't we have normal arguments?"" --Amber heard

""In Australia you were hallucinating on medication. Do I not give you your meds every day?"" --Amber heard (I'm not joking, listen to that shit)

[Recap] All he could think of her being good to him is her giving him his meds every day, taking off his boots after work, annnnddd giving him vitamin water. Making him feel. Changed his life. But he doesn't want to be a shithead in Amber's eyes. This is just sad, I feel so sad that Johnny hasn't felt cared for so far in his life more than this. She's obviously decimated his self worth. But he fought back, good on him.

""I left last night because I couldn't take the idea of more physical abuse /upon each other/. We are a crime scene waiting to happen."" -Johnny
""I know"" -Amber

""We have got to get our shit together as individuals and as a couple. I don't want you out of my life, I want peace. If I'm the culprit every time I'll do anything I can to change. But please do the same."" -Johnny
""But you forget your priorities when you're mad! -Amber
""I could say the same about you, Angel!"" -Johnny

""I've got less time on this life than you I'm not going to spend it making someone's life hell, fucking up yours--and I don't want you to fuck up mine!"" 
-Johnny


-------
Depp should talk to the husband of Dalia Dippolito. That crazy b was in jail charged with attempted murder case closed--and she sounds JUST LIKE Amber here. ""What about all that stuff I do for you after I abuse you?!"" 
Dalia Dippolito literally brought up how she ""took care of her new husband"" when he was sick from poisoned Starbucks that she was hand feeding him!!! Unfortunately for her he didn't die.

What I want to know is.. is will she get special treatment in her jail time because she has a ""Muskie"" baby stashed away somewhere in a cold freezer (or her belly)?",Mel F,3,2020-09-21T10:58:17Z

Imagine this crazy B talking to him like this if what she says happened in court truly happened. She says he rips her gown off and throws her through glass windows, chokes her, punches kicks and hits her till she's red and blue (but no pics or proof oops), grabbed her by the hair and punched by a cast, then I would say she is the bravest bitch I've ever known. 

She seriously needs to stop taking hallucinogens. 


Anywhoo I've seen and heard enough, she's a gas lighting crazy bitch slut bag and I don't really give a shit if she got ""pushed"" or ""called names"" ---because that's ALL that fucking happened to her.

I think the love bombing behaviour is just because she‚Äôs scared he‚Äôs going to leave her (leave her without a payout) and she‚Äôs trying to keep him there. She acts like a child. They both said it more or less in the middle of this tape that she will say something and try and provoke him and he walks away at the first sign of an argument.There‚Äôs no evidence here of any physical abuse from him or any fear of physical abuse from her.

She might feel left and ignored by him in the relationship, he is not a saint of a man, so that might be the case but she is so manic in her rants. Leaves no space for him to respond, demeans him and admits to being physical. She has anger issue and like JD said in the tape she jumps at his throat when they fought. Amber though is so exhausting and toxic and still he refuses to hit her yet she gets so mad....she hits him. She is abusive and gaslights him constantly. She could have left him if she is unhappy in how he deals with him splitting during fights.

617,UgwTspK_99WS2Lc94b54AaABAg,"I know she's wrong for many things, but I can understand some of the things she's saying regarding their relationship. Everyone who is commenting saying ""Lol wtf is this bullshit Heard is saying"" is a complete idiot. It sounds to me like a proper concern if she is telling the truth. If he was always running away and never dealing with situations, and also questioning her why she is with him but doesn't totally trust him, then those are totally things he should step up and deal with. Lots of people stay with someone they love even if they don't fully trust them. It's sad but true. And it is true that someone can't always run away and not deal with situations, and be there when it's tough not just when things are good. 

Everyone saying shit like ""Lol omg what a manipulative piece of garbage,"" is an empty-headed buffoon. Don't walk into a situation or pass judgement with bias. You are clearly prejudiced and just jumping on the attack AH bandwagon if you say that everything AH is saying is BS. 

Let me, for the record, say that I believe JD is mostly in the right, and that he should win this court case against Heard, but I'm not going to be deceptive or dishonest and pile on top when there is nothing to pile.

I mean depp doesnt seem like a peach, but he seems normal and emotionally normal, needing normal things.

Like she wants to be able to control and destroy and have depp come back and kiss her feet.

She doesnt actually realize what her actions mean, and she doesnt understand how hitting somone effects another person. She wants to be able to hit somone, fight with them verbally, and not be held to account.

She is toxic. The relationship was toxic.
She definitely wasn't the woman for him. They are too different. She needs someone who she can fight with like crazy, and afterwards just make up and act like everything is ok. I don't know what type of environment she was raised in order for her to be like this and I honestly kinda feel sorry for her. But that doesn't mean she can do this to him! She needs therapy and he needs someone who can give him peace, tranquility. That's why he walked away whenever there was conflict. And she was holding this against him! Unbelievable! That's just his character. He avoids conflict. You can't accuse someone of being true to himself like it's some crime or something. They were so wrong for each other.
Also, all this talk about him not fighting for her enough? What is she? Like the jewel of the Orient or something? She is the one who should have fought for him!

With her boyfriend of the month who called my beautiful niece stupid, and worthless, up till the night he threw her into a wall, and still the courts would not take the kids from her.  We got a restraining order against the guy who hurt my niece, and her mother would yell at her, telling her it was my niece's fault that her satanic spawn of a mother couldn't see her boyfriend every night.  I took my brother to the hospital when she hit him in the face with a pan, almost breaking his nose, and taking the kids.  I got hem to the hospital and called the police.  My brother never lifted a hand against his worthless waste of space of a wife.   That is what this bitch makes me think of.  After years my brother took my advice.  My advice; I will cash out my 401k, it's a gift.  Offer her $10k for full custody.  If you need more offer more.  I won't say what the kids were worth, but she took the money.  She put those kids through nine kinds of hell.

AH is one of those relentless bitches who just screeches and claws ans sucks the life out of you, and sucks all the air of the room.  What role is she playing on this tape?  
Can you imagine being her make up person? Can you just picture doing her hair and makeup?  Her wardrobe?  Can you IMAGINE making her non-fat skim triple machiato iced latte, not exactly right?

When I was married, during the entirety of my marriage, I was always wrong.  He never made a mistake.  God help me if I said something the wrong way, didn't use the words he wanted, or if I watched tv and knitted, instead of being focused 100% on him I wasn't being a good wife.  Narcissists should come with a brand on their forehead.  Sociopath. Warning, your soul will be sucked dry.  Run.  I only started following this about a month ago. I can't believe she cost him his pirate movies.  I mean, I didn't watch them, but he seemed to enjoy it.  Boy listening to this reminds me of my marriage.  You cannot ever win an argument with a narcissist, and the sociopath in them will make you pay for trying.

821,Ugz0Zl2uQLFNc79tcsh4AaABAg,"You know this a lot seems parallel in many ways to my husband and my relationship although less the violence lol. My husband Is a good man, he hates arguing at all, especially coming a dad he saw abuse his mom, was doing drugs, drinking etc unhealthy relationship, so he avoids conflicts

I however am use to conflicts, watching my dad hit my mom, being in abusive relationships before and being what I‚Äôll call more a yelling family when anyone was upset. 

Although I thought I have always been a decent human being who has given so much to others, do me wrong and my feisty side will come out when needed... and arguing to work something out when your mad seemed normal in my life u til I met my husband of 5 years. I‚Äôm 51 he‚Äôs 30, and tbh it‚Äôs rare I say my husband makes and has made me become a better person, here‚Äôs why,

Exactly like Amber is saying I can absolutely relate to her and Johnnys relationship like I‚Äôm sure many of us can.  My husband pretty much does the exact same thing as Johnny, avoids, ignores, goes quit, hates fighting at all costs, this could lead to hours of me going to the room mad, angry, upset because he‚Äôs hurting my feelings by never rarely extending the olive branch so it  seems and the longer it takes him to come see me if he does, it‚Äôs fuelled the fire with more hurt and pain because he‚Äôs not doing it the way I feel he should.  

Let‚Äôs say for example, I say to my husband, why is it when I come home you can‚Äôt manage to get off the computer to give me some time first? I thought you said I was more important then the computer? Remember when you said that 5 years ago, well I didn‚Äôt forget it. My husband will look at me and go love you Narnah, you know that‚Äôs not true and then turns back to the computer Lolol.  So now a bit of resentment builds in my head and I start getting snappy, my husband talks back in the same tone I just used. I am like, Don‚Äôt snap at me, I‚Äôm telling you it hurts my feelings.. his answer will be well you snapped at me first! I‚Äôm like can you just understand being softer makes a huge difference then snapping back at me even if how i said it is wrong. You can see it on his face this look of confusion, then I get even more upset because not only did he ignore my original gripe but now he just gave me attitude to my attitude. The argument started off as nothing much then can grow into a mountain to the point I have to leave the room because I‚Äôm so sad, angry mad and sometimes words not so pretty leave my mouth.  Where as he has never called me a name or tried to bring me down ever,

With my husband now I always feel like he makes it seem like everything my fault, we rarely argue btw but when we do it‚Äôs always me that gets upset never him even though I feel justified to be upset it‚Äôs the way I go about it sometimes. I do understand Ambers frustrations because it‚Äôs 2 different personalities that deal differently with conflict. But this is where she is wrong and needs to self reflect like I have had to do... 

Arguing causing nothing but hurt, pain, resentment, talking, discussing causes a more rational, loving caring feeling where things can be resolved way sooner then creating arguments. 
My husband has taught me by my own self reflection that it‚Äôs not that he doesn‚Äôt care, or stand up for me or only deals with things when it‚Äôs good , like Amber feels, and I use to think the same, my husband doesn‚Äôt want to argue because it‚Äôs pointless, he avoids talking to me because he thinks he‚Äôll make it worse so he will play on his computer for hours or sit there not coming to see me because I‚Äôve left him with the impression that I‚Äôll probably just get more upset and yell and he doesn‚Äôt know how to deal with it in that manner so best just to avoid and go silent, then women ofc will take this as not caring or standing up etc... 

My husband has made me r√©alis√© by how he deals with things is that I‚Äôm the one in the wrong, he‚Äôs maturely dealing with it a better way then me.

Amber I‚Äôm sure has validity to some things, but it‚Äôs her own actions and reactions that are the cause, it‚Äôs not Johnny. Amber is in the wrong just like I was doing... she‚Äôs trying to get Johnny to argue when he doesn‚Äôt want too, she‚Äôs trying to get Johnny to do things her way and think like she thinks it should be resolved then blaming him when he resists her way of dealing with things, because it didn‚Äôt go her way... she is the one at fault here for trying to turn a more calmer personality into a argumentative one.. then claiming he‚Äôs not there..  Amber you need to self reflect and adjust your way of thinking before you can be that better person... we are suppose to love our other halves and be kind, loving etc, not trying to create battles hurt and pain. Time to mature up and realize it‚Äôs not him, it‚Äôs you. 

However because you have proven to be a narc and a liar and deceptive etc, that‚Äôs where you and I differ,  my heart is always in the right place, I try always to be honest and truly help others. I know your not the most evilest person, but instead I feel sorry for you because you‚Äôll always go down a Rocky path in life until you find your true inner self, because a person who truly loves them self does not need to hurt others or use people as you do.. That‚Äôs just an insecure person deflecting on others  because their not happy with who they are. 

Johnny deserves a lot better and you should set higher standards for yourself ...",Sunny Justice,5,2020-09-18T07:39:08Z

907,UgzYuCQy99As2P7qU-R4AaABAg,"Funny how she keeps saying I don't want to talk about Toronto, but she keeps bringing it up, and how she wants Johnny to come to her first, support her be there for her ""throw in the olive branch"", but she's the one who starts all the fights. Why should he throw in the olive branch when he didn't start it. Johnny is being the bigger person by walking away and staying away from her when she starts a fight starts because he knows that nothing gets solved when both are angry. You hear her say why don't you come to me and say sorry I don't want to go to bed mad. I think she pushes his buttons then wants him to come to her say sorry for something she started. She must love that makeup sex, or grudge sex. She constantly repeats herself about how he never comes to her and says sorry. I truly believe most of the shit she wants other than his money all lead to that angry makeup sex. (keyword MOST)

Seems that she goes from 0 to 60 in no time. She never lets him explain or like he said get a word in when she's flying off the handle. So he walks away before he loses his self-control. Not to mention. but I've never heard her say that he hit her or beat her THEN hearing him apologize. so he pushed her probably to get her off him or to defend himself. BUT you hear him say how she goes off on him and hits him throws pots and pans at him then you hear her say sorry, or I don't want to talk about it. 

She wants him to come to say sorry for something he never started. She wants him to say sorry to her so she for something he didn't start. Why say sorry for something you not at fault for? It's like you in your car sitting at a red light. Someone rear-ends you and you get out of your car and say ""I'm sorry"" I didn't mean for you to rear-end me. Listen to him and he says how she gets physical with him, insults him, lies to him.

She wants to turn him into a submissive pussy for shit that she starts, and he's not having nothing to do with it. You can hear how she starts off really quiet then listen to her get so upset around 33:10 she starts off very calm then boom blows up. it's like she's fighting with herself. She talks about mood swings when she's the one who talks calm then upset then calm then flys off the handle then calm. SHE'S the one who's having these mood swings. 

Just listening to Johnny talk so calmly I swear almost puts me to sleep, but listening to her holy fuck, I feel like I want to throttle someone in the throat or start a mosh pit. Can you imagine Johnny in an Exidous concert in a mosh pit? He would say ""ouuuuch (exactly how ET said it, remember that movie back in the early '80s) that hurt"" and instantly Exidous would morph into Zamfir all of them blowing into a Pan Flute, and everyone would be wearing I love Yanni t-shirts, the mosh pit of sweaty long hair and skinheads, POOF are now a circle of dudes skipping while holding hands tightly singing Kumba Ya, all this just by his voice alone.

936,UgxRlWLczJS-Ap908V94AaABAg,"4:55secs - Amber heard flips out revealing showcase who REALLY starts the argument because she cannot defend the Toronto incident.

0 - 10:00secs - Amber complaining about Johnny always running from a fight.... ... .. .  as he runs to the next room only when she starts fighting and beating him up.   She implied he always leaves the house which kills the relationship...  Johnny only left the house twice but she tries to confuse him by stating that leaving the room IS leaving the house. What??

11:30secs - Amber making up stories that don't exist and refuses to explain and backup when Johnny put her on the spot.  Also, Amber starts projecting - She implied that Johnny married her for security and foundation... JOHN IS A MILLIONAIRE, he doesn't need security from her other than for her to be his wife. She couldn't answer and bailed/diverted and tried to flip everything back on him anytime he puts her on the spot with a question. 

14:30secs - Amber confessed about herself losing control of her emotions and taking everything out on johnny both physically and mentally. She then passes off trying to say that everyone does this as human beings.  No. Amber. You and specifics do this, not everyone. 

14:50secs - Amber admits that she has no faith in herself on controlling her violence.

15:30secs - Amber confessed that she becomes insecure about the marriage every time Johnny walks out. I wonder why, Amber.  

22:00secs - Talks about Johnny giving attitude but then gave him massive attitudes instead and continuously. Double-standards much, Amber? She then continuous gaslight him to epic proportions.

25:00 - 30:00secs - Queen of Gaslighting. Admit she attacks him with violence nearly every time she argues against him. Admits to throwing objects. Admits to hitting him on the face. Admit she has no idea if she used a closed fist or not but ignore the idea that johnny knew that she punched him in the face. Admits to mentally manipulating him. Super hardcore projecting her ideas onto him. Completely ignores how Johnny wants to save the marriage but is unwilling to accept she is at fault. She doesn't care about Johnny's love for her as she ignored it like it was nothing. Demonstrated hardcore double standards continuously. Constantly running away from discussions that prove her at fault by flipping everything back on Johnny just to escape.  

31:00 - 35:00secs - Amber refuses to understand how her fights and violence pushes Johnny away from her. She doesn't understand her narcissistic behaviour caused their marriage to fail.

35:00secs - Amber demonstrate hardcore paranoia.

37:00secs - Amber highlighted how she is completely unaware of the way she speaks.

43:00secs - Amber expects Johnny to INSTANTLY calm down and have a discussion with her AFTER she attacks him... like a robot.  That's irrational, unrealistic, ignorant, inconsiderate and a MAJOR problem! ""Time"" is very important and allowing time for a person to calm down is essential so a rational discussion can be done, otherwise, the fight will reoccur and become worse. Amber confirms that she DOES say sorry, however, she always causes the fight to happen again thus causing the couple to go through the same circle of ridiculous toxic process.  Johnny has been trying to tell her that he is fed up of this and want Amber to stop causing the fights in the first place, but she refuses to accept fault.

47:00secs - 50:00secs - Amber stays quiet every time Johnny mentions the plane incident and instead of trying to understand his point, she dismisses it and enforce her.

51:00secs - Johnny admits that he doesn't stand his ground strongly enough against Amber. HOWEVER, if he does then the physical violence that includes the throwing of objects will intensify. 

56:00secs - Extremely dangerous and abusive. Amber admitted to taking and controlling Johnny's medication. She pushes him so much, she believes the medication doesn't work. She is horribly counterproductive and abusive. Heck, if anyone was in the same situation, they would become an alcoholic and be close to taking too much medication too! She is dangerous.

58:00secs - 01:02:00secs - Johnny perfectly laid out all the problems in the relationship, how much he loved Amber, what he wants from their relationship, what he will do to try to improve it, and what he wants from Amber to improve it too. 

01:02:00 - 01:06:00secs - Amber tries to say that Johnny loses control when she attacks him. Johnny came up with a ""Self Improvement"" solution by typing up a list of their issues for them to study and try to fix each other.  Amber bypass the list idea as she refuses to understand how it will benefit the relationship. She refused to be productive in any shape or form, and she refuses to see the ""point"" of the list idea which is there to help improve the relationship.


AMBER HEARD is a narcissist, manipulative, vindictive, a psycho, highly unrealistic, inconsiderate, have extreme double standards, incredibly paranoia, lazy, a projectionist, incredibly highly sensitive, believes she is never at fault, believes that if she strikes something it won't cause damage, and so much more. She is extreme, the type of person that can actually kill another person and pass it off as ""they caused it"" while sipping red wine. She never listened to Johnny, she just goes round and round in circles offering zero productivity.  Listening to all of this made me stressed out so I can imagine how Johnny felt who is the 1st party. When you listen to the first half of this conversation, you'll think that Amber is just a typical psycho ex-gf, but when you listen to all of it you'll realise that she is everything in the above plus more.",EAprima,61,2020-09-18T03:19:56Z

She called him a coward . She talks about fights and mood swings , in fact reflecting her mental health state onto him , her own insecurities manifesting into an actual reason to hit him ..She never hides the fact she hits him , or throws things at him , she doesn't see it as an ATTACK , she goes to great lengths explaining her reasons as to why  she did the assaults , SHE GAVE REASONS .. All ABUSERS have a myriad of reasons as to why you made them do it .. This is one frightening tape , the abused trying to stay calm and negotiate , the ABUSER talking quickly , sadly , angrily ,soothingly , in assertion , in anger all in one talking session ... I've just got the shakes writing about this ...She is not very well , but NO EXCUSE for BATTERY of another Human being FEMALE or MALE ABUSE is GENDERLESS .... And NO WAY DO I WANT  AS an ex-Terrified , Battered , Insulted , Sexually Assaulted , Belittled and Scared Human  ever want Amber Heard  EVER  to be a representative OF MINE or ALL THOSE LIKE ME . She is the ABUSER , I watched her telling her story , when the Police interviewed me I just MELTED and SANK and couldn't explain coherently  never mind sit and do a press conference  to relive and relay everything . All I wanted to know was , "" Are my Children safe"" ??????...."" Am I safe"" ????... And this is Amber Heard  an ABUSER ... Us actual ABUSED saw her behaviour as abusive , no reason or rhyme other than getting to her chosen goal at any given time . Johnny Depp is enabling her in this tape by cajoling and comforting her , but actually he is looking for an quiet back door exit without setting Amber of on a tirade .....Thank you UMBERELLA GUY for broadcasting this , highlighting how ABUSE happens .

He could be gone in a week or in 30 years. This is a major red flag, if Johnny stayed with her he could have gotten so depressed he could have committed suicide. Oh Johnny I feel so sorry for how broken and defeated you are by this vile abusive woman.

She constantly admits to being the aggressor and the one that provokes and causes arguments, she admits guilt so many times! How on earth is Johnny Depp an abuser? Its clear who the abuser is here! I hope Johnny wins his lawsuits, if he doesn't then it will prove the massive hypocrisy and double standards.

I find it ironic that when Johnny admits fault at something she calls him out, but when she admits something she tries to shift blame, ignores it, and changes the subject. In her head shes never in the wrong. Even though all the arguments are being caused by her own behavior and she's the one that admits to starting physical fights too. She loses her temper so many times in this audio, she belittles him, gaslights him and Johnny tries to remain calm unless she goes so far as to insult him that he calmly says thats enough!",Rob,2,2020-09-17T21:35:17Z

1227,UgzkDgzw7_PaaLrMD1B4AaABAg,"Interesting in full context.
- Im always the one to throw the olive branch ( because she is the one starting the fight )
- You always split at the top of the fight ( she starts the fight and JD usually locks himself in a room, in the house. Sometimes renting a hotel room next to where they are staying ( not really up and leaving, coming back a week later )
- I am tired of talking about Toronto, I was over Toronto ( Isnt that the one that was talked about behind closed doors, JD asks for the tapes and she said she would send them to him. ( he wouldnt ask for them if he was doing anything wrong )
- I need to feel safe in this relationship, not have a vacation husband ( clear cut case of abandonment issues, perhaps from her dad. Her idea of safe is to be secure and being safe from being alone )

Only a few mins into it and already it clearly demonstrates sofar that JD is a passive personality who would normally give in and let go, but when put in a highly stressful situation, removes himself from the situation in the hopes it will calm down or just simply go away. He is clearly ( in his mind atleast ) innocent of any wrong doing, from instigating the fight to any physical altercation, this is generally against his nature.

It does come out if you listen carefully, when Amber is taking about pocking a animal, he does say something like really, as if he means "" you think your the pocked animal"" ( showing he thinks he is the one thats being pocked )

1434,Ugzew8oWIEX0XUGJW1B4AaABAg,"i feel like she needs a lot of therapy into understanding that she is the problem and that being frustrated, angry, and hurting your partner physically/mentally/emotionally is abusive behavior that most normal people will either disengage from by physically removing themselves from the situation or they numb themselves to take the abuse. it sounds like depp was physically removing himself and only pushed her away to defend himself from her hitting him, but he knew if he ever called the cops during this time she would spin it on him for attacking her(pushing away). its a case of lose lose, no matter which scenario is done depp would still get hurt and amber is trying her best to hurt him as much as possible because his the victim that got away and abusers like her hate it when there victims leave them. the only way the victims are allowed to leave in her mind is when she GIVES them permission to do so, such is the case when she let her ex go after a police officer wasn't going to let it go after catching her in public abusing her partner, I wouldn't be surprised if that is how that victim got away. Amber couldn't afford to be charged with domestic violence as it would give her cover away of being this holier then thou partner. She NEEDS that facade to be wanted, desired, and to feel that she is the pedigree of partners for future victims. narcissists feel that there partners should thank them for them being with them regardless if they are abusing there victims or just seeking glorification, its all about attention and for amber it doesn't matter if its a man or woman she will want to punish you for not stepping into her line to do as she wants it doesn't matter how long it takes or how she does it. She saw an opportunity with the ME Too movement and said to herself she will use this to destroy him. Sadly for her most of her audio proved that she was in fact the abuser, because once a narcissist gets enraged enough they tell the truth out of anger that you are still not lying for them even though as a victim you have no obligations to do so, by depp pushing her over and over again without giving her room to defect it away she was forced to answer to him which cause her to be even more enraged that she ultimately stated ""no one is going to believe you."" that to me is the damning point and she should that been done then, but now im wondering why is this being dragged out? why is it not a cased case for depp? why does he have to go through months of having to prove himself where if it was for any other woman it would be hammer slammed?

Were these audio files taken and published clandestinely by a third party or were they consented by both to be released from a therapist or marriage counselor for example? In my experience with secret audio recordings, they were always recorded for nefarious underhanded purposes, clandestine operations, extortion, false testimony, bribery, mockery and belittlement and for general dishonest motives.

You can hear how Johnny is trying to pick words so he doesn't trigger her into another violent outburst.

Johnny:""You throw pots and pans""
A.H.: ""But thats different""
Every time he even touches on her being violent, she attacks him with aggressive insulting speech.
She's putting him down for calling Travis because she punched him in the face, and kicked him, then lied about it.
A.H. ""i hit you, i did not deck you, I did not punch you, I was just hitting you"" 
And then she goes on to try and belittle him and verbally attack him.
