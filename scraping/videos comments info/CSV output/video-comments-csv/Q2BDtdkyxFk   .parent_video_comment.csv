should be regulated to keep those creepy crawlies out of the country.  Apparently, killer bees are now in 
Texas. ... But dogs, they are like persons, are they not?  Maybe Australia's government is really attempting 
to justify their immigration and detention laws?  Maybe they like the Nazis, believe that the English should 
stay in England, and the Germans in Germany, etc.?  Plants, they stay in one place, but dogs, like persons, tend 
to wander - like travel.  So, what is this ""biosecurity"" concern of theirs, really about?  If not the safety of persons?
  They sure do not wish to shutdown their beaches, though every year over there in Australia, people get eaten 
by sharks, or so it is reported. .... Jesus once told a woman that Jerusalem would no longer be the place where 
people would worship the Father.  See, John 4:21, kjv.  So, how important is it, the place where you find yourself?
  Well, the concept of place is different from the concept of land.  A place, is like a mindset, or attitude.  Where is 
that place?  What do you bring to, or takeaway, from ""a party""?  Is everybody there, found therein? ... Umm, it is
