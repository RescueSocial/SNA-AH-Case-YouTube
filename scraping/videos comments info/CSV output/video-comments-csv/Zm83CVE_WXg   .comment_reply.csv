In other case if Depp was found guilty the sentences could have been way more severe then hers since he is a “man” and the reason media is annihilating her is to show otherwise. I understand what you mean however we are talking about most of Depps inheritance his name and his family name. His more then 30 years of accomplishments.

91,Ugw5T8XghN6_1vRKoTF4AaABAg,Gamemediafan 17,"@Jason Pryde nope. She did not mention specifically the holocaust or  the physical conditions of the Jews. She was referring to the part where the Nazis would indoctrinate people into hating Jews ,mentally and socially. Never brought up any holocaust stuff. If you don't wanna like what a person says it's fine, everyone should have a viewpoint,  but don't lie to make something look worse then it is.

And no offense, but specifically in the social and mental area, her comparisons are absolutely correct. You really haven't noticed that anyone who isn't a liberal extremist (whether conservative, libertarian, or even just a REGULAR liberal) is basically blacklisted, made fun of, and trashed by the Hollywood system? Anybody who basically even HINTS that they don't like people like Joe Biden in Hollywood are called alt right nazis and white supremacists, or Trump supporters, or whatever other desperate name-calling an SJW throws at people who disagree with them. Chris Pratt was basically forced by an interviewer to admit that he was a conservative Christian, and just from that small statement alone people have been trying to cancel him, even though he didn't even say anything! They literally made up photos hopped pictures to make it look like he was a conservative extremist dickhead when that wasn't the case, all because people found out he was conservative. Then you have the hypocrisy of how Pedro Pascal basically painted every single republican as a nazi or confederate, even though both Democrats and Republicans aren't in the black-and-white mentality at all. It just sxreams hypocrisy and intolerance for anyone other then SJW's. That's how Twitter and Facebook works, and Hollywood surprisingly go to those people as their guides for their decisions. Sorry, but in the message, nothing Gina said was inherently WRONG. If she also made a PHYSICAL comparison, with how the Jews were being beaten, raped, and murdered, then more people would be calling her a fucking moron. But that IS NOT WHAT SHE SAID.",2021-02-13T02:15:23Z,3

134,Ugwic8B8vTcKJjHMqr94AaABAg,Tired of it All 👀,"Depp tried to be the bigger man and walked away... He was going to file for divorce, but she went the nect day.. Then she demanded that her and her friends would continue to live rent free in his penthouse and the monthly/yearly fees would be paid by him. Meanwhile they were already living in them while they had been married, but she now claims he kept her hostage... She also demanded he would give her an insane amount of $$ each month for alimony or she'd go forward with abuse claims... They settled for 7mil which she supposedly donated to charity according to her, multiple magazines and her friends. Fast forward to 2021 there was only 1 payment to charity made by Depp in Amber's name for 100,000.00. Only because he was just going to donate the whole 7mil in increments, but she refused and wanted the money instead, that was 2016. Now they're claiming because Depp filed a laweuit in 2019 she wasn't able to pay the whole 7mil even though she said she did.  She also is the one who went to multiple outlets and told her ""abuse"" story and now calls it ""her truth""  and still acts as if she's the victim! It's insane!! She also claims bots are sending her hate and made up the petition claiming  these are deranged Depp fans and bots. Going as far to say Depp must be paying them?!? Depp has never claimed he was an angel, but he never beat her.
Her photos are doctored. She changed the date of these alleged incidents 3 or 4 times because there were pictures proving no abuse occured so she claimed she got the date wrong🤷🏻‍♀️ She will not Stop or Admit she's in the wrong... Sad thing is she still has fans sticking up for her and she still has a job! 🤦🏻‍♀️  I don't believe in cancel culture, but she is EVIL!!",2021-02-12T01:42:12Z,3
