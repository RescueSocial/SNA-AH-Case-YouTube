Although it appears that Bad Women like Amber Turd will drive away Good Men where Good Women won't be able to find them because Bad Women scared them off.

Of course there are also Bad Men who drive away Good Women where Good Men won't be able to find them because Bad Men scared them off.

This kind of irony is all too sad. Because not all Men are the same just like how all Women are not the same, every group have at least some evil among them. Because in this world ""No one is perfect"" everyone needs to learn this but some chose to keep looking for one.

Which is why as a Man I just gave up on seeking out the significant other and just live life where I can be happy with my family because I still have them where I can dedicate my life to.

My point being Johnny is very personable and friendly, but if he is wronged to the point of lawsuit, then he'll fight back to defend himself (legally not physically). That's what everyone seems to forget about most people actually, is that no matter how nice someone appears to be, they ALL have a breaking point and will have to do something to defend themselves.
