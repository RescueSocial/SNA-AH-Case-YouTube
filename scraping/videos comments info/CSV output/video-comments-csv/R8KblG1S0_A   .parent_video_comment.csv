193,UghzQcyXeK_ED3gCoAEC,Me encanto la actuaci√≥n de Jonny Deep es como siempre excelente. Ademas el guion y la fotografia es cuidadosa manejada que junto con el arte que sentir en verdad la √©poca y el ambiente pesado de aquello a√±os de inconformismo social. Aun cuando siempre es estereotipadamente gringa es muy bien recreada. Muy recomendable para ver lo que fueron los 60s. ¬†,Orlando Forero,3,2014-05-22T17:37:06Z
194,Uggo8AW3UQ9zZXgCoAEC,"Johnny Depp knew Hunter S. Thompson. When Hunter shot himself, Depp searched around and found ¬†his old novel rejected multiple times. After seeing the movie, it is no mystery it was rejected way back when. It is like reminiscing about my early 20s. Of course, I might change the title to Tequila Diary, the 487 proof rum would be JP5 jet fuel and Puerto Rico would be either Tijuana, Singapore, or Olongapo City in the Philipines. I have better stories to tell, but not as believeable as the one he tells. When you tell a story and cannot remember why you lived, it is hard to write a book about it.¬†",John Lloyd Scharf,21,2014-02-21T05:33:26Z
