5,UgyrV2yfGW7EgzYjJPN4AaABAg,physco bug the movie geek,@LpsGlamourGirl 298 I'm not on amber or Depp's side but I think maybe he probably said something or did something to piss her off tbh,2020-10-25T19:29:15Z,0
6,UgyrV2yfGW7EgzYjJPN4AaABAg,LpsGlamourGirl 298,"@physco bug the movie geek And Amber has made so many poor decisions though, Iâ€™m sure as a work buddy and even somewhat friendly with his wife Lisa too, the stuff that came out about Amber likely did really hurt them at some level to hear about it they have all the info an open minded bough mind to hear and consider. And despite how much you might like the film, Amber and Jason have lives outside that particular work and there is nothing wrong in Jason doing what made him happy, please  understand he was a fan of Lisa that actually had his dream come true at some point in his life and has children with her.",2020-10-25T14:19:07Z,0
7,UgyrV2yfGW7EgzYjJPN4AaABAg,LpsGlamourGirl 298,"@physco bug the movie geek uh yeah but you have to remember Jason was infatuated with Lisa when he seen her on tv and had dreamt of being with her for the longest, kinda like a positive acting  stalker that actually got the love he longed for. And some guys like not only younger women, but older ones too. Chalk that up to the fact Lisa also got that ughhhh as they say she THICC. If you look hard enough you can see a few photos of her shape in the hips, and maybe youâ€™ll her butt a little bit which I donâ€™t think Jason would have a problem with ðŸ˜‰",2020-10-25T14:08:09Z,1
