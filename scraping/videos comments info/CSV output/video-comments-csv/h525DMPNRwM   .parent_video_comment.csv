2,UgzoAvXDOL1vHIBW6aN4AaABAg,"The interview starts off with an important point about Momoa's casting and racial barriers yet Amber Heard ignores it to focus solely on praising her own character. Even when she brings the topic back to Momoa, it's only in regard to female support and the importance of Mera's role in motivating the character of Arthur. Heard is so self-absorbed in this interview, it actually prevented the direction from going anywhere interesting or useful. Pity.",NikNakShak,1,2021-03-06T01:37:40Z
3,Ugwt175SzQY8FyIWITZ4AaABAg,Some actors pretend to play villains...Ambuser is the villain who pretends to play a hero.  Get rid of the abuser from Aquaman 2. Such a pretend activist with the ribbon on the wrist when actually she's using a movement for her own benefit -it's insulting to real survivors.

8,Ugx2DPZtBh-dHZRzIbl4AaABAg,"She goes on and on about how both her and aquaman are equal in status as superheros, and how she saved him in the movie, and that she wasn't just his sidekick. THE MOVIE IS CALLED !!!AQUAMAN!!! FFS. Not whatever your characters name was. Nobody will remember it. Everyone will just remember the name of Aquamans character cos it is right there on the cover of the dvd",Ruthie Dee,1,2021-02-11T10:00:39Z

I find it disguting that because she is a woman, all she has to do is accuse Johnny, no evidence, no nothing other than accusations, and he gets fired and loses millions of $'s, while all the evidence in the world that she is in fact lying, has no impact whatsoever on her career.
