7,UgyTQ5GKCLcdmCL7YPV4AaABAg,"Anyone else noticed the ""symbolism"" or ""similarities"" between this fight and return of Superman. Look at this way:


-Steppenwolf is about to kill someone with his axe (Mera/Cyborg)
-Somebody stops the axe (Aquaman/Superman)
-The character attacks Steppenwolf, sending him away from them (Aquaman punches him and Superman kick him)
-Then, the character goes straightfoward Steppenwolf, and he attacks him but Aquaman avoid the axe and Superman avoid his hand. 


Definetly, Snyder is such a genius

24,Ugxf5n8H8qFJB_nUaIx4AaABAg,"You guys do understand right? Snyder had his film with the story and Mera's accent. Then it went to shit and Whedon changed a lot. Then Wan had to try to make his film match it instead of the Snyder cut. Whedon changed died in the war to fought in the war. Whedon had Heard redo all her lines w/o the accent. 
Then the Snyder cut comes out. Things are different.

40,UgykjlOC0WImm4uIDlF4AaABAg,"*Some actors play a villain, some villains play an actor.* 
 Amber Heard doesn't deserve superhero title - she is a real-life villain who created false accusations against an innocent man. Justice for Depp

ADDED: I'll include these blog qotes from 2011 when Amber was on the set of Drive Angry before she was dating Johnny. It's by Todd Farmer a writer/actor - it seems legit and he even provides a picture. After reading the blog my take-away is she beat the crap out of pretty much everybody - her role of Piper allowed her to get away with beating others.
*BLOG QUOTE* - Most of this is likely due to the fact that *she beat the crap out of me. She pulled her punches with Christa, but she did not cut the boys any slack.* I snapped a picture at the end of the day. I should have taken a picture the next morning when *the bruise had blossomed the size of grapefruit.* (he provides selfie of red marks on chest)
*BLOG QUOTE* - I remember *Billy Burke* joking that he thought shooting a fight scene with the lovely Amber Heard would be more fun and less *painful. She beat the crap out of all of us.*
*BLOG QUOTE* - *And she beat the crap out of me.* By the way. There are men and more than a few ladies who would pay top dollar *to be beat up by Amber Heard. Oh. And she spit on me. Over and over and over.* And you KNOW there are folks who‚Äôd pay for that.

41,UgxfauWTU3o92vCSli14AaABAg,"So my ASSUMPTION as to why Aquaman was talking to Mera and Vulko in those air domes was because they wanted to talk in private since sound travels faster in water than in the air, it's the equivalent of Get Smarts Cone of Silence. Since this movie WAS SUPPOSED to take place before Aquaman, Orm aka Ocean Master was still king of Atlantis, and they probably didn't want him over hearing them talk about Steppenwolf, as akin to when Umbridge didn't want students of Hogwarts talking about how Voldemort was back.",Painter Lava Lamp,146,2021-04-04T04:41:38Z
42,UgzNUoBaNa-yexQ3UyJ4AaABAg,The dialogue is nearly identical to the 2017 version. The biggest difference is Mera's British accent. Presumably Amber dubbed it over in the other one because she'd decided not to use it in the Aquaman movie after all.,Jordacar,79,2021-04-03T06:51:42Z
43,UgwVl_z6STH1wZrPew54AaABAg,Mera said her parents died in the Snyder cut. In Aquamanovie she had a father. Opps that's plot hole in the DCEU now,s vuy,28,2021-04-01T03:25:12Z
