0,UgwPykIwj5ARoJZKdGV4AaABAg,EZ Law,It will definitely be interesting to see how the case progresses in America!,2021-08-03T10:50:55Z,0
1,UgwIT83m7VZ5ndqsUxd4AaABAg,EZ Law,"Thanks for the question! The UK case is not continuing, as Depp was refused permission to appeal. His case in the USA will take place in 2022.

The UK case was between Johnny and the Sun (well, the owners of the Sun), not Amber. This is very important and the video explains why.

Thanks again and please subscribe :)",2021-07-18T23:05:25Z,0
2,UgxOWfgzZYCWNz32B7R4AaABAg,Julie Lea,"@EZ Law That is my point, neither why AH is not in jail, why she should be in jail, or why JD lost the case is included. 
I'm sure I could have been more organized, but it's 4 yrs of incidents, I understand you can't address everything, but you didn't even list the reasons AH should be in jail, & if you read the court docs as you stated I should not need to link said court docs. 
 Few people are that far behind on the case that they are unaware of who JD was suing in the UK, or you can determine that for yourself by the comments, it's your channel. 
 If you are interested in AH's criminal activity that was brought up in the case, I will send you those links to the court docs.
 I'm a psychologist, not an attorney, but I have heard attorney's speak on it. Please forgive me if I was rude, I'm not usually, I'm unwell & just lost a close family member to Covid.etc having personal problems. Much Love",2021-09-04T22:09:38Z,0
3,UgxOWfgzZYCWNz32B7R4AaABAg,EZ Law,"@Julie Lea It is awfully hard to respond to rants put together with very little sources and so much content, some of which has already been dealt with in the press/courts since the case. But have a nice day :)",2021-09-04T17:50:28Z,1
4,UgxOWfgzZYCWNz32B7R4AaABAg,Julie Lea,"@EZ Law THE VERDICT SPECIFICALLY STATED ""She can't be a gold digger because she gave the $7 Mill to charity""....which she said FOR YEARS & ALL OVER THE WORLD, she KNEW what she was saying. 
 The charities she allegedly gave to were supeoned & she gave not one red cent, so yes, it's proven beyond a shadow of doubt she lied under Oath PURPOSEFULLY.
 The audio will not be thrown out of the Court this time, she admits to throwing bottles & hurting him, REPEATEDLY, I don't think a jury is going to buy Nichol's story of him falling on a knife or whatever he made up! 
 A Justice's job is to come to a verdict based on the evidence, most of which he threw out, but never to speculate, you are confusing people, not clearing anything up, it appears you know less than nothing about this case. Good luck",2021-08-31T02:15:14Z,0
5,UgxOWfgzZYCWNz32B7R4AaABAg,Julie Lea,"@EZ Law The AUSTRALIA case, NOT the UK case, the Australian authorities were going after her when letters were presented in Court of her talking about  ""greasing a vet"" & scamming to get the dogs in, with 2 witnesses to boot. You might try answering that question, it was on TV so yes, the Australian government was going after her, you can watch them say it!",2021-08-31T02:00:43Z,0
6,UgxOWfgzZYCWNz32B7R4AaABAg,EZ Law,"@Ishea83 If the court found out she lied under oath, they could deem her an unreliable witness - which would be a big dent in the Sun's case as she is their star witness! As for repercussions, if it was found she lied under oath I imagine this would be dealt with separately. However, it's extremely unlikely to be the outcome that they can show she was purposefully lying (even if deemed unreliable) as it's a he said/she said case, even with evidence of some bits. Good thinking and interesting discussion!",2021-03-12T17:23:51Z,0

14,UgwolY4RNn0zhKTU56p4AaABAg,EZ Law,"She couldn't be 'charged' in this case because it was not 1) a criminal trial and 2) she was not a party in the trial - only a witness. This is a common confusion due to the nature of the trial being abuse, which we associate with criminal. However, it was a libel trial between only Depp and NGN (The Sun), so Heard was not on trial and never will be for abuse in the UK as Depp is ONLY suing the newspaper.

19,UgxI-zHgRfK6PynDNiR4AaABAg,EZ Law,"@Rose Harvey Hi Rose, so remember the burden of proof is not fact like a criminal trial, it is simply 'on the balance of probabilities' for a libel case. The Sun only had to prove it 'probably' happened, not that it 'did' happen. So, in order to prove that Depp 'probably' abused Heard, they used her version of events as proof. Of course, there was also other evidence she presented in the form of bruises, other witnesses etc (search online for the details). So the judge ruled he 'probably' abused her - which is enough. I hope that clears it up!",2021-03-02T22:55:17Z,1
20,UgxI-zHgRfK6PynDNiR4AaABAg,Rose Harvey,@EZ Law but weren't these just unproven allegations when they published the article (still are). And Johnny was challenging them on what they published about him as being fact at that time. Whatever evidence/testimony she  gave after that are not actually pertinent to NGN publishing allegations as fact. They published without his side of events and they didn't say alleged.,2021-03-02T12:43:48Z,0
21,UgxI-zHgRfK6PynDNiR4AaABAg,EZ Law,"She had to testify in the UK as the Sun's witness. As you say, it's important in every case all the details of both sides are heard. However, Johnny Depp will appeal and the Court of Appeal will most certainly be presented with new, up-to-date evidence which will be interesting. Thank you for watching and giving your opinion!

25,UgzxTOtdfdchv-A2W_B4AaABAg,EZ Law,"@Julie Lea Hi Julie, this video is a short summary so please do try to take it easy. I have read the full judgement and listened to the audio tapes. I remember AH admitting to a lot, although perhaps you could point me to the link and timestamp for admitting the bottle throwing AND how it dislodged his finger (as admitting to the first does not necessarily mean it caused the second). I am just the messenger, and impartial, enjoying the legal discussion from all perspectives :) Thanks for your thoughts and have a nice day!",2021-09-04T17:46:32Z,0
26,UgzxTOtdfdchv-A2W_B4AaABAg,Julie Lea,"@EZ Law What about the Justice making up a story neither AH or JD said on the stand? Is it not his job to make a decision based on the information at his disposal, rather than wild speculation such as he did here & with ""she can't be a gold digger because she gave the money to charity"" with zero proof of that....and the proof is in making Justice Nichol a liar over & over again,
 How do YOU propose his finger fell off? There is proof she was throwing bottles at him, she said so on the audio's that were not allowed in court by the Justice because he said they were ""SECONDHAND EVIDENCE"". There is a TON to address as a legal case, it doesn't appear you read transcripts or have any idea what happened in Court, or do you work for Murdoch as well?",2021-08-31T01:45:40Z,0
27,UgzxTOtdfdchv-A2W_B4AaABAg,KANAN NAKUM,"@EZ Law She told bunch of stories & her sister, Rocky & Josh who lived in JDs PH rent free validate her stories. She had no evidence whatsoever for any of incidents except for two- one from Dec 2015 & May 2016. JD showed so much evidence which contradicted her claims. Uninjured Makeup free photos, cctv footage & much more. He also proved how much she lies. Btw- audio she forgot she recorded after finger incident proves she hurt him. She kept apologizing to JD that she didn't mean to do it. Judge ignored EVERYTHING. Her so called only injury photos from Dec 2015 & May 2016  look fake & total makeup job.  Bruised & broken nose , busted lip don't look like that. No swelling or any discoloration. Same goes for May 2016 photo. She said JD threw phone at her like a baseball pitcher. She felt her eye popped right out. But the photo of red makeup with simetrical line & again no swelling whatsoever. New discoveries show she lied about many things. UK judgement didn't make sense. Judge ignored many of her inconsistencies. Believed her & took her words bc said under oath. She was the abuser. JD has real injury photos to prove that & the audios. She did it for money. She was broke & unknown. She gained so much by turning tables on JD. #JusticeForJohnnyDepp",2021-06-23T14:33:04Z,1

29,UgzxTOtdfdchv-A2W_B4AaABAg,Russell Hawkins,"Amber Heard is not in jail for the same reason most of the politicians are not in jail. Amber Heard has demonstrated profound characteristics of narcissism, psychopathy and sociopathy, just like many politicians do. Yet those politicians are hardly likely to pass legislation that outlaws their own behaviour and consequently criminalises them for the bastards and swines that they are.....  instead, what we see is evil encouraging evil by an absence of such laws.  Go figure.",2021-03-13T14:23:35Z,3
