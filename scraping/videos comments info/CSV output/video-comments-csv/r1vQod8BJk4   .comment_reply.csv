80,UgyOwwlDdrlwVQhjdYB4AaABAg,LunaticReason,"So not in the defense of Amber but I think a lot of her toxic behavior comes from her parents.  I was watching a clip of her talking about them and I got this sense of anger and disdain retelling a story in which as a child her parents are called into school and are dismissive of her behavior and their role in parenting her.  ""A we don't know where she gets it from kind of response.""  She frames the story as being an overly creative child.  I get a sense she was probably a Hellraiser probably in response to her upbringing. 

She also talks about her being the only one to have left Texas and I get this sense of pride and contempt.  I had to look deeper into it and now I am seeing all these things about how abusive her dad is.  I don't think she's innocent I think this proves more of why she did what she did.  We just have a deeper understanding as why.  I think she has family issues particularly Daddy and she lashed out in Johnny because he was an easy target that wouldn't fight back.",2021-07-15T08:57:49Z,0

Sure, they aren't literally dragging out people and hanging them but all someone has to do is make one accusation and you'll ruin someone's life. They'll lose their family, their job, etc and even if they're cleared they'll still be a pariah, not just them but their whole family. Depp himself talked about the shit his kids had to go through everyday for months just because of a false accusation.

117,Ugz9hneWmkSU4o8qFDB4AaABAg,lisa richards,"NIBS  Yeah, it’s just ridiculous.
I think she just wanted the attention, money and publicity of being with him, and s played up to him, (just like She had him going when she went to San Francisco to meet up with him) and then when she realized she was really actually married to him, even though she had made it in ultimatum to him to marry her, she was like, “What the hell am I doing here? I don’t want this guy!”
Then she started having the affairs, and resenting him every time she couldn’t control him.
It is common with someone with borderline personality disorder to “devalue” their conquests, and they start treating them badly.
She is clearly very mentally effed up.
I think she is an extreme narcissist with BDP.
Nothing against Johnny, but he needs to go to therapy to figure out why he thought that was love on his part, love of a woman who treated him terribly, with a terrible character—-lying, revenge, total Disregard for him. 
Violent, she had affairs on him within one month of marriage.
What about that did he think was something he should love? He needs therapy.
He seemed totally unfazed she had affairs, still loves her. Makes no sense.
There is a difference betwee attraction and love.
Nothing against his mother, but I know she beat him up as a kid, and I think he thinks that’s love, and you learned to accept it to have that relationship with his mother.
Sorry this is so long, just so much wrong with that woman.
I had a guy do something similar to me once.
You just don’t expect someone would marry you for attention, and money. And then turn around and threaten your reputation and to destroy you.",2020-03-10T14:00:26Z,0

      When Ms. Paradis and Mr. Depp split, they didn't have a pre-nup (she is independently wealthy herself, from a successful career, and her family's wealth), and Mr. Depp gave her anything that she wanted, and he split his fortune down the middle and gave her half.

IF Heards' father truly did make the statement read in this story, whether intentionally or not, it can be understood as a real threat of physical violence. That's a big no-no in the eyes of most court systems.

I see your point about the difference between a ""threat"" & actual ""violence,"" but considering how many multiple shooting instances include ""threats"" posted online or spoken verbally to another person(s) BEFORE they occurred, law enforcement won't be playing any games & can/will take them seriously.",2020-03-09T18:07:11Z,0
