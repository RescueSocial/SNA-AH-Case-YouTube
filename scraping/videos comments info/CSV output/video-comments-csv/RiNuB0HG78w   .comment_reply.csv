24,Ugyhn9U1rlDZOWgjFud4AaABAg,Sairam Sivakumar,@Beep Boop they aren't microscopic. Get that lie out if your head FFS. We men are tired of hearing it when we literally can have our life ruined and our family taken away from us just because the law considers men guilty until proven innocent and women innocent until proven guilty. Never ever tell me women have it hard in society the amount of power they have is monumental and they do everything to cover it up and downplay it. Just go on to the subreddit men's rights and hopefully you understand how 'microscopic' false accusations and rape at in men. Fun fact : men aren't included in the definition of rape anywhere in the world no that's not the patriarchy it's the feminists who protested and petitioned against it. And then you wonder why we gag at mention of that name.,2021-03-30T07:26:32Z,0
25,Ugyhn9U1rlDZOWgjFud4AaABAg,Danny Muldoon,"@Beep Boop well I will say that a woman's definition of sexual assault is quite broad. I used to live in Florida and worked at a restaurant. A  table left without a tip and when I cashed out his cheque I happened to say to the other waitress ""that c/$# walked off without a tip"". Latet I got called in by the manager to say that I had been accused of sexual assault. Now if I had known just using a word and not implying it at her would have got me into so much trouble I would have directed it at her sencitve ears and got my money's worth. In ireland  we curse all the time including the c word and nobody bats an eye. Why? Because they are just fucking words! How can you be sexually assaulted by a word???? Ffs",2021-03-28T20:57:06Z,0

I can sadly assure you that for a lot of case the victims are not one not believed. 1 of my friends were told their rapists probably tough it was okay that they shouldn‚Äôt go to court for it. One of my friends was literally told she was lying and that she just regret having sex by a cop. One of my friends actually went to court with a lot of proofs about the assault. They told her that since it would destroy her aggressor life for a small thing they would let him go with a warning to be more careful about the woman he frequented. My friend was raped by his gf he was told it was impossible by cops and laugh at. I have so many examples like that. I have friends that were called weak or slut for being assaulted. 
Fake accusations do happen but are more rare than real one. It‚Äôs considered that unfounded (lack of proof) and fake accusations are at a 5% rate of the accusations.",2021-03-28T18:46:01Z,1
27,Ugyhn9U1rlDZOWgjFud4AaABAg,Danny Muldoon,"@Beep Boop As someone who has been on the receiving end of false accusations you would see how easy it is for a man to have is life destroyed based on one false statement. You are assumed guilty until proven innocent. While i think abusers should get the full extent of the law, there should be due process and if a woman is found to be making false accusations they should get the same length of sentence the abuser would have got. In most cases, women don't get any charges brought against them after they make false accusations, even under oath. There was a case recently here in Ireland, A 70 year old man was accused of assaulting a woman, turns out there was CCTV footage that showed that it could not have happened but yet she still claimed she was assaulted, on the stand. The woman was not charged with anything after, she got to walk away. Meanwhile, the man who had lost work and his reputation and a shit ton of money on legal representation has now go after the state for bringing the case against him when they had evidence to prove his innocence. Instead of ""believe her"" it should be ""trust nobody until you get the full story"".",2021-03-28T17:11:20Z,2

50,UgwcFGvVaZCx-3uGeeN4AaABAg,Elizabeth Grace,"@Beep Boop That‚Äôs so true! There‚Äôs definitely a disparity in the way male victims are (not) considered, or in how men are treated in civil cases (custody matters taking the cake here). When it comes to men as perpetrators, though, it goes both ways with the issues. There is a very real bias in that sense, but it‚Äôs not the whole story at all.

I was just reading an article, for example, that mentioned only 3.5% of reported cases of rape (a predominantly gender-based crime, especially in adulthood) in England and Wales were prosecuted this year, and 2.3% led to conviction. That‚Äôs insane, especially considering it‚Äôs estimated that only 15% of victims actually report sexual offenses to the police. You can‚Äôt read that and maintain that the legal system or society truly favor women. For every man who‚Äôs unjustly prosecuted based on stereotypes, there‚Äôs likely several that got away with stuff. And those statistics are from the same country in which Depp somehow lost the libel case against the Sun. The legal system really fails men and women both.",2021-03-28T08:57:34Z,2
51,UgwcFGvVaZCx-3uGeeN4AaABAg,Beep Boop,"Sadly both gender get way to many passes. When you see the numbers of domestic violence and sexual assault cases that are actually prosecuted you understand that the justice system is flawed. 
When you see that victims of sexual assault are made wait hours before being able to talk to someone that will take their depositions. When you see cops telling domestic abuse victims that it‚Äôs not a big deal that they should just try to talk this out. 
I have seen both gender get away with way too much and the system helping the abuser. Abusers get too many passes.",2021-03-28T03:53:39Z,1
52,UgwcFGvVaZCx-3uGeeN4AaABAg,Traps,"@Gabriela Provencio You are absolutely right, however, this does not necessarily mean that ""it is more than that"". Females are simply seen as the less mentally and physically dominant and strong gender, as this is on average factually correct¬π,¬≤. Furthermore, because humans go by stereotypes (this is not a ""bad trait"" but instead a biological behavior to remember certain patterns on certain people that might be helpful or dangerous in the future), this results in females getting on average shorter and lighter sentences and punishments in criminal court (for the same theoretical crime)¬≥ and getting favored in family court‚Å¥. Females are socially more excused to get away with violence towards men‚Åµ, also certain traits we connect to women are used to dodge responsibility and accountability; a female pattern that often occurs is going into the ""helpless victim""-pose when confronted, and it works, as they are often forgiven, let off easier as supposed to or supported, even if they are in the wrong(‚Å∂). These are extremely huge and important social passes, you could even say privileges we give to females. 
Now, I actually don't have a big problem with that, this is just how we see and threat different people, this is completely normal and natural, but the mainstream-feminism has tried to tell us for the last decades that women are the ultimate victim in society, who have it so hard, while males are the privileged one, in complete denial and disrespect of their importance, accomplishments and issues, and I do have a big problem with that.
