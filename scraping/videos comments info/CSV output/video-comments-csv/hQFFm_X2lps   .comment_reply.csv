3,UgyO8M25NdsC4Vth25N4AaABAg,Amy Beaulieu,"This statement is NOT to imply Amber Heard is innocent. It, however, is to imply that if you don’t see both sides you’ll never have the full story. I’ve done a weird amount of research on this case because I’m curious, and from everything I’ve heard and read they are both quite sociopathic, and abusive. They abused each other and should never have married, which is a whole other issue. But it’s about who wins right? 🤡",2021-10-25T18:38:14Z,0

23,Ugysbbrfa4xeD1FiTi94AaABAg,Mad Hatter,"I don't know about you, but when I'm having a stressful conversation, particularly about trauma, I feel too anxious & nauseated to eat snacks at that time. The snacking & comfort eating would usually come afterwards when I'm on the come down.

In the short term stress usually suppresses appetite. The nervous system sends messages to the adrenal glands atop the kidneys to pump out the hormone epinephrine (also known as adrenaline). Epinephrine helps trigger the body's fight-or-flight response, a revved-up physiological state that temporarily puts eating on hold. Reliving trauma in a crowded room would usually create acute short term stress. Maybe she is different, but it is unusual behaviour, especially in the casual way she is doing it.

That said yes it's true, eating could be helping with stress & be a distraction, the stress of having to lie & evade in court & on tape.",2021-11-04T14:17:59Z,0

27,UgwE-O2jW4vyOYGHDnx4AaABAg,Sara Heart,"@Rock Candy ah, ok, I wasn't aware she was married to Tasya, who by the way, seems like an enchanting woman, but sadly I think Amber used her to accelerate her own career and standing,  but moving on, if she started seeing Depp while still with Tasya, it may establish a pattern of behavior (infidelity) which should have been more closely examined by the judge in regards to Elon. Amber is the definition of narcissism, not surprising she used drugs to control Depp although I think it was much more than trying to coax him with a Xanax, I could completely see her tampering with his food or drinks, keeping him aloof, drunk, incompetent and unaware of his surroundings on a regular basis. A total manipulator, not interested in anyone or anything other than herself. That lead them on and then burn them way of life is rage fueled, what the hell happened to her? Sex trade? Used? Maybe had to do something to get her break in Never Back Down? She takes me as the sort of vengeful person that would profit from child or sex trafficking or and not bat an eye.",2021-08-28T20:48:23Z,1

She used makeup to create bruises - witness statements never saw injury before or after getting TRO - also there is a picture that the paparazzi got where she is crazy laughing with her co-conspirator friend the next day, face clear, and it's online.   There's more evidence of faking it but i can't go into it.  (I'll just say James Corden show.)

He ended up with life threatening infection 2 or 3 times because of that.  She was angry she was asked to sign a postnuptual agreement and that she wasn't in the will.

80,UgzQkCdelPeXM5n9FYh4AaABAg,vanillainflux,"@Emmanuel even though i think (imo) they probably both have volatile tendencies, drug usage, which, put together in a couple, became explosive; and she imo probably did suffer more physical injuries; i was thinking the exact same thing r.e. NPD. her behaviours in her testimony; the nonchalant (grandiose/entitled) eating, the boredom, the 'irrelevant' details (derailing), the dead eyes which quickly turn into smirks then quickly turn into flashes of anger, all do read as very very NPD strategies/behaviours. these behaviours look identical on women and men with unprocessed/undiagnosed NPD.
then again trauma is a powerful thing and can inform the ways people behave/react. both their testimonies feel bizarre to me.",2021-11-17T15:35:16Z,0

94,Ugzr9j5S6GRja9N766x4AaABAg,11cylynt11,"@Alissa Hansen I didn't mention anything about her. I simply came to give my 2 cents about reading body language.  It's not a one size fits all. Cultural, age, mental state,, etc. aspects should be considered when reading body language. 

I agree with you about Amber Heard. She is American so it's easier for me, also American,  to be able to read her body language. I've seen several of interviews of her and I believe that she was the actual abuser toward Johnny Depp. I mean she threw a glass at him while he was sitting down at a bar and she severed his finger. What could he have possibly done to her while he was sitting down on a stool. She didn't do that in defense obviously.  So that tells me that she was the actual abuser. And Depp was a victim. And just to add insult to injury, she also hurt his career. I do not like her neither as a person nor an actress. I will not support films that she appears in. 

 I feel bad for Depp as his career took a hit. He seems like a good and calm person. It's difficult to imagine he would abuse her. However it's not difficult at all to imagine Heard abusing him with the way she conducts herself.  She seems very domineering, overbearing, and controlling. When something doesn't go her way she takes it out by seeking revenge. Which is something a sociopath does.",2021-09-23T17:00:48Z,0
95,Ugzr9j5S6GRja9N766x4AaABAg,Alissa Hansen,What is your point exactly?  Are you trying to say you do not see she is a perfect example of a narcissist.  All of her words and body language are screaming that she is a liar and proud of her actions.,2021-09-23T13:43:58Z,2
96,UgxZzl4dW9xw6_ElC5t4AaABAg,Priscilla Dórea,"@Sebastián Patti I'm not defending her, I'm talking about him, if he wants to pass on credibility as a serious job he doesn't need to monky about, because doing that he seems to have a side beforehand. In my case I came to see the video with the intention of analyzing it, because everything I see is substantial, sensationalist and faddom fight, but I all saw here someone just mocking, whether what she said was true or not,  he could have done without it. Particularly I don't think she and depp are good people, they're both abusive, but even if depp was the aggressor and liars i wouldn't want to see him making fun of him too, i follow some people who analyze in my country, including murder cases, nor do they act like that",2021-08-08T20:06:50Z,0

Keeping up with research and continuing education is *required* of pretty much everyone who holds some sort of license in healthcare. My Nursing Assistant/Home Health Aide license alone (which only required 175 hours of class time to get certified)  required 20 credits of continuing education per year. My Pharmacy Tech license requires 40. I literally just submitted the write up for my last couple of 2021 credits
 to my Board of Pharmacy for approval. It was about research on the mechanisms behind tolerance to psychoactive medications and how NMDA antagonists (medications like Ketamine, Namenda, and DXM) prevent it in patients who need to be on certain medications long-term. When SARS-CoV-2 hit, the healthcare system, where I'm doing clinical rotations, required everyone in a DPS position (and all med students on rotations) to complete extra training regarding several areas related to the pandemic. Hell, it was *doctors* who first sounded the alarm over OxyContin. The discovery that Purdue Pharma had falsified their data came when new independent studies couldn't reproduce the results.

279,UgzBKXArmJUAqszIpKB4AaABAg,Werm,"@Murphy Church I'd say that fertility issues and not wanting to risk your body aren't that different as far as validity as a reason for going the surrogacy route.
If someone wants to carry another's baby, and is completely okay with taking those risks in exchange for money so that the bio parent doesn't have to undergo the risky process themselves (which could be for many reasons: certain conditions, family histories, and genetics can make one person significantly more likely to experience serious and life altering side effects of pregnancy than others) I'd say it's no different than someone who wants to do it because they aren't fertile. You're paying someone to be pregnant on your behalf either way, and wanting to have a child and being physically unable to, and wanting to have a child and not being able to cope with the side effects of pregnancy, are equally valid reasons to want to want that option.",2021-10-05T21:03:35Z,0

Regarding the surrogates, they are debatable even in case of fertility issues, and I'm not sure what to think of it in these cases. But when it's about ""nah, I'm not going to risk my own body, I'll pay someone else to risk their body, and I'm too busy for pregnancy anyway"" I'm totally disgusted by that attitude.",2021-10-05T20:15:41Z,0

349,UgxlYWfxHWzYbXCUmMp4AaABAg,Akai Seirei,"@Michael Keaton      How can a woman like that fool so many people into thinking that she was really the victim? I have seen and heard victims of violence and when they tell their stories they do it like Johnny. With the pain reflected on their faces, with the events that they convey with the real experience that is happening, with their desire for someone to listen to their struggles. They do not go around hesitating, nor changing facts or not even eating while they speak, because in reality they want to convey the injustice, the suffering, the pain and even the impossibility of being unable to defend themselves or escape from the vicious circle due to fear, family or even appearances. A woman who is really abused wants her story to be taken seriously, not to sound like a game. I really feel very sorry for Depp, because all of his expressions show that he is the one who suffers and is very deep and I hope that one day he can get rid of that nightmare. Dear Johnny, I don't know you personally, but I really hope that one day you can heal yourself and turn this horrible page forever. You are not alone, not only because you are an actor loved by many, but also because your sincerity is heartwarming and I'm so sorry you had to face such horrible disappointment and heartbreak, like so many other women and men around the world. May you find happiness again and, above all, justice.",2021-08-01T02:21:22Z,6

And he is ex having connections to the Turd's lawyers. 
The UK judge paid NO attention to Johnny's evidence, and he had lots, including cops who came to the house and never saw anything on her face. The 2nd set of cops had bodycams on & they show not one thing out of place.... And supposedly, according to the Turd & her friends, Johnny had come in destroyed everything with a magnum bottle of wine.

Like the looking around the room thing which to me became a clear sign she is trying to avoid direct confrontation with the people who ask questions (because she f*cking knows she's in trouble and picking a fight now isn't smart). At first it might have been fear though. Unfortunatly, all other signs from her quickly pointed to ""afraid because she's the abuser and has been caught"" rather than ""afraid because she was abused"". Or the putting your face in your hand - he missed how she was about to grap a snack but thought better of it and instead tried to ""sit on her hand"" so to speak to keep herself from grabbing food at that point. He keeps stressing that she is bored when she clearly isn't. She is stressed and trying to hold up the sharade her lawyer told her to keep - eyes half closed (like she's bored) unless she's acting out a wild story. She's trying to look inconspicuous and failing because she really shouldn't be looking like that if she was the abused. Now, I never heard of her before today but is she an actress? If so, I don't get how she managed that... she s*cks... (or maybe her lawyer hates her and got her to act in the stupidest way so he could later say his loss was her failure) XD",2021-06-02T00:30:50Z,0

For example, when I landed wrong on a trampoline a few years ago and messed up my knee to the point it popped sideways and I couldn't walk on it for several weeks. I made jokes about it quite often. Hell one of the first thoughts in my mind during the moments following the injury (after the initial pain) was an image of the scene from Ace Ventura with a spear in his knee and the motion he made.

It can't be used in court for a reason, and that reason is because it gives the false positives I've been mentioning. Innocent until proven guilty is a great concept unless you're being harassed by the police while being innocent.

Whatever the reason, you can try and say you are autistic and have this and that. And if they are nice, they'll believe you. But I can be on cocaine/alcohol and say the same. Or I just might be a little too sleepy for their liking, and then go through the same. You're not acting normal (=90% of people/no conditions) and most of the ones doing the same ARE problematic, maybe you ain't. But you will be a rarity. Deal with it. Body language works only on people with controll of their body, normal senses/brain functioning, and emotions. If you are part of the people OUTSIDE that ring, it doesn't.

Your behaviour is the same as someones with secrets or with drugs. Your behaviour will be declared as normal AFTER the questioning. But you gotta understand that they will check you out. If you won't look at the light, it usually means you're on strong drugs. You get it? You can't get pissed cuz you're assumed the same as everyone else. If I'm walking weird at an airport I'll have to go through checks that I'm not smuggling anything. Because smugglers often hide thing under their clothes.",2021-06-04T18:23:58Z,0

When you go in for your initial consult (which might be free) just tell them what happened to you and tell you don't want to ever get into a situation like that ever again. Do your research on your local mental health professionals to see where they are and what kind of reviews they've gotten.

635,UgxlxBxTWamauWXzeNB4AaABAg,Louise Tapp,Not true I’m afraid. Since these videos/audios there has been plenty of evidence released to show that she has lied about the abuse. Even her lawyers are now getting mixed up as there are so many variations to her stories. She lied about donating her divorce settlement to charity and there is photographic evidence to prove she did not have the injuries she claimed. Johnny has never been accused of abuse before and all his past partners have signed declarations saying what a loving gentle man he is. Only one of them has a track record and arrest for DV and that’s HER. She has weaponised the Me Too movement to use against him. He rightfully so is just trying to clear his name for not just his sake but for his children after years of being called horrific things in the media. If you actually read around the case and look at the evidence available you will see a clear abuser and it’s not him. Unfortunately she thinks she can get away with this due to the fact she is a woman which is disgusting!,2021-05-23T17:52:39Z,0

If you look at last interviews of his he always speaks very softly and stutters as he has said himself he suffers with shyness and anxiety. If you watch in this video he is constantly glancing at her to get approval for what he is saying and seems very fidgety as he doesn’t want to say anything wrong. He was very courteous towards the interviewer. However if he had been drinking I don’t think you can blame him as he was having to put up with her tirades of abuse.,2021-05-23T18:03:21Z,0

702,UgzgH4RvtzH-WOUD4E14AaABAg,Amayagma,I think your choice of words kinds makes it sound like you're generalising. That's like if women were to kinda paint men as being awful and toxic and so on. Definitely isn't always true. I agree that when men are abused it usually isn't addressed and if anything it's turned on it's head and made out like the man is at fault when he's not... but just because that's the case doesn't mean you should kinda make it sound like all ladies are like this. There are genuine abuse victims that are female and never actually get justice. Women like Amber really fuck everything up for everyone and I know that so many women and abuse victims that absolutely do not support her and her actions because they know and can see she's at fault.,2021-05-14T18:24:18Z,0

Like he always says it isn't an exact science at all and the whole point of his channel is to watch footage and say what's happening and what they seem to be indicating with their body language... He isn't trying to unpack things on a super deep level to explain how and why things happen he's just saying what tells are given in the video that could possibly reflect how people are feeling or what they are thinking at that moment

Edit: ok I got further in the vid... I can see a bit more of why you responded the way you did, still feel majority of my points kinda stand but yeah... I kinda get it",2021-05-14T18:39:09Z,0

A good example is the infamous Logan Paul video from the suicide forest. It's appalling and I can't stand him so it's not really a defense but when he's laughing it's definitely not because he thinks it's funny or doesn't care, it's because he's in shock. I don't think he really anticipated how traumatic it would be to see that and most people would have seemingly antithetical reactions.

912,UgxKTUyK3qzfAjbzSzZ4AaABAg,Sarah,"Also her having better body posture than him (in the clip of them together) could be because she’s self conscious from being photographed by the media. We’ve seen how the media criticise women’s bodies. Better posture makes a better photo. It’s sad that women are conditioned to know/care about this but it’s true. I’m honestly just shocked at how much minor and easily rationalised gestures are being used to discredit Amber based on a “science” that isn’t evidence based... and people in the comments are loving it. It just makes me worried for humanity? I think the disclosure at the beginning of the video is good but the way it’s worded “at best 70%” is borderline misdirection. It should also disclose how inaccurate it can be, together with where this random 70% figure came from. I think people just want to love Depp because he’s a talented actor that’s provided us with a lot of enjoyment over the years... but the entertainment wasn’t a selfless public service. The way society puts celebrities on pedestals without holding them accountable is grim.",2021-04-09T20:40:11Z,0

The number of men that got wrongly accused of domestic violence is astonishing not only that but a lot of them are actually abused psychologically and physically.

1016,Ugzyo8bqOznBF0dsZyN4AaABAg,73kimura,"He is wasted and she seems to be like trying to make him feel small by showing off how comfortable she feels in this interview situation which must be a pain in the ass for anyone who has ever been asked irrelevant stuff by someone who does not really speak your language and you have to be polite. Jonny had a few drinks too much and Amber seems to bask in the fact that while he is feeling social anxiety or at least struggling with the whole lame ass red carpet bullshit she on the other hand is all smiles and the professional celebrity.

1158,UgzyoqG9U3Jt--7-Gn54AaABAg,Ofelia Fajardo,"@Phillip Robertson you're right that it seems fake, but it's interesting how an ""actress"" can't act hurt? I find that she comes off as fake because she's naturally influential. She's likely not someone whose had to sell anything very hard in her life. I think men in general are naturally resentful of women who are ""trying to get their way"" because they feel that women generally don't have to work as hard to sell any idea. I think this is particularly true of this youtuber. It's evident in the way he practically has no negative points on Johnny from the start, but does so for Johnny's ex? Does she seem subversive to the untrained observer? Heck yes, but bare in mind, she's not going to feel like she has to try very hard to make an impression in the first place. Her skin tone gets flushed, and suddenly she makes eye contact when talking about her sister. ""Observer"" never bothered to point that out either. Just makes blanket statements in general. In my book this pens him down as ""not observing scientifically"" at best and ""uses extreme bias"" at worst",2021-03-10T14:35:40Z,0
1159,UgzyoqG9U3Jt--7-Gn54AaABAg,Ofelia Fajardo,"@LaraCroftEyes1 From your comments alone. I can tell you're a very protective person. So you see someone feeling abused and you go into their defense. Never change, the world needs more of that altruism. With that in mind, I want you to imagine you're someone that's already popular, pretty, and influential just by walking into view. Maybe, just maybe that means you would be someone, who's not practiced at expressing yourself with the intention of making an impression. So she comes off cold and uninterested. She also displays a lot of marks as an introvert. Typical of the lack of eye contact when speaking among other details. Ultimately It's hard for most people to judge introverts because well... INTROVERTS aren't out there making a lot of friends. Their circles tend to be quite small and selective. People rarely get a full picture of this personality type. It doesn't help that johnny is both charismatic and easily expresses his intentions, and is also obviously feeling wronged by the whole situation.

I'm sorry I'm not trying to be mean, I just find that your bias on this case, You even said in the beginning that you watched way too many hours of videos Amber and you hated doing that basically... and you tell her to fuck off. How am I supposed to trust your opinion, when you are actually hateful to the person that you are giving a annilystic read on someone that you obviously clearly don't like and your own body language is very very stiff, and nit picky, snarky, mocking. Your smiling and laughing, obviously showing that your above her or something... It doesn't make sense, It's almost like your enjoying trying to tear down someone. Stop Eating. Wow, that has NOTHING to do with anything. She probably knows that they won['t believe her, that's why she is shrugging. Why would a ""insecure"" person (because she shrugged lol) come out to the media and everything and tell her story? She isn't being animated or caring about this because the lawyer is dumb, and she is trying to ask her questions that are the exact same thing, but phrased differently, over and over and over... This is a courtroom tactic to make someone look like an untrustworthy person. The lawyer is stupid, trying to play mind games, and that's why she is so uninterested to be there. To sit there and be asked questions that make no sense, are basically to trip you up in your words, word salad pretty much... Every time she speaks, she speaks with honesty and stongley, and the lawyers try to change the subject and interrupt her. This is rediculous. She didn;t talk with her mouth full because the other lawyers where talking to each otherm and it was rude and totally ujnprofessional and disrespectful to not only Amber, but the judge andI don't know why he doesn't speak up more. She expects a YES OR NO ANSWER?? Who the hell is this lady, you cannot do that. And if you listen very carefully they are ALL WHISPERSING through out the entire court proceedings. Ok.. so what in her body language tells you that she isn't telling the truth about the sister and the stairs?? You just said ""In my opinion, that wast the case."" Why? What made you com e to that conclusion? ... Johnny is lieing. He sliced his own finger off, by throwing glass, duh! HE IS incongruent to the MAX. He will take one position on something and then a second later he may take a contrary position, this is an example of a situation where your statements would be described as incongruent and tons of details while describing his finger being sliced off but he laughs about it too...",2021-03-03T01:47:44Z,0

Tbh, I'm old enough to have seen Johnny since the early 90s and he's always been quiet and soft spoken, to me it seemed entirely uncharacteristic for him to have abused her. Also because he's been in relationships a lot of the time and there's never been a peep out of any of those women. While obviously that's not foolproof, seeing her responses, oof. Completely sealed the deal for me, even without the commentary.

This isn't even the defiant face of a woman who has fought her way out of a crap relationship, nor does she look like victims I've seen on tv. He does, however. Hell, I do the smirky laugh thing when I'm embarrassed about something and try to make it less bad for myself to talk about.",2021-03-23T10:10:35Z,3
1286,UgycUxUBQ1yVqic8F0V4AaABAg,Tiffany Patenaude,"Sadly only because she’s a woman and he is a man. So a man has to be the abuser and the woman has to be the victim. But it’s not like that. Women can be violent to a man. Psychologically and physically, just like a man can be to a woman. But the society is made to automatically put the blame on the man, because he is a man so he is strong he is a “real man” a “real man” doesn’t cry, doesn’t have emotions. And the victim is the woman, because we are “weak”, “fragile” and “sensitive”. 

We want to be equal, but sadly it seems to be only for the “right things”. When it’s about violence, crime, abuse (well I’m talking about those who aren’t the real victim but try to act like one) they really love the patriarchal society that we are in. 😪",2021-03-15T08:31:40Z,2

1390,Ugw_uiHlM4Tu8fdzB354AaABAg,Tea Rainey,"I can say with some certainty that you are correct. Especially with the perceived power dynamic of her being more assertive and dominant and him being submissive. I have been in that situation personally and didn't learn until after I was long gone from those people that I'd do exactly what Johnny was doing there. I remember when I was asked a question my heart would race with anxiety as I wondered, what if I say something that upsets them? What can I say afterwards to placate them? I was always thinking of my next word with such intensity that I'd shake, terrified to misstep. I also have family in the same situation with bad life partners. The best example would be my grandfather who found himself a woman my age (early 20's). At first everything seemed as normal as it could, but as the weeks and months would pass I noticed he no longer held his head up and made direct eye contact when he'd speak. He'd duck his chin if she was in the room and look to the floor as he'd reply to anyone and if she made even the slightest gesture he'd back up his statement and remove himself from the conversation immediately. He wouldn't even meet my gaze when we'd speak which I regret at the time I felt as him attempting to be dishonest with me. Though now after therapy and some years I've learned that this behavior is common in people in toxic relationships with a dominant partner who polices every little thing and reacts with violence or mental abuse to curb unwanted behavior. These toxic people know very well how to train someone with the right personality like a dog. They can get whatever reaction they want just by moving or vocalizing a certain way. Even a grunt or a loud nose exhale is enough to trigger that submissive behavior. Even now I struggle with what I perceive as aggressive body language, eye contact, and vocalizations even if the person I'm reacting to has no intentions or doesn't even know me that well.",2021-03-23T18:59:01Z,5

When she touch it his first reaction is slighty fear, he hides his hand at first instinctively, then look at her and we can't hear what they are saying but he shows it again and clearly makes a joke about it. She laughs with him but once he look to the other side,  her face instantly changes from joy to concern. You can clearly realize she didn't buy it, and is worried about him. It is very obvious she knows something and doesn't know how to help him.",2021-03-29T12:31:08Z,2

Memory loss are can be described as dissociation - a self defence mechanism to separate one self from the trauma. This way you aren't constably destabilized.

1486,UgwELTExLWgx4u5kwmB4AaABAg,David Tapp,"Johnny Depp lost his libel case in the High Court, London. Is that what you mean by 'lose'?
The thing is, the case wasn't a Depp vs. Heard, it was Depp vs. The Sun newspaper, over it's use of the phrase “wife-beater”, in a published article. Depp lost because the court's ruling was that it was acceptable to use that phrase. Crucially, Depp lost because he had hit Heard. The fact that she was an abuser and that the balance of violence between the two participants was heavily weighted to one side, was not an issue in the case.
The bottom line is that the case wasn't about who was the abuser, the issue was Did Depp hit Heard? He did hit her, therefore he was de facto a 'wife-beater'.
His legal advisors should have made him think far more carefully about which battles he picked. I feel sorry for him but he chose to bring the case; he knew he had hit her; he had to lose! What was he thinking?!!",2021-03-12T08:14:13Z,2

And even then you're acting/living the role but there's an element of you within it. Plus you usually rehearse for hours on end with a director guiding and correcting you.

1513,UgyNH4MNqWyhJuIlke14AaABAg,Arkadia Moon,"To be fair, acting for the screen to portray a fictional character is a very, very different proposition to making a lie credible in real life. Acting generally runs off an internally-consistent prepared script that runs to a known conclusion, and doesn't deviate much from it, and everything in the film supports the fiction.

Lying in real life involves improvised responses to questions that are not scripted, and the other players in the scene are doing all they can to derail any notional script you may have in your head and root out all the inconsistencies with identifiable facts. And there's no screenwriter, script editor, or director to make the scene support the fiction; facts are facts. People who think they can act their way through this are living in a fool's paradise even if they've got several Oscars on the shelf -- and Amber's nowhere near that calibre.

Acting skills are a very poor preparation for this -- especially if you're trying to apply them where they aren't going to work.",2021-05-23T19:33:57Z,1

1589,UgyoM7pP953-s4A0A9R4AaABAg,Sarah Rounds,"NOT that I believe a word this woman was saying... however, you did mishear what she was explaining on that part. She said that she and Johnny were on a landing of the stair case. Her sister was at the top of the landing and came rushing down those stairs. A staircase with a landing means there is a set of stairs, and then one large flat (the landing) and then a second set of stairs directly off of that. Her poor excuse for while she may have possibly “hit him” with “some part of her body that she can’t remember” is because after her sister came rushing to get in between them where they were arguing on the landing, once she down the first set of stairs, she was afraid that Johnny was going to push her down the second set of stairs.
HOWEVER, she did add the part of them “being on a landing” half way through her explanation of how the whole situation happened... adding details to better paint the picture you want seen after you already get past the part of the story that would have been relevant to explain it is another classic sign of someone who is making up a story.",2021-02-16T00:12:58Z,0

1624,UgzYQ0nF6LyyKMaQmZV4AaABAg,Tazhie Nunurbusinezz,"@Marija Kula ""people like her don't come from happy and good families"". That is very much not true & is misinformation that you probably shouldn't be spreading. I have zero idea what Amber's parents were like when she was a kid & I doubt very much that you have a lot more info than I do. 

Mental illness doesn't care if you have wonderful parents or sh!t parents. I had an idyllic childhood & was never ever hit, not even once. I wasn't emotionally or verbally abused & I wasn't neglected at all. I was sheltered from violence & negativity on all media until I finally was allowed to watch violent movies at age 17. I was supported in every single thing I did. They were about as perfect as everyone expects parents to be now but they did it in the 80s & 90s.

I was stalked & almost murdered my first few months at college & there are some issues I deal with that result from that but that has zero to do with my parents. My little brother had depression through his teen years & they did everything they could do. It wasn't from anything they did & is assumed by my brother's team of doctors to have a genetic component passed from my mother's father's family.

When he was in his early 20s a relationship ended & he locked himself in an enclosed trailer with a running snowmobile. My father drove the 22 minutes from their house to his in 12 & a half minutes. My dad was the one that ripped the locked door off of the enclosed trailer with his bare hands after he searched the property trying to find his son. He pulled his unconscious son from the enclosed racing trailer, called an ambulance & started CPR (thankfully my RN late husband had taught both my parents). My baby brother is only alive today because my Dad was paying attention & got him help. My dad went from having the same black hair that I have to almost completely gray overnight. It was that close. My brother didn't tip him off that he was ending his life but the text my brother did send my dad felt off to him so he leapt out of his tractor, jumped in his truck & floored it to my brother's house. 

My parents are terrific parents & 2 out of their 3 kids have mental illnesses. Negative parenting can absolutely produce mental illness in the kids raised in those homes but that isn't always the case & sometimes it just happens due to outside things or due to a genetic component. We have to stop accusing people of stuff without the necessary evidence. That's how we got here in the first place. Amber is the abuser & Johnny was the one being vilified until more evidence came out. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯",2021-06-10T14:11:41Z,4

Then you take the ""I don't know with what part of my body I hit him with. I was protecting my baby sister!"" Is full of crap!! I had an ex put his hands on me like a MMA fighter. I dodged most of them. My daughter comes in carrying a pencil, she was going to stab him. He chases after her, I give chase. He's holding her hand trying to take it. I shove his hand & her away. Then I punched him in the left side of his head, it his the wall & knocks him out. I can still remember everything about that night. The was the last time he put his hands on me. Told him the next day that it happens again, I'm going to do my best to kill him. Every time when it looked like he was going to hit me I'd ask... ""Are you ready to die?"" He'd quickly calm down.

I never asked if or implied she's never lied. I never asked if she had 'ever been a hypocrite' or was a hypocrite on many things.

I asked what evidence there is that she was constantly intoxicated (an addict.). I asked if you have any proof she was using as much as he was. So you have to determine how much he was using and then her. Otherwise you're just taking sides.

Just think of how many women you're painting with that brush right now. Who use substances, have married well off men, have lied about things to avoid trouble or damaging their reputation and who would leave with as much as they could carry in a divorce with a man as wealthy as he was.

If that's your standard for sociopathic, narcissistic drug addicts then they're everywhere. They make up a significant portion of the western female population. 

I never said I support her or agree with her. From the little I've seen of her she seems like she's off her face. That there's something wrong with her.",2021-04-12T02:11:32Z,0
1683,UgzRDYivr_uvt58CznZ4AaABAg,Alegna LaVieenRose,"@7dayspking yes, there is plenty of evidence to support my claims. Testimony for example of her ex assistant Kate James, staff that worked for them, and  notes from her doctor and nurse about her heavy drug use and drinking. Also from evidence in the court case. First she denies taking drugs, then confronted with counter evidence she admits to it. Also she boasts about her use of drugs and alcohol in an interview, which I can’t find now on the spot. On Incredibly Average’s channel there is a lot of evidence why her story does not add up. Also Nick Wallis (UK reporter) has all the case evidence on his site. Including all transcripts. If you followed all evidence you find she really is a hypocrite amongst other things. Claiming she was a self supporting woman, never interested in his money. Yet claiming 3 penthouse appartements, 50k spousal support, a Landrover (while claiming she had no means of transport), where he also had to pay for all costs and rent/maintenance ). Also she did not donate the 7 million. Even the judges in the UK case attest she misled the court and lied under oath. She is a textbook narcissist.

I completely understand I've been in a physical abusive relationship and a emotional/mentally abusive relationship and nearly every other one was with a narcissist, 
I still always feel it was my fault and maybe I did something to make them be that way but I also know it was wrong that they behaved that way, it's hard to speak up about, you feel you're in some kind of trouble speaking up or some form of embarrassment :(  
 So I can completely understand :( 
It upset me seeing these interviews as you can see how broken Johnny is and he's feeling some sort of guilt all the time :( he's making little jokes at his own expense which is normally a defence mechanism, 
 she just is either rolling her eyes or smirking, I know you can have a nervous laugh in these situations but that's not a nervous laugh that she's showing, it's arrogance.

1807,Ugz4IVUal2UYVmrL1TJ4AaABAg,Starrweaver,"@Freja Kjellberg I think that she saw how kind he was, the gentleman in him and knew she could control him. He fell for her, thought he was in love. But like he finally admitted, it was a person he believed in his mind. He fell in love with the illusion she created. But that wasn't the real her... she's been arrested for abuse before. He really should have got a background check on her first.
The reason he was turning to alcohol and drugs more was due to trying to shut out the pain. She was manipulating him. Just like the video showed, she was in control. He was intimidated, hurt both physically and verbally. She'd torn him down. Someone stated he stayed for the sex. That's insulting. Women in this situation are controlled, made to feel worthless, they are terrorized and threatened. They aren't staying for sex, they stay out of fear.
I've been in it, my own daughter was a victim of it and I'm thankful we were able to escape from the nightmares we endured. It could have been worse, and the mentally we both suffered was debilitating in some ways. I had more non-sexual physical attacks, and in the end my vision was damaged due to blows to the back of my head. Blunt force trauma to the cortex.

This person often has this look of arrogance or superiority. As if she's smarter, better and you're beneath her. That story about her sister being in danger, that's a ploy to try and come off as selfless. Yet she can't be bothered to say yes or no to a simple question without flubbing it or ignoring it. She needs to be shown as the liar she is and someone who I believe purposefully entrapped Johnny Depp just so she could manipulate him. Her little act likely started to break down after the marriage. Cause by then she would have no reason to play pretend. Just make sure to store up 
""evidence"" and make it seem she's the victim. Then once she started to tire of him, tire of the games, she finally has enough and is ready to start her big pay off. He had money, was at the top of his game. But as she abused him, he started to spiral downward. Often friends notice this but don't know where it's coming from. The one being abused is embarrassed, ashamed, feeling like their life is a nightmare they can't escape. They turn to drink, drugs and fall into depression. Since Depp had difficulties during the filming, likely from trying to escape the situation the only way he knew he could... it would cause memory problems, focus & more. His guilt for letting his professionalism suffer, depression from the situation and feeling worthless, due to years of verbal abuse took a toll.
It was stated he loved his mother and stood by her even though she was horribly cruel to him. It shows that he isn't a violent individual, that he's suffered abuse from a woman before & it's likely one reason she was able to control him for so long. The signs are there for those who know to see.
There is a video, where they were arriving somewhere. He reached out for her hand, then stopped, withdrew his hand and waited to see if it was okay for him to do it. That isn't normal in a relationship.

I feel bad for all he's had to go through because of this, he doesn't deserve it. I just hope he understands his fans and others believe in him. Love you Johnny Depp, you're a tender soul, you've a good heart. I wish you the best and more.",2021-02-13T05:46:59Z,2

1883,UgzVUVZ6OmSgmPOPpQ94AaABAg,Emeryl Tekutsu,"@Mari Muradyan It's terrible.

I know several people who have been victims AND several people who have been falsely accused or labeled by various means.

There are different ways it happened. One guy just happened to have the same name (Let's say ""Steve"") as another person. His niece said that ""Steve did stuff to her"", essentially, but the thing was she had TWO uncles both named Steve and it was the OTHER uncle who was being accused. He happened to be her uncle and happened to have the same name, so when word started getting around people thought they meant him.

If you recall the whole scandal with priests, I had a priest friend who was watching the news one night. And guess what pops up? They started talking about the pedophile scandal and they put HIS PICTURE up on the screen.
Thing was they put the right name of the accused up, but they put the wrong picture up. I guess a picture of ""some priest"" was good enough. When he called to complain they basically made a correction in fine print that probably no one would even notice. Can you even imagine watching TV, you're not even accused of doing anything, but they post your picture anyway and say, ""This guy is a pedophile""? It's horrific what the media can get away with and they don't even have to go out of their way to issue corrections - they can write some footnote somewhere and pretend that fixes the problem.

Then we knew another person and we actually believed her story about being raped, because that's what you do when someone tells you something like that. But we later found out there were massive holes in her story. For example, she claimed to be babysitting someone who wasn't born yet, as well as the fact that she had never babysat said person. When her story became filled with holes it became obvious that she had made up the lie that she'd been raped because she wanted to get sympathy from a guy she was dating way back when, and also wanted to explain why she wasn't a virgin (she was a very wild teenager) and explain her bad behavior. A rape story was something easy for her to use where people would say, ""That explains a lot"" and feel bad for her, but it turned out not a single fact lined up with her story. And the thing is that the dates things would have had to happen were very clear, so things that didn't add up couldn't have been a matter of 'just getting the dates a bit wrong'.

That's just three cases I know of where people have been falsely accused even accidentally, but a lot of people don't take it seriously. They want guilty until proven innocent. Of course I want my nieces to get justice if anything happens to them, but we want our nephews to get due process, too. Who wants to see their son or nephew or brother / etc have their lives destroyed over fake accusations?",2021-02-03T06:19:54Z,1

1885,UgzVUVZ6OmSgmPOPpQ94AaABAg,Emeryl Tekutsu,"@Grace Haven I think a lot of stats are purposefully manipulated, and most people believe things to be one way because it sounds right based on what they've always been told.

For example, when they talk about rape victims, they purposely leave out things like jail rapes or sexual assault in juvie. There are a massive amount of boys and men getting raped but it's just like, ""Nah, we don't count those ones.""

I've become a lot more critical of the stats we believe we know in the last few years just because we've been seeing so often how they purposely manipulate them to fit what they want. Like when they changed the number of people who need to be involved to be a mass shooting and suddenly there is a surge of mass shootings because it takes like, 4 people to be around when it happens (I forget the exact number, I think it was 3 or 4...) But then you read the actual mass shooting and it can be like, ""They were in a house with some friends and the gun accidentally went off into the floor."" There're a lot of shootings where no one even got shot! But it pumps up the stats.",2021-02-02T17:03:08Z,0

It's also a means of avoiding answering the question, giving her time to create a suitable lie.  She is so obviously lying.  The signs and the blatant tells...anyone could read her.  She was, without a doubt, the abuser in  the relationship.  I'm not sure if she's a narcissist, but her arrogance and superiority complex are evident.  She's probably just not too confident in outright lying to the lawyers because the situation is stressful.  She is bored and a bit anxious but not so much that she acts panicky, like a cornered mouse.  It's more like annoyance, as in 'How dare you harass me with the same questions over and over!  I'm the victim, dammit!!'

2012,Ugzyo95loM3ini7nFRB4AaABAg,Luminatrix FanFiction,"@il Not strictly true. The reason Johnny lost was because the Judge was biased in favor of Amber Turd due to three things. 

Conflict of interest... For example, the judge's son is affiliated with the Sun's writer who wrote that defamatory article....or the judge's wife who happens to be a woman's equal rights activist and a feminist who affiliates with the #MeToo. This is all you need to know: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camilla_Palmer ""Women's Equality Network"" - Camilla Palmer who happens to be married to Justice Andrew Nicol, is a woman's equal rights activist. Lastly, Camilla Palma attended an event woman's equality function back in 2016 where Amber Heard also attended, so they know each other. 
 
That judge was biased from the start and compromised because his wife is essentially a feminist who had met Amber Heard. If the Judge ruled in favor of Johnny, he could have found himself being kicked out of his house and on the curb by his wife. Meaning that he should have recused himself. This particular judge was always going to ignore the evidence and admissions.

Johnny already proved in both the depositions and affidavit witness testimonies that he was innocent, and proved that Amber was in fact the abuser. So he already brought the burden of proof to court.",2020-12-30T06:44:07Z,11

Anyways, I see a lot of her in him and it's easier to detect now that I've lived it. 14 years with him, now he's married to the home wrecker.

2167,UgwpUUTjsyZ3wS2zJCJ4AaABAg,Shawn McNulty,@Philin yeah i agree. It’s both sides problem. I think the other side didn’t object because they knew it would make her look bad. I have no idea why her own lawyer didn’t stop her. Although this seems to be only a part of the depo. There is a strong chance that after a break he did tell her and she didn’t do it again.

2173,Ugy1O_UnHhxofh4xn5Z4AaABAg,Bratist,"This isn't a Me Too era issue. This is simply an issue that's been going on for ages because ""men stronger than women, how can women abuse men?!?!?!?!""

Same thing happened to my dad when I was in high school (2012/2013). His abusive wife of the time claimed he was the one abusing her and we were instantly kicked out of the place we'd called our home for 2 and a half years by the police. By we, I'm referring to my father, myself (16/17 at the time) and my little brother (12/13 at the time). We were given 20 minutes to pack clothes and leave. Spent a month living in a motel room because we had nowhere to go (All family lived out of state) and we weren't allowed to get any of our things until the court date because she had a restraining order against him. Hell, my school knew all about the situation because the guidance counselor had to drive me to the motel after school as no buses went by there (obviously) and my dad was usually at work when school let out.
The one time we did try to pick up some more clothes, I called the officer assigned to the case and was told my brother and I legally could live with her because it was legally our home. She was not allowed to refuse us entry. Just my dad couldn't enter. I convinced my dad to drop us off at the end of the road and let my brother and I go to the house and pick up some more clothes, as the officer assured me was my right. She called the cops on us. Then when she was told she HAD to let us in, she told the officer that my dad was buying me cigarettes.
The case was thrown out because both filed for divorce and both lawyers just wanted that to be the end. Amusingly enough, HER lawyer walked my dad and me to our car after the judge's ruling of ""congrats, you're divorced, you got two days to get your shit"" and was apologizing for the two years we spent living with her. He apparently did not like her and made the comment of ""I'm friends with her dad, but it's clear the apple fell far from the tree."" He insinuated that he would not have fought very hard for her if it'd gone fully before the judge. I guess when your client walks into court laughing with her daughter while the opposition is sitting in traumatized silence and tears kinda says all you need to know about the situation at hand.

Sorry if I rambled on, I just get frustrated with cases like this. It hits close to home. Just seeing Heard's fucking face acting so nonchalant when she was the ""abused one"" while Johnny is clearly trying to rationalize everything that happened to him.",2020-11-23T13:40:54Z,2

2253,UgyrqYlV5-Ajd7qeqcV4AaABAg,Keerya,"No, this is normal. Here's why :
My mom is an elementary teacher. Long story short, a few students' parents where accusing some staff of things, my mom intervened to defend them and the staff used this as an opportunity to shift the blame to her, accusing her of being violent.

Now to the question ""did you grab a child by the shoulder and and shook him while screaming ?""
She answered ""yes"". Just a plain old yes. It was a yes or no question after all.
But this yes do paint her as a violent person who shouldn't be near children. 

The truth to the story is that the child was endangering his classmates by playing with scissors and almost stabbed another kid in the eye even though my mom had told him to stop what he was doing.

Add a few more questions like this (well, less dramatic ones) where she admitted to actions she did but never gave context because it was yes or no questions. 
With her colleagues lying and omitting half the stories, the parents angry, the inexperienced director who called inspection before investigating if there was any truth in the claims.

And bam. You have an innocent forced to resign because the truth made them look super guilty.

In conclusion, never answer a yes or no question by yes or no when defending yourself.
It's usually better to give context. Because you never know what have been said in your back and if the person you are talking to is aware of the full story, or if they will even ask about the full story. You could answer yes or no thinking they'll ask for details and when they don't it's too late and everyone have made up their mind while you lost the opportunity to defend yourself.",2020-11-25T07:13:04Z,0

2441,UgxDdpsBDVutxOKWMbV4AaABAg,Christian One,@Niki Bechus Well... That's the beauty of covert narcissism... They never have to be physically abusive or outwardly aggressive.  I believe Wynona Ryder just recently came out saying she checked herself into a psych ward after their relationship.  There had been a big age difference between them and she was underage when they started dating.  So she could have been manipulated in all kinds of ways never realizing Johnny was pulling the strings.,2020-10-20T21:09:23Z,1
2442,UgxDdpsBDVutxOKWMbV4AaABAg,Niki Bechus,"@Christian One If he was a Covert Narcissist I doubt his ex partners Vanessa Paradis whom he dumped for AH or his other long term partner Wyona Ryder, would have made the legal under oath statements they both voluntary did. 
These documents were presented to the Judge who presided over JD & AH's divorce case. 
They stated that JD was never violent or aggressive towards them or anyone else they were ever aware of in the 20+ years they collectively shared with him. 
In this very video it states his housekeeper has been working for him for 30 years. 
His bodyguards have also been around for long periods of time however as stated in this video when AH came on the scene JD's longterm  bodyguard] resigned and moved on. 
These are alll markers of a mentally  healthy individual not a Covert Narcissist.
AH who is very likely a Malignant Narcissist would've made sure she chose an empath or someone with a good moral compass & sense of decency. These are the type of partners she was well aware could be manipulated & dominated, not another Narcissist . 
The court case in the UK was about an article the Sun newspaper wrote slating JK Rowling's for still allowing JD a staring role for the second time in her movie franchise.
She stuck by her choice & didn't fold to the negative onslaught of people wanting JD fired like happened with his Jack Sparrow role. 
She obviously had gotten to know JD personally & respected him not playing into & believing all the lies.

2501,UgwTaQexepfR4Migsll4AaABAg,Ethan Poole,"Stacy Zoloft is also used for treating anxiety as a far safer alternative to Xanax and benzodiazepines (which can be highly addictive and difficult to discontinue), but I do believe she was referring to Xanax as Zoloft is a slow acting and long term medication (an SSRI/antidepressant, but taken at lower doses than for depression) whereas Xanax is fast acting for breakthrough anxiety.  Having a history of extensive abuse throughout adolescence and being a victim of domestic violence in my early 20s (even 26 years later I have never pursued another relationship or dated since as I can not trust others anymore, it makes for a very lonely life as an adult as it equally limits friendships) I take Zoloft to help with the severe anxiety and muscle armoring that come with Complex PTSD (plus Avoidant PD) as Xanax really isn’t safe for long term chronic anxiety.",2020-10-02T09:56:59Z,1

No she doesn’t laugh at the end of the unedited video. She lets out something like a “huh” but that’s  a common verbal release that can mean a lot of things,  or nothing but it’s absolutely not laughter .  Again, you aren’t seen got hearing what’s actually there

His mom was an abuser, she was a thrower. ""My mom was may be the meanest human being I've ever met.""(rolling stone interview) but he says he worshipped her. This could be the reason why johnny allowed amber to treat him the way that she treated him. I wonder whether he subconsciously thought amber loves me and that's why she's behaving like this because my mom loved me but she treated me in a very similar way. There are text messages of johnny with amber's parents after last phone incident, where he does talk about how he worshipped amber and how he would've done anything for her. He was deeply in love with her. A psychologist in her channel 'live abuse free' did a video relating this topic.",2020-09-17T15:22:20Z,0

When your brain is done analyzing things like that, it starts to protect itself from the bad effects of those memories.  Some people forget it altogether, some will refuse to talk so as not to put themselves in that mindset, others pick it apart for analysis as closure that nothing could be done about the situation.  I don't know of any studies so this information is by no means scientific, but of all the people I know that admitted to picking apart their trauma like I did, they chose to talk about the situation like a bad in-joke.  Some of us just laugh at our bad situations because the only other alternative for us is to just break down crying or screaming.  Those things just leave you exhausted.",2020-09-16T16:30:24Z,1
2706,UgwuDfHgzvrOwg9J7nt4AaABAg,J A,"Johnny always has a little half smirk when he is talking and he does stutter in interviews. You really can’t read into it. This really has more to do with the evidence in their case. Amber has been caught in too many lies. She is very insecure in her relationships. I honestly believe that is why she is controlling and manipulates others. 

She has made it harder for women who have been abused and at the same time brought forth more awareness of men being abused in relationships.  

She had an agenda when she married Depp. Her greed of money and fame. I don’t know for sure but it seem as though she was pushing him to the edge mentally too. Another year of it and I believe the abuse would have killed him. He looks healthier now that they are no longer together.",2020-09-16T14:26:52Z,0

Diclaimer: i know i'm primed from the start of the video and previous knowledge, but i can still be affected by fake emotions if convincing enough. Take the video about the couple that adopted then dropped a kid because of his needs (on this channel). When they fake cried i felt nothing. When the same thing was done by the analyst (absolutely horrible with names), i immediately felt an empathetic response.

Testing out on my own face, my duper's delight involves pulling back the corner of my mouth while also pulling at the upper lip. Like a snear rather than a smirk. Mine also feels a lot smaller, more centered around my moth rather than along the cheek. Obviously this is just me and everyone's duper delight smile will be different.",2020-09-14T05:07:12Z,8

I had a male friend during high school who was a model and unfortunately he was the stereotypical ""dumb model"". He often lied on things he did and places he went to. When I entered university I came across him working the cash register at a supermarket, which I have nothing against. But he said that he went to another certain university, and the timeline didn't add up one bit. Whenever he lied he always did this little chuckle right after saying it.
These sort of people actually think people are too dumb to see through them, just like Amber Turd who admits to everything in court then denies it literally 5 seconds later. She even annoyed the judge in the UK.",2020-09-16T11:44:58Z,5

You cannot keep up the facade forever and remember everything you need to do to play the part when life throws things at you, so i would guess that the clip was genuine, especially since amber seemed to expect the submissive behavior. As for the interviews, well, it's a stress filled situation and people don't always behave  the way you would expect when stressed.

Anyone who abuses anyone in a relationship and can gaslight people or manipulate them is awful. But it is always a tricky situation. However it’s good to be aware of things and yet still be able to formulate an opinion. 

Sorry if it sounds like I’m rambling, this particular situation always struck a personal chord with me so I know where my biases lie and I can get emotional over this type of stuff. Either way I hope you two are having a great day/evening.",2020-09-14T04:57:18Z,1

Yes peoples actions need to be isolated alone, her hitting may be wrong but if she was genuinely trying to get away from him or defend her sister it’s a different stories.

It’s the fact that she’s a double faced bitch. Gold digger. Couldn’t get away with Depp’s money.. she immediately went for Elon. And he didn’t fall for it. Hence a lot of people where warning Elon how crazy Amber was. Hence he immediately broke up. Sucks for her.. she was telling everyone that she wanted to Marry him. All for his money of course.

You’d belive anything coming from her. Like I said, she could be recorded punching him.. and you’d still defend and place her as a victim. 

Also she just recently, just yesterday, filed for the case to be dismissed again. 5th time she’s attempted to dismiss the case or dismiss some of Depp’s proof to the court. She whined about Depp’s attorney leaking information without providing it to Heard. (That leaked  video where she is smirking and chuckling) To Amber. How ridiculous. He wasn't even the one to publish it; Nick Wallis was. A reporter. And it was provided to Wallis by the UK courts.

And what does she do? Whine and play the victim act. 

This is HER video, a video SHE recorded. there and SHE complains that Depp’s attorney didn't provide HER OWN video proof to show to court .. to HER? really?!?
