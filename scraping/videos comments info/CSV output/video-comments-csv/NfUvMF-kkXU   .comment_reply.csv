Unfortunately, you know that women can’t possibly defend themselves properly against a man, so end up with a higher rate of injury. It doesn’t mean that the abuse is any less devastating though. And, unfortunately, men have no resources for support in such situations. They’re literally stuck in their misery because they fear ridicule, and the loss of their children, which is often used as a pawn to make the man stay. They also know that the woman is automatically believed by most, and the family courts are in their favour. Feminists seem to ignore these inconsistencies in equality. It’s female privilege to have such support. Men have none.",2020-02-02T18:30:23Z,0

True humility, imo, is an ACTUAL Awareness of alllll aspects of oneself.  Awareness of one's weaknesses/limitations/faults Annnnnnnd🎶 strengths/intelligences/talents.  Now, you worked hard & spent tiiiiiime(which this world equates with money!) on a rendition of calculations MOST Find Less Than EASY to accomplish -let alone have the passion to do it all on their own, with no training nor pay involved.
It's impressive.
And nothing to NOT be Pleased with/""proud"" of.

You did excellent work, and you were pleased with the results.

No need for extra humility, imo, I mean, you didn't brag even once -that I noticed. (Granted, I wasn't observing for the purpose of determining whether you were bragging or not, so I admit I could have missed something, but I'm pretty sure that vibe would've turned me off to your style & I wouldn't have ""enjoyed"" watching your mind play out so simply/brilliantly.

Just sayin'.

Keep being brilliant, dedicated, humble.....
Just remember ""my"" version of True Humility, yes??  It's great for when people try to subtly knock you down for being naturally satisfied/pleased with an accomplishment of your own making/time/effort.

It's okay for us humans to be pleased by ourselves sometimes.

88,UgwNaqgOyNRxU0xpyNZ4AaABAg,Jennifer Taylor,"I edited the above, your right Johnny said Raquel was not there ( as far as he knew just because he didn’t see doesn’t mean she wasn’t there) 
the Body guards were outside if the girl went to the apartment why would she not ask them for help if someone was in danger ?   
Why in the Hell didn’t Amber go to the door and ask for help or scream for them to help ?  What did she think some tiny ass woman was going to do. The body guards even though they worked for Johnny would not let him beat her up if it had been true. 
I think Raquel was hiding possibly  just because Amber says she sent Raquel a text doesn’t mean she did and the other girl is going along with everything else. Why should we believe them.  Where is the text message ? 
Why would Johnny lock the door to his apartment if his body guards were outside and he was only there to pick up a few items and leave ( 30 minutes) ?  
And if the Body guards didn’t see Raquel enter and the door was supposedly locked then how did they rush in when Amber started screaming stop hitting me Johnny?  
Did they break the door down( not in the photos)  I don’t think Raquel got the text and came over she was already  there the door wasn’t locked. Another lie between Amber and Raquel not surprised. 😮 

plus the police never saw any broken glass and no bruises, swelling or marks on Ambers face. She told them nothing happened ( the truth ) There was no evidence of anything smashed in the hallway. And there were two filled glasses of wine. I guess Johnny poured a glass for himself and Amber after he locked the door and before allegedly beating her up and smashing everything in a heated argument when he was only going to be there for 30 minutes. 
But according to Amber the Body guards, police and everyone else is lying to protect Johnny except her and Raquel even Johnnys ex’s who
Have said he is not violent. And we clearly know Amber has a history of violence.",2019-03-24T23:50:56Z,6

Her hairstyle, the tee, the earclips, the mark under the eye are the same, as far as I can tell.

96,UgxHYg3WL1WgMC-bhSJ4AaABAg,MackLyon,Johnny’s seen these videos (or at least 1). He’s following him on Instagram.,2020-12-12T19:34:05Z,1
97,UgxHYg3WL1WgMC-bhSJ4AaABAg,Julie Fisk,"@Debbie California the day he was slamming was the day he found out his business partners lost 650 million dollars, his mother had died a few days before. But either way you are absolutely right in that, she tried to set him up and failed. TMZ has yet to issue an apology to Mr. Depp about the release of that video, they cut out so much of it, where she it up and then where he walks out and she is caught laughing and smirking into the camera. I believe she and her dirty friends tried to set him up. I really do. Why would she need to have all of them around, all the time, living on his dime??? She is a dirty, low down, evil, devil in disguise. I hope that Mr. Depp wins his libel case in the U.K. then Virginia, then comes after TMZ, and the rest of them. There is also a text conversation with photos between a.h. and her friends husband about ""showing"" Mr. Depp some knives during a ""talk"" she's going to have with him. Then they can all have dinner. Its super creepy and I wish it would have been brought up at the trial. The guy who did it is usually very reputable",2020-09-12T03:19:21Z,1
98,UgxHYg3WL1WgMC-bhSJ4AaABAg,Debbie California,"I was in an abusive relationship (he eventually went to jail over it), so I knew from the beginning she was lying. The day his mother died he was taped (by Scamber) slamming cupboards. Like “WOW”, right? She was clearly trying to bait him in the TMZ video that broke this story. I don’t know about you but when I was going through REAL abuse I would never have openly video taped him being abusive. I KNOW what would have happened if caught doing that. This story is terribly sad that a guy pleading with her to “not go public because he loves her and knows what will happen to BOTH of them”. Again. I don’t know about you but MY abuser would never, and NEVER DID say ANYTHING even remotely caring to me about our divorce. The entire story makes NO REAL sense when you’ve been through it yourself.",2020-07-05T04:20:11Z,0
