We dont know them personally and most times things are not as they seem. Like for example we know Johnny was also druk a lot, a lot of people change when they drink. This is why I think theyâ€™re shouldnâ€™t be a witch-hunt against Amber nor Johnnh.",2021-02-20T15:00:46Z,0

18,UgzETkVYb2qx7jHW4Ah4AaABAg,Nick,@Freedom Fighter heard is significantly worse for business now that everyone knows she was the main abuser and the evidence is public. I can't see her getting any major roles after her current contacts are up.,2020-12-08T21:16:09Z,0
19,UgzETkVYb2qx7jHW4Ah4AaABAg,Nick,@nonogimme theres an audio recording of heard saying she was the one punching depp. At the very least they are both abusive. Depp potentially was only acting in self defense,2020-12-08T21:14:25Z,0
20,UgzETkVYb2qx7jHW4Ah4AaABAg,Satan's PR Guy,"@nonogimme OK firstly I'm not a huge Depp fan, so you can throw that nonsense argument away.  

Secondly, let me clarify before you accuse me of anything else, this is not about ""not believing"" victims, especially just because they are women.  This is about taking every abuse allegation seriously and coming to conclusions based upon evidence. That is how the system is supposed to work.  You shouldn't believe anyone.  You treat everyone's allegation and defence with respect.  When the world sees justice go out the window then people need to speak up, otherwise going forward it is the real victims of domestic abuse that will suffer.  

It doesn't matter if the victim is male or female, that's the point. A victim is a victim and it is the liars who make a mockery of real victims, not the people who call them out!! 

The truth is a lot of people have followed this case very closely and the trial itself.

You should read the judgement, it's just full of assumptions and concluded based almost solely on Amber's statement without any corroborating evidence other than her sister's statement, although she was pulled apart in the witness box and it became clear that she was an unreliable witness.

You want to know about blatant lying, OK.  Her evidence included her statement, the statement of her sister, pictures of him drunk and a video of him being angry with cupboards. 

Depp's evidence included witnesses who have seen her violent behaviour, witnesses who claim that she never had bruising when she said she did (including the police), a statement from her employee that said Amber stole her own abuse stories.  Security who had to remove Depp when Amber was getting violent.  Let's not forget the recordings she Depp obtained where Amber was exhibiting all the signs of an abusive partner.  She admitted hitting him, mocked him for thinking a court would believe he was abused by a woman, love-bombed him and then would lose it whenever he tried to calm the conversation.  Called him a coward for removing himself from fights. 

Let's not forget that he has years of gentlemanly behaviour with previous girlfriends, whereas Amber couldn't get anyone to speak for her and she has been arrested for domestic abuse before.  She claims she was exonerated, but that is not the case.  In domestic abuse cases, they often get dropped because partners aren't willing to provide a statement for a number of reasons.  Forgiveness, fear of repercussions etc. 

Well there is plenty more to go over, but I'm not some chump who doesn't know what he's talking about.  I care about victims and justice.  At this point, the only justice will be found by those who are willing to avoid her work, removing money from her employers.  Depp has certainly suffered enough.

Maybe you could look into this further and you'll realise the justice system is not perfect, but attacking my reasoning and justification? You're out of your depth",2020-11-24T17:38:41Z,1
