When people make comments like what the OP said it tends to inadvertently confirm those suspicions despite the fact that they were talking about general crime which isn't sex dependant. That's what I was implying with my response. I will edit my original comment to at least reflect that.

82,UgycmKK6o_8DTF4ajOd4AaABAg,karla roh,"@*Noir Maria* I've just watched another doc by JCS, this time about Casey Anthony -- when I listened to the recordings of her voice, I could actually hear Heard >> the same tone, rhythm, emphasis on certain words, the verbal and emotional outburst whenever she felt pressured..... only Heard is, to me, so emotionally unstable and mixing that with poor acting that the fact she's a pathological liar might be harder to decipher for people who have no experience with characters like that. By the way regarding the trauma & memory -- from my own experience, I don't remember the details, but I do remember the chronological order and I remember how I felt or what was done to me.. because I felt the effects of it.. so for instance my brain pushed out the verbal abuse, like I don't remember what was said first and how, I only remember a few words, but I do remember my emotional reactions to that abuse, how exactly I felt, and I remember the aftermath. I feel like there's a block whenever I think of that incident, but I can answer questions without changing the scenario because I know the truth. I believe that there are many degrees of amnesia following a traumatizing incident, but I also believe that Heard cannot just do both -- remember details of one thing and claiming she has amnesia regarding other things when she is asked about the same moment. It's ridiculous that she wouldn't remember how she got up off the floor but somehow remembers that the phone is on the floor.. which by the way we're still waiting for the info where the phone was.",2021-02-10T18:01:20Z,2

But i couldn‚Äôt dodge it was too quick, I just blocked and she literally hit her face into my hand. It happened very quickly. So ya that‚Äôs the exact detail of how it happened.

With their under developed brains and such.  Those babies being slapped, and shaken around by their mothers and fathers for crying too loud are just supposed to walk out of the door because it is their life and decision that their parents did that to them. And when they do say anything, they are either abused more, or taken away and get put in the system. Not knowing if they will be placed with a better family or not, carrying that trauma of their parents abuse with them for the rest of their life. Asking themselves if they really deserved it or not.  Because mental health and the human brain is totally not complex or anything. But it looks like you have life figured out, and know exactly how to end world abuse, murder, trauma, and mental health issues.   But to concur with your statement, yes, a full grown adult should make the decision for themselves whether to stay or leave once having been abused once. Anything after that is them choosing not to leave. But it is not like they went into the relationship hoping to be abused by their  partner they thought they could trust.

It also takes being comfortable with moving about and stuff and no one explains what happened to them like this with any level of feeling comfortable. I also find they don‚Äôt stutter as much as they more take pauses because they struggle to think about the situation and it causes blanks for a second and you have to regather your thoughts.

There are some movements that are pacifiers, the person does it instinctively when they're nervous but you have to notice if the person already does this naturally or started to do it now. So it's basically some change in their body language and movements that don't  match what they're saying, like saying yes and your head lightly moving like a no. These actions are considered signs of dissimulation according to the SCAns(Six Channel Analysis) protocol. Also, there's FACS system, only face analysis to interpret expressions and micromovements of the face and their meanings, like anger, fear, sadness and so on.",2020-07-16T21:45:14Z,1

However, Amber Heard is an extremely toxic case where she uses her white femininity and constant liberal online persona as a way to excuse her abusive behaviors.

Look I‚Äôm not saying what happened to you isn‚Äôt true but what happened to amber is far from the truth. I grew up in a Violence ridden household that of which was mainly cause by my own sister. I saw a woman cry on cue, I saw a woman who could easily flip a story so quick In her favor against my own father. Now do more digging and you‚Äôll see her story does not match up whatsoever. If you‚Äôve ever been a in physical altercation you know things tend to slow down. You‚Äôll notice the smallest thing and remember the most odd points of that instance.. it‚Äôs weird just because she says idk Um I‚Äôm not sure I don‚Äôt remember is a credible statement at all. Courts don‚Äôt go off based off hearsay.. evidence speaks volume. The way both of their stories are recounted it‚Äôs easy to side with Johnny.. clear cut statements very little stumbling while recounting different instances.. I‚Äôm sorry but THE LAW DOES NOT STOP WHERE YOUR FEELINGS BEGIN. there has to be accurate proof and most of it is in johnnys favor.. think about how unfair it is that Johnny has to disclose every single bad deed he‚Äôs done and his evidence is given out to the public yet amber is allowed to present various articles behind closed doors... how is this fair? This is not only favoritism to amber turd but a bigger injustice to Johnny. Women can be the biggest and dirtiest liars playing victim and acting the role of a hurt woman when y‚Äôall bitches be preaching about equality.. she needs to dragged publicly and exposed for her lies.

Now imagine you dont know her behavior before, so you meet her, she is this beautiful sweet girl and shows you that she has a good personality.  You wouldnt belive such a girl can be so good. So Amber acted good and made Johnny love her, she was playing the game, manipulating him, until she got him under her power,  she started showing her real color, (because trust me, if someone acts fake, that womt last longer, they will eventually shows their true color). After the abuser knows you love them, they will abuse you and all you can hope is that one day they will change and be as you met them. They will still use you but you are too weak to leave, you see how beautiful they re, how good sex they give you, how peaceful they are with you soemtimes, you even forget that they can kill you.

Then they married.. It impresses me why she would do this since she did not do it for the money. Soooo she did it for his attention then? I can only imagine that if thats the case she must be psychologically damaged. Its sad. Damn i feel sad for him. If that's the case. I fully get u. In fact my ex was no angel and my entire friends and fsmily felt his aggression constantly even towsrds them. My mom was scared of him so yeah i might be completely mistaken this. Thank u for clarifying,2020-04-25T08:58:36Z,0
798,Ugx5qsXGEV6iRF5fbch4AaABAg,truthseeker,"Well, I'm very sorry to hear that. That is horrible what you went through. I'm glad you are better now. However, Depp has evidence to back up his claims.
1. Amber Heard claims she had visible, extensive, easy to spot injuries (e.g. broken nose, split lip) on multiple occasions. Her friend, stylist, assistant, bodyguards, building employees and estate managers all say those injuries were not there.
2. Amber Heard claimed there was extensive property damage. Again, witnesses say it was not there.
3. People witnessed Amber attacking Depp on multiple occasions, both verbally and physically. He also has medical records. She, however, was uninjured in all these occasions.
4. Her assistant says that when she first met Depp, Heard started to mimic his style in furniture, clothing and everything else. She also said that Amber was controlling and paranoid and regularly went through his phone and asked her assistant who the people Johnny was talking to were. She also controlled what he could drink. She isolated him from his friends and they lived in an apartment surrounded by her friends. After they broke up, she kept trying to send him notes and even wish him a happy birthday over a year later.
5. She has tried to claim that Depp is crazy and even tried to have him undergo a mental health evaluation with a doctor of her choice for the defamation trial. The judge denied her request.
6. If you listen to the full conversation between them, you can hear lots of tactics narcissistic abusers use. She lovebombs him, word salads and gaslight him. All the tapes except for the phone call were recorded by her.
7. The taped conversations include confessions of physical violence. She admits to throwing pots, pans and vases at him and says that is ""irrelevant"" when he brings it up. She attacked him while he was lying on the bed watching TV because he had been over a friend's house for ""too long"". She kicked a door into his face and punched him in the jaw when he was trying to hide in a bathroom from her. She hit him and threw bottles at him, one of which cut off the tip of his finger and shattered the bone. She has always claimed that the only time she ever hit him was in defence of her sister. This is clearly a lie. She has also claimed that he cut off his finger himself with a plastic phone whilst attacking her. The trouble is that she is on tape admitting to doing it and that witnesses say that she was not injured the way she claims she was after that incident.",2020-04-25T05:49:27Z,1
