101,UgzaIZKk2zo23bAUkl94AaABAg,DJ Kav,"@Mamouillette n#1 Perjury is quite rare. It has to be extremely serious, probably deliberately lying on the stand (in the dock), to persuade the outcome of a serious criminal trial. 

In this case, I don't think anything will be followed up. As criminal matters are reported to the police by someone. Who then follow up by investigation. The police then decide if it should be passed on to the CPS (Crown Prosecution Service). The CPS are the solely responsible, to decide if a criminal case, would be in the public interest to go ahead, or if the there is sufficient evidence of a successful prosecution, as it's UK tax payers money used.",2020-07-23T21:18:03Z,1
102,UgzaIZKk2zo23bAUkl94AaABAg,DJ Kav,"@Mamouillette n#1 Perjury is a criminal case. It would have to go back to the CPS, get the police involved if required. 

We have two court systems here in the UK, the criminal and civil.

Civil: 
County Court -> High Court -> Court of Appeals -> Supreme Court

Criminal:
Magistrates Court -> Crown Court -> Court of Appeals -> Supreme Court

The Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court are the same, for civil and criminal, as they're the 2nd and 1st highest courts, in the UK.

If a criminal act occurs within a civil case, it will trigger a separate criminal investigation, and would have to enter the criminal court system.",2020-07-23T19:59:00Z,2

I‚Äôm very, very sad that the phrase ‚Äúbelieve women‚Äù has been twisted into something else.
It doesn‚Äôt actually mean that you believe women no matter the facts. That phrase just meant that when a woman says she was raped or sexually assaulted, people need to stop dismissing their claims automatically. Because that‚Äôs what has happened for all of history. People always assumed that the woman asked for it in some way. 
But now people with agendas have twisted the phrase. And too many men are believing that feminists are woman haters and men are the real victims.
The truth is that women are still the main victims. There are men who are falsely accused of assault or rape, like Johnny. But I don‚Äôt know one man, personally, who has been falsely accused. Yet almost every woman I know has been sexually assaulted, myself included.
To be clear I‚Äôm not saying abuse of men should be ignored.
You mentioned your son being afraid. But I‚Äôm much more worried for my daughter getting sexually assaulted than my son getting falsely accused.

I hate injustice and I believe all of you feel the same. TBH I believed Scamber Turd when she made the allegation. But when the audio leaked came out I went to Johnny Depp's side.

As this scandal goes further, JD's ex defended him and the people who JD have close relationship with him said good things about him.

This is contrary to Ms. Turd. Those who worked for her went to JD's defense.
