THERE are always two sides to a story. However there is a good amount of evidence to show that she was the nasty nasty.
I think it is going to affect how both are viewed in public eye 100%
But ya know what I hated her in aquaman and this was before all this, I don't enjoy her as an actress tbh. I think she should be a model and fashion person. Not necessarily an actor she isn't a good actor regardless. I think she is cool looking and is naturally attractive...but I would be so glad if she wasnt in any more movies really unless shes playing someone nasty perhaps a grittier role, I really liked the aquaman film but she ruined it a good bit for me acting wise casting choice wise....",Wolf Moon,0,2020-08-20T01:32:30Z

266,UgxoYyxC8pJedJ-65FZ4AaABAg,Johnny Depp has done alot for men falsely accused but also alot for men who are abused.  I understand why he did not speak out in the early days even when he was not proven guilty of anything. He is private and just wanted to move on.  However thank goodness he had just had enough.  It must have made him sick seeing her as a spokesperson for metoo and never being able to remove the stain from his reputation and thank goodness he finally came forward to show the truth.  I was always really dubious about the whole thing even  right at the beginning when people were jumping on the bandwagon.  So many apologies are owed to that man and although this is not over yet I hope he can finally be happy again after clearing his name.  He could be a spokesperson for men who are victims of domestic abuse. His is such a classic case and it is great that his story has brought more awareness to this.  So I am happy for him personally but also for all those men who have dealt with domestic abuse.,L Mac,3,2020-06-25T14:39:08Z

Amber Heard: I spoke up against sexual violence ‚Äî and faced our culture‚Äôs wrath. That has to change.





By Amber Heard¬†

Dec. 18, 2018 at 3:58 p.m. MST

Amber Heard is an actress and ambassador on women‚Äôs rights at the American Civil Liberties Union.

I was exposed to abuse at a very young age. I knew certain things early on, without ever having to be told. I knew that men have the power ‚Äî physically, socially and financially ‚Äî and that a lot of institutions support that arrangement. I knew this long before I had the words to articulate it, and I bet you learned it young, too.

Like many women, I had been harassed and sexually assaulted by the time I was of college age. But I kept quiet ‚Äî I did not expect filing complaints to bring justice. And I didn‚Äôt see myself as a victim.

Then two years ago, I became a public figure representing domestic abuse, and I felt the full force of our culture‚Äôs wrath for women who speak out.



Friends and advisers told me I would never again work as an actress ‚Äî that I would be blacklisted. A movie I was attached to recast my role. I had just shot a two-year campaign as the face of a global fashion brand, and the company dropped me. Questions arose as to whether I would be able to keep my role of Mera in the movies ‚ÄúJustice League‚Äù and ‚ÄúAquaman.‚Äù





I had the rare vantage point of seeing, in real time, how institutions protect men accused of abuse.

Imagine a powerful man as a ship, like the Titanic. That ship is a huge enterprise. When it strikes an iceberg, there are a lot of people on board desperate to patch up holes ‚Äî not because they believe in or even care about the ship, but because their own fates depend on the enterprise.



In recent years, the #MeToo movement has taught us about how power like this works, not just in Hollywood but in all kinds of institutions ‚Äî workplaces, places of worship or simply in particular communities. In every walk of life, women are confronting these men who are buoyed by social, economic and cultural power. And these institutions are beginning to change.

We are in a transformative political moment. The president of our country has been accused by more than a dozen women of sexual misconduct, including assault and harassment. Outrage over his statements and behavior has energized a female-led opposition. #MeToo started a conversation about just how profoundly sexual violence affects women in every area of our lives. And last month, more women were elected to Congress than ever in our history, with a mandate to take women‚Äôs issues seriously. Women‚Äôs rage and determination to end sexual violence are turning into a political force.





We have an opening now to bolster and build institutions protective of women. For starters, Congress can reauthorize and strengthen the Violence Against Women Act. First passed in 1994, the act is one of the most effective pieces of legislation enacted to fight domestic violence and sexual assault. It creates support systems for people who report abuse, and provides funding for rape crisis centers, legal assistance programs and other critical services. It improves responses by law enforcement, and it prohibits discrimination against LGBTQ survivors. Funding for the act expired in September and has only been temporarily extended.



We should continue to fight sexual assault on college campuses, while simultaneously insisting on fair processes for adjudicating complaints. Last month, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos proposed changes to Title IX rules governing the treatment of sexual harassment and assault in schools. While some changes would make the process for handling complaints more fair, others would weaken protections for sexual assault survivors. For example, the new rules would require schools to investigate only the most extreme complaints, and then only when they are made to designated officials. Women on campuses already have trouble coming forward about sexual violence ‚Äî why would we allow institutions to scale back supports?

I write this as a woman who had to change my phone number weekly because I was getting death threats. For months, I rarely left my apartment, and when I did, I was pursued by camera drones and photographers on foot, on motorcycles and in cars. Tabloid outlets that posted pictures of me spun them in a negative light. I felt as though I was on trial in the court of public opinion ‚Äî and my life and livelihood depended on myriad judgments far beyond my control.





I want to ensure that women who come forward to talk about violence receive more support. We are electing representatives who know how deeply we care about these issues. We can work together to demand changes to laws and rules and social norms ‚Äî and to right the imbalances that have shaped our lives.",The Amber Heard Playlist!!,0,2020-06-07T23:41:30Z

They deleted that, cause they knew that was nooooot smart, but then reposted it. And they're deleting comments regarding the issue, and STILL, the ratio of support/against the brand (and all sister companies) is 50-1 AT LEAST. And it seems to be the same 10/20 people commenting in support of the company over and over. And now they posted about the black lives matter movement, and a black ex-spokeswoman tweeted today how outrageous she was, cause she was fired for speaking against racism and white supremacy, and now Loreal pulls a ""we support black lives"" fuck that! Loreal only supports themselves. So yeah, we'll be boycotting thag shit company and their sister companies, as well as boycotting Aquaman 2 IF that abuser isn't fired. There are mountains and mountains of evidence on how SHE was the abusive person in the relationship, and in her deposition she tried to lie abou one of MANY incidents where she says she locked herself in a bathroom to run from Johnny,  but she wasn't aware the defense had the audio of her admition that it was JOHNNY inside the bathroom running from HER!
