35,UgxJv4s7V-78F2L3EWV4AaABAg,ArauJo Jhonatan,"While that's true, I think it is a recipe for shooting her own foot or, depending on the outcome of Aquaman 2, an effing rocket launcher.

If the film tanks, and I think it will, WB will probably notice that it was because of AH, and that will make her a ""black sheep"" of sorts in Hollywood. Now, I know Hollywood does not works like that, but in the remote possibility that they decide *some* level of income is needed to keep their glamorous lives going, no sane director would cast her. It is asking for your movie to flop. We'll see how much of a punch the fanbase can pack",2021-07-14T13:42:12Z,1

A company as powerful Warner Brothers could easily sweep it under the rug and make it and even him disappear. Firing him would've been very easy if not for all the people who were outraged by their callous actions. He has been a mega star since the 90's and alot of us grew up with him as a major talent.

They reshot all of the scenes with Kevin Spacey to replace him in ""all the money in the world"" they also replaced the actor in ""army of the dead"" AFTER shooting wrapped. My issue is they fired Depp and won't hire him but Heard is still getting hired when she is also potentially guilty. Either fire BOTH or fire NEITHER it's the inequality and injustice towards Depp that is making her situation not great with millions signing petitions to have her fired. No one signed a petition to get Kevin Spacey fired and replaced but yet they realized it wasn't worth the risk keeping him in.
