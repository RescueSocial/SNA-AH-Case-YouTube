8,Ugx_dVRkwjlHkOQu7F94AaABAg,Susan Martin Tebbetts,"@JOHNNY DEPP I would like that awesome I have been a fan since 21 Jump Street which I know you aren't a fan of speaking of but that's how far back my fandom goes. I have enjoyed all your underrated. I loved the professor the movie had me laughing and tears. I found it amazing I loved The Libertines would have loved to have seen more of that movie. I don't know if anyone is pointed it out to you but while watching reruns of the TV show and some of your movies today, that is where a lot of your character acting began in the show. You're very talented I have a husband who likes to drink then smoke stuff. And he is the sweetest, calmest man. That's how I knew when all these allegations started it was false. I've been around enough people to know certain things affect people pretty much differently like alcohol. But other items usually just mellow the person out. And I would have been mad too if I lost as much money as you did. I was saddened at the loss of your mother. I am on Instagram",2021-03-17T13:21:41Z,0

Amber Heard is a terrible person for what she is doing to you. 
The truth will come out and Amber will never work in Hollywood again! She needs to be arrested for all her lies and trying to destroy an innocent mans career and reputation that he has spent his life making. She's a pathological liar, she hurt her ex partner and beat up her sister. She is the abuser!!!!

77,UgyWpdD0hHDw0M8OvG94AaABAg,Panthera,"ARE YOU STUPID OR SMART? 

ABOUT AMBER HEARD: Smart, talented, peaceful, good public speaker, presents herself really well and professionally, yet whilst in relationship with Johnny, videos appeared showing her with actual blueness around her eye from abuse, she started drinking despite her never drinking or binging, experienced physical and emotional harm, is from a good yet simple and peaceful family, advocated human and women rights and better lives for the people, was always friendly to millions of people and still is despite everything, cries out for help, shows what is going on and yet people do not seem to care what is what.

ABOUT JOHNNY DEPP: Very rich, good acting abilities (easy to fake something), dresses in expensive clothes yet often prefers a professional pirate's style, is aggressive and abusive (that is also known from his past relationship), has been shown in videos kicking furniture and damaging kitchen, throwing things around, shouting like crazy, created a lawsuit for $50mln against a woman who does not even dream about such money. 

WHO IS HERE TO BLAME AND WHAT IS HERE MORE IMPORTANT - TRUTH OR THE SUM????  ALSO, WHAT IS THE POINT OF THIS SCANDAL? TO COVER UP SOMETHING MAKING THEM TWO FIGHT EACH OTHER OR TO DRAG HER TO THE SEA WHILST IT IS OBVIOUS THAT SHE IS A GOOD AND PEACEFUL WOMAN FROM THE LAND?

All in all, I think that Amber Heard has a good and peaceful history for being a world's improver and an evolving woman with some life's challenges along the way in such complex times, whilst Johnny is known for arcades, battles, royales, not settling down, binging, not solving past problems...

WITH THIS EXPRESSED - AMBER HEARD WAS ABUSED, SHIED AWAY AND RETRACTED CHARGES, HE ATTACKED AND PUBLIC CHOOSES HIM DESPITE THE OBVIOUS EVIDENCE BECAUSE HE IS MORE FAMOUS, HAS BEEN RICHER FOR LONGER, HAS LOTS OF FANS OF WHOM MANY ARE DUMB ADVENTURE FANATICS NO MATTER WHAT. SO, WHAT IS THE ACTUAL TRUTH ABOUT THIS MATTER? WHO IS GUILTY AND FOR WHAT? ALSO, WHO IS NOT GUILTY AND WHY? THINK.... USE A PEN OR PENCIL AND PAPER IF YOU WANT TO DO SO. HELP TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM, THAT WILL HELP TO SOLVE YOUR OWN PROBLEMS OR TO HELP OTHERS SOONER OR LATER.",2021-05-08T21:42:26Z,0

This is why we only see a video of this incident because before this she figured she could milk him and also fool around due to him being away.

My five cents. I give a fcuk about how evil she is, her behavior will remain this way and thanks to how our current society is, we all are in chasing fame for five cents.

Can I then report her to the Police then?
You live in a strange country.
What do you do with surveillance cameras?
If I come to a friend, on his private land, can I say no, or does it only apply to his children?

180,UgwvH6NqZGC-Y0D1_zB4AaABAg,Panthera,"ARE YOU STUPID OR SMART? 

ABOUT AMBER HEARD: Smart, talented, peaceful, good public speaker, presents herself really well and professionally, yet whilst in relationship with Johnny, videos appeared showing her with actual blueness around her eye from abuse, she started drinking despite her never drinking or binging, experienced physical and emotional harm, is from a good yet simple and peaceful family, advocated human and women rights and better lives for the people, was always friendly to millions of people and still is despite everything, cries out for help, shows what is going on and yet people do not seem to care what is what.

ABOUT JOHNNY DEPP: Very rich, good acting abilities (easy to fake something), dresses in expensive clothes yet often prefers a professional pirate's style, is aggressive and abusive (that is also known from his past relationship), has been shown in videos kicking furniture and damaging kitchen, throwing things around, shouting like crazy, created a lawsuit for $50mln against a woman who does not even dream about such money. 

WHO IS HERE TO BLAME AND WHAT IS HERE MORE IMPORTANT - TRUTH OR THE SUM????  ALSO, WHAT IS THE POINT OF THIS SCANDAL? TO COVER UP SOMETHING MAKING THEM TWO FIGHT EACH OTHER OR TO DRAG HER TO THE SEA WHILST IT IS OBVIOUS THAT SHE IS A GOOD AND PEACEFUL WOMAN FROM THE LAND?

All in all, I think that Amber Heard has a good and peaceful history for being a world's improver and an evolving woman with some life's challenges along the way in such complex times, whilst Johnny is known for arcades, battles, royales, not settling down, binging, not solving past problems...

WITH THIS EXPRESSED - AMBER HEARD WAS ABUSED, SHIED AWAY AND RETRACTED CHARGES, HE ATTACKED AND PUBLIC CHOOSES HIM DESPITE THE OBVIOUS EVIDENCE BECAUSE HE IS MORE FAMOUS, HAS BEEN RICHER FOR LONGER, HAS LOTS OF FANS OF WHOM MANY ARE DUMB ADVENTURE FANATICS NO MATTER WHAT. SO, WHAT IS THE ACTUAL TRUTH ABOUT THIS MATTER? WHO IS GUILTY AND FOR WHAT? ALSO, WHO IS NOT GUILTY AND WHY? THINK.... USE A PEN OR PENCIL AND PAPER IF YOU WANT TO DO SO.

The meeting ended (he had told her that he had to have this meeting) he was late for her birthday party because of this. Time lines show he went straight back home. She in her statement said he was high and drunk, she was upset because he had missed her birthday for this meeting...

The anoint he poured was large, but he never picked up the bottle and took with the glass, he may have been getting as far from her as he could and wasn’t planning on keep popping back. Doesn’t even mean he drank it all. AH is a known wine drinker, it’s about time more of that and her drug taking is revealed. In UK court case she went out drinking clubbing (expensive club until very early hours) and reportedly left club with arms full of expensive wine bottles to take back to hotel.
