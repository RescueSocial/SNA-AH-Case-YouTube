I will not just avoid watching the film, but I will boycott it. It's not tolerable, when we know for certain that an actor is an aggressive physical and mental abuser, that that actor still keep the job. Not a man, nor a woman, not none!

22,Ugzyq-wUawVGIGxaVn94AaABAg,"What Amber said about being a woman and people not believing Depp is true.

Just look up the crime & conviction stats between men & women. Unless you have recorded evidence against a woman (and even that sometimes is moot), she‚Äôll ALWAYS get away with it. In a world of he said/she said, her word always trumps his.

This is why relationships are declining between the sexes - men are weighing the dangers of even associating women today. Movements like ‚ÄúHerbivores‚Äù in Japan and MGTOW in the west are a direct response to this.

Depp got off easily when compared to men like Brian Banks.",Resvrgam,11,2020-04-01T18:33:11Z

25,UgxDwfKS_fl33zDJ-ZF4AaABAg,"Amber Heard: Found guilty by her own recorded words of being a domestic abuser, lying about it FOR YEARS, blackmailing and gaslighting Johnny Depp and having legitimate Borderline Personality Disorder (in my unprofessional opinion): Gets to keep her job, and the silence is DEAFENING as there's not a single feminist peep.

Vic Mignogna & Johnny Depp: Accused of sexual misconduct/abuse with ZERO evidence, immediately fired from his job, and nearly had reputation and career destroyed by the Twitter SJW's as just one man of many wrongly accused.

Really highlights how fucking hypocritical and disgusting Hollywood is and social justice warriors in general.",Mcheetah,11,2020-04-01T17:24:43Z
