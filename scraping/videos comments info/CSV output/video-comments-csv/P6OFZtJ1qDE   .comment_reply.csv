60,UgzSuXJYrCirrTgV0hl4AaABAg,Shawna Conway,"Lol you got me there ü§£üòÇ.  I just really hope that false victims like AH start paying for their lies . I'm sorry it has to be Johnny, but at the same time no better soul to bring attention to the fact that MEN suffer from domestic abuse too. Maybe it will make it so men who are victims of abuse can start to speak up and get the same support and respect that women of domestic abuse do. Idiots like Kathy Griffen running her, ""This is controversial so I better say something stupid so I can get some press"" agenda cloud the waters. I'm a sister only to those who want true equality. If the fathers the better parent he should have custody. If she is abusing him he should be able to call the cops and not be asked stupid questions like ""She's tiny! You couldnt have stopped her?"" By the cops, and then get charged when he does. So glad I'm a woman for 1 reason, I'm not gay so I dont have to date them!!!",2020-07-14T07:42:39Z,0

She's had a number of small acting parts - though her acting is nothing really memorable, and now she thinks she's the best stand-up comedienne ever. She's arrogant, quite full of herself, and not very well liked among celebrities. Back in 2017, she did an artistic photograph about Donald Trump. Let's just say it was not well received when revealed to the public and she subsequently was fired from all of her jobs - except her comedy routine. Essentially, the public and Hollywood now view her as just a washed up wannabe from yesterday's boneyard, and she can't even tell a good joke. She literally destroyed her own career and reputation over night.",2020-07-14T06:19:37Z,2

What??!! Johnny's dumping me??!! Kicking me and my 6 freeloading friends out of HIS penthouse? Who does he think he is? I'm hot, he can't dump me! Plus my freeloading buddies need a place to stay (not his problem).. oh I'm pissed.. I'm gonna ruin that $%#@!!! Dumping me!! Yeah you're gonna regret this.. Careers over! Social lifes over! I'm clearing your bank accounts and taking your properties..
What's funny is if she was a good person she wouldn't have stalled before the wedding on signing the prenup. She stalled, said she forgot, till it was the wedding day and Johnny was like ""Okay but you'll sign the Postnup right (Same thing but after you wed).. she agreed only to attack him and his lawyer on the honeymoon when they brought the paperwork for her to sign.. she flipped out. This is what lead to his finger being chopped off. If she was a good person she would've signed it and respected his personal property and earnings.. but no, this was a planned robbery from the getgo...
Ended up trying to blackmail him like: just sign it all to me or I'll go to the press about you abusing me..
He ended up giving up and giving her SOME of what she demanded as long as she agreed not to trash him in the media..
What does she do after she gets all this money and his properties?
