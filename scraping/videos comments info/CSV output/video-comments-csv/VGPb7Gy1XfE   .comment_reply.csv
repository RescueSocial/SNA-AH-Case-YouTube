According to the facts, do you know what happened? I mean she still has the roll of Mera while Depp lost some acting gigs. I also saw a picture of her with a black eye; did Depp do that to her? Not taking side just trying to find out what happened and why fans want Amber removed as Mera. As I stated in my previous post, I thought she did an okay job as Mera but wouldn't mind if she was replaced ( don't think that will happen though) since I don't think she and Momoa have chemistry as their characters.",2021-03-02T17:15:08Z,0

There have been so many cases where injustice has been allowed to continue cause the courts didn't do their job, you see it all the time. This case was no different. Depp had all the evidence to prove himself innocent, and yet the judge said it was ""substantially true"" cause of how she ""donated charity"" and is an ""activist"". Though later we'd find out that the charity thing was a lie, she beat previous ex's, and she used self harm and makeup to fake the beatings. She also had connections to the judge and his wife.

Seriously, I hate this stupid logic with ""oh well.the judge said it was true, so it has to be true right?"". It's like they've been living under a rock for years to be obvious to the Justice system's obvious flaws.

121,Ugx5wTCOT8tbmdkCqHd4AaABAg,charisaob,"@Sky High people are taking matters to their own hands because Johnny Depp lost both films, because of her accusations of domestic abuse, UK court didn't do any justice against Sun saying he is a ""wife"" beater, and this goes on for many years now, dragging his name to the mud, and after the audios got out and millions of people have listen to them, and I also listen to them because I am a victim of domestic abuse this case got my attention, and because justice takes its own time the courts will start from next year, AH still has roles and movies and stuff, people reacted it is not fair, she should get out of movies as well. The legal problem of Warner Bros is that they don't have legal papers against her, they cannot take her out without any court paper. But if Aquaman 2 suffers financially plus Johnny Depp might win the case, she is out of Hollywood for good. 
Now you can ask WHY some people go to all this trouble..... my answer is, do you really want women not get punished for violence? what would we teach our children? female abusers are ok because they are female? that women can get away with this? and that is definition of being sexist. I think AH should not be playing a hero while in reality she destroyed another mans life like that. Abuse in my book is abuse no matter the sex.",2021-03-26T20:01:41Z,2
122,Ugx5wTCOT8tbmdkCqHd4AaABAg,Nora Girl,"@:D She didn't win any legal battle. The only legal battle that has been won was by The Sun against JD for defamation. She only testified in this. And he appealed the judgement, which means there will be another judgement on this and nothing is set in stone. It's just really hard to sue A NEWSPAPER for defamation when freedom of press exists. Their trial (JD vs AH) is set for April 2022 and to say the least AH is in daaaanger regarding this one, she has barely provided any proof (and the only things that have come out of it so far have been faulting her, such as her lying UNDER OATH about donating her divorce money to charity... her own lawyer admitted it, I mean? She's literally a criminal in UK at this point) and has just made crazy statements such as WB putting these rumors out, about her getting fired to pressure her (yes, she said that). And WB not coming out saying she will be in Aquaman 2 speaks volume too, they haven't expressed any support towards Amber Heard in the midst of all these rumors coming out over and over again. Also trying to put a subponea on Disney, like the girl is destroying her own carreer at this point... Anyway, if she is found guilty in April, it'll be very bad for the movie that is set to come out in December 2022, which would be RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE of all of this, pending the judgement probably. Aquaman 2 would be ""the movie hiring an abuser"" and I can't see WB risking it... there are more and more rumors that AH was fired, even people saying James Wan himself said so. I feel like WB won't make any real statement about that and we'll have to wait until Summer when they start shooting the movie but I really feel like keeping her puts the whole studio in danger and I don't think they would favor her contract over the whole DC franchise they've tried to build for years. WB getting rid of JD was a ""safety mesure"" because of all the pressure their trials put on the studio, I don't know why they would believe Amber Heard would be less of a ""danger"" for their reputation...",2021-03-02T14:48:17Z,1

124,Ugx5wTCOT8tbmdkCqHd4AaABAg,KayKay2513,"@Sky High she would be credited as a star, paid above-the-line.  Stars, producers, and writers get paid above the line usually much much more than the rest of the crew. 
Her being a star is supposed to be one of the reasons people go to see the film.  While I do love Jason as an actor it is just something I cannot morally do.  That is, give my money to a corporation that does not care about male domestic abuse victims.  The public has read and listened to the evidence from the trial with JD and the Sun.  This is how we came to the conclusion that we cannot financially support these corporations.  The under-the-line workers who made this film as well cannot do anything, they have no power against these businesses.  It is up to us public to force them.   We can admire the dedication and work that went into these films of course but we must do in a way that does not keep on supporting AH and allow her to not face any consequences from her awful actions.  This is the only way for us to. 
It's just like Game of Thrones, I definitely admire the work that went into the beautiful season but I criticize the writing that severely lacked in it.

324,UgxCk1YHTd0OOoJHgaV4AaABAg,determinator 94,Did you not recall the scene on the boat? Arthur DOES take his quest seriously; he just doesn’t believe he’s worthy since he carries the burden of guilt regarding his mother. Then Mera says “You are the bridge between land and sea. I can see that now. The only question is... can you?”,2019-10-19T00:30:37Z,7

337,UgyWU7HYnDo5bjRF8jR4AaABAg,Max Alain's Meme Stash,"@Bruuh I don't care. CGI is a medium, just like 2D animation and live-action. However they blend doesn't matter as long as it looks impressive",2020-10-15T18:50:22Z,0

339,UgyWU7HYnDo5bjRF8jR4AaABAg,Mateo M,"Rocky Ok, did you want somebody to actually start a war underwater with real life explosions and have both actors hold their breath long enough to do the scene? And while we’re on it, did you want them to tame real seahorses and sharks, or is it ok to bait them into swimming around the way you need them to in the shot. I don’t think they can find a real Mosasauras since they’re all extinct but will a crocodile with prosthetics do??? Of course it’s all CGI, how else are they going to do the damn scene. Just because it’s CG doesn’t mean that it doesn’t look beautiful, because it does. It’s one of the greatest looking shots in the entire movie, and really the entire DCEU. Including the shots in Wonder Woman that we’re not CG and actually practical.",2020-05-24T19:57:30Z,0
