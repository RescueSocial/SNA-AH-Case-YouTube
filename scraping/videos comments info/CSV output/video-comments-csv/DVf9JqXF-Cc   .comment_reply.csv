2,UgxzH3tS43Te8mNGxqV4AaABAg,Rock Candy,actually we have the audio tapes where we can hear what went on behind closed doors.  One person was the abuser the other was abused.  Plus the undeniable evidence she faked injuries to destroy him and to help herself to more money and fame.  So if you mean toxic as someone is abusing someone else and then also systematically trying (and succeeding) in destroying their life and livelihood -then yes it was toxic.  She's not a monster - she's an abuser.  Too bad she didn't donate the 7mil to charity she claimed...,2021-01-31T14:43:37Z,6
