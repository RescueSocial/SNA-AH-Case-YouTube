I think from the proof I saw that JD can control himself also I have dated a narcissist like AH and I was also domestic abused not from that ex tho but that ex did mental abuse me tho , so sorry to say this but before saying idk what I’m saying I lived for years in a situation like this so I do know what I say",2021-07-04T12:56:17Z,2

Not towards his ex’s but still he is someone who can get violent while fucked up. Self destructive behavior can go hand in hand with destructive behavior that affects others. Everyone close to an addict suffers in some way. Amber just had to deal with the violence on top of that. As indicated by the photos, witnesses, texts, recordings, etc. The evidence Amber had was more than some victims who win in actual DV cases. There is no proof that she or anyone else is lying.

And why would anyone be jealous of THAT!!!!!   AND im with you about the rest of the cast as well. They were all to blame to a certain extent. And Jason was on her side about Johnny. He believed  all of that crap she spouted. So shes  back in the sequel, but according to the comments Ive read, wasnt such a good idea for the movie. They HAD a lot of fans, which they are losing by the thousands. I dont know if its true or not but a video on my tablet said the first day of filming the movie was a Flop. Sounds good to me. Keep up the good work.😄😄😄  And Kal el  are you talking about a lot of the over 1 and a half million people that signed that petition that wanted her gone  are ugly and jealous, I dont think so.

He has played roles that honestly aren't physically appealing. Johnny Depp is a talented and wonderful person. When your former partners are quick to defend you, apparently you are truly a good person. That said, I'm really more of a Marvel fan. I love Batman and the Joker. I didn't get into Aquaman until the beautiful Jason Momoa took on the role. He was great in GOT and he seemed to be comfortable with Emilia Clarke. I would very much rather see Clarke in these films. People like AH are the real reason people who are suffering in ACTUAL violent toxic relationships are afraid to seek help. AH abused Johnny and got away with it because she's a woman. News flash, men ACTUALLY DO get abused. They're reluctant to speak up because they are afraid of not being taken seriously. She's getting away with it over and over. REAL VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE are not so happy and energetic, they usually have a very quiet demeanor. I grew up in a dysfunctional and at times straight up physically abusive home. I was very embarrassed when I married an abusive man after everything I survived. I didn't try to go to court for help because my mom was unsuccessful in receiving legal help.. AH is the boy who cried wolf. She's abusive and violent but probably afraid that she would be exposed for her behavior. She flipped the script and painted her victim as the abusive one because.....fill in the blank..... She should be punished for her lies and crimes but that will most likely never happen.

177,Ugy7j4iQW18tByxtkB94AaABAg,Shifting Mercury,"@Touay She didn’t abuse previous partners. She was arrested for grabbing her girlfriends arm and arguing with her in public. She got thrown in the drunk tank for the night. Her ex gf has said Amber never abused her or hit her. If the police had witnessed her abusing her gf, she would’ve been charged. We know that Amber hit Johnny twice but on the very same recording, Johnny says something about them being physically abusive towards each other. I can send the link if you don’t believe me. There was proof in the photos which contained the metadata, and the testimony of the makeup artist, among other witnesses to her injuries. Her sister witnessed Johnny attack her twice and was there when Amber hit Johnny. Apparently because she thought he was going to push her sister down the stairs. There were also texts going back years where the abuse is discussed with her mother and her friends. The sister even claimed to confront Johnny about the abuse. When Amber discussed the abuse in the phone call recording, Johnny points out that he didn’t call her a liar. It was months later when he decided to change the story and only when he was going to court that he claimed to be a victim. Which is something abusers do in those situations. 

Nobody is just defending abuse. You either believe her or you believe Johnny. If she hit him after he was abusive to her on several occasions, that doesn’t make her the abuser. She had no reason to lie. Johnny has every reason to lie and he only started lying after he realized his career was damaged. All he had to do was get take responsibility, get help and get clean and sober and eventually, he would have been given another chance. Most people realize that Johnny isn’t like that when he’s clean and sober. The fact that he won’t take responsibility and wants to blame his ex wife for getting a restraining order, makes it so much worse. By attacking her so viciously and showing no remorse and not seeking help, he is destroying any chance he has of getting his career back. It’s only because he is such a popular actor that people refuse to believe it.",2021-06-30T05:57:08Z,0

184,UgynjsCp0-XBaNh8i-54AaABAg,Lone Wolf,"@Meteor same here.  Heck it wouldn't even surprise me if warner bros pays off any legal fees or bail money for amber heard if it becomes necessary, as they already shown they're willing to do stuff like that when it came to paying people to shut up about Ezra's misdeeds.    It's funny that Hollywood has gone so woke that it's easy to predict what's going to happen with most new films these days.   

Take space jam 2 for example.   I already know space jam 2 will be declared better than the first one by the mainstream media.   They'll say it's an all time great film regardless of it's quality while saying the first was trash.    And if it doesn't make enough money at the box office, they'll just conveniently blame it on the pandemic and HBO max having it on their service while it's in theaters to take away it's revenue.    

And anyone who says it's a bad movie will be declared a racist obviously.  

Same thing with Aquaman 2 as I have a feeling any fan that complains about amber heard when Aquaman 2 comes out will be labeled an outright sexist by the media and Hollywood alumni..",2021-06-29T18:13:58Z,3

Tell the world Johnny, tell them Johnny Depp, I Johnny Depp, a man, I'm a victim too of domestic violence'. .Bit weird to add 'a man' in there if you didn't think Johnny as a man wouldn't be believed. Then she starts banging on about being 115lbs like that means you can't abuse someone because you weigh less then them and asks him 'have I ever been able to knock you off your feet?' like that means anything either, it's still abuse. It happens, My uncle was abused by a woman (his ex wife) who weighed less then him.  Also Tasya saying that she wasn't abused doesn't mean she wasn't (wouldn't be the first time a victim has lied that their partner wasn't abusive, physically or mentally)",2021-07-20T19:27:00Z,0

The fact that people label any sort of positive change for society or the planet as ‘sjw’ is problematic in so many ways. If everyone had that attitude, we will never survive. To me sjw’s are the people who are constantly outraged by any little slight that they see as threatening their overly idealistic worldview. They aren’t making meaningful change. They have a new cause every week. People who advocate for the shit that actually matters are essential to the survival of the human race. As for his bottled water company, it doesn’t exist. He has a canned water company which was created to address the problem of single use plastic water bottles. It’s his cause. So of course he’s going to say that. But go ahead and cry over him wanting to save the planet because it somehow offended you.

She never said she lied. In fact, she repeats the accusations in the tapes and Johnny admits they have been violent towards ‘each other’. She never said no one would believe him because he’s a man.

The audacity to even suggest it.
It's SO offensive that I think if I was dealing with those executives, I would say: ""Yeah, we'll sell you those rights""
And once I had the money I'd march them straight to jail then ransom them back to their company.
They need to be reminded that not everything is for sale They need to be put in their place.
Jet Li was offered the part of Cipher in the Matrix movies. He turned it down because, although they only needed him for 3 months to film his part, they wanted him for 9 months so they could film, document  and own ALL his moves and  technique. In the same way a company can own intellectual property.

Disney is just as greedy and selfish as any other Hollywood studio out there.   Anyone who says otherwise is either ignorant or they're selling something.

But I think the got this idea from Britain who tried to copyright the name Iceland that they used in I think it was the name of a supermarket. But the EU rejected it from the basic Iceland existed and used the name since the 9th century.  Also the Norse mythology existed since the 700 after Crist. No one in Scandinavia nor the EU hopefully won't let it happen since no one has the right to a religion especially one as old as the Norse. Even Stan Lee said he has no right to the mythology and only borrowed/inspired by the myths.,2021-06-29T17:50:47Z,8
