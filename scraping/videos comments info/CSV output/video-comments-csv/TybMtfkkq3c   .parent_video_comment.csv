1,UgxG3Le1SftBN5T86Cl4AaABAg,Is it possible to fire both of them and once the court case resolves hire them back maybe for another role in another movie like Johnny depp as a DC Movie superhero. Speaking of which maybe marvel is going to make a move and offer him a role. If Dc every tried to make a movie about superhero with magic power Johnny depp will be a great choice.,Divjot Singh,0,2020-11-23T22:22:03Z
