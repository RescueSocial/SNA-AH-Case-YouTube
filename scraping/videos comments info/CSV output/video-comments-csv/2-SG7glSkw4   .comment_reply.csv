Seriously, unless it caused him to commit terrible acts, I frankly do not care what he does to his own body. If someone I loved did drugs, I would be concerned, but I wouldn't guilt trip them or make it about me. Amber is just being a drama queen and a hypocrite. He was still working and functioning, so it's unlikely that he was constantly high. He even detoxed and cleaned himself up. Unlike Amber, who's dependent.

Karma came to collect the debts. I hold the pm BOTH responsible for their actions and words. Domestic abuse allegations for her, past bad behaviors for him. I also advocate that BOTH of their bad rep should be taken into account. She should go to prison, but he shouldn‚Äôt be a winner in the case either, bc he doesn‚Äôt deserve it. He ditched his family and a loyal partner for her... what is so hard to understand? I‚Äôm against double standard and hypocrisy that ppl create by treating him like a saint. He‚Äôs rotten just much as she is, they deserve each other. I cannot make it any clearer for you, especially since I repeated myself several times already.",2020-10-22T19:33:07Z,1
107,UgxMx_lfPyWxC-L9jDF4AaABAg,Little Big Truths,"@vanessa sanders you don‚Äôt, i do. If we admonish other ppl for doing drugs or alcohol, he should be held to the same standard. We frown upon men leaving families for other women, why should he be an exception? We find it unacceptable to wish or incite death on other people, why should he be have an excuse? As I have said, he got what he deserved based purely on his past actions and words. He knew what he was getting himself into... He could stay with Vanessa and none of this would‚Äôve happened. I‚Äôm not excusing AH, as I have stated previously. Yes, she‚Äôs a home abuser, but tbh, they both deserve to lose the case.
