16,UgzhP9QWX6q55i3ZEFV4AaABAg,"Wow! I thought that ScreenGeek was a fairly reliable source, but looking into their article...I will never trust them again. Their ""source"" close to the situation is Amber Heard. I wondered how a single source would make a discourteously blunt statement on behalf of Warner Brothers, an official statement for L'Oreal Paris, and give an inside scoop on what Amber Heards lawyer's are planning, but it wasn't until I e-mailed L'Oreal Paris to inquire why they would take over Amber Heard's Social Media sites that this all became clear. Jacob Dressler must be a BIG Amber Heard Fan to write an article as if it was actual news when it is Amber Heard propaganda. The obvious mistake in the ""statement"" should give it away. ""there's much more to these allegations than what's been revealed so far. That is why Amber Heard hasn't settled with Johnny Depp."" Mr. Depp is the PLAINTIFF in this case. Ms. Heard COULDN'T settle anything with anyone. Jacob Dressler is a shill for Amber Heard, and Warner Brothers doesn't like fraudulent statements made on their behalf. L'Oreal Paris is going to ""clarify"" this ""statement"" made on their behalf as well. I don't think this article will work out the way Ms. Heard thought it would.",NIBS,0,2020-02-29T23:44:17Z

But you can hear Amber Heard physically and verbally abusing and attacking Johnny Depp in numerous audio recordings all over the media, you can listen to her voice an hear everything, and even friends who have said that they witnessed and broke them both up to keep Amber from hitting and physically abusing Johnny... You have eyewitnesses that have witnessed Amber Heard physically attacking Johnny Depp, physically and verbally. You have audio recordings of Amber Heard actually you could hear her physically grabbing him and hitting him, while verbally abusing him in front of people in the public over the phone and eyewitnesses, and all they can come up with is some fake text messages, that anybody could have done Anytime, Anyplace, and anywhere, on a computer that you could have made up these fake text messages, but no video, or audio of him actually saying these things in front of people. Also if he did what she said that he did on the airplane in front of the public as Amber Heard claimed, where are all the people? where are all the witnesses where are the flight attendants? and the pilots of the plane and the airport security???

Right! Right! You don't think the Amber heard's agent and manager and close friends, are not doing this so that they can save her acting career..?? because everybody wants her out of Aquaman 2, plus she's trying to save her career by having some ginned-up fake text messages saying that Johnny did it, Johnny did everything, Johnny Depp is the evilest man on the planet, and I'm just a little angel, I am God's gift to the Earth because women are perfect and men are evil..!!!",Andrew Nicholas Joseph Benenato,0,2020-02-28T13:10:50Z
25,Ugx6HUGnX2JpH8BPMjV4AaABAg,"Hi Tristen,  disclosure : personally I don`t use L`Oreal products. I quite understand, those who do may wish to continue, however, I ask them to please bear in mind, that the company is supporting Amber. At the very least, they could withdraw her marketing until the case is resolved. Obviously, as I have said previously, the way I can support Johnny, is to avoid (Aquaman 2), if Amber is kept in her role.

If companies wish to make use of Celebrity to sell their products, they should remember there could be a downside. As you say, it is wrong that one party should immediately be punished, whilst the other get`s a pass & I mean that whichever way it worked. Especially, as the case is still ongoing, no burden of guilt has been proven yet. 

As far as companies & institutions are concerned, any action should be the same for both parties, either presumed innocent until proven guilty or treated as guilty as accused, without a legal decision. Of course, you are dealing with individual companies who make their own decisions.
 
But not only hasn`t Amber lost out like Johnny did, it actually has boosted her career & celebrity, that leads to more possibilities such as the U.N. situation for instance. Which is blatantly unfair treatment, IMO.  (Sorry for the length of comment, Tristen.)",Long-time Sci-Fi Enthusiast,0,2020-02-28T12:42:31Z

118,UgywPxx50vcA_u-pJr54AaABAg,"Amber Heard has no incriminating evidence against Johnny her lawyers are digging for anything they can use against him thus the reason her “temporary restraining order” was never extended because she had no concrete evidence against Depp she only had hearsay and statements from her friends who lived on Johnny’s properties at the time of her accusations. Amber and her friends had more to loose than Johnny in this ugly divorce that’s why they came together against an innocent man so they could get full access to his properties they were all staying at. It’s just like Game of thrones Amber wanted his Castle, Land, and money so she tried to manipulated our judicial system but failed because her temporary restraining order was never granted to permanent order. If it were granted Amber and her friends would have lived at JohnnyDs penthouse free of charge until the case was over because there would have been an order in place preventing Johnny from going to these properties if his ex wife was residing on them. It was her motive for the restraining order but until most learn and understand law they will not see this connection. Ok",Melyblaze Gardens,1,2020-02-26T15:02:51Z

Her and her lawyer are attempting to bully their way into getting incriminating information from Johnny’s side. The audiotapes have left them desperate and frantically searching for information that some of his exes have stated, doesn’t exist. Now as for not keeping her roles, Warner Bros is more likely to remove her than L’Oréal. Granted I’ll be honest, if they do it wouldn’t be for moral reasons.

188,Ugw4dNZkZ1Bf3zgx-p14AaABAg,"I’ve worn a mixture of two L’Oreal foundations everyday for years now. I love them. Too bad I will no longer be able to wear them. It sucks but I refuse to support a brand that back someone like Amber Heard. I’ve convinced my family and close friends to also boycott these brands.... but this is very discouraging. Almost like it’s futile because I realize losing my coin isn’t enough to hurt them and doesn’t seem to deter or scare them. I was hoping they would do the moral and honorable thing but I see now that is definitely asking to much. 
I mean just look at all these magazines like DailyMail who went so hard after Johnny Depp when Amber first laid her accusations. They basically tried and found him guilty just in the court of their publication alone. Yet if they were to come just as hard after Amber people would of excused all of that because at least they are being as equally as hard on her as they were on him.... and yet still they won’t. It was days and days after those audio clips were leaked before news outlets started talking about. Some of them have still barely even broached the subject. It is like the collective is unable to acknowledge any wrong doing and simply refuse to admit any fault. I just don’t get it. Why?!?! 
Why is it so hard for these companies to say, “We were duped. It happens and we are sorry. We are now going to do everything possible to right these errors.” They don’t have to admit culpability. Amber tricked a lot of people. Not me but hey. A company that would step forward and issue a statement along those lines would win my approval and might even make me like them more than I do now. Not to mention at this point it might actual give me a little hope for our future.

It's unfair for Johnny, he gets fired from playing Captain Jack Sparrow, for false allegations and Amber Heard will still be in Aquaman 2 and gets away with it.

They are spreading the word due to that, and the continued animal testing just adds to it.  

Ted Binion called it well when he said “you endorse something unethical  - and upset people, each person will tell 10 and it will grow exponentially.”  He was a very successful businessman.  So I’ve told more than my 10.  I’m told  each of them will be doing the same.  And so forth...

Aquaman 2 - Same...a no brainer ...it’s a movie so quite easy to just not put money into anything having to do with her.

I wonder if they will care or be so fond of her if they start to lose money ?? I'm all for equality, but I'm definitely not one of those women that are all for it as long as it suits them. She should be treated the same as Johnny. Her people are saying they want to present their evidence in court, but if we're so wrong about her why hasn't she defended herself ? All she's done is basically laugh at the petitions and say they don't matter. She should be in damage control mode, not being a horrible bitch to the public that she needs to have a career. Thats the main point, they can ignore the public's point of view and opinions, but who are these people expecting to buy their products and watch their films ?

If she is found guilty they may be able to do it too. But she’s lawyered up. It is a double standard and she is disgusting but boycotting anything she is involved is what’s going to hit the bank and money talks.

He is FAR MORE VALUABLE to the movie then she is, and if he has kept up to date with current events, and is not a fan of what he has been hearing, then I'm positive he will simply say ''I'm not working with her again''. but obviously, it won't come out in the press like that and he won't speak about it publicly until it has all blown over.

441,UgzT2ZYi6UvDUy9F4hh4AaABAg,"I find it ironic that soy woke S.J.W.s wanted Aquaman played by Jason Momoa because they didn't want Aquaman played by a blue-eyed, blonde-haired white man with a fair, pale, Caucasian skin color because they wanted more ""diversity"", ""inclusivity"" and ""representation"" with Jason Momoa being a Person Of Color, but they didn't concern themselves with Amber Heard's toxic femininity. 

Well, I shouldn't even be surprised, considering that they deliberately made Ocean Master, Aquaman's arch-enemy and the villain antagonist of the movie a straight white male with blue eyes, blonde hair and a fair, pale, Caucasian skin color whose personality was both racist, and sexist. This is done on purpose because in the Aquaman comic book, Aquaman is actually supposed to have both facial features, and an overall physical appearance that are very Aryan-looking, instead of him looking like a man who is a Pacific Islander, and Ocean Master is supposed to be looking lik a man who has brown eyes, and wavy, reddish-brown or auburn-colored hair instead of looking more like how Aquaman really looks in the comic books. 

They were all so concerned about homophobia, racism, and sexism, but they paid no attention to Amber Heard's man-hating misandry. Aquaman II is going to be a box office bomb if Amber Heard reprises her role as Queen Mera of Atlantis. This is going to lead to the rumor about Marvel Comics taking over DC Comics actually becoming true. Which would not be good at all.",Incubus Time Lord,0,2020-02-25T03:29:50Z

494,Ugz9byVQgSyU2GeENvV4AaABAg,"Well, if that's how they want to play, then there's only one thing left for us to do: boycott. The studios and corporations are truly heartless entities that see us as nothing but walking wallets and will protect their own despite their abhorrent behavior and shove them down our throats. They are ignoring the petitions and our comments despite the evidence and customer outrage. On top of that, WB comes out and expresses how little we mean to them. The question becomes do these entities deserve our support? The answer is obviously No. But, the thing is, they will continue to ignore us and protect monsters like heard so long as they themselves don't feel the sting financially. The only language they, and more specifically their investors, speak is money. Take it away from them and maybe then and only then they'll learn their lesson. To that end, I suggest everyone vote with their wallets. Horrible behavior like heard's and like these corporations' should not be rewarded or allowed to continue, but it will so long as we remain inactive. It is time we took a stand",doctordetroit84,207,2020-02-25T02:28:48Z
