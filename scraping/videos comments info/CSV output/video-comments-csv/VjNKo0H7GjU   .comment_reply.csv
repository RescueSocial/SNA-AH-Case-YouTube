3,UgyWohc-AH6t49ufWst4AaABAg,Rock Candy,i'd agree except for the fact an innocent man has had false accusations thrown at him that could have put him in jail. he lost his career.

There is now audio self-confession she was not a v1ctim and we know she has made grandiose lies to the public (not donating to sick kids hospital).  She is the perpetrator of DV against Johnny.

7,UgyanB5K-R9S5QgndyZ4AaABAg,Rock Candy,"yes many people believed her accusations (only) because she went to the court for TRO with bruises on her face.  When the audio came out and she self-confesses - the hasty & sad mistake of believing her lies at the expense of Johnny's reputation came to light.

He said she donated her settlement, which doesn’t sound like something a gold digger would do, so she must be telling the truth. That’s *literally* what he said.

12,Ugx-w_ph0T_H3WARJLx4AaABAg,Hawkcam1996,"@McKenan Bundy No, actually, it was the court in the UK that disagreed, and his reasoning was literally “well she donated money, so she’s not a gold digger, therefore she must have been telling the truth”. Problem is, it was proven she *didn’t* donate the money. It was a lie. Just like the body cam footage proved she lies about Johnny beating her in the penthouse. It has been proven that she lied in court *multiple* times, and the US courts have taken notice. Amber is on her last legs. She’s going to lose the case.",2021-08-06T16:57:41Z,1

There is evidence against Heard, its not just hearsay and conjecture.  People have come out and given statements showing she is lying and of course the infamous recording of her attacking Depp.  Was he as bad, who knows, I'm not supporting him or her, I just want equality from these studios.

20,Ugx_zColZ2IrbjUkR5l4AaABAg,Nicole23384,@UK Media Warrior I’m not taking sides bc I think Depp and Heard are both messed up. Have you and all the other Depp supporters been with them through their relationship every minute since they were together? Heard and seen everything? They were both toxic to each other. To the extent of it no one knows. Both of them could be sputtering lies this whole time for all we know. Anyone can lie. All us viewers and fans do is read the online articles that is suppose to sum up people’s whole situation and lives in a paragraph. Just because one studio does something doesn’t mean another one has to do the same thing. It’s business. Disney got rid of James Gunn bc of past tweets. Warner Bros picked him up.

21,Ugx_zColZ2IrbjUkR5l4AaABAg,UK Media Warrior,"@Nicole23384 A contract that prohibits a studio firing an actor?  Not very likely, they would be giving up all control and considering the amount of money these actors cost to hire, plus the money going into promoting projects with these actors in them the studio would want control so if someone does something really bad they can cut them lose.  I'm not saying other studios aren't as bad as WB, they obviously are, but as there is as much evidence against heard as there is Depp then both should of been asked to resign, not just one.",2021-08-01T16:15:53Z,0

Look at the pictures she took when he passed out and posted it on social media to make him look bad. Dude has a substance abuse problem, that’s clear. 

There’s literal audio of him pleading with her to stop being so toxic and destructive. She says in no uncertain terms that he’s a man and people will not believe him, they’ll mock him. 

I go back to my initial question, why is it that the man gets cancelled but not the woman? That’s a clear double standard. If there were audio of him being anywhere as abusive, he’d not only get cancelled and never work again but he’d probably end up in jail.

In my view no great weight is to be put on these alleged admissions by Ms Heard to aggressive violent behaviour.

A witness giving evidence in court does so under an oath or affirmation to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. Questioning can be controlled by the judge. Questions which are unclear can be re-phrased. If a question is not answered, it can be pressed (subject to the court's control) and if still unanswered may be the proper object of comment.

170,Ugwdxs0NMVvC9wIwBpZ4AaABAg,Jayden Ball,"@Daniel Graham Please read the new court documents from Virginia court and see the reasons why the judge in Virginia kept denying Amber's attempt to dismiss the case for the third time. Amber used the UK court ruling to support her attempt. The judge stated that they denied the attempt dismissal because the UK trial was not a fair trial based on the following reasons. Amber was not the defendant in the UK trial so she was not subjet to discovery (meaning at that time, she couldn't be investigated thoroughly back then as she is now hence her attempt to dismiss the virginia trial to prevent from more discovery-this is just my opinion about why she kept trying to dismiss it). The Virginia judge also stated that Amber's statement were not consistent with the evidence (so I think, they were saying, it was not credible or that they don't have enough information). I think its the lack of any evidence from health professionals and proper photos of the injury regarding the alleged broken ribs, nose, two black eyes, cuts all over hands and feet also leads to this decision. Also perhaps, the finding of the UK court about her donation is not consistent with the new evidence in Virginia court. If you compare, the documents in the UK court, most of them are not consistent with new discoveries for the Virginia trial. If no one is noticing it until now, perhaps with the Virginia judge pointing it out, can make people look more into it.

Fair enough if your opinion is based on slanderous coverage I can't persuade you.

Paragraph 174:

In her evidence, Ms Heard said that she did sometimes throw pots and pans at Mr Depp but only to try and escape him and as a means of self-defence. She also said at times in the recordings she was being sarcastic or trying to wound Mr Depp's feelings.

And Para 175:
In my view no great weight is to be put on these alleged admissions by Ms Heard to aggressive violent behaviour. It is trite to say, but nonetheless true, that these conversations are quite different to evidence in court. A witness giving evidence in court does so under an oath or affirmation to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. Questioning can be controlled by the judge. Questions which are unclear can be re-phrased. If a question is not answered, it can be pressed (subject to the court's control) and if still unanswered may be the proper object of comment. None of those features applied to these conversations which, in any event, according to Ms Heard had a purpose or purposes different from simply conveying truthful information.

Because none of those people seem to notice that these stories fit the overall narrative of those channels.

But this judge in particular keeps refusing to allow police who were there and all evidence to be used in the court room. Johnny is not allowed to do anything at all to defend himself and they discredit the police. Amber threatened Johnny and his kid. There's evidence of that. Amber edited footage, they have the unedited footage with her smirking in it and showing Depp wasn't mad at her when slamming the cabinet and being upset. They have traffic cam footage showing he did not keep her prisoner. He even rented cars for her and has paperwork and traffic cams to prove it. She even laughed when lying about him being abusive. She lied about not being a gold digger and donating money to children's hospital. Campea has not looked into it at all. He's just being dumb.
