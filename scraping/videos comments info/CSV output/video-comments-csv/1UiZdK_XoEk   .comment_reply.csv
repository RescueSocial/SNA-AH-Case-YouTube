4,UgxDkjXAyZocuRkzKoV4AaABAg,Batgirl,"@Doctor Soup The trouble is she has attached herself to a movement ""metoo"" that unfortunately have stood behind her thus far. Any wrong move on WB part and it would be more hassle than firing her is worth. It's clever on her part that she's done this because for the most part she's untouchable...for now. But rest assured when she's found guilty...the block of very unstable lies will all come crashing down on her very shady, selfish... deluded ass!",2020-10-24T17:49:17Z,0
5,UgxDkjXAyZocuRkzKoV4AaABAg,Doctor Soup,"What's hard to understand for me is why they didn't attempt to get her out earlier. I understand they are awaiting the verdict but I find it hard to believe that they couldn't attempt to get rid of her beforehand. To me an intelligent move would be to get rid of someone who is an abuser and not wait things out like this, but that is just my opinion. I agree with you that they are likely waiting it out. I feel at minimum that they could have at least condemned her actions, but that is just my opinion.",2020-10-24T17:30:09Z,1

11,UgzDj15bdVuS2tHE7OZ4AaABAg,BrainInvasion,"@Doctor Soup After reading one of the comments below, I'm glad Warner Bros hasn't fired her before any kind of verdict has been decided.

Meanwhile Amber's doing all she can to mess with Johnny's career, and posting disrespectful social media comments aimed at Australia, and poking fun at her criminal dog smuggling!!... I'm so tired of all this nonsense!! Also, thanks for editing your comment, and removing the part where you said ""Do your research!""...
