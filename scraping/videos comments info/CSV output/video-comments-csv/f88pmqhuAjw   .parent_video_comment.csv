There's no way that they think he's the abuser. Anyone who witnessed his testimony, heard those tapes, has listened to the things that his ex-wife has said, know that Johnny Depp is not the aggressor. There is a myth of mutual violence because at some point the victim is going to defend themselves. This may be physical, verbal, or otherwise but you're not going to sit there and take it forever so certain individuals will say that the victim is a participant. That's not the case. You have to defend yourself at some point and interestingly enough in the case that I have heard you can tell when Depp has an Epiphany about what's going on there and he realizes that his wife is not who she says she is. He is  definitely not the one who instigated the conflicts And he certainly doesn't seem to be enjoying them, while on the other hand you can tell that his wife relishes that horror. Makes me squeamish just listening to it. If there is somebody that is representing themselves as the domestic violence movement or whatever, they're operating outside of the opinions and feelings of people who are abused. We knew when we saw him he was the one that was the victim. My advice to Mr Depp is to let go of the money and get the hell out of the world for a while and recover because this woman is a pernicious disordered personality, probably a sociopath with sexual sadistic tendencies. You can see that and hear it in her voice when she's abusing him. We all wish Johnny Depp the best and we hope this wench gets what she deserves. Unfortunately, karmic quicksand takes its time swallowing up these human voids. It adds further frustration to people who have been hurt by them and continue to be hurt by them but there's some lesson in it for us and we good to watch Johnny Depp and learn from what he went through because as a movie star and a very attractive person most victims don't think that that would ever happen to a rich movie star but it does because the disorder out there and some of them don't care about anything but getting what they want. Sadly, what they want is the world and worldly things. and that's not the same as love which this person had I think. And what did she do with it? She pissed it away. She had everything but it wasn't enough and she will never have enough because that's how f***** up she is. We're glad you made it out Mr Depp",Rene Diedrich,2,2021-03-24T10:34:04Z
