217,UgykPiS9EEGJ4j4kCFt4AaABAg,Kutlu Mƒ±zrak,"So this one's a funny story. That... is Mera. She appeared fairly early on in Aquaman comics. HOWEVER..... Like many things in DC and Marvel lores, these characters are all new versions of older stories. FOr example, young and rich archer getting lost after a long journey, coming back to his home to find it in shambles and deciding to fight with a hood / hat and an alias might sound like  Green Arrow's premise..... But that story is originally Robin Hood. Almost beat by beat.

Aquaman takes from one of the most well known legends in the history of mankind. In fact, it's almost blatant giveaway if you look at his first name. Outcast and lost prince far from his kingdom, goes on  a journey to reclaim an old and powerful relic weapon to rise up and become the King that was meant to be as a hero of the people. And his name is Arthur. Do I even need to point out how that Trident was Excalibur in the original?

So the point comes down to what exactly influences these modern myths that we call comic books? Aquaman is primarily King Arthur legend, with a very healthy dose and overlay of old Atlantis myth combined with the sporadic elements of certain folk tales.

The original for the very dark and tragic Little Mermaid tale is not even Andersen's horrifying depiction of a lovesick idiot mermaid dying, in fact, those stories are mostly semi modern renditions of old tales across the Old World. Mermaid tale originates ( like a lot of old tales) from the Greek myths. In essence, the red hair stretches back all the way to Odyssey, where sirens appeared to the sailors as otherworldly beauties with red hair as they sang.

Hence, Mera's red hair and her overall mermaid motif.

Read comics and watch their movies with a very critical story comparison eye, and then you'll start to see some really interesting things. 
A small, but so very overt thing almost %99.99 percent of all populace never realizes as an example:   A baby, put into a vessel and let go into the great unknown, to be raised as one of the people he actually doesn't belong to, and possesses a multitude of insane powers..... sounds like Superman. But is actually Moses, considered the greatest telling of the conflict of an immigrant and considering superman creators were Jewish kids......

P.S.: Funny enough, Batman, one of the most popular of all superheroes is again contrarian to many of similarly famed superheroes in the fact that his origins are not from some old myths, but in fact was just the old detective serials from 1890s given a costume in comic form.",2018-10-30T00:23:36Z,4

342,UgxazJv2DOXA-kUwfch4AaABAg,Straight White Male,"Buzz 32123 It absolutely is, and correct me if I'm wrong but it seems like you're trying to undermine my point. Atlantis was created by Plato, a Greek philosopher and storyteller. He's quite commonly seen as one of the founders of Western philosophy and mythology. Atlantis is as such heavily based around Athens, with the two often coming to blows.

Atlantis eventually lost the favor of the Greek deities and sunk into the Atlantic Ocean.

Point is; they're Greek. I'm not even Greek, and I don't know what nationality/ethnicity you are, but surely you wouldn't want people fucking with your history/culture? For some reason it's always okay to just erase white history and mythology, like blackwashing people like Lancelot, Bedivere, Queen Margot, and now in more recent times Marvel is blackwashing characters like frickin' Heimdall and the Valkyries from Norse mythology. Getting a black James Bond as well now, oh and he'll be played by the same actor who blackwashed Roland from Steven King's ''The Dark Tower''.

See what I mean now? That's why I'm glad for this movie they didn't ''diversify'' as they call it. Like I said: I want a black Black Panther, and a white Heimdall.",2018-10-07T12:55:36Z,0

344,UgxazJv2DOXA-kUwfch4AaABAg,Straight White Male,"Buzz 32123 I mean casting an exact 25% of each ethnicity. So like one black, one Asian, one mixed, one Caucasian. That just makes a movie feel like a scripted machine, and makes it difficult to suspend disbelief. I wouldn't want Wakanda to be half Asian half black half white, and I don't want diversity in Atlantis either. It wouldn't be true to the source material, again making it feel artificial.
