This was a planned scheme ( with tons of court testimony to back this claim) that she and her friends concocted this in order for Amber to make money|Fame and her her friends to continue to live in the Penthouses that Johnny was so generous in allowing those losers to live there FREE. It will take more than apologies, she needs to serve time for lying in court, ruining JD's career, And for all the other terrible things she has done.

26,UgzpZ6edPplv847ffUZ4AaABAg,"There is an ocean of difference between Robert Downey Jr. and Amber Heard. 
Namely, the mistakes Robert made harmed himself first and foremost as well as his family emotionally. He eventually got clean, and worked to prove himself a reliable man and actor, while rebuilding his familial relationships and publicly owning up to his past choices and mistakes.

Amber Heard physically assaulted and emotionally & psychologically abused Johnny Depp, all while claiming no one would believe him if he came forward because he is a man. And the ""apology"" discussed here wasn't even hers. Why should we ""give her the chance"" or any chance ""we gave Robert Downey Jr""
 when she won't put in the work he did. She can't even apologize for herself.
