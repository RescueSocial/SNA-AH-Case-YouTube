0,Ugz3RsS8TtUY1yIk8794AaABAg,SheDevil,You speak as a survivor. It was so obvious that she was the oppressor. I don't think she even thought about the kind of ripple she was creating. She chose the wrong man. Johnny Depp has been at the top for a long time and he deserves to stay at the top. She thought she could use him to get there. She is just a horrible person. It's not just physical violence that make an abuser. There's an oppression that people don't see. The beat down before the actual beatings begin. Well said. üëè,2020-12-23T03:14:03Z,0

3,Ugz3RsS8TtUY1yIk8794AaABAg,Tiffany C,"@Walter B there‚Äôs a very strong problem through all of this rhetoric with using the phrase feminism to denote misandry. One does not equate with the other. Your wife and her friends may not consider themselves to be feminists, but the truest definition of that is anyone who is a proponent for equality. Anything that wants to push the pendulum in favor of women to the exclusion of men is purely misandry, do not confuse the two. 

Likewise, being a feminist does not mean that we adopt a victim mentality. Most feminists are progressive and proactive in speaking up for themselves, As opposed to a misandrist that is aggressive and regressive. 

A good analogy would be all the incels that hide within the MRA movement amongst men who simply want bias to be erased within the system. The same way there are misogynists within the men‚Äôs movement, there are misandrists within the feminist movement. The job of any true feminist is too cold out people like Amber Heard and their ilk, likewise yours would be to call out men who do the same and equivalent thing.",2020-11-23T15:18:50Z,3
4,Ugz3RsS8TtUY1yIk8794AaABAg,Walter B,"Tiffany,
Let me start with respect for you for engaging facts. That in itself puts you ahead of most feminists.
I won‚Äôt lie, I can‚Äôt stand feminists. I will explain. However, before I do, let me tell you something. I married an engineer decades ago. She is a very intelligent and independent woman. However, she NEVER judges people by their sex organ ... she is no feminist. She rejects victimhood ... she is no feminist... she deals with facts day in and out ... she is no feminist.
So let‚Äôs clarify what a feminist is.
How did we even get to the point where Amber could beat Johnny repeatedly and smash his finger off without consequence? Feminism.
Let me be specific. Your opening gambit was ‚Äúeven though the victim is male, I‚Äôll make my focus about women‚Äù.
Try this test. Look at your favourite search engine and type in ‚Äúdomestic violence‚Äù and see how many females you see condemned and how many males are represented ... ever... the answer is zero, not zero tolerance ... zero.  How? Feminism. Let me be specific... no best, hospitalise and murder children is covered up by the world‚Äôs media (every outlet) by ... feminism.
I want to tell you two stories. One involves a boy who was friends with one of my kids. When this boy was four, his mother picked him up and threw him into a wall. He ended up in hospital with broken bones. Now, the police, the hospital, the government and the media did ... NOTHING.  Why? Feminism. A few months later that father packed the kids into the car in the middle of the night because he knew he would NEVER get any support because of ... feminism.
Then, just recently, another of my kid‚Äôs friends had an incident where his estranged mother harassed him as school. She was estranged because they found bruises on his back. When he was asked he said he ndd we vet wanted to see his mother again ... so the police charged ... the father! Why? Feminism. Anyway, the father asked the school to intervene and the school said no because of ... feminism! When the lawyers got involved, the school finally said they‚Äôd protect the child. But...
A few weeks later, the school recognised the behaviour and ran DV training for boys only ... for SV against women and only women. They forced this kid to publicly opt out... because of feminism.
When Raina Thaiday murdered her 7 children, the media and government buried it... because of feminism. One attorney general came out and said DV was a an thing and discussed if all men should be screened before entering a relationship. Why? Feminism.
So let me put this on point blank terms... why can women beat and murder children with impunity? Feminism. If we have a fascist movement reminiscent of the Weimar Republic, it‚Äôs feminism.
And I‚Äôll leave you with two other things,
1. Cassie Jaye wanted to take the Mickey on MRAs (I am not an MRA for the record, I oppose all liars and bullies and all toxic movements). She changed her mind away from feminism and became an advocate for everyone. She made a film called the red pill and the feminists went after her with a vengeance. Read her blog.. to this day, they hound her relentlessly... why? Feminism!
And lastly, I won‚Äôt even get into the aggressive bullying in education... but I will show you what my government does. It‚Äôs nothing short of mental abuse,.., why???

https://ibb.co/p2pH9Yd
https://ibb.co/NTHQf4Q

I love intelligent women and I‚Äôm married one. My female friends are all great women, not one feminist/victim/pushover among them. I will close with this again. Feminism was is and will always be a movement of malice, prejudice, bullying, lies and contempt for 1/2 the population... even violence and murder are acceptable. Just search it if you doubt me or ask Erin Pizzey.",2020-11-23T14:36:42Z,1

He has his own production company, and it just put out a documentary on Shane Macgowan which is amazing. Probably worthy of awards. He has another movie set to come out soon that likely will garner attention as well for awards. 

I‚Äôve said it before, and I will say it again, it seems like he‚Äôs going to be on the RDJ path to redemption. He‚Äôs gotten clean, he‚Äôs just going to have to start taking the indie route back into films and build up his career again.

22,UgyXW_1z7KBnLPGswqR4AaABAg,Tiffany C,"In the case of abuse victims though it is an actual thing, and very common for them to do as a means to somehow try to take their power back.

On one hand she wanted to enact some kind of violence on him as payback for what he had done to her, on the other hand she knew what the consequences would be if she ever did anything like that. It‚Äôs mainly a coping mechanism at any rate.

What Loreena Bobbitt did to her ex-husband was actually act on a revenge fantasy. Because she was not actually in danger at the time, that‚Äôs why it was considered illegal, because it was not self-defense. He had already passed out, and she could have gotten safely away without assaulting him. She didn‚Äôt have to do what she did, which is why she got jail time.

It‚Äôs just more of the media smear campaign though in Johnny‚Äôs case the tabloids report on exactly half the story. Did he have that revenge fantasy? Yes. Did he acknowledge in the very next text that he could never lay hands on the woman he loves? Also yes.",2020-12-11T08:37:22Z,1

If they didn't our laws wouldn't be made this way. You wouldn't see a case like jd. Your definition is the outlier and it cannot define the rules. The truth of the matter is feminism has been hijacked by hateful, ignorant and self serving people. I see no way to recover the term from them. If you can't take back the term then you need to make a new term. You need to start your own club and evolve the cause. I'm a guy and i see the backlash of feminism from the men side in the form of mgtow. They see misandry of feminism and has chosen to cut off women. They convinced themselves that women has built in character flaws that make them irredeemable. This is enforced by self proclaimed feminism's vendetta against men. I see mgtow as equally destructive as feminism when they go to that extreme. Men should filter out misandrists like how women should filter out misogynists otherwise the end result is just division.

Otherwise I will agree with your last statement. Domestic violence and even sexual violence is a human issue at the core. We do need to fight for equality for everyone across-the-board and lessen the division, and that means being able to find our commonalities and come together.

My only issue is it seems like a lot of people get bogged down into this ‚Äúgood feminist, bad feminist‚Äú rhetoric and the problem is not so much that they are good ones and bad ones. There are misandrists like Amber Heard hiding out in the ranks speaking for the rest of us and they don‚Äôt get to do that. 

They are long overdue for being called out because of the damage that they do to the movement, but all true feminism ever has been is about equality. We are tired of the Brock Turner‚Äòs of the world getting a pass, and people just like him getting confirmation hearings for court. Rape kits going untested, police asking ‚Äúwhy do you want to ruin that boy‚Äôs life‚Äú and the automatic assumption that we are all lying. 

Now it is just becoming common knowledge that some men also have to deal with the same things. As important as it is to have male feminist, it is equally important to have women speak up for men who can‚Äôt. Things like the Johnny Depp trials have pushed that into the forefront. 

People like him and Terry Crewes show us that it is not solely a women‚Äôs issue when it comes to DV and sexual assault. After a point, it is not so much a gendered issue at all, it is simply us against a very powerful, antiquated, and corrupt/biased system",2020-12-02T12:05:19Z,0

Not one journalist had the courage to stick their head above the parapet and give a balanced piece of reporting.

I'll say it again, if you truly care about this issue and want to further your understanding, please read the paper I referenced above. Alternatively, you can view presentations Dr. Strauss has given on youtube, or Dr. Donald Dutton. Or if you want a female perspective, search for Erin Pizzey  - who started the first womens DV shelter in the world. She found that the majority of women who attended her shelters, were either violent towards their husbands, or violent towards their children. Most of those women had endured terrible childhoods.

Domestic violence has never been a gendered (or a black and white) issue, it is a GENERATIONAL issue. Children who witness or suffer domestic abuse, grow up to become either perpetrators or victims of DV themselves. Erin Pizzey's DV shelters were hijacked by Feminists in the 70s, and turned into a female 'victimhood' industry. The result of this has been catastrophic for familys and children.",2020-11-29T01:44:18Z,0

The one in the UK was for libel against The Sun, and the judge DOES have connections to both Rupert Murdoch and Dan one insofar as that goes. His son works for talk radio UK, which also employs Dan Wooten (who was the old editor of the sun). It is also owned by Rupert Murdoch, who owns The Sun. 

The judge has also written a book in the past about freedom of press, so he does have some bias there, in the book was co-written by a Geoffrey Robertson, whose ex-wife was Kathy Lette. Amber Heard went to Kathy Lette‚Äôs house during the trial for a dinner party. So she has actually met family and friends of the judge, and even a year prior went to Doughty Street chambers, which is the judge‚Äôs old firm. There are multiple connections after a while, and it detracts from the idea of ‚Äúconspiracy theory‚Äú when the people involved have started changing their profiles and social media to erase the connections that there are.

Because of testimony that came out in the UK trial, the Australian authorities are re-opening an investigation into whether or not an Amber Heard smuggled her dogs illegally into the country, and because there was already a case for that in Australia, they will also be investigating whether or not she committed perjury.

Johnny‚Äôs defamation suit against her personally is coming up next year in either February or March.

119,UgzLQ3QJYD7Q09TY8GF4AaABAg,S K,"@Tiffany C There is part 1 of an amazing breakdown of the allegations / inconsistencies in AH's story here: 
https://theinfamousone.medium.com/a-complete-breakdown-of-amber-heards-allegations-against-johnny-depp-part-i-ab2f569ac4bd

I'm not sure when part 2 will be up, but this picks apart the fantasy tale she told a piece at a time.  She set the stage for it from the beginning, manipulating how Johnny would be seen from the start. But she couldn't remember the lies she told, so the inconsistencies, when you see them side by side, it's even more incongruous that the judge ruled as he did so.  I wonder if he thought it was just too much trouble to go to, to review and compare.

And that's such a scary thing to think because you're dealing with a man's life, reputation, and career here. Someone who has no history of domestic violence, who was never arrested, charged, or convicted.  

Someone who is not only a rare talent, but someone who no one except AH and her cronies had a bad thing to say about.  One of the most common things you hear about him is how gentle he is.  Even she said on the stand that he has trouble asserting himself with people, he doesn't want to be the bad guy.  

To not put the effort in and just accept everything she said despite all the inconsistencies showing she was not credible is mindblowing.",2020-11-26T04:20:52Z,1

He ignored the fact that she kept changing her story, and he ignored many many peoples‚Äô testimonies that said she was walking around the day after an alleged incident with no marks whatsoever. Essentially his mind was made up beforehand. He had law-enforcement telling him that she had no marks on her, building staff, and even medical professionals; and the other part of the problem was that Johnny was neither charged nor convicted with domestic violence and in both countries it is supposed to be ‚ÄúInnocent until proven guilty‚Äú",2020-11-25T17:12:22Z,0

In the Virginia trial however it‚Äôs going to come down to a jury, and not all of them subscribe to the believe all women narrative. That‚Äôs probably the angle that her defense team is going to try to play, but it‚Äôs not going to play out here when he has so many female witnesses. If we are supposed to Believe all women, that means we should believe Winona Ryder, Vanessa Paradis, Trinity Esparza, Kate James and so many others. The LAPD officer was a woman too. And if you‚Äôre considering juries, you have to consider that even some of the women on the jury would be victims of domestic violence at some point themselves, and they are more likely to recognize the signs and relate to Johnny than they are to Amber.

Not a lot of men and women can take feminists movement series. Due to the fact that it hasn't been in the best lighting for so long.

Look at it like #NotAllFeminists the same way dudes had to do #NotAllMen ... I‚Äôve said already elsewhere you cannot let the nutty loud ones speak for a whole movement. That is like incels speaking for the MRA. In every single group, and every single movement, there are extremists and crazies. They are generally the ones making most noise. 

The true core of feminism has always been pushing for equality, and since Johnny Depp has become an unwitting standard bearer, and most unwilling, there have been many many women and feminists stepping up and speaking up, a lot of whom are DV survivors themselves.

However, I can also say the same when the rules are reversed. But it makes it incredibly hard for a man to prove that to the public eye. Because of the me too movement believe all women.

But that's a story for another day. Now in this situation don't get me wrong,  I am happy that a feminist is supporting a man for the first time. because, how often do you hear such a thing? Other than men's are this and that. In this day and age the feminist movement is designed just to downgrade men, there are plenty of articles, videos, websites that can support that fact. And the reason why I say there is a war between men and women. it's always been that way. way before even I was even born. one gender seems to want to have more superiority than the other different cases but different reasons.

What I'm trying to say is it's going to be a long while before equality finally reached the table until then they're still going to be a battle between the two sexes.",2020-11-23T21:39:11Z,0

If you were actually paying attention to the trial, Amber Heard had nothing to do with Johnny Depp and Vanessa Paradis splitting, otherwise do you think she would jump as quickly to testify for him?? They even both admitted on stand that Johnny and Vanessa had already split, Johnny even dated someone for a short while in between the two women, before he and Amber got serious. She was also very jealous of that girl, whose name was Rachelle.

We‚Äôre not going to victim blame here, he does not get abused because he was duped into believing such a younger woman would love him for the rest of his days. We‚Äôre also not going to victim blame him for not leaving sooner. Let‚Äôs not make Johnny Depp a #WhyIStayed

He is not worse for what has happened to himself, and we would never say that to a female victim. It is actually very very common for victims to lean into substance abuse in order to cope with what‚Äôs happening to them, and I do believe because he has a substance problem Amber picked him as a prime mark.

The stronger argument is why in the world Amber Heard treats people the way she does. She uses and abuses everyone and goes through life with no consequences, but part of the problem is that people look at the victim and their actions as opposed to the abuser and theirs. 

How about we keep all the shame and blame on her because she didn‚Äôt have to hurt him in the first place. Why could she not just stay married and keep her damn hands to herself? Why did she feel like she had to throw things and why did she think she had the right? Why did she try to demand half his wealth in the divorce after what she did to him?

211,UgwwC6AkAMdSr9lhGw14AaABAg,black_romeo,"@Tiffany C I hope you don't think I was referring to you as not speaking up. I was talking in general terms. Of course you spoke up, you made a video. 

You said ""your men's rights movement"". I own it? I'm a part of it? I just mentioned it, I made/make no claim to be a part of it. Also, the way you said ""your men's rights movement"" seems like you're referring to it in a negative way. Don't know if that's how you meant it, but that's how it came across.

Incels literally have nothing to do with men's rights. Neither do MGTOW. I know you didn't mention MGTOW but they both get lumped in with men's rights a lot, and I can only assume it's for disingenuous reasons. Incels are a bunch of guys who want to have sex with women but can't. Over time it morphed into hating the guys who can have sex with women and the women for not giving it to them. None of that is a men's rights issue. MGTOW are....I want to say a bunch of weirdos but that would be unfair to the ones I know who aren't that bad. Essentially they've checked of relationships with women and society's expectations of them all together. It's most a self serving movement. Men's rights focus on.... men's rights. I genuinely believe that true feminists, like what you seem to be, and an actual advocate for men's rights would get along and could accomplish great things if you worked together. It's just a shame that the MRM is demonized for just speaking and then get lumped in with people who don't claim to be part of their movement. 

Jubilee had a video where 3 MRA and 3 FRA were going to sit down and discuss their issues. But what actually happened was there was 3 feminists 2 men's rights advocates and an incel. The incel clearly didn't belong there. It got in the way of what I thought would have been a great conversation. Both sides would've learn more about the other and came away with more of an understanding of the other sides issues. But nope, they put a child in there to say ""girls are smelly and gross and have cooties"" because...that furthers conversation? And promotes unity? What it does is make men's rights advocates look bad. And it feels like that was the intention. Building more of that resentment I kept banging on about.",2020-11-19T16:16:36Z,0

The notion is that in any movement (even your men‚Äôs rights movement because you have nut cases like incels) the extremists are the ones who are the loudest and who throw a negative slant on what is an honest effort. The bottom line is those in the middle have to start a dialogue and open up communication, and more than anything come together and start seeing likenesses as opposed to differences. 

If this case should show anybody anything, it‚Äôs that there are two sides to every story and you have to wait until all of the information comes out in the open to make an informed decision. But yes, there is darkness in everyone, men and women alike.",2020-11-19T13:08:30Z,0

What they have done has brought bad publicity for the third movie. Best thing to do is to write either online or by email or by letter to Warner Bros and its head of offices. I posted on Twitter the contacts for the Big Warner offices in these two tweets.

The more people send their protests, the more Warner will realise that they have screwed up by firing Johnny Depp. Had they kept him, they would have gotten the complete support of Johnny fans and more so from audiences whop did not see the other films. When I wrote to WB, I told them that I and others would buy their Blu-Rays in used shops so that they won't make any money from us.

They have the exact same information available as the general public and yet they tried to cover their bases because of a BS verdict that is obviously BS. They let him go despite knowing better, bungled the job professionally by not telling the rest of the cast and crew, and then kept the obvious abuser on their payroll. They literally punished the victim and rewarded the abuser, and I have no time for that.

To this day I think he still believes the narrative to a degree despite there being no evidence. But after a point common sense should kick in. 

I am not entirely sure that her mother believed her, because I think both of her parents are well familiar with her by now, but I do think that Amber sent strategic texts to certain people to have a record of things. She also liked pointing out her supposed injuries to people to try and call attention to it in the hopes that they would recall it later. Amanda De Cadenet was one of those people, but she also did the same with Melanie Inglesis as well as her nurse. The nurse, being a health professional was not fooled, and that showed in her notes that they used for trial, Amanda I think initially was until the audios came out, and I think Melanie is somehow intimidated by Amber and willing to go along.

Not to mention Melanie the makeup artist really had to be dragged to court to testify. She was so determined on not testifying because it'd affect her business.

She wore red lipstick as did Amber heard on the James Corden show, but yet you could very clearly see all of the swelling in her split lip. 

That has always been my contention between her and the make-up artist friend of hers who is trying to prop up her narrative. No matter how much make-up you put on injuries, you might be able to hide the discoloration, but you *cannot* do anything to hide the swelling. 

Rihanna is an excellent example of what a real survivor looks like the day after because she had the exact same injuries that Amber Heard claimed. We‚Äôve all seen pictures of them, and they are no comparison to the photo spread that Amber Heard released as ‚Äúevidence.‚Äú 

And that is what I was saying in my video. Amber Heard wants us to believe that the weak, rhinoplasty looking bruises are the result of a raging drunk man going no holds barred on her face, and we all know that Johnny wears rings. She would‚Äôve had welts from the rings, he could‚Äôve cracked her orbital bone, he most certainly would‚Äôve broken her nose and you would see that by the disjointedness and swelling. 

For her to go on the James Corden show the very next day and do an interview, with bruised ribs and a broken nose would‚Äôve been absolutely impossible. Those injuries would have required medical attention and it would‚Äôve hurt her to breathe, much less talk.

I suspected for a long time when he was with her. due to his bodylanguage when in public with her compared to when alone, that he was being abused mentally.  I just did not realise to what extent and also the physical abuse going on.   I just waited years for the day that she would push him to the point he would stand up publically for himself.  I was proud of him the day he did.  

Yes initially I understood him just wanting to forget it and move on with his life and if she had not continued pubically to present herself in such a high profile way as a victim she would probably have got away with it.

There was a paparazzi shot somewhere, I should have saved, have never found it again, but it showed little marks on her left arm that look like self harming scars. They were all even, parallel, shallow, and that‚Äôs exactly what he meant by appearing self-inflicted.

332,UgxZdQsqewS2hponbHl4AaABAg,MarathonH,"@Tiffany C Yes I agree, that's a fair sum up. I was an aupair once for a woman getting divorced.  The divorce lawyer coached this woman into creating evidence for the divorce case.  I was asked to secretly film the husband in an attempt to incriminate him.  I suspect AH's divorce lawyer worked out how they could set him up, so it looked as if she needed a 'restraining order'. The trouble is the average person in the street doesn't realised how cunning and dishonest people are when it comes to court /legal cases. To divorce lawyer's it's just standard practise. It's dirty work... it's not honest...

It's also worth highlighting that AH comes from a family back ground of domestic  violence. It's alleged her father beat up her mother. And it's reported she was violent towards her sister. When you watch the TV show where JD tricked her into thinking her car had been wrecked when in fact it had been resprayed and converted into something beautiful...she goes totally nuts. She's volatile.... suggests the guy should be punched for damaging her car. Physical violence is something she knows...she's been  brought up with it.... she's comfortable with it. That's why in the audios she calls JD a ""baby"" for not putting up with her attacks. It's her default setting. She even says to him in the audios ""I can't promise I won't be physically violent"".. This is not a fragile, afraid, victim. 

I think JD hasn't appreciated how much he is up against. It's not just about him, and his situation. He is fighting the court system that is currently massively biased towards woman. It's because for years women were given a raw deal in court cases. They were called whores for wearing short skirts. Lawyers claimed they were asking for trouble and provoking rape. They were not believed, but instead faced smear campaigns and presented as liars. The backlash of all those years of bias... and the sexual predatory behaviour of men in power ..has led to the Me Too Movement. But that has nothing to do with Johnny Depp. The connection is ridiculous.

And on top of all that...this is a totally new territory... revealing that men can be the victims of physical abuse.

It doesn't matter that she's physically smaller than him...if she's starting physical fights.

Poor guy... it would take the patience of a saint not to retaliate at some point. Yet in the court case all they had to prove was one insistence of him physically touching her...and that would be enough to call him a 'wife beater'. His actions being in self defence were just not considered relevant.  

The position by the majority...is that women can be as physically violent as they like...but because they are physically smaller... it somehow doesn't count.

It's just crazy...what about the emotional and psychological affects on the men?",2020-11-14T23:28:27Z,1
333,UgxZdQsqewS2hponbHl4AaABAg,Tiffany C,"I think the exact part of the problem however is that she doesn‚Äôt have enough consistent wounds to be able to claim injury because she didn‚Äôt want anybody to hurt her pretty little face. Rocky is supposed to also be a ‚Äúmartial arts expert‚Äú so you can‚Äôt tell me that if she was willing, Rocky wouldn‚Äôt have popped her one at least once. They did not do enough to fake her injuries or the scene, which is why they didn‚Äôt have the believability from the police. She wasn‚Äôt willing to go that far. 

To me that also supports the notion that her abuse angle wasn‚Äôt part of the con until way later. I think she wanted to marry Johnny long enough that she could have a shot at half of his wealth and then walk away. By the time all the drama happened with his management company, and he was about done with her nonsense, he started talking about domestic abuse, and she probably saw the writing on the wall. So believing he was just about broke and that he was liable to rat her out as an abuser, she tried to get there first with the accusations so that she could capitalize on publicity, make as much money off of him as possible by ransoming him out in the divorce, only he decided to take his power back and take her down.

That‚Äôs why I think she doesn‚Äôt have enough good actual evidence to try and make people believe it, it was initially something that they did on the fly, so she had to resort to using old photos and videos she took just to humiliate him. I even think the rhinoplasty picture was her just showing off after her surgery. She tried to parlay that into evidence of abuse.",2020-11-14T22:51:52Z,0

345,UgyN396jmltZskTqIl54AaABAg,Tiffany C,"@JorjeeZeAlien I think Jo showed her blind spot when she made the transphobic comments that she did, and I think the distinction you‚Äôre trying to make is the point that I made in this video, although it was a very minor point. I would however actually class Rowling as another subset of feminism, which is the white straight fragile type that does not believe in intersectionalism. It‚Äôs problematic, in a completely different way from straight up misandry.

There are misandrists hiding within the feminist movement that give us all a bad name. It‚Äôs kind of like union busters posing as Teamsters, or way back in the day when Pinkerton posed as striking workers to help break up and end the strikes. They have swung the pendulum so far into the opposite direction to man hating that they are the exact, equally as dark, antithesis to misogyny. They are both equal and opposite. So when people criticize all feminists, they‚Äôre essentially throwing the baby out with the bathwater and missing the fact that the actual feminist movement is and has always been about true equality and not some sort of retribution. 

There are women who swing way too far into it, Amber and her herd I think are part of that, with Kathy Griffin riding her coattails. 

I think Amanda de Cadenet realized what kind of damage Amber was doing and stepped away. Jennifer Howell is another one with a conscience who refuses to back Amber because she knows the truth.

382,UgwkKcrtoo3EBMk_5DB4AaABAg,Tiffany C,"@Tamarahope77 I have been subject to the kind of intimidation that comes with what you‚Äôre talking about. The difference is when domestic violence comes into play, they use space and proximity to intimidate you. It‚Äôs not just walking around slamming cabinets. Nearly everyone does that. 

What Johnny is doing in the video is not even paying her any attention, therefore he is not trying to intimidate her with the physicality. In fact, for the majority of the video he pays her no mind whatsoever. The fact that she keeps calling out to him instead of feeding into the hedge and trying to be as insignificant as possible is proof that she had no fear of him even when he was angry. 

Conversely, my brother punched a wall once right in front of my aunt‚Äôs face. Did he hit her? No. But he used his size, strength, anger, and that exertion of force to try and intimidate her. You are correct in that physicality can be an indicator of domestic violence, but there are other factors that have to be taken into consideration. 

In Johnny Depp‚Äòs case, by all accounts he attacks things and not people. His former partners having been with him for even longer than Amber Heard coming forward to say that he is not abusive in a relationship is QUITE significant and it cannot be overlooked. I can‚Äôt stress that enough. 

Winona Ryder was with him for four years and she was largely inexperienced when she got into the relationship. Though they parted ways, to this day she still stands for him and that is huge. Vanessa Paradis was with him for 14 years. To never raise a hand to a woman in that length of time indicates that if he was ever going to do it he would have surely with her. 

Domestic abusers abuse their partners, it is literally in the definition. When it comes down to it, Johnny may attack a hotel room or a kitchen, but he never has turned his anger on his partner. 

In all of the illegal audio that Amber Heard had over the course of their marriage where she filmed him without his consent, never once do you see or hear anything about him hitting her. After a point, the absence of a thing is evidence itself. 

Taking away the gender bias, every single thing that Amber Heard has done on the other hand is indicative of a domestic violence perpetrator. She took pictures and video to humiliate him, and has no leg to stand on when it comes to true evidence of abuse by him. She is the only one who has a record with regard to domestic abuse, and he is the only one who has medical records proving abuse within his relationship with her. After a point, it is a no-brainer.",2020-11-15T15:56:11Z,2
383,UgwkKcrtoo3EBMk_5DB4AaABAg,Tamarahope77,"@Tiffany C Attacking property is scary and is enough, where I live, to qualify as domestic violence. Domestic violence doesn't have to include beating the spouse. It only have to include coercion and control.",2020-11-15T08:55:08Z,0

394,Ugyce3TjUm9BmHWZDkh4AaABAg,Tiffany C,"I feel the same, and I do have domestic violence survivors in my circle as well. One is female, one is male. I remember the female confiding in me the revenge fantasy that she had about her husband, so when I saw Johnny Depp‚Äòs texts to Paul Bettany, I really didn‚Äôt think anything of it. It‚Äôs like I said in the video, it‚Äôs very common for victims to have fantasies of vengefulness in order to try and take their power back. 

Venting does not make one violent. My friend fantasized about taking the frying pan full of hot grease off the stove and just dumping it on him, grabbing her daughter and running. The guy I know on the other hand, had to have so much proof before he even had believability. Fortunately in conversations with his wife, who was also a friend, I had already put two and two together. So when he eventually showed me a video of her drunk and chasing after him, beating him with a candle, all it did was confirm suspicions that I already had. 

It takes people having their eyes open to the signs and knowing what they are hearing. 

At one point in my research when I was first reading up on the case, I read an interview with Amber that she did where she spoke about the trials and what not, and she said something to the effect that she would always be out there and he would never get away. And that is the voice of an obsessed abuser. It‚Äôs so obvious to anybody who lays bias aside and takes a objective look at everything that‚Äôs out there",2020-11-13T12:29:51Z,17

Even the James Corden interview had no swelling whatsoever despite all the make up she had on. I used Taylor Swift and her busted lip as an excellent example of how you cannot hide swelling even behind a crap ton of make up, especially red lipstick. 

Both girls wore red lipstick, Taylor at a red carpet event, and Amber on stage for the interview. Taylor‚Äòs lip is obviously busted and swollen, Amber is pulling her face and stretching her mouth in expressions that would re-open a split lip if she had had one.

She had a real problem in court with the fact that no one ever tells him no.

I have been following this situation since the very beginning.. years now.. every point you have made i have made so many times.. also.. to her end game.. and this is scary! If you look into the texts between herself and her ""friends"" you have her and josh sending pictures of knives to each other.. talking about Johnny.. at one point in one of the text where josh sends her a picture of a knife she gets excited and talks about using it on JD! Josh then makes some kind of comment like, it's not to use on Johnny, Amber.. or something to that fact.. I like so many others believe they were planning more then just taking half of his money.. i honestly believe that if he wouldn't have gotten out when he did this would be an "" i had to defend myself"" and they would have seriously hurt him.. i don't even want to put it into words but you get where I'm going.. 

I was abused first by my father, who treated his kids worse then animals until DSS and the state police finally found us and got us to our mom when I was 13.. he had kidnapped us for almost four years.. then i meet my kids dad in school.. love of my life! Was with him for almost 20 years.. I was also abused by him.. i FINALLY had enough almost five years ago now after he had almost killed me twice.. i didn't realize he had gotten into heroin and anything else you can imagine.. i didn't know those signs.. when I found the stuff and i asked him about it wanting to honestly help him i swear his eyes were black.. all he kept screaming as he was literally choking the life out of me was where was his stuff.. i had never even moved his ""stuff""

So with that said.. and like you have said.. there are signs when someone is abused.. and signs of abusers.. for instance.. it's been almost five years and I'm still single.. i don't trust men.. or many people to be honest now . I've been diagnosed since with severe PTSD.. thought i was dying.. him, he was with a bartender in a matter of days and then had multiple different relationships like right after.. people are only abused and take that stupid shit because they honestly care, Love that person! It destroys you to think that even defending yourself or calling the police will hurt them.. and then if it happens you do everything in your power to try to fix it.. i call it mind fucking! That's what i would tell my ex all the time.. all the lies . Going. Away for weeks coming back with the worst excuses.. ugh.. anyways . I see so much of everything i have been through in Johnny Depp.. actually, all his stuff and what happened to me was almost at the same time.. sorry for the rant.. but yes.. she's a narcissist, like my ex.. and if you have gone through the same you can spot them just through simple statement's or actions they do",2020-11-17T19:59:02Z,5
441,Ugzn1LkslZtWHj_s6dJ4AaABAg,Eliza Winters,"@Tiffany C I think this chronology of events makes perfect sense and explains her behavior a lot. Thank you for that. I also think that there might be more to it. I think she planned it all out and worked at several options simultaneously of ruining him, taking his money and propelling herself to the cream of the crops. It's probably not quite accidental that she chose abuse and say not blackmail as her ultimate tactics although she definitely was planning blackmail while working at the folio of pictures of him in the most compromising positions. It seems from the broad range of her volatile attempts - outrageous demands, humiliating and abusive treatment, take it to the limit dares, friendships with guys, etc., she was trying to rattle and hopefully break him, which would have made everything else easy. But she underestimated him. And that's when the real turd came out with all the rage unleashed. A narcissist craving for completion of her plan, world wide attention, full control, all the things that she feared would slip through her fingers. And Johnny looked such an easy target with his free spirit shit and passing occurences. That's how Johnny Depp became an ""abuser"".

What makes me really angry are people like Sharon Osbourne saying Johnny Depp's marriage is like her own, mutually volatile. I'm sorry but even if she had been present there (which she wasn't), her marriage has lasted for a better part of the century, so there's no comparison whatsoever. But also doesn't hurt to remember Tolstoy's classics: ""All happy marriages are happy the same way, while the unhappy marriages are unhappy in their own way."" She should go and educate herself, as you say, before opening her mouth.",2020-11-17T03:56:04Z,6

445,UgyndXTiVdEtfksfAwN4AaABAg,Tiffany C,"@Meme Koval i‚Äôm seriously hoping they do have a DV expert, but I cannot really pin down exactly when the abuse hoax started. I think in part she just wanted to say that he was a boozer and drug addict and she couldn‚Äôt live with it anymore. That‚Äôs most of the videos and pictures that she took of him, trying to prove that he was always passed out or tanked up on something. It has always been a long con game to get his money, the only thing that changed was how she planned to do it and what scandal she wanted to stir up.

I think the abuse angle actually came up when she thought that he was going to call her out for abusing him. At that point it was the height of the me too movement and she seized the opportunity for maximum publicity and believability. 

She‚Äôs not very bright, so she‚Äôs not really that much of a strategist. She is just very opportunistic and impulsive, and I think he knew that she had gotten way in over her head and didn‚Äôt want to embarrass her both because of her mental illnesses and he didn‚Äôt want to prolong the scandal for himself either. I think he slowly come to realize though that you can‚Äôt reason with someone like that so you have to basically turn the light on them and show them for what they are.

So I do think the defamation case is going to go better because not only have they subpoenaed her medical records, but they have advantage of the believability of law-enforcement here. By subpoenaing her medical records that should also include any mental health evaluations. But the fact that LAPD is actually trained in domestic violence should go a long way too. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs one of the most consistent calls that they get, so they are well-versed in what it looks like.",2020-11-24T21:11:05Z,0

It does not make it better to treat men how women have historically been treated. It is just as problematic, and we really have no room for that. 

Equality is absolutely what we should shoot for. There have been far too many conversations about toxic masculinity in the past, but it is time to discuss toxic femininity and what it is. If toxic masculinity is overly aggressive and damaging to men, toxic femininity is passive aggressive at best, but subversive and deceitful at worst. The way that Amber Heard has used the media and (in the past) public opinion to gaslight and further abuse Johnny Depp is one excellent example of how underhanded female aggression can be. 

And you‚Äôre right, it is absolutely astounding that after the audio was dropped any organizations whatsoever continue to support her. It‚Äôs showing a blind spot that they are not willing to realize they have.",2020-11-11T22:51:04Z,7
475,UgzSkkUPLUgnLzlnRid4AaABAg,S K,"@Tiffany C I've been sharing this when I see people honestly asking what the deal is, aren't they both toxic, wasn't the relationship toxic?  So hopefully people unaware will get a better understanding of the relationship dynamics at play here.

Toxic femininity is to blame for the poor reputation of feminism imo.  Feminism is about equality and not being better than men.  We cannot expect to be treated equally if a vocal group (hopefully minority) of women insist on standing on the throat of men proclaiming their superiority. That doesn't work. We all have to learn and grow and move forward together determined to do better for everyone.  

I have thoughts on that but they must be better organized before I spout off.

What is infuriating to me is these organizations that still support her and see nothing wrong with championing this kind of behaviour. It does a disservice to women across the board, it sets back the feminist movement by vilifying men and anyone who doesn't agree with them.  

To call intimate partner violence survivors ""bots"" ""stans"" ""fan girls"" is so harmful. They are minimalizing experiences and trauma.  I am sick to death of seeing Robbie Kaplan, who once represented Harvey Weinstein, yet again diminishing victims suffering by supporting her, tweeting about what a victory it is.

There‚Äôs been plenty of discussion about toxic masculinity, but almost none about toxic femininity which is subversive and often times passive aggressive. To be as overtly aggressive as she is should really be seen as anomalous, but the fact that she hides it I suppose is what‚Äôs subversive. 

It is also extremely problematic that most of the traits he exhibits of a domestic violence victim ‚Äì ‚Äì leaning into substance abuse, engaging in revenge fantasies, are very very common and not something that we should shame domestic violence survivors for doing.

Might be our understanding and meaning is different but there absolutely are couples who beat each other up and where the violence is situational in nature. That‚Äôs not domestic abuse as per the definition in PD 12J in British Civil Courts. My experience is that such violence is less common than domestic abuse. Domestic abuse takes place only when there is an abuse of power from one person to another. It‚Äôs always about that abuse of power, whether there is violence or not.

I am sure AH made sure he knew this fact when she had a secret meeting with Justice Nicols during the UK trial. I pray Johnny Depp‚Äôs legal team subpoena Justice Nicols to find out what transpired in the secret meeting between him and AH.",2020-12-06T20:17:36Z,0

I'm sure there were a lot of English people who were very shocked at the outcome Johnny's got a lot of fans over there probably more than in the US.",2020-12-02T22:51:30Z,0

481,Ugz83LnMcIUXOHgDghZ4AaABAg,Grimm Wicked,He will he lost in the UK because apparently they don't believe in perjury but her sister lied under oath when she said her sister never assaulted her yet her's testimony stood the Virginia court case would not be so loose with the law.,2020-11-30T08:34:36Z,2
482,UgwY6TYs1reHAk6Hsjt4AaABAg,Sarah Wells,"@Katrien Cornelis the bullshit ometer is real, mine went off loudly when I saw her coming out of the court building with her flattened down hair and make up ""bruises "" with her head on a swivel, a real abuse victim will hide, head down eyes averted, just get me away from this, I have been that victim and she enrages me.",2020-11-19T22:49:06Z,0
483,UgwY6TYs1reHAk6Hsjt4AaABAg,Tiffany C,"@Light House Psychology The bathroom issue was put to her in the divorce. She sat for a deposition, which is what I was referring to. Even then she was quite obviously lying under oath and could not successfully explain away why she was pursuing him. 

She started trying to say that the only time she ever hit him was over the staircase incident, but then they pulled out the bathroom audio which proved that wasn‚Äôt the case either. She really doubles down on lying in that. 

And even worse, we now know that the staircase incident wasn‚Äôt true either, because there are witnesses to the fact that she nearly threw Whitney down the stairs, which is categorically *not* the story she just telling in the divorce case deposition.",2020-11-17T14:39:45Z,0
484,UgwY6TYs1reHAk6Hsjt4AaABAg,Light House Psychology,"If the lawyers put the bathroom issue to her, this wasn't done in the UK trial I don't think, she will just come up with another elaborate lie to explain it away.  When someone is prepared to lie with impunity whilst under oath and commit perjury with no fear, it is almost impossible to mount an effective defence against that. The VA lawyers will really need to come up with a much better strategy than JD's lawyers had in the UK.",2020-11-17T03:44:35Z,0
485,UgwY6TYs1reHAk6Hsjt4AaABAg,Tiffany C,"@James Stewart that sounds pretty accurate. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs this video where I talked about a male friend, or if it was in the comments.

I realized my own bias when I believed his wife at first when she told me she was being victimized, but it took many conversations with her to slowly come to the conclusion that it was not her who was being abused but him. Too many things didn‚Äôt add up in her story.She straight up gaslighted him through the whole relationship until she died. By the time he showed me a video of her drunk, chasing and beating him with a candle, it only confirmed what I already knew. But therein is the exact problem with believing all women right from the jump. That said, it‚Äôs hard to hold space for and support victims when you still have to wait for the smoke to clear to get the full story",2020-11-14T13:01:14Z,1
486,UgwY6TYs1reHAk6Hsjt4AaABAg,James Stewart,"@Tiffany C Haven't  researched  this  but heard that about 40% of dv calls to police,  the man is the victim but when the woman is the victim the damage suffered is alot  greater.",2020-11-14T12:50:58Z,2
487,Ugx2K_2qAgmMBjR5ur14AaABAg,Tanya M,"@Light House Psychology I agree. Seeing what happened in the UK trial, my expectations of the 'justice system' are very cautious. There was an interesting phrase that I heard recently that really struck me- ""good people don't realize just how BAD bad people are.""",2020-11-17T20:17:31Z,4
488,Ugx2K_2qAgmMBjR5ur14AaABAg,Light House Psychology,Unless the jury are 'tampered with' and 'bought off' ... there are people with huge amounts of wealth who may have a vested interest in the outcome and I would put nothing past them.,2020-11-17T03:47:48Z,2
