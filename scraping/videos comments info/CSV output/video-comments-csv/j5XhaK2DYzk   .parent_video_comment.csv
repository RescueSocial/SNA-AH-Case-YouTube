2,UgwqdbbapxzkSkYhQt94AaABAg,"I didnt like aquaman 1...it was like power rangers kids tv show...there was no chemistry between amber and Jason at all and the acting was wooden...wont be watching aquaman 2. I dont think she should have the part if found guilty PURELY because if johnny had abused her he was sacked from pirates because of it she should rightly be sacked too. 
I think because its a kid thing she isnt a great role model being verbally and physically abusive to more than one person and totally off her trolley on drink and drugs in various interviews or clips...however I also dont think its right she HAS to be a role model either (its not her responsibility to raise other peoples kids) lots of stars in hollywood have lost their career over being abusive to women so amber shouldnt get off scot free because she is a woman.
Its not even just about the abuse its the whole scenario. Dating him to give her a leg up in the movies and marrying him for the minimum amount of time to get a divorce settlement worth millions then blackmailing him and then faking the abuse publicly seeking for him to lose his career and lively hood whilst her and her friends had all been leeching off him...he has kids and they were also bullied at school...
She is a nasty vindictive liar. I personally wouldnt trust her as far as I could throw her. Spiteful filing for the divorce the day after his mum died...he isnt the only one she abused though...another ex refused to press charges but police witnessed it so she still had to spend a night in the cell...poor elon has sported a few bruises too but so did amber while she was having an affair and johnny was away...so where did the bruises come from? Johnny was on tour...",Jay A Errington,0,2020-10-25T20:54:23Z

5,UgySj8BgjkOR0dnrE-p4AaABAg,Johnny is getting bad press as he is in a lawsuit  with Murdoch media but the public support is there,Moira O'Reilly,1,2020-10-20T19:45:06Z
6,UgwSMoLAqI8koelv10x4AaABAg,I still think amber needs to be blacklisted from Hollywood or terminated,Redmist 2004,1,2020-10-20T18:17:39Z
7,UgxkOUhqlERH3ygcXrl4AaABAg,Johnny is a main character. The story revolves around his character so reduced screen time makes zero sense. Amber Heard is a bit player so she could be replaced by any other actor or character and it wouldn‚Äôt impact anything.,Ride or Dis,2,2020-10-20T11:29:02Z
8,UgyI5aZm0z0p1oVFUTR4AaABAg,"You are aware of the petition to remove her from Aquaman 2, aren't you?  Its up to 500,000 signatures.   Warner Bros can't afford to take a chance on her - not to mention the filming is in Australia.  There is a good chance they might not let her in",Scott Cook,1,2020-10-20T04:52:16Z
9,UgwBIRM_fGiupNQcJO94AaABAg,And there are tons of people who know about her and Depp that will refuse to see the movie. With her pushing to destroy a man just because she could and no one would believe him I find her disgusting. To the point that it would break the immersion of the movie. Replace her asap please.,EbanSoul,4,2020-10-19T16:26:05Z

12,Ugx3Y73iS-e-2B9F8ZB4AaABAg,Good video! I think more studios should make films this way when controversial on screen talent is involved. Studios may want to spend a little extra and make different 'cuts' of a film to save a lot of money and bad brand press later.,Ridiculous Thoughts,0,2020-10-19T13:35:41Z
13,UgyG814qeuUxUpLCsQh4AaABAg,I doubt Warner Bros is firing Amber Heard. Amber Heard will still be in Aquaman 2.,Official Filmilen,1,2020-10-19T13:33:13Z
