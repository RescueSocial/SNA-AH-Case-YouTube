2,Ugx8at-xrpfhkK6R6aB4AaABAg,"Maybe she does lack oxytocin, but she also abuses mood altering substances so I think it was very easy for her to loosen her grip on reality/morality which has landed us here. She probably does have trauma but that was never from Johnny and instead of choosing to rise above whatever abuse she suffered when she was younger she chose to become the abuser. It's actually quite common for victims of abuse to become the abuser in an attempt to get their power back. But at the end of the day, it all comes back to money with her. Never about wrong or right. She just thought, ""Well if he's going to divorce me anyways I need to get as much money as I can in court, and this is the best way to do that.."" That's it.

18,UgyA-LF5fGXUtQHT-8t4AaABAg,"Really interesting. This is something I have wondered about for a long time. I wonder if birth order has anything to do with it. AH is the eldest and maybe felt as a child that grown-ups don't make a fuss about being abused (her mum) and those in charge are abusers (her dad), which might explain why she called Johnny a baby a lot, (like her sister). Johnny was the youngest, (like Whitney) and I wonder about his other siblings. Also in Johnny's case there were more siblings and a single parent. Johnny also had a guitar at a young age allowing him to focus on something else (escape). Maybe if you have an escape, you have more oxytocin? Amber was most likely a fighter and fought back for control and respect in her family. Perhaps because of this she had less empathy for her mother who she felt should have stood up to her dad. She maybe found ways to control her father by saying and doing all the right things so she could control him (stopping him from hitting her), whilst despising him. She then controlled her mum and her sister, perhaps by negotiating with him on their behalf. She then controlled him later with money. She learned the art of manipulation young, therefore empathy is not important for survival. 
Johnny's empathy could be because he just kept out of the way when his mother was home. He knew that she had to work hard to support 4 kids, and when he comes across anyone in a bad position he can empathise and he knows that he has a ways of making people happy. Making people happy, makes him feel happy, probably what gives him more oxytocin. Just guessing of course.",M P,2,2021-04-21T01:58:02Z

25,Ugw8WiDnQYRMlgPR5Wt4AaABAg,Nice work Dr Soup) in phycology oxytocin is definitely a factor in mood formation as it is involved in social bonding however it’s a chemical produced by the hypothalamus and therefore only influences mood it doesn’t control it so Amber WAS physically and possibly sexually abused as a young girl but so was my ex girlfriend and she was simply selfish by her own choice not because she didn’t know what she was doing being under the influence of oxytocin)) However with people like Amber ect there is a certain amount of being wilfully unaware of their effect on people but that just cognitive dissonance not choice bound lies and manipulation when you ruin someone’s life or and break the law constantly and have a unwarranted view of there grandiosity.Amber like my ex CHOSE to act the way they do and have in life.,The Killing Joke,3,2021-04-20T05:14:50Z
26,Ugz49yBQng92SjLiDn14AaABAg,"I agree with this theory. Growing up me and my siblings all had no love and shared the worst life can throw at you. LSS only a cousin and I came out like Johnny, caring and aware of the hell we went through and did not want anyone to live that hell. Where the others gave up due to the pain inflicted. The others love to inflict that pain on anyone but its their partners who got it the very worst. No matter how much my cousin and I did to try and help it was useless. They all are like amber but hard to believe maybe, are worse. They kept pushing limits with people till some broke...many funerals over them taking lives and few murders. The parents ALWAYS bail out the bad seeds but straight up told us we were pos for trying to help them, we were trying to change them! Yeah to be better ppl not the gd monsters they grew to be! We got shit on and hated by the very ppl who raised us and the others flocked to them like bees to honey. Even though they endured the horrible abuse at the same hands they said meh to it, was normal and me and my cousin were they freaks. Sadly a few years ago my cousin was murdered by our family after trying one last time to help out a fallen brother fresh from jail. I moved far away and watch from a far now hoping still that they will wake up... 
I have been asked why do i even care about saving those who threw me to the pit of hell? That may never have an answer I can give I just feel I have to try. i came out from it so i feel that there is hope in their souls somewhere, maybe?",Animation Alliance,3,2021-04-20T04:22:39Z

28,Ugzb0w8nMImhQYe1TLR4AaABAg,"She wanted all the fame and money in the world. The problem was that her ""beauty"" was extremely standard, and sub par at best, and never stood a chance at standing out amongst others her age. The lack of talent was another thing, but she managed to nab a role in The Rum Diary, and she caught the eye of one of the greatest actors of his generation - Johnny Depp. After his split with his partner of 14 years - Vanessa Paradis, he soon after got with Amber. She had found a loophole and shortcut to fame, because her roles only increased. Though it had little to do with talent and more so to do with the fact that she was with Johnny Depp. His family and friends saw the evil in that woman from the beginning, and tried to convince Johnny to end it all. Sadly, it was a case of love being blind, because Johnny refused to end things, and he made the biggest mistake of proposing to her, then marrying her... without a prenuptial agreement. 

At that point everything was perfectly set in order for Amber, and she then really showed her true colours towards Johnny, who during that time was suffering a relapse in drug and alcohol addiction, therefore Johnny was at his most vulnerable, she began abusing him, and his vulnerability further increased with the death of his mother, at the same time he was also suffering from financial issues. She probably had also seen Gone Girl, which allowed her to get a bit creative with her plan. She began crying ""Wolf!"" and the public instantly believed her because we must ""Believe All Women."" 

A lot of the world turned on Johnny, but as time went on, eventually evidence of her perhaps not being the victim after all, began to leak. Therefore the much beloved hashtag: ""#JusticeForJohnnyDepp"" was born. Victories sadly were few and far between for him. He lost his role as Gellart Grindelwald in Fantastic Beasts 3, and he lost his London case to The Sun, which referred to him as a: ""wife beater"". He attempted a retrial though sadly, yet not surprisingly, he failed. Though as of recent, his case to prove his innocence has been rather strong. Many know now that Johnny never did anything wrong, except one: He loved her. 

Thankfully he managed to figure out that any mutual love that was shared between the two was all an illusion. Now as time goes on and Johnny's case gets stronger, and Amber continues to cry wolf. More and more figure out the lies created by Amber and her team. Amber obviously doesn't know how that fable ends. Once you've cried ""Wolf!"" One too many times, eventually no one believes you. She also didn't know another thing: Her career is always be in the shadow of Johnny's. After all, he is the reason any of us even know of her existence. When we think of her, we instantly think of Johnny. She'll never stand on her own. When she dies, she'll be remembered as all the things, she wouldn't wanna be remembered for: Johnny Depp's ex-wife, an abuser, a gold digger, a liar. That'll give us one thing to smile about.

36,UgwvApIvgrXaqsLrqdB4AaABAg,"I wanna leave a comment before I watch this to see if what I say lines up with your theories. 

In my opinion, this all happened because of clout, fame, opportunity, and fear. Due to her abusive past and narcissistic tendencies, it probably started out as minor arguments which escalated to abuse towards Depp and due to fear of truth getting out she projected all of her behavior onto Johnny Depp thus all the things she said happened to her were lies because it was likely twisted versions of what she did to him.

She likely looked into different scenarios and stories from other real victims and weaved in into her narrative and because she's a gold digger as stated by her divorce demands and lack of charity donations,  she likely knew she could make a lot of money by marrying him and divorcing him especially if it ends because of Johnny Depp's bad behavior and likely roped her friends in on the hoax with the promise of money, fame and thus planned and got ideas from them too.

If Amber and her friends can lie about the penthouse police incident then they can lie about everything, the video evidence proves the lengths they went to orchestrate this hoax.",Rob,0,2021-04-19T22:28:45Z

She may also have unresolved anger at her father and by extension men for what she perceived as wrong and is out to level the field by claiming to champion 'victims' and beating on men and those who are 'masculine'. Her intellect isn't like an example of any spectacular heights, except for a knack to follow money and popularity. the glamourizing of victimization trend caught her eye and her oxytocin is poorly developed, not challenged by the inner ability to identify right from wrong by accepting responsibility and all the icky feelings that entails, but which allow us to grow. There's an epidemic of toddlers who physically grew up but mentally and emotionally are still tantrum-throwing toddlers. But i don't think she ruined John; if fact, she may have been the force to get him to face his own demons by, well, being a demon. Thanks for the vid, Dr Soup :)",Francine M,0,2021-04-19T21:47:20Z

He said things like, ""she was out of her mind and didn't know what she was doing,"" regarding his mother's ab*se. He also said, when talking about playing bad characters, that no one just decides to be evil and destroy others. In real life, it looks as though his ex wife did just that.

Listening to the tapes and she clearly wishes to be in control and show how great she is and demanding the lime lite to prove she did not deserve the treatment she got. JD showed in many photos and on the tapes, he has a desperate need to be loved. He never apears to be saying how great he is as an actor, he apears rather shy when he is praised.
