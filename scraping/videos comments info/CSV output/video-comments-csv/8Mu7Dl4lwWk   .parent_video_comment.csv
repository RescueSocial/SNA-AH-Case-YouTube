This is a sad story. I implore you to share this video and this story all over your own pages, Johnny Depp got railroaded here. What happened is immensely unfair. I listened to the full audio in question, and while I'm sure Depp had his own struggles - I don't believe he abused her. When you get to be a fly on the wall to hear them fight - its impossible to not hear Amber's manipulation, and emotional abuse. This was clearly a toxic relationship gone bad, and she is far more guilty than she's lead on. Please LIKE this video, engage (civally) down below, and share it around. Since the media isn't covering it, we need to get the word out on this.",Popcorned Planet,278,2020-02-02T04:20:30Z

Amber heard divorced and sent an extortion letter demanding money to keep quiet to johnny depp, and when he denied her demands, she accused him of DV.
Depps ex managers are being sued and investigated by the federals. They never provided any proof.   
Amber heard refused to give deposition under oath three times and sold her evidence to tabloids instead of giving them to the court.

the police confirmed there was no evidence of abuse.                                           
Amber Heard dropped the allegations with prejudice. Johnny Depp had a long list of evidence to prove she lied. (One being the leaked tape)
Johnny Depp also had over 30 witnesses to confirmed she lied about abuse.

One day to stop her from hitting me I held her down till she calmed down and the next day she shows me her wrist and tells me she could have me jailed for that mark. I noted that mentally and never made that mistake again. We had kids where I was the primary parent, I worked nights and took care of the small children from morning till night yet she would threaten to take them and not let me see them. Non stop mental abuse. This is real and its more and more common. 
     Finally I broke my leg, (was a professional athlete). After a year of my 4 year battle to save my leg she literally asks me out of the blue, ""Just tell me when you can handle all the bills and I'll move out, I'm only staying with you because I feel sorry for you"". HAHAHA I thought about it and realized that she only paid for the house phone, and cable and I could live without both so I said, ""Can you be out by the weekend"" and she moved out. I kept the kids and she had them on the weekends... LOL  Best thing that I ever did.  Its 100% wrong to hit a woman, but watching or reading about a story of abuse, doesn't tell the whole story.

91,Ugw73p1L8SlR6Q3ef894AaABAg,"One of the main issues I see with the US, is that justice seems to favor the one who speaks first, especially since social media is usually the first place issues get released to, and from there it just becomes a case of public sentencing.


Stars especially are tackling most of their issues by making the public on social media, which gives a very bad precedent to everyone else.
And it's so easy for them to milk the public outrage by connecting their issues to the #MeToo movement and whatever else. They media and the public outrage take care of their issue.


Unfortunately the same shit won't work for Debrah, who works at the 7 Eleven, or for Mark who works at Car Wash, because nobody gives a flying fuck about them. It's not something the media can milk for views. 
And your children are growing up thinking that shit can be solved by posting it on social media, provided they don't get shot during the school lunch break ... and it's fucked up.


And it's all thanks to the simple fact that people in the US love the drama. Give the people what they want, and nobody bets an eye to shit that's pilling up.",Nandor Szabo,1,2020-02-03T14:02:33Z

Because when an older person walks away from an exchange it is a definite and clear sign of disrespect. Since what the person who is walking away is saying by doing walking away is saying that she is not worth the time and mental effort to deal with a disagreement. And this is magnified when the person walking away is much older than them such as in this case Johnny Depp. Thus I have to side with Amber on this.,Nicholas Lin,0,2020-02-03T11:02:31Z

Narrative wise, the films have run their course so it makes sense that the studio would want to drop an expensive star and reboot the franchise on a much smaller budget and new cast.

4. She does feel like him not accepting her physical violence is wrong.

When he said she was punching him, the only retort she had was to complain about the language of it, she took issue with calling it a punch, accepting instead that she was hitting him, not really a significant distinction. She also didn't attempt to deflect by claiming he was violent too, which she would have done if he had been. Furthermore, she mocked him for complaining about her violence. Obviously she thinks being violent is okay.

Hearing his pain,anguish and suffering really hurts and Johnny is as gentle as he looks.Johnny is as gentle as a children's teddy bear.
Johnny had made a lot of Children smile when he was a collaborator for the Make a Wish foundation(I don't know if he still is involved with them) and even though he made the dying children smile and be with them for the day behind that pleasant demeanor he was battling his inner demons that is Amber Heard's abuses back at home.
Seeing those Children made him more happier than he ever was.
I hope Johnny can get the redemption he truly deserves and at the same time have Amber Heard pay for her crimes.",BRUTALSHANZ1988,1,2020-02-02T18:29:05Z

For years many of his supporters, many survivors of DV - mostly female - among them, have been fighting to get his side of the story be heard in the media. But he didn¬¥t get the chance. Media was quick to cancel him for her mere words without evidence. Johnny`s court documents consist of more than 40 testimonies of witnesses - several having witnessed Amber abuse Johnny in real time -, 87 CCTV, that show Amber without bruises, when she claimed to have them, police and medical reports  and audio like this recent one. And still media would turn the other way, won¬¥t get his evidence out there. They just won¬¥t. For 4 YEARS so many people have been trying to get the information out there. Since 2016 Amber Heard has been slandering his name, accusing him of abuse, without a single, reliable evidence. Up to this day she can¬¥t provide evidence, that he abused her. And still media stays cricket silent. We, people of the Depp community, were more than happy, when #JusticeForJohnnyDepp went viral yesterday. Many, many of them - including me - spent all night retweeting the hashtag and finally, finally, media seems to wake up and can¬¥t ignore his evidence anymore. Victims got to be heard. Both sides need to be heard. Not only the female one. Looks like media can¬¥t deal with a male victim and a female perpetrator. Johnny lost so much, but he keeps fighting for his good name. He sues Amber Heard for defamation now, and he is willing to get everything out there, if needed. He is willing to get stripped naked in front of the world in the spotlight for the sake of truth. Victims need to be heard. Men need to be heard too. Your video is one step in the right direction. I will happily share it.

She married him for a few months, falsely accused him, and got 7 million dollars out of him. If she at least claimed to be bi it would make more sense.
