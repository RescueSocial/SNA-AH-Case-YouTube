0,UgyjWCjn3g6RIhEYaKZ4AaABAg,Matilda Project's,"@Yuna McHill I do get what your saying. But I do NOT believe in hate or revenge. That being said, amber has not paid her due,. Did not even own it, out loud, (in tapes, yes) but who knows what she tells people that we don't know, about those tapes, like momoa. 
Understand though info. Is out there. If we know they know, and don't think it didn't circulate around them first, before we heard.  It's a choice to believe it or not, but at this point no one can deny knowing the truth. Her tapes, she made, her voice owning what she did and he didn't do. 
Look at what she accused him of, then look at evidence, she's crazy, more important it has been proven the UK was apart of it. Further, Momoa proved he does research, but evidently he is either not good at it or he chooses not to believe it. In which case makes him a bad guy, a cheating husband (because why else would he side with her at this point), or he is just plain stupid ( sorry, but what do you think he is gonna say in the end, ""I did't know."" Which would make him stupid.)  Furthermore, anyone siding with her is bad at this point, because if you do your research, you will discover the more she gets away with the further she goes (would you high 5 someone about to drive a car drunk, knowing they went to prison for vehicular homicide?  Amber is a destructive person, we know this. She was a stripper, is an alcoholjc, drug addict, domestic violence abuser, violent history.  She just bought a baby to shield herself from responsibility for her malicious wrong doings. Momoa congradulated her. 
We kow in the public that Hollywood builds up these actors to be heroes among us, it s all bought and paid for, we all want to believe the best in others, but she needs help. 
What do you think they're going to say when she hurts that baby, ""Oops, we didn't know.""  REALLY!!?!",2021-07-11T17:29:59Z,2

Thing is, Aquaman's audience demographics was rather women-tilted, at least in comparison with other superhero flicks (52:48 or something around that). I imagine the sequel's box office forecast estimates not being different in that regard, though other factors will come in play this time, no doubt.",2021-07-01T16:52:22Z,0
8,UgyF1yyP2QfTBL4Bkvt4AaABAg,"Well, well, well, how the turntables",I mean idk. Lsee the media claims its just die hard depp fans that are making a uproar and thats not true.  There are many women behind depp. Yeah momoa is a hottie but its not that serious. As a survivor who never got a win from my abuser its just that much important that depp gets this win.,2021-07-01T16:39:28Z,2

11,UgwG7yurrId56YggbBp4AaABAg,KH8,"Inequality has no bearing on our lives whatsoever?  Are you for real? With a username like that, shows just how far from reality you really are. 

Every day, men are made to pay for children that aren't theirs (and go to PRISON for failing to do so)
Every day innocent men's lives are destroyed by false accusations,  without the right to due process and you don't think that effects US?  I'm a mother to a son and a proud wife to a man who has to keep his mouth shut because he can't risk offending anyone.  
Boys are made to stand up in schools and apologize to girls for being male!  Whatever pill you've taken to completely ignore the world past your own uppity nose should be marketed.

WB has no duty to protect JD, just their own policies which states their employees must maintain a ""no controversy"" standard while in their employ which is what they leveraged when asking JD to resign.   By their OWN policies,  which they DO have an obligation to,  Amber Heard should be gone",2021-07-01T23:25:59Z,1
