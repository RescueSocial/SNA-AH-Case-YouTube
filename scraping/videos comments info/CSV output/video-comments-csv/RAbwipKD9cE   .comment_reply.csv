Why make fun of a blind person, a Asian, a African-American, someone with a cleft pallet, a birth mark, height, whatever. It's not something you can change, you were born that way, never will change and nothing wrong with it. Only insecure people find fault with others unchangeable things. Now attitude, snide, petty, mean, venomous those can be changed  people are that way by choice, people that shit in someone else's bed just to be spiteful, those people are worthy of derision. People that use their social status, wealth or popularity to harm others, they are deserving of mockery and shunning. People that attack and do physical harm to others because of their own sense of entitlement and inflated ego, those people are past the mockery stage and into the criminal, those people should be incarcerated, both as a deterrent and if possible reformation.

So AH mocking people for their physical stature = petty, sadly desperate.
Dishing it out but being so thin skinned to cry the victim afterwards =weak sauce.
