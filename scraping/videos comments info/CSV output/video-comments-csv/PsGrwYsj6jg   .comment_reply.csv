1,Ugw5-kGtmR19Tf4CA8B4AaABAg,Olivia Rogers,"Same. I rarely advocate for actors getting fired regardless of how much I dislike them as people IF I enjoy their work. For instance, I'm still upset about Hartley Sawyer getting James Gunned from the Flash even though I dont approve of those hideous tweets of his. If you're a full on r*pist or something like Cosby, that's different.",2021-03-02T05:31:05Z,1

19,Ugz7HOlaLH_Z3A-8k0Z4AaABAg,Rock Candy,@James Smith sounds about right to me!  The main issue is that she has falsely accused him of abuse when she was the one who hit him - and then she went on to destroy his career and reputation as revenge.

20,Ugz7HOlaLH_Z3A-8k0Z4AaABAg,Rock Candy,"Like i've mentioned before...if you look up Incredibly Average videos it will clear up any misunderstanding.  AH is the abuser.  He was abused by AH (confessed on audio) and then falsely accused of doing those same things.  It's highly interesting if you watch the video series or just one video and will help you understand - so don't just dismiss the idea as 'not interested', pls. :)  Also what else are you doing in these covid times - so look up the videos!!",2021-03-06T11:56:37Z,0

Maybe Depp is 100% in the right, and completely innocent, but he might also be abusive as well. I'm on the side of innocent until proven guilty, but I believe we should all just step back, and let it take its course.
