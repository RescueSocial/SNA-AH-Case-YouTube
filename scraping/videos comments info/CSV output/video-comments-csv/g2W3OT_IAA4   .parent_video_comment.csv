25,UgzsAEw4kP0ywtpbyM14AaABAg,"Of course, she didn't. WB will never say so. They will just announce new plans, shuffle, reshuffle, test the public until they have enough feedback to decide whether Aquaman can stand the box-office test. I think WB made a huge mistake last year of raising her profile during the promotion in order to give buzz to Aquaman. They made another mistake at inflating and fidgeting with production costs and box-office numbers. They made another mistake when they decided to do all Heard's parts in CGI because she was God-awful at it. In her own words, she did ""90 takes"" of the rose-eating scene. Just that scene. Eating the bouquet was 90 takes excruciating. Wan did a good job of covering her lack of talent, but in doing so he tricked and fooled the public. They will pay for their mistakes this time around.",Open Social,0,2020-04-04T15:07:58Z

I wouldn't be surprised if they signed Amber for more than one because they probably had plans for another Aquaman movie, maybe it's also harder or more expensive for them to take her off the movie, violate the contract and recast than losing money from the theatres.

The first one seems deliberately disingenuous while the other seems sincere but unable to separate the evidence from what he wants to believe. They each have a little over five times as many subscribers as you, and I often agree with them on an emotional level, but I think you do a much better job of giving the facts in a fair and accurate way even when they're different from what you would like them to be.

87,UgwX7s3BCS33_q7Eb314AaABAg,"When Amber Heard loses the defamation case, the WB will remove her from the film.  There will be charges brought against Ms. Heard as a result of the many crimes that she has committed in her attempt to frame Mr. Depp. Each fabricated piece of evidence that she produces is a felony. Every deposition under oath is perjury. She sent Mr. Depp a letter, through her lawyer, with her list of financial and property demands OR SHE WOULD PUBLICLY DESTROY MR. DEPP, which is extortion. She attempted to have witnesses CHANGE their statements, which is witness tampering. The list goes on...she will not be available to make movies for years. If Mr. Depp chooses not to pursue this--cases involving Domestic Violence have to be prosecuted by the D.A.",NIBS,24,2020-04-04T02:08:16Z

I saw someone on Twitter a few hours ago who had posted a link to a tabloid saying that Heard was fired.  They swore it was legitimate info, other people were like ""nah give it time first"" and I agree with that approach.

As much as I feel Heard should be fired, I'm doubting it will happen :/.",TheKingOfRuckus,5,2020-04-04T01:54:21Z

I will be the first to celebrate when Amber Heard gets her just desserts, but dude false information actually degenerates credibility. It doesn't help the argument for Johnny Depp, in fact a video like that is something the MSM can point at and call YouTuber's extreme and fanatical instead of well researched and speaking facts.

Agreed. This coronavirus hysteria is driving the world batty. I can't even get packages that have been ""out for delivery"" for the past week. 

Thanks so much for shouting out Darth News. He's a big fan of yours and deserves more subscribers. It's always nice to see YouTubers helping each other. Especially when they are my favorite YouTubers!!",Ariel Coffin,0,2020-04-04T01:35:07Z
