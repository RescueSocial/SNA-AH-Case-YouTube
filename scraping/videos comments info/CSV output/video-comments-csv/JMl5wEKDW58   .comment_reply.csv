104,UgwEskAvHyq_I4zxKV54AaABAg,Luke Maher,"@Why It Matters Podcast there are so many things and stories they could do with Superman. Take inspiration from all the classic storylines and give their own take on it, yet they're more focused on these other movies and spin offs that hardly any of us are asking for. If they had a studio head that loves DC comics or just comics in general, like Marvel has with Kevin Feige. The possibilities of great storytelling for not only Superman, but all the other DC heroes would be endless, even if Marvel and Disney doesn't always stick the landing with each character or movie.",2021-01-15T19:01:04Z,0
105,UgwEskAvHyq_I4zxKV54AaABAg,Why It Matters Podcast,"Totally agree, I think they chose amber just for looks. Which shouldn‚Äôt be the all factor. I mean Jason mamoa doesn‚Äôt look like the blonde aquaman we‚Äôre used to. Yet he carries it really well.

But hey you know Warner bros and DC don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre doing when you can‚Äôt even figure out what to do with Superman. One of the greatest comic characters to ever exist.",2021-01-15T18:36:07Z,2
106,UgwEskAvHyq_I4zxKV54AaABAg,Luke Maher,"@Why It Matters Podcast Exactly! Couldn't have said it better myself. Jason and Emilia already have better chemistry on and off screen than him and Amber ever will. And aside from already being a FAR better actress with actual talent, Emilia is able to express kindness within a character, while also being able to convince us she can hold her own in a fight. Amber, even when she's playing a character who is supposed to be heroic, all we can see is how evil of a person she truly is. Emilia just oozes that role model type, like Gal does. 

I'd be surprised if there's still parents out there that allow their children to look up to Amber as Mera. She doesn't deserve to be Mera or even be allowed to act in general. Besides she doesn't even have anything of value for us to latch onto. There are far better actresses out there in terms of looks and talent. WB should give Emilia the role, but we all know that'd be smart and wise decision, which WB sadly isn't good at making, at least at this moment.",2021-01-15T18:15:02Z,3
107,UgwEskAvHyq_I4zxKV54AaABAg,Why It Matters Podcast,"If it was up to me, I would cast Emilia Clarke instead. Let the character be in the hands of someone who has a good personality and can be a roll model for kids. 

And then when the character becomes very popular, amber heard will have to just watch all the success that she won‚Äôt be apart of.",2021-01-15T17:42:00Z,9
108,Ugyb4GfR1nH-RAONFqJ4AaABAg,Why It Matters Podcast,I‚Äôm just still stunned at the fact she‚Äôs still not in prison. Really shows the equality between men and women these days. Even though if this situation was reversed Johnny Depp would most certainly be in huge trouble.,2021-01-14T11:27:12Z,0
