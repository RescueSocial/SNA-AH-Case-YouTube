She looks good o his arm etc, but he is not interested in the person underneath.

She is begging him to be interested in her. He couldn‚Äôt give a shit. A don‚Äôt think he is barely listening to her. You have to question his motives for why he was with her in the first place.

She keeps asking him if he‚Äôll fight for her and he doesn‚Äôt even respond. He is not interested. Doubt he ever was. He just wants a cardboard cutout for a wife.",2020-08-03T17:04:03Z,0
56,Ugy1Xq_K9jgtC0_PM1J4AaABAg,Nonya Smith,"Yep. I agree. She probably carried all the emotional baggage of the relationship and his lack of emotional availability and commitment, evasiveness, unwillingness to own the things HE does/says after these fights, or to be the one to initiate reconciliation/communication triggered the hell out of her. His alcoholism and drug addiction is consistent with someone who is emotionally available; unaware of or incapable of processing his OWN feelings, therefore incapable of recognizing and empathizing with hers.... maybe anyone else's either. Hence his stonewalling and ""running away"" at any sign of discontent... as she describes it. He only looks like the ""good"" guy, or blameless, because he isn't the one being loud. Many narcissistic abusers/toxic partners know how and when to deploy this tactic. Hell, he sounds somewhat inebriated right here in this video, which helps him to pass himself  off as him being the 'calm' one. But we've both seen and heard him out of control in anger, likely under the influence of drugs AND alcohol. Whether he was or not, his behavior was out of control and you don't have to hit someone in order to intimidate, scare and abuse them. Let's all keep in mind that Depp knows this is being recorded and can adjust accordingly. This sounds, to some degree, like reactive abuse from Heard.",2020-07-14T01:25:07Z,2

61,UgxuPG2FNKnK-cfrZ354AaABAg,Live Abuse Free,I don't think it's needs to be one thing or the other. The MeToo movement is about women standing up to sexual abuse and being open about it.

63,UgymetrzLoOEJUPxuKB4AaABAg,Live Abuse Free,"No I don't agree that it's weird and certainly not dangerous. Someone like that doesn't accept that they are an abuser, they are so full of contempt and anger for the person they abuse that they feel entitled to express themselves in this way. They don't see that they are someone with deep issues harming someone worthy of respect. They see the other person as the cause of their anger and deserving of punishment, even when they know other people may respect that person and think of them as an abuser if they saw what was going on. If they are violent they will know what they do would be considered by others to be wrong but they think they have good reason to do it and that the other person is making them so angry that they are making them do it.

They can believe that their victim is forcing them to behave in a way that's out of character. They will enjoy the emotional reaction of the person they abuse because of the feeling that comes with it - that they must matter, as well as the relief of expressing their inner rage.¬†

I believe it's true that they can't face who they are - they can't face seeing themselves as someone who is forever stuck in early childhood and who desperately needs to feel powerful by abusing someone else.",2020-02-22T16:47:45Z,1

Customs must have had a reason for Heard being the only one charged. (Barnaby was not minister for customs.)
Heard's guilty plea was not really an admission of wrong doing as she said ‚ÄúI understand there is evidence to the effect that I completed the cards in the terminal. I accept that may be the case and my memory might be faulty about this.‚Äù

101,UgzQtVCgyX6AmIsc8b94AaABAg,Emma Newton,After listening a bit more I think it‚Äôs clear Amber is the abuser and seems like a comorbid npd and bpd personality disordered person and maybe Johnny is quite an empathic introverted person who leans on substances to cope with negative emotions like anxiety and deal with a volatile relationship maybe more socially anxious but capable of reactive abuse and disregulated emotions in a toxic relationship. He sounds trauma bonded with her and confused and desperately trying to keep the peace and make it ok between them but then he understandably gets angry and defensive when attacked by her verbally or physically and blamed unfairly. Definitely think she‚Äôs the abuser and he‚Äôs the victim the longer the audio goes in this video. Seems obvious now I‚Äôm 46 minutes into this video. Poor Johnny,2020-02-13T20:41:31Z,0

Of course he can't show up for her (or probably anyone else) on an emotional level.

The fake bruises, which her friend, the make up artist did, to the feces on the bed, to cutting his finger tip off and him getting MRSA 3 times, let alone losing Pirates, and then when he did his cologne they attacked him again... Even though he had the Chief woman of the local tribe he studied was on set, and taught him all the stuff he needed to know when he made the video for his cologne. All bc she's a woman and he's a man. I find it absolutely disturbing to think this could happen to my brother, my son, or any male friend.... Bc society says women don't lie?! Funny, I can grab any rational female and ask her if she's ever been hurt or screwed over by another female and she'd laugh and probably give me a very very long list of names and situations...

The perpetrator or offender may Deny the behavior, Attack the individual doing the confronting, and Reverse the roles of Victim and Offender such that the perpetrator assumes the victim role and turns the true victim -- or the whistle blower -- into an alleged offender. "" 

It's basically what narcissistic abusers and manipulators do when they are accused (or think they will be accused in the future, you can definitely do pre-emptive DARVO) of some wrongdoing. They flip the tables and do anything in their power to spin the events in their favor, as if they were the victim and the perpetrator was the actual victim. When Depp came with claims that Amber was the abuser, not him, Amber's camp claimed DARVO on him, but it's apparent with the new information that Amber was doing the DARVO all along.

203,Ugwm_AcfTzJdlSRC5EF4AaABAg,Em2238,"@Ann Smith there's a clear difference in what she's doing and how she's speaking to him that narcissists do... Listen to how he addresses things ""we....our....us"" and RIGHT after that she RIPS into him about how he NEVERRRR apologizes, NEVER this, NEVER that, ALWAYSSS does all these bad things... He's completely level headed and she's escalating, and pulling out the Always and Never... Any rational person will see no one always or never does anything. Except narcissists, lol! They ALWAYS blame and NEVER take responsibility. It's a classic go-to for my ex the second I'm starting to make sense I guess... He then gets alll huffy and starts with the You ALWAYS and You NEVER....
   If you've been with or around a narcissist, you'd recognize it right off the rip, not only in that, but in her whole conversation. You can actually listen to ALL the tapes in full, that have been released so far, on the chanl Incredibly Average. It's almost scary hearing what you used to hear, from someone else's mouth and hearing all the stuff said to you, being said by someone else to their significant other. It's a very strange feeling, lol. As far as your situation, I'm not talking about a single incident, I'm talking every single day, this conversation goes on. Every. Day. No matter how much you try to have a smooth day, get along, etc and it just can't happen bc they THRIVE on drama, bullshit and control. I actually had to get used to it being not only quiet, but also having no drama, not having to preplan how I'm going to say something, and I never noticed how tense and on edge I was.... Until he only came by on wkends to hang out with our son and I. Which, like anything else in someone that is a narc, fades bc quiet and ""normal"" is BORING to them. And, hey, that's ok with us, boring is ok. Boring means not having to be told how I feel, how I should feel, how I should talk, what I should say and how I should say it... Ughh, lol, like I said, you don't realize how much you were walking on egg shells until they aren't around for a while. I feel for Depp, but I think he'll see what the rest of see once time has passed, or esp when you have to interact with the person again and you think OMG drama, get me out of this, I just want to be home in silence, lol!",2020-02-12T22:56:17Z,7

In her initial report when they went to court before she said she only hit him once in defense of her sister but in this audio and the other that's been released she has admitted to not only hitting him on multiple occasions, but also to being the one to perpetrate the physical violence as well as throwing things at him. She also broke the NDA on speaking about their relationship many times, including the article she wrote about the abuse she apparently received from Johnny that started the current defamation case.

All personality disorders   involve narcissism because people with personality disorders are developmentally arrested.  They don't grow out of childhood without help and life experience.  Just like children in the early years (2-4 nd beyond) who are narcissistic and ego centric.  For little children it is normal to be that way.  Adults who are arrested at an early developmental age    So they retain the egocentrism.  If you ask a small child why the sun rises in the morning the child will say ""So I can get up and play.""  Everything is about the child.  They have no theory of mind, so they don't know that other people are thinking separately from them.  There have been lots of studies on this.

- She was abusive to her PA - sending texts between 2 and 4 in the morning. Erupting in rage when an airline cancelled a flight. The PA worked for her for 3 years.
- She threw items at Depp and is constantly emotionally abusive and gaslighting.
- Depp has zero history of DV in relationships. 
- The audio proves she was violent towards Depp...


Amber has narcissistic personality disorder and Depp is completely innocent.


Women abuse men in marriages. DV isn't a one way street. Female narcissists lie and manipulate others. That's why we shouldn't ""believe all women.""

Hard to overcome for women with the constant propaganda of the feminist narrative misrepresenting the statistics of DV and painting all non sociopathic men with the same brush. Most men who are breadwinners keep each other accountable for spending to benefit the families finances - nothing to do with being ""controlling"".",2020-03-29T06:14:37Z,0

He would yell I would counter yell and then I would get hit, the police would sometimes come and he would put it on me. My new hubby and I have had like about 4 arguments in 5 years, him and I barely fight. So I thought for years it was me I was the problem but I don't think so now. I've met Johnny Depp and he was so lovely and kind. I gave him a book of artwork of prints of drawings I did of him, he was so amazing. I'm so glad he is out of this hell.

As I said he may just be needing a witness to validate him and stop him from thinking that this is HIS madness. She will always feel abandonment at the slightest nuance and her emotional needs will always come first. The fights she creates are an old battle played out in an attempt to express old anger overcome the previous abandonment a never ending cycle of needy destruction, she is the one who sits on the edge of psychosis NOT him. Never can she win this old battle because it creates the opposite of what she intends, ie abandonment not just with a narcissist but anyone and everyone she forms relationships with. If she is not fighting she is not loved. A hopeless situation. 
From his side I have heard the theory that all alcoholics are narcissists and it is a narcissistic behaviour if only from the point of view that there is lack of consideration for others and I agree a lack of relatedness likely to court when high will trigger her more. On the other hand the stress of being with someone with bpd is phenomenal  and JD sounds like he is on something to me. I have met very few non malignant borderlines and though not researched the general consensus is that relationships with people with bpd are far more destructive than with narcissists and that is from people who have been in relationship with both. Malignant bpd to me is an unmatched horror in relationship. Of interest nowhere does he abandon her in this conversation which is telling to me. You don‚Äôt know who I am or how far I have come as I don‚Äôt know you. It is good to have these discussions and we may agree more than you think.",2020-02-15T19:25:33Z,0

The question of travis could be triangulation from Johnny Depp  it also could also be the need for him to have a witness because of her gaslighting.
