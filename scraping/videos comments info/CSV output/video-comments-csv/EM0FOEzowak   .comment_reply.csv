1,UgwkQlbO74uTQ_Wc8Q54AaABAg,Dana Craig,Omg..thats priceless...J.D. and his lawyers should get footage of him in cast and then record a reenactment...I wont pay 2 see A.H. in anything..but I would pay 2 see her expression when watcging something like that...J4JD,2021-06-17T16:25:10Z,2
2,UgwkQlbO74uTQ_Wc8Q54AaABAg,Ulvetann,"When she was showing off her damages, JD actually had a broken arm. So if he was to box her, he'd have to use his left arm. -but You try to swing out with a left arm, if your right arm is in a cast. -AH would have plenty of time to dodge him.",2021-06-17T14:19:05Z,2

4,UgwU5EAN0QU26j8FT9x4AaABAg,Rock Candy,@CamIam it's all very very concerning.  i can't quite listen to the knife audio but i'd say you are right about her plans...,2021-06-17T15:23:08Z,2
5,UgwU5EAN0QU26j8FT9x4AaABAg,Ulvetann,@CamIam She is sketchy af.,2021-06-17T14:21:22Z,3
6,UgwU5EAN0QU26j8FT9x4AaABAg,CamIam,"She publicly said she kept a gun by her bed for self defense. Then we have audio from the hotel room where she asks him to cut her with a knife. We have him saying that she begged him to go in the bedroom with her. She could have been setting him up to look like an attacker, so she had to ""defend herself."" She recorded and narrated the self harm episode instead of calling for help, even when the housekeeper came by. It sounds like she brought the knife too. He stated that she interfered with his detox and deprived him of needed meds. Then there's audio where she says that she now sees that he needs medication and he agrees. She says she makes sure he takes ""the good ones"" and offers him vitamin water because she cares about him. She's no more qualified to manage his medicine than he is. Why was she messing with it? Why would she be insisting that he drinks vitamin water?",2021-06-16T20:51:53Z,4
7,UgwU5EAN0QU26j8FT9x4AaABAg,CamIam,"I agree. I think she could have been plotting to do it herself and disguise it as any of those things. A few details spread out in court and media sound pretty suspicious when you put them together. I think she was slipping him ""dr*g water"" too.",2021-06-16T20:38:30Z,4
8,UgyKXws3g6i_vXpiI3R4AaABAg,Rock Candy,@March Reighly well said.  i notice a lot of people say he's not perfect or an angel...ok...but he is innocent.,2021-06-20T09:52:38Z,1
9,UgyKXws3g6i_vXpiI3R4AaABAg,March Reighly,I think most of his fans that are adults are aware that JD isn‚Äôt a perfect person. This case was never about anyone being perfect.,2021-06-20T03:39:05Z,1
10,UgyKXws3g6i_vXpiI3R4AaABAg,Spamachu Chan,"@Rock Candy I do agree with you. Again I do side with JD. I'm just not a fan going ""He's an innocent angel and did nothing"". We primarily hear the argument in the recording, not what led up to the argument so there is still missing context to it; but over all AH is the bad guy. She was the one that ultimately made the decision to hit or ""smack"" JD, she crossed the line and became the bad guy immediately. I'm just speculating that JD isn't an angel and had some toxic moments that helped to esclate the situation in the end.",2021-06-19T13:10:07Z,0
11,UgyKXws3g6i_vXpiI3R4AaABAg,Rock Candy,When he was speaking to her in the audio and she was losing it...he never insulted her or talked angrily.  He was trying to help her deal with her anger issues.  He tells her often he loves her.  When he sent those texts he was angry but that was because of all the ab use and it was never to her.,2021-06-16T17:26:21Z,5
12,UgxwPacnNGqoXILT1N94AaABAg,Rock Candy,she is definitely the perpetrator.   She also put out a cigarette on his cheek after the finger being severed. her account of the incident timeline is complete fiction.,2021-06-17T15:32:58Z,2
13,UgzWK14Bit74HFyaRFR4AaABAg,Rock Candy,because Nitwit Nicols (judge) made sure to comment that he believed Amber was in fear of her life at least 3 times and it must have been terrifying and he gave her a win in 12 out of 14 incidents - making it obvious who he believed.,2021-06-16T17:21:29Z,5

15,UgxVt3-dyqCu8XIVLOt4AaABAg,Doctor Soup,"I agree with you. Saying something in private out of frustration, doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre a horrible person. Most people say things in a moment, especially with their friends, and don‚Äôt actually genuinely mean it.",2021-06-16T04:26:10Z,7

23,UgydrqutTAcpY2B_ZFB4AaABAg,March Reighly,Some people cannot assess history and evidence to learn from the mistakes of others. They won‚Äôt take it seriously until they experience it themselves.,2021-06-20T01:56:56Z,1

25,UgzXUXubKujPKiCRysV4AaABAg,Doctor Soup,"I agree Deb. There is a huge difference between speaking out of frustration‚Ä¶ and actually having bad intentions to do something. These people were so focused on making him(the man) the problem, that they focused on something so small like that, when her ‚Äúproblems‚Äù were/are so much more severe.",2021-06-16T09:13:27Z,3
