21,UgxygMs32Em_K1ZaBKl4AaABAg,Jack Kurt,"@Christie B Men get sexually assaulted (and raped) at an equal rate BY WOMEN(ABOUT 89% OF THE PERPETRATORS ARE FEMALE) in the US in the recent years. Here is the link to an OFFICIAL US GOVERNMENT WEBSITE - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4062022/
Also here is an article from THE SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN WITH OFFICIAL 2019 DATA,
In 2019, for example, this survey showed that equal numbers of men and women reported being forced into non-consensual sex (either raped or forced to penetrate someone else). Extrapolated to the US as a whole, this would represent 1.9 million victims among each sex during the preceding 12 month. NOW OBVIOUSLY IN THE OLDER DAYS WOMEN WERE RAPED MORE BUT NOW IT'S JUST EQUAL.ALSO MEN DON'T REPORT SO MUCH SEXUAL ASSAULT COMPARED TO WOMEN.

IN THE US, Men are assaulted at the same rate as women by women.

58,Ugz4rWoNdIJrhTorV1d4AaABAg,nonogimme,"@Cindy K First of all , i said Karen because that is literally her name. ‚ÄúKaren Black‚Äù 

Secondly, what evidence? The audio tape? Sorry to say that you simply fell for Depp‚Äôs team's smear campaign against Amber's character, like many others. Imagine believing the misconstrued tape released by his team to manipulate public opinion . ü§î Bet you didn‚Äôt know even in the said tape he‚Äôs actually the perpetrator of the violence. In the uncut version¬†shared in the court, her abuse¬†had actually happened in reaction to him scrapping a door over her toes.¬†LOL Funny how his¬†team NEVER presented that version of the audio¬†in court as their defense because it's not¬†legit and the full¬† version doesn't make him look good.

If you REALLY do your research and read the court verdict , you would know that the Court found enough evidences that Johnny Depp abused Amber at least in 12 counts of domestic abuse and 1 count of sexual violence. So no , nobody just take her ‚Äúword‚Äù for it, especially not the Judge in the court of law. She didn‚Äôt get any special treatment . You cant just accused a powerful A-list actor like Johnny depp without proper evidences. Amber isn‚Äôt a perfect victim (there‚Äôs no such thing or they‚Äôre most likely dead) but that doesn‚Äôt change the fact she was THE victim. The fact that she might not be a completely helpless weak woman with a super gracious personality at all times has nothing to do with this.
Why should she be fired too? The only reason Johnny was fired was because he pursued a lawsuit for a crime he‚Äôs guilty of. WB didn‚Äôt ask him to step down until he engaged in this smear campaign against Amber and even LOST a lawsuit (against The Sun of all publications). He has been¬†decreed as a WIFE BEATER by the British courts and notorious libel laws due to a dumb lawsuit he initiated. Amber has no verdict against her at the moment hence why it makes no sense that people want her to be fired. Just READ the court verdict!
https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Judgment-FINAL.pdf

Last but not least,  some of you¬†really think you're doing something ""revolutionary"" by not believing¬†a victim just because she‚Äôs a women. Just say you hate her because she exposed your favorite actor for being an abusive junkie and go. Or better yet, do a PROPER research before giving your public opinion on something serious like this.",2020-11-20T18:10:09Z,0
59,Ugz4rWoNdIJrhTorV1d4AaABAg,Cindy K,"@nonogimme You see, if they had agreed with Amber, then they maybe could be called one. Well maybe that would be a feminist instead of a Karen..

People are taking Ambers side and ignoring evidence provided against her claims. If they want to fire Johnny, then they should fire Amber too. Why should she get special treatment? Why do women get sympathy from others just because they claim that something happened, the man not being given a proper chance to clear his name even after showing his evidence? People are jumping to conclusions so fast.
