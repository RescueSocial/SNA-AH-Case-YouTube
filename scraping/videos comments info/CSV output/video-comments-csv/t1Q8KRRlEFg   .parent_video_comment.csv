Don’t need no man. A baby alone.



it’s been a while since high school biology 🧬, but I’m pretty sure women need male sperm to have babies 👶

I mean you can make that choice and live with it, but for a kid, having a father figure in their life is just as important as having a mother if not a bit more; The data indicate that single mothers in most part fail to raise their kids in in proper manner especially boys ( I'm not talking about all single mothers, but the vast majority of them ) , that''s why a lot of these kids bail out of school, some may end up i jail, some end up even dead.

15,UgyRbKQ78kFw-xDe5Op4AaABAg,"Why do people care so much about what others choose to do with their lives? Does it affect you and your happiness in any way? What happens if one of you end up getting divorced before you have a kid and your biological clock is ticking and you really want a child? Will you just accept that you will never get to become a mother? Some people think they know it all, but they really don't. A woman does not need to wait around 40 years for a man to marry her and allow her to become a mother. through no fault of that woman's, the man she was with could've cheated on her or abused her even though they were engaged. and lo and behold, she finds herself single at 32 and still childless. 

A lot of statistics are from poorer single parent households, not those that are financially well off. How is a financially stable woman who saves her money for all her life in the hopes of having a baby and chooses to have a child on her own by choice and out of love because her fiance decided to cheat on her, lie to her, and abuse her 4 days before their wedding any worse off than an 18 year old girl that gets knocked up in a bar and ends up pregnant? the men commenting are just threatened that more women are going to start having children, with or without them, and stop waiting around like puppies for a decade for empty promises and hollow words. who are any of you to tell others how to live their lives? i am sure that child will be much more loved than a child that is an ""accident"" or a mistake in a home where the father smokes and does drugs while verbally abusing his wife. This isn't about feminism or about hating men. It's about women who really love children and want to be mothers, and who are tired of waiting another decade for the ""one"" to show up after the previous the ""one"" cheated on and abused her. i guess it's a good thing that most of these women could give a rat's butt about the opinions of a bunch of people they have no connection to. as for talking about finding a man to settle with, it really doesn't mean much. plenty of lowlives end up married and provide a toxic environment for their children, who grow up with traumas and other psychological issues. and let's not even talk about those who have children and end up abandoning them.",Diana West,0,2021-08-12T09:06:15Z

One fair point which should be inspected further, because that's one of the many points where women have a privilege over men (and real equality is proven to be nothing more an idealistic, surreal dream):
They easily can have their own child without a partner, just a sperm donor is necessary, even a clinic is not really needed, as there are willing men who give their sperm for a certain amount of money (without intercourse, of course). Men otherwise still need more than just one or two egg cells, they also need a surrogate mother to carry and delivery that child, which is fundamentally harder, if not almost impossible to find (except for gay couples, i guess)

164,UgxtvhHotNvV6q2p9fF4AaABAg,"I dont think its a positive thing, but i might do child on my own terms, if relationship with my current boyfriend would fail. With my current bf we have planned to start making a child in 1-2 years in future, im 25 years old now. We are in a healthy relationship, so right now i think that probably will happen. But with life you can never know for sure, and I know after 25 females fertility starts to decline. So if we would broke up in future, i dont want to be in my late 20s and find my self single and with no kids. If we would broke up i would make kids on my own terms. I have wanted to have kids for my whole life, and since i was 20 years old i started to be in serious relationships with men to have children. But 2 past relationships failed before this current one. My dad was alcoholic, so i had alot of childhood trauma to prosses and heal from, so thats why those past relationships failed. Being in healthy relationship didnt come to me naturally, and i had to learn it. Of course my biggest dream is to give my child a healthy and happy family because i never had that growing up, and i want to belive i can give that to him/her with my current bf. But if i cant and relationship fails, i dont want to be childless. Unfortnately females have very short time being fertile, and in that time frame you have to heal all the trauma to make healthy and happy family. I hope im able to do that and stop the cycle, but if i cant im still going to be a mother.",Zombiee Child,1,2021-07-10T14:55:38Z

173,UgwR0TbsijR8wCDG-Gx4AaABAg,"I say that single motherhood is the perpetuation of dysfunction in the home and further destruction of marriage in America. And that according to the Psychology world who specialize in child development under Piaget'. If any child does not have a mother and father in the house it is going to be unpredictably dysfunctional. If they do have both parents and neither is relationship material then the results will be the same. This is why women think they dont need men to rear a child. 
     They are causing the child great harm. Amber perse has failed in relationships with men. Somebody like her just needs to be schooled then screwed until her time is made up. I dobt if she got 30 minutes with johnny or muss. bc that is how women are supposed to get it from an older woman who has succeeded at morning, noon and night. 
    I a telling you it is the key to sexuality. And if you are not doing it how do you know? I documented it for 5 years with 9 differnet females from ages 23-50. I don't take them from 8i-80 blind, cripple or craza'. My findings are unnamaous. It is a easy fix bc all it rreally takes is a man tearning how tto withhold his ejaculation while still experinceing the cli,max and orgasm. Masters and Johnson could not do what I have done.
     But being the greatest lover who ever lived and discovering the secret to the mystery of the woman's sexuality I can prognosis Amber's situation. Amber who is a striking, sexy beauty like most females of her stature who has not found a man that can sexually satisfy her. No woman can be sexually satisfied by another woman, merely pleasure like the man refuses to (learn to) do. Simply bc anything she gives a woman a man can too and more. What women find in women is time in the bed and affection ou of it. 
   The problem is with MGTOW they never learn how to totally sexually satisfy their women. Here's part of the problem with men that have continued bc women don't say anything. Men tend to finish too soon when their woman is just beginning to get started to cum. Long story short (git da buk ""Sexual Perfection"") I have discovered that women need a certain amount of sexual heterosexual contact at certain ages that their men and themselves are unaware of. (its in da' buk!)
    At 30 a woman needs one hour of sex every day (3 wks per month). At 40 a woman needs two hour of sex every day (3 wks per month). It can be night and morning. At 50 a woman needs one hour of sex every day after menopause. And fromwhat I saw on the tape of johnny an Amber, I feel sorr for her. Thigs canno get better withhe sexually unless she finds a man that can love her as long as she likes at those given ti,mes mornin, noon and night. It can solve the world's problems. When a man can totally sexuallu satisfy his qoman she takes control out the bedroom. Ppl just on't know so they do anything trying to find the woman's libido.",meechie B,0,2021-07-10T12:51:57Z

Perhaps she will have to give up the odd smoothie while she has to hold the little tot, while in reality, there are millions of ""stunning and brave"" single women and men every day raising children (natural, fostered or adopted) without making it a big issue.  Often they are short of money, despite working full time and struggling to pay their bills, yet they willingly sacrifice their needs for those of their children.  The difference is they actually want their kids.  Their children are not an attention-seeking exercise, or a commodity to be traded in when ""mom gets tired"".  Every day they raise their children with love, not via a nanny.  Amber Heard's reasons to adopt (buy) a child are selfish reasons.  I suspect it is a ploy to promote good publicity in light of her recent history ...   well that plan backfired!  I doubt this child was ""adopted"" for love.  Watching her with the child, there are no signs of interaction as demonstrated by a new parent and baby.  Please stop idolising people like Amber.   She is manipulative and hard as nails.

351,UgziInlEQSLRhq3KQmF4AaABAg,"The main reason for single motherhood you neglected to mention Lauren, is... girls and women willingly screwing around left right and centre, treating sex as just short-term physical gratification, whilst choosing to completely ignore the serious consequences and ultimate responsibility and ""purpose"" that action often brings, which is... to create a new life!  Sure, many men are also guilty of this, so I'm not letting them off the hook, but considering that it's the women who will ultimately become pregnant (their body, their choice, right?), I believe that THEY most certainly need to 'think' more, and respect themselves, by implementing self-control before acting and stooping to a level of pure animal instinct.  

When I was young, just as today, all young people were also horny and guys often tried to 'woo' their girlfriends into 'going further' but it was the girls that said ""No"" and the boys/men respected them for it.  And guess what... there were far fewer single mothers.  But sadly today, that sense of self-respect, responsibility and youthful maturity seems to have completely disappeared, to be replaced by narcissism, selfishness and a _""Whatever""_ attitude.

483,Ugyirrw7CBEl7yV1CS94AaABAg,"First, Lauren, you need to better understand the traditional meanings of the terms you are using. You have for some reason created your own definition of “single mother”. 

Traditionally, a “single mother”, as distinguished from a divorced mother or widow, was one who gave birth to a child out of wedlock. The divorce was married to the child’s father and the widow is the woman who lost her husband because he died. 

You continue to cling to this notion that what makes a difference is a mere 2d adult body in the home— but there is no evidence supporting your theory.

It is the presence of the child’s FATHER that makes the difference, nit just any random adult. For example, fatherless black boys are frequently raised with their grandmothers in the home in addition to their mothers and there’s no evidence that has a beneficial outcome anywhere near on the level the presence of the boy’s father does.

Another example would be boyfriends and stepfathers. According to you the presence of these men would be of a net benefit because they are a “second person“, but in fact, statistically, the mother’s new husband or boyfriend is THE most dangerous man in a child’s life. He is 50 TIMES more likely than the child’s dad to kill that child and kids who do not reside in the same home as their natural fathers ate 40 TIMES more likely to suffer abuse.  

In general, statistically, the children of women who try to raise those kids without their natural fathers in the home have bad outcomes.",Matthew McCauley,2,2021-07-08T16:28:26Z

It reminds me of the people who record themselves giving a few bucks to a homeless person to get a pat on the back from social media.",Tyler James,0,2021-07-08T16:22:19Z
492,UgxRgF0tcS0JMq7vpad4AaABAg,"The thing is, all your arguments doesn’t apply because the situation with choosing single parenthood and being forced into single parenthood are completely different.

First of all, I completely agree that Amber is questionable as a mother, single or not. 

But when it comes to single motherhood by choice I absolutely don’t think it’ll be comparable to single parenthood by force of circumstances. 

Situation A: When someone ENDS UP as a single mom, without choosing so, they were initially not planning it, so of course they won’t have enough resources for the situation. It makes sense for the kid to end up in bad situations, either the mom cannot afford it, or they have to work extra hours to afford it, which results in neglecting the child. 

Situation B: When it comes to choosing to be a single mother, obviously a person taking in that rout has planned it and can afford it. Let’s say Amber (without her questionable past), she doesn’t need to work extra to afford a child. She can just spend as much time with her child and married women do, and doesn’t rely on a man to pay up. So the child that Amber brings up doesn’t really face the challenges that normal kids in normal single mother households face; that child has enough resources, is not at risk of poverty, can go to private schools or extracurricular classes, and is not neglected by mom. I think the outcome can be drastically different than situation A. 

So I don’t think children raised in the single mom by choice houses will be the same. If someone can afford it, they have the resources to have a child without needing to take extra time off, I don’t see a problem.",Negin Nasiri,1,2021-07-08T16:21:42Z

Sex, is the joining of one man & one woman, given by God to both show their love for one another, but far above that, to continue the species. 

God, being the kind & loving & Wise being that He is? Also made this a PLEASURABLE act. This way, BOTH genders, (sorry, only TWO!), could find joy, and a desire to participate in, that which God created. 

Enter mankind, once again. Man/Woman, believing they could IMPROVE on the Perfection of God? Over the millennia, began ""experimenting"" with acts and mannerisms, never intended by God. 

And this, began the eventual and gradual decline, of something already created, perfect. As per usual. 

Enter Amber Heard, thinking she's found something ""New!"", and that she's a ""Pioneer!"" now, in. 

HOLD IT! Sorry Ms. Heard, beater of Pirates extraordinaire. King Solomon, you know, a KING, like they have over in Europe, where you and all your friends pretend ""Perfect life"" exists, while always claiming this in AMERICA? Said: ""Nothing is new, under the sun"". And you know what? He was RIGHT! 

Been done. Doesn't work. Stupid idea. Moronic thought process to pretend it will, coupled with ignorance, for not already knowing this, yourself. 

Kids need a MOM. Kids need a DAD. EACH provide an invaluable, and irreplaceable aspect of themselves, in their children. Yes, even when, ""Imperfect"". CAN it be done with just ONE? 

Duh. Many a heroic Mom & Dad have proven this- however, since each case is unique and separate? Results would have to be taken, studied, assigned, the EXACT properties, that created both successes & failures. Because there are BOTH. 

Just as with a Mom & Dad in the house. However, since God is the creator of all of this? HIS way, over the multitude of years? ALREADY HAS BEEN. 

And far, FAR more failures have resulted from YOUR WAY, than from GOD'S.

Just a side note.

But I agree with everything you had to say about Amber Heard.  There are some amazing single parents who devote their lives to raise children alone due to unfortunate circumstances, and they are heroes.  But single parents typically fall short of what a two-parent household can do.  I think it's incredibly selfish to seek parenthood as a solo parent because one would deprive the child of a parent by design.

It wasn't until I was an adult that I realized what his loss cost me.  My mom was a wonderful role model, and worked very hard to raise her 6 kids with no help from the government.  But she couldn't possibly know the things growing boys would get into, and I ended up smoking at 8, drinking, doing weed, and having no model for how to have a relationship with a woman.

Being a parent is something you earn with dedication, loyalty, trust, compassion and empathy. And if you haven't built the foundation of a healthy relationship first, you don't deserve to skip all that work and buy your way into the end result. It's wrong and it's unfair for the child. Entirely too many people have a child because they are being selfish and it's what they want. But they almost never take into consideration the thoughts and feelings of that child - What if that child doesn't want to grow up in this world ? What if that child didn't want to grow up without a father ? Now you have brought a life into this world that doesn't even want to be here. It's selfish and inconsiderate.

Policymakers at last are coming to recognize the connection between the breakdown of American families and various social problems. The unfolding debate over welfare reform, for instance, has been shaped by the wide acceptance in recent years that children born into single-parent families are much more likely than children of intact families to fall into poverty and welfare dependence themselves in later years.
