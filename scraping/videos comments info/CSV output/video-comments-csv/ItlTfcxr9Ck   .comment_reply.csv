It was NOT the court who made that diagnosis, it was Scambers personal psychologist. She exemplifies BOTH Narcissistic Personality Disorder AND Borderline Personality Disorder, which, while rare DOES occur. Please don‚Äôt try to argue with someone who knows what they‚Äôre talking about. It just makes you look like either a Scamber apologist or someone who knows her.

33,UgyVXPhHChhEIdBCpc54AaABAg,Brad Ballanger,"I am sorry but you have no idea what you're talking about. Narcissistic Personality Disorder is a completely different entry in the DSM, and has markedly different criteria. None of her behaviour fits BPD either, not even remotely. Amber fits the criteria for ASPD and NPD but definitely not BPD, and while they can be comorbid, none of the Borderline traits have been shown. She is a Narcissist, please do not misrepresent psychology.

36,UgwcnazPfEtW1i0jqyp4AaABAg,Doctor Soup,"felicia s You summed this up in a way better than I could have. I actually feel this same exact way, my friends and I have discussed this amongst each other. It‚Äôs hard to say specifically what she has due to all of the drugs she‚Äôs is on, like you said.   If you watch my part2 video to this video, I mention some stuff similar to why you described. I basically talk about how she may have drug induced psychosis, meaning that yes, she very well may have mental health issues already, but it wouldn‚Äôt come as a surprise to me if a lot of the problems she is experiencing are due to such a heavy amount of drugs aka Drug Induced Psychosis. I‚Äôve been saying it for a long time(and should probably say it in my videos) that I really hope one day she can spend time in an institution so she can maybe get the help she needs. I don‚Äôt condone any of her actions but it makes my heart hurt a bit to know she needs serious help and DOES NOT have it.",2020-05-20T17:30:49Z,4

38,UgynjaF3aic9QBIjBAZ4AaABAg,Doctor Soup,karena apus Great point. This is actually exactly how I felt/feel about her interviews and stuff too. Like it comes off as if she has such a blank facial expression and she struggles to empathize with people.
