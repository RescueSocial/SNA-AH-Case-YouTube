5,UgwHr_u1-t_08FooUSN4AaABAg,"I think the U.K. Courts should rehear the case now. During one of her tapes when she smashed Johnny's finger and chopped it off? Instead of helping them find his finger? She focused on not wanting to leave the home they shared. The other person there was trying to get her to take her Seroquel. I know someone who takes Seroquel, for Bi polar disorder Mania. Manic episodes schizophrenia it is an anti-psychotic. Someone I have known for 28 years that is Certifiable and has been certified from a mental institute takes this. I tried helping her over the past 28 years she is the mother of one of my acquaintances. This person is just like Amber.  She is so violent and unstable, she has many times told me she wanted to stop her meds. I told her if she did I would have her committed.  Immediately, she is abusive to everyone in her life and admits it. Days later she calls and apologize's!  When she takes her meds correctly she's tolerable! If she does not. Watch out for her especially her neighbor's she owns a 25 and will use it! I have wanted to get that thing away from her for 28 year's. God only knows where she has it hidden! Her and Amber are 2 peas in a pod! Thankfully Amber must not own a weapon or Poor Johnny would be 6ft under with Jason Mamoa. Jason for ripping out the pages of her books. These people are so obsessive and paranoid about there stuff. They constantly think everyone has stolen from them. They will also steal from you, they are not good at hiding it! Or blaming it on another person,  if they think someone has done them wrong. You will still here her talking about it 15 yrs later every day. Just as if it just happened! I wrote a letter for her for Social Security.  It is insane how much trouble she can stir up! I have begged her to take her Seroquel when she is Manic. Amber is mentally ill and should not have that baby! Trust me she will loose it and that baby will get hurt! Oh and the lies are plentiful. They also can not be alone.  This lady is on her 13th marriage, #13 divorced his wife for her.  He is constantly abused verbally and physically.  But she always seems to slip through the cracks. Sorry-so long but, she is dangerous not just an abusive liar! She is MENTAL! Educating people is the best we can do for them!",Sandra Frazier,0,2021-08-06T03:19:29Z

69,UgyGotIikC0ALGUpbfF4AaABAg,"Seriously Andy you need to actually take a step back. You are letting the fact that you decided he was innocent from day 1 cloud your judgement.  For example, let's look at Incident 14  specifically part iv) of the ruling relating to the police officers. The reason doubt was put on their testimony was as follows

1) They didn't take contemporaneous notes. The first notes on the incident come from when they were deposed months later 
2) These notes produced months later contain discrepancies, for example claiming they were there for between 30 and 60mins when CCTV shows its 15mins
3) Only 1 of the officers gave oral testimony, the other written
4) Neither were available to have their testimony cross-examined.

Ultimately it's the last one that's most important and it's what makes their testimonies hearsay.  So their evidence being deemed to hold less weight is perfectly legit. It would be exactly the same in most countries criminal systems as its important that testimonies are able to be crossed. If they had both been available to be crossed and also if they had taken notes at the time rather than having to do the notes from memory months later then this evidence would have held way more weight as law enforcement testimony is generally held in high regard.  That was another consistent mistake of his team, they got witness statements off people and character references but for many they never had these taken under oath and those what were they didn't make available for cross. And then people like you wonder why his witness were held in less regard


And Depps witness and evidence in most cases have way more issues than The Suns and it's not helped by Depp destroying his credibility with the lies he told in his statement to the court that he then got caught in, often by his own evidence in the form of messages and recordings. And in civil cases it can often come down to whose evidence has less issues. 

Mind you the simple fact is that even if they could destroy every piece of testimony from her and her witnesses and they could show she also abused him, Depp would still lose BECAUSE his own discovery shows he is guilty. That's what people aren't realising, recordings and messages he disclosed have both him and his witness who later back him admitting to the assaults. Being abused on other occasions does not absolve you of fault.  People who are dying on this hill to defend him have chosen the wrong one to die on. If you think she is also guilty that's fine (The evidence seems to suggest she did also abuse him) but to keep trying to excuse an abuser, especially one who can change if he accepted the illness he has and made a real effort to kick it rather than the half hearted attempt at rehab. It just gives anyone being abused the wrong message",Simon Wakefield,0,2021-03-28T12:02:13Z

We are asking the wrong questions... Think about it just one second.  Johnny Depp is confronting the Sun Newspaper owned by Rupert Murdoch, who also owns so many media, one in particular FoxNews... that in fact was the primary tool used to elect Donal Trump... So, Rupert Murdoch owns large numbers of shares in the movie media... on the board of Disney and/or Warner... now the real question... what is his real objective in taking down Johnny Depp... The following question... JD has in fact an incredible power to negotiate... with a big fan base... He can in fact negotiate his salary at the end of the scale... Is there some advantage for Rupert Murdoch to either reduce JD bargaining power or simply attach a rival movie media and so increase his share and power... Is it possible in a previous buyout where JD was linked and refused to participate...  this is the only avenue to follow at this point... We should stop talking about the facts... they don‚Äôt matter any more with a judge that been bought... questioning the facts, the validity of the ruling seems secondary... we must go to the puppet master, the Voldemort, the one no one accepts to prononce his name...

Its well passed time that they began to prosecute those who make false allegations to stop this, give them the sentence their intended victims would have gotten... It's the only way this mess ends, the only way for real victims to feel safe to come forward and get their justice. It should be about the crime, not the gender...  I really hope the kid gloves are off and they go for blood and annihilate her in Virginia, she deserves no mercy...

190,UgxxvfSohmCQaq3fykp4AaABAg,UK courts are corrupt in my opinion can not wait until Amber Heard gets in a real court and she is heald acacabl for her actions and previous statements.  The judge in in the UK was basically on the take protecting his sons job period.  Amber Heard is going to be roasted in the Virginia courts especially since Johnny has one of the best lawyers in the country. Amber is going to tank her case just on her lies every statement she gives contracts the one that she gave previously. Nothing out of her mouth at this point can be trusted and unfortunately she put the YOU TO MOVEMENT in jeopardy for false claims due to her fake story against Johnny Depp. I take have a real problem with that being from a previous abusive relationship. Honestly I know Johnny Depp is innocent from their recording and my previous experience. So sorry that Johnny got falsely accused buy such a mucus person.,Tia A,0,2021-03-26T20:41:17Z

194,UgwOzmRJlYlkcgb55aF4AaABAg,"I've said before, being British, our justice system is something I loathe. In cases like this, the British media have the freedom to say anything they want. The victim of that slander has to be the one to take them to court to prove their not what is being portrayed! I've previously referenced the Meghan Markle letters to her dad. Written and addressed to him and yet she had to take the papers to court for invasion of privacy. The British Media can't be held accountable until taken to court and yet even when outcomes are won, say if Johnny had won his case, they'd still go ahead and print the same headlines but put alleged in front....Its very dangerous, damaging and it undermines real Journalism. 
The main argument here, is that they have judged this as a criminal trial and as though a criminal trial has already proceeded. The judgement should have been on the slander by NGN towards Johnny Depp. Unfortunately and horrifically the backwards British system means that everyone and their aunt can have input. In my opinion, NGN should never of legally been allowed to a) print a comment like they did with no evidence / conviction and b) be allowed to call Amber to the stand to ‚Äúprove their case‚Äù after Johnny filed the lawsuit against Amber as it is 100% a conflict of interest when she has something to gain from that outcome in her own criminal trial. 
Yet here we are and in other more recent cases we continue to see it. A West Midlands Police officer physically and verbally assaulted a woman by grabbing her by the back of the neck, calling her names and trying to pull her to the ground. He admitted in court that he assaulted her. The courts decided that he would receive a 14-week overnight curfew, wear a tag and pay compensations and court costs. So for the grand total of ¬£680 (¬£500 to victim, ¬£180 to courts) you can assault a woman... It's a screwed up legal world here in the UK!

200,UgxgDJrL_WnlkrYdzLN4AaABAg,"This hearing had nothing to do with justice. They literally discarded everything that did not adhere to AH narrative. Because reasons.
Under normal conditions discrepancies in testimonies are being considered a fail. But as it is often with women with gynocentric justice system, up is down. When a guy commits a crime, while intoxicated, its an aggravating circumstance, he was irresponsible and punishment should be increased. When a woman commits a crime, while intoxicated, it is often a mitigating circumstance, she was not in full control of her mental faculties and therefore should receive lesser sentence. There is a reason why for women ""mental problems"" are a goto excuse in court.
As far as ""errors of this kind are very common"" - bullshit, complete and absolute bullshit. Lawyers work with their clients extremely thoroughly to avoid exactly those mistakes. To dot all ""i's"" and cross all ""t's"", as their opposition can completely destroy, in an unbiased legal system. any credibility that person has. Only reason not to properly ""train"" a client is if outcome is predetermined.

Then they allowed for a while ‚Äúsuper‚Äù injunctions which were the courts forcing the press not to air the story at all. Not any details, nothing.
