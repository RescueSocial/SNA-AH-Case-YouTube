 That's so true, my families boundaries are a mess, my Mom is a covert Narc & boundaries don't work with her, it's just distance when someone refuses to accept your boundaries. People can't mistreat you unless you give them the power to do so, that is so very true. What has happened with those kids has hurt me far more than anything that has ever happened to me. I see everything as a learning experience, but that is hard for me, it just feels like a cruel world when babies/kids are hurt to that extent.
It's good to see someone with healthy boundaries who refuses to be exploited by someone with a problem respecting other people. So few people actually have strong boundaries.
 Thank you again, I am beyond sad I've just lost essentially my last person I consider family & I appreciate your kind words whether true or not, lol. It will come back to you in the form of good! Much love",2021-08-15T04:51:48Z,0

That is the best thing to do when possible, I do my best to help people heal from these kinds of people, but I have not been lucky in my personal life with them. My best friend was killed by his personality-disordered wife among other things. Someone married into my family who is very much like AH, she physically attacked me twice in a rage over some minor thing, & after seeing how she treated her babies (she was actually found unfit by the Navy &abused her husband/my relative, she constantly threatened to say he hit her & get him thrown out of the Navy with a dishonorable discharge, sound familiar?) I raised the babies for a couple of years until he got out of the military to raise them. She abandoned them & came back for the older one & now abandoned her again, which breaks my heart every day.
 This case has been very triggering for me, but I pray it will help men, because she has hurt female victims with her lies. I want SOME good to come out of this case. I hope people will begin to realize both genders can be abused. 
 I don't think AH should be allowed to have one! I think a person should have to have a mental eval to adopt a baby/child. No good can come of it. It could have been a staged thing, or perhaps her partner will raise the child, or maybe that's wishful thinking on my part. Much Love",2021-08-15T00:12:25Z,1

138,UgykJZDQ0TRAHJxVhFJ4AaABAg,Makkerooni,"@BigCityJungleCat EnvisageThat yea, so far things have been good for me in that sense. I understand wanting to reverse all the pain you went through trying to be a giving person when it's just thrown back in your face, but I n the end the lessons you learn from it are always helpful in the future. Regardless, I'm glad you managed to find your calling. Having something to calm you and send you into your own world for a while is always good to find, and I've found art in some way shape or form is one of the best ways to go about that. Perhaps artists are just more observant to the world around them, since they find a way to make beauty despite the shroud ingredients darkness, and perhaps that's why we both can understand these observations. regardless, our conversation is probably making a lot of unnecessary notifications for whoever posted this original comment lol, so with that this conversation may have to end soon, but I wish you the best in your life, and keep doing life the way you are now, because it's wonderful how much you can do. And most of all, keep up with your art, I'm sure your beading is just as beautiful as your voice :)",2021-09-09T02:01:14Z,1
139,UgykJZDQ0TRAHJxVhFJ4AaABAg,Makkerooni,"@BigCityJungleCat EnvisageThat yea I tend to feel the same way. Plus I tend to observe others behaviours so it makes it easier to see from other perspectives, I suppose that's why I think the way I do. Many people tend to act on initial impulse without giving it logical thought which may be why they get into bad habits. I strongly stand in the ""when one door closes another one opens"" kinda thing so when people are in a bad situation, I try to help them find a way out rather than letting them succumb to their circumstances. I'm glad I found someone online who can voice their opinions but do so in a logical way, stating facts rather than just directly attacking the other perspective",2021-09-07T17:23:10Z,1
140,UgykJZDQ0TRAHJxVhFJ4AaABAg,BigCityJungleCat EnvisageThat,"@Makkerooni: Thank you. You make me feel glad to be communicating with someone who thinks in such a sensible way - because most of the others I've come across on here were not very nice or thoughtful at all. 
I suppose that when I talk on social media about my life, it often feels like I'm exposing myself to loads of strangers who will see it (some of who may be the wrong kind of people). Though I have no problem speaking my mind to my family and the people who are close to me, but they are well aquainted with the story by now. 

You do have a point, about how I managed to get through so much of the bad/terrible stuff in this way. Well I don't know - I am just this person who has very firm/strong beliefs and principles about not doing/consuming the ""wrong"" things to put things ""right"". I have never gone too far with alcohol and absolutely ""never"" would touch drugs - I'm even very careful with prescription meds and have only taken them when extremely necessary (like when I was in so much pain etc and couldn't deal with it). And yep, there has been some really horrendous/horrific stuff going on in my life (like you would hardly believe) but ""somehow"" I have stayed alive (I don't even know how). But I'm sure that if I'd added drugs/narcotics etc into the situation this would've only made things a damned sight ""worse"" - and so it's just not for me. And this is why I can say to others, who are experiencing difficulties, that there is never an excuse (not on this Earth) for taking/using drugs (or any bad/toxic substances) because I know this from my own life-experiences. I have never regarded myself as a strong person or heroine (very far from it) but have always viewed myself as just simply ""me"" and how I can best survive my situation. But if ""I"" (someone like me) can do it, then I'm sure absolutely ""anyone"" can. But with me, I don't believe it is down to anything to do with ""strength"", but more to do with basic common sense or something, idk. And then there is the case that I do not function the same as most other people. I am a completely different species altogether.",2021-09-07T11:26:43Z,1

241,UgzpxmtyyYD1y3j-UJp4AaABAg,Julie Lea,"@Lynne Webley She's right, the Justice's son worked for the owner of THE SUN, & he had ruled against the The Sun in a prior case, the owner of The Sun is a career criminal with documented crimes for over 60 yrs, he is well known for threatening people & if Justice Nichol would have ruled in favor of JD, his son would have never worked in the industry again, bribing & threatening Justice's is one of his many well-known crimes, he controlled PM's in Australia who have come forward, in the UK, & POTUS's.  He's a Billionaire who controls countries, manipulating this case was small potatoes. 
 He's also responsible for JD being fired from POTC 4 days after the op-ed, & all the  lies you must have read in the media, how do I know they are lies? Because I read the actual documentation of the case, the media has reported wild lies! 
 I could see JD was going to lose this case at the beginning due to the decisions he made in favor of NGN, that were damaging to JD's case, & reading the verdict was surreal. He left out the audio of AH on drugs, saying she faked bruises, saying she hit JD & he ""ran away"" because he said they were secondhand! The actual people is FIRSTHAND. He said Josh Drew was a excellent witness, he was a THIRDHAND & witness to nothing, nor did he claim to be! He called the police LIARS & dismissed the second police officer entirely. AH'S testimony literally made him sigh in frustration, as she kept changing dates to fit the story while on the stand. 
 It was utterly ridiculous, as for JD drinking, what about AH saying ""All I took was Ecstasy, Xanex, hallucinogenics, Adderall, & cocaine"".....when she cut his finger off, & you should have heard the Justice's speculation about how his finger was severed!!! 
 A Justice's job is to use the facts, not say ""Well, this MUST have happened.....""
 Find me another verdict that says that, & what were you saying about JD's drinking again? Right, no record of violence, AH, arrested for DV in a previous relationship & extensive evidence, by her own mouth admitting it over & over again, that she was abusive.",2021-08-15T00:40:29Z,1
242,UgzpxmtyyYD1y3j-UJp4AaABAg,Thinking logical,@Lynne Webley bs there‚Äôs no evidence and from that cows mouth too in audio evidence she stated Johnny never touched her it was all her,2021-08-05T16:13:53Z,2
243,UgzpxmtyyYD1y3j-UJp4AaABAg,annaj banana,@Lynne Webley wtf does that add up to????? JD was never abusive to anyone ever.  He has so many friends and ex partners willing to tell that.  Amber Heard can barely get her sister to lie for her.  The bitch beat up her own sister and her past lover.  She is narcissistic sociopath.  Using Me Too makes her even more disgusting,2021-07-24T00:11:36Z,6
244,UgzpxmtyyYD1y3j-UJp4AaABAg,Jack Whitbread,"@Dee Dee you may want to look at the evidence yourself sweetie, absolutely no evidence Depp was violent. The audio tapes prove Amber was the one that was physically abusive. All Depps ex gf's defended him and even Amber's own parents stated she is violent and a compulsive liar",2021-07-17T15:54:52Z,2
245,UgzpxmtyyYD1y3j-UJp4AaABAg,emily cheetham,"@May Loo JD lost last year because- A the judge had connections to the newspaper, B the judges son worked for A radio station owned by NGN (who own the newspaper) & C the judges wife went to a party with AH. This all adds up to a conflict of interest. Judge nicol never should have been judging the trial last year. He should have excused himself. As for why JD didn‚Äôt get a re-trial the court said the next day (or within a few days) that the newspaper had freedom of speech (to write whatever shit the liked) & their lawyers were far too powerful to fight (they are amongst the most feared lawyers in the world). Added with the sun case was against the sun newspaper NOT AH. That is why they wouldn‚Äôt let him appeal. So get your facts straight. Outside of the sun newspaper There is very little evidence of JD ever being aggressive, violence, etc. Yes he sometimes got a bit drunk or high but I know people who have gotten drunk/high & never do anything wrong, & JD admitted to head butting AH once in self defence when she was attaching him. Where as AH there is plenty of evidence of her doing wrong such as- the Audio recordings where she admits to hitting JD, the fact that her ex wife (before AH was with JD) accused her of DV, the body cam footage from police shows NO damage, CCTV shows NO bruises on AH, AH smuggled her dogs into Australia, AH committed perjury by NOT donating the 7 million to charity as she had claimed, AH threw a bottle as JD which smashed & severed JD‚Äôs finger off. Need I go on? There is far more evidence against AH. Even the judge in America is getting fed up with AH. Do your research before posting things. Not everything you read in the media is correct. Also people don‚Äôt suddenly become violent. You ask anyone JD Kennewick in the past & you will see that he is a kind, caring, protective, considerate, quiet, sensitive person. All hiss ex‚Äôs & kids all say he never laid a finger on him. His colleagues (people from moves etc.) all say the same. Where as AH everyone she knows says she has a short temper and looses it. Even AH‚Äôs parents supported JD‚Äôs side- what does that say?! So no there is not more evidence supporting JD as the abuser but there is for AH.",2021-07-16T08:29:22Z,3
