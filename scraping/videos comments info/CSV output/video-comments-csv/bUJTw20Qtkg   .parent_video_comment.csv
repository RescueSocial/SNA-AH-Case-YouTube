1,UgxV7zFCAo88HRh7CCB4AaABAg,"So nothing about Elon Musk and Jason Momoa, or anybody regretting  they defended her? Still the same people who always supported him. Lol why are you lying in your titles mh? You and the people liking the video and agreeing with it : yeah you really are the side of truth, honesty, fairness and good morals lol. More like the side of trashy, irrational, rageful, cheap, gossipy, misogynistic, low-life mor0ns who don't watch the actual video before repeating the title everywhere as fact. 
These gossipy mobs against female celebrities are not something new, it has nothing to do with any interest for activism and ""justice"". Just your basic old American tabloid culture.",v f,0,2021-10-02T21:03:42Z

4,UgwS1L5nl9e5chIBW_V4AaABAg,"It's Johnny's fault in the sense that if you like a woman, or love a woman, your hat man is going to tell your head what to think. There were probably a ton of things that he should have paid attention to, but if a woman is making you happy downstairs, the switches upstairs are going to turn off. I mean whatever he got from it made him happy enough to ignore his common sense. Really he probably should have known better. When you're young follow your heart. When you get older listen to your heart but follow your head. Hey I guess he's getting some entertainment out of it nothing else. This ought to give him more angst fuel for his acting.",Paul R,0,2021-08-03T05:10:03Z

6,UgygktHeUOZKph9tcDx4AaABAg,I support Johnny Depp  the real Johnny that is  he is the real victim  and what i mean by the  real Johnny is because  there are many imposters of him   and want  Johnny  Depp   to reveal  if he is  the  one   genuingly trying to contacting his fans   cus i don't like  the thought  of  having to  thinking  he is fake when he's  the  offical Mr Depp  hope you  get me   on this  ?üò¨,Michelle Westwood,1,2021-08-02T07:38:11Z
7,Ugzv8wwvwd8lUzDmHG54AaABAg,"My husband and I are both survivors of DV in a previous marriages. We called it long before Johnny went public with it. Once you've been in a relationship like that yourself you see the body language in other relationship quite clearly & the body language of these 2 was like a neon sign on the Vegas Strip. Even among the glitz & flashiness of other celebrities the fact that she was abusing Johnny stood out. 
What she is doing is the classic move abusers pull. For all they love to think they are different they all pull the same tricks. It's like they all have the same playbook.
You also have to look at his ex of FOURTEEN YEARS is defending him as well as the woman he was with for 4. It doesn't matter how well it how long you have known someone, as an abuse survivor I can promise you unless you LIVED with them you don't really know how someone is when nobody is looking. 
Combine that with her criminal record of abusing previous partners & there's your answer, she's the one with a long history DOCUMENTED of being the abuser in relationships.",Mosaic Crone,0,2021-08-01T21:53:27Z

15,UgyaAm5ohDMJ1w8QM0t4AaABAg,Everyone is manipulative nowdays...thats why...oh no..you cant say that! But seriously..theres alot of people going rogue..so much so that it's called independent...and they're just out to bend the lack of contingency into a network that's allegedly off limits to only a specific few...but anyways...with society being so manipulative and so dynamically effective at it...theres way too much to allege here. If you don't know what the facts are and have witness what's occurred and know whether it was intentional or its just occuring out of order and accident...then you just don't know the facts...how can this pay off to be no one's fault? Well she can get help and he can too...I understand how that's viewed by people like Johnny...help means telling someone else your private business and as far as he is concerned he doesn't have anything to tell and therefore shouldn't do it...I agree..but thats not how society or the law sees it and we all know that and why...he knows why too and he can fight that legally...and should but it's not going to end the issue..if she gets help then it will put it out..if he has satisfied society and the law that he didn't do anything and it was her..then that's his luck...so..its still just another part of the game...its like city right of way...its that basic and that immature and that much a technicality. If a woman hits a man and gets her block knocked off then she's done it to herself...if a man can't pick a woman that won't drive him to violence then he's done it...everyone's responsible for themselves...and everyone knows that...if he had killed her..then people would put it where belongs but otherwise they're just looking at worms and wood...where did they go where did they come from and where are they now..thats not helping or hurting or involved..but its annoying and just an industry facet of entertainment.,Lance Love,0,2021-07-30T16:38:46Z
