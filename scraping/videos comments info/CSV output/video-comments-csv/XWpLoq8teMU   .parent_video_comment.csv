I do question the authenticity of certain audience members/youtubers! In Deppp's defense, I think he's mostly innocent, though not entirely. He's a violent lush and his drinking is UNCONTROLLABLE! This could've caused a snafu, which, henceforth, promptdd him to act abrasively. I know he has been doing his part to stay sobrr, which is phenomenal! I'm a fellow AA'er and do understand the stress that he has endured, though it doesn't excuse any of his alleged abuse imposed on Heard! \
 I'm 1 of his fans (in certain flicks) and an admirer of his style! This does explain why so many hav acknowledged that I do loook similar to him from particular movies! Haa
  I'm only asking, would you defend Deppp regardless of his looks and celebrity? This is an iconic case, in that it proves how guys can b victims too. I think we all HEARD what we needdd  -- the defense rests!
