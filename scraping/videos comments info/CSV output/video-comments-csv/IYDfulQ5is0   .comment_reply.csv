1,UgzzWWLsG5N77RfbUZR4AaABAg,Wendi Salgado,Phoenix Rising I love that! That‚Äôs perfectly said. I used to think I was a feminist until all these crazy women started with this insanity of ‚Äúmodern feminism‚Äù. I feel like people need to stand up and shut them up.,2020-02-20T09:25:40Z,1
2,UgzzWWLsG5N77RfbUZR4AaABAg,Phoenix Rising,Wendi Salgado thank you for clarifying.  I love how many women are coming out and supporting Johnny!  I have seen so many injustices with men and it‚Äôs about time we care for our men and listen to them and believe them too!   Johnny is a victim of domestic violence and I‚Äôm glad he‚Äôs getting justice! Thanks again!üôèüèø,2020-02-20T08:39:44Z,2
3,UgzzWWLsG5N77RfbUZR4AaABAg,Wendi Salgado,"Phoenix Rising You‚Äôre right. I had to go back and read my comment because I‚Äôm sure I never meant that. It is what it sounds like but what I meant is that women should learn to speak and use their words just like what we‚Äôd expect from a man to do.
I must‚Äôve known what I meant and just figured everyone would know what I meant. Lol",2020-02-20T05:59:44Z,1
4,UgzzWWLsG5N77RfbUZR4AaABAg,Phoenix Rising,@Wendi Salgado what?  hitting and throwing things is what is expected of the man?  OMG!  I had to read that again.... NO NO NO NO NO NO..... Men ARE NOT DOING THESE THINBGS!  Women are....  Men are reacting to these things and being called the abuser!,2020-02-19T19:58:17Z,1
5,UgzzWWLsG5N77RfbUZR4AaABAg,Phoenix Rising,"with all due respect, ah,  WOMAN PUSH AND PUSH AND PUSH, THEY BITE, SCRATCH HIT THROW THINGS, AND when the man finally reacts she screams abuse... I watched my mom do it to my dad, gain custody of us and her new boyfriend beat us all till we peed our pants and our dad could do nothing cuz he was a man, he couldn't even get joint custudy, even though we begged the judge to let us live with our dad....     I say, if you hit someone, know they have the right to hit your ass back... women punch's hurt too and women HAVE beaten men to death... you don't want to get hit, ah DON'T HIT- PERIOD!   and, HE NEVER HIT HER...  listen to the tapes... he pushed her to keep her from attacking him yet again... she abused him repeatedly.....     #jail4amberheard #justice4johnnydepp   #hetoo   .@Wendi Salgado",2020-02-19T19:54:27Z,2
6,UgwAVN7pASfMIu5Nz1p4AaABAg,Wendi Salgado,"Highwall (lmao @ dark side of the web) I don‚Äôt get on there very much. I‚Äôll have to get on and see what‚Äôs up. But that she had to? Ha! No... no one has to get into a fight like that. I agree with the comment that she is not alone in this. Johnny must‚Äôve done something to make her so mad but why get onto a physical altercation? Just leave! Like Johnny was trying to do and what made Amber get so mad. I‚Äôve heard that she‚Äôd even come to where he‚Äôs left to (ex. The bathroom or another house) and try to continue fighting with him. It sounds to me like a bully following you to try to keep poking the bear. Just stop! At some point people themselves, like Amber l, take it to far and deserve to be taught a lesson. Lol whether it‚Äôs knocking them out (which would still look horrible for Johnny) or to be thrown in jail.
I think she needs to be stripped of her role in Aquaman. She needs consequences. Women like this get away with actions like this all the time and it‚Äôs just enough. If you wanna act like an asshole, you should get treated like an asshole. And assholes get their asses handed to them eventually. Maybe it‚Äôs time to see it happen for Amber.
I‚Äôve also read it‚Äôs not the first time she‚Äôs abused a partner domestically so.. I don‚Äôt feel sorry for her.
I‚Äôm glad Johnny taped her.",2020-02-09T16:51:59Z,2
7,UgwAVN7pASfMIu5Nz1p4AaABAg,Highwall,"Well, do you know about this dark side of the web called twitter? I saw it in so many peoples defence for Amber.. Like she ""had to"" rubbed me wrong :)",2020-02-09T16:33:18Z,1
8,UgwAVN7pASfMIu5Nz1p4AaABAg,Wendi Salgado,Lol I haven‚Äôt seen or heard people saying that. ü§î But you right. I‚Äôm not a man but we do (as a society) also put a lot of pressure on men.,2020-02-09T16:08:06Z,2
9,UgytZ9EFlmC5hNPf4ed4AaABAg,Phoenix Rising,"with all due respect, r u kidding?    It is crystal clear here that it is AMBER that abuses and JOHNNY that leaves the room, how is that both of them?  He is the victim... she is the abuser and she admits it over and over, she even says she can't promise to stop abusing him... It was all her and he was the victim.  jail4amberheard  justice4johnnydepp",2020-02-19T19:46:26Z,0
10,Ugw2iRrxguPt8kSEaS94AaABAg,Wendi Salgado,"I'm talking about violence against either is wrong and we should not negate that women who do these kind of things deserve to be punished just like we'd expect a guy who abuses a women should be punished. Just because a man can cause more physical pain does not mean that we should let it be okay for our women to run wild and not learn to how to control their anger and for that matter, their emotions as well. (I am saying our women here like our baby girls. Our children.) If we don't control it from the beginning they will grow up with this same attitude towards our men. 
Feminism isn't bad if what you are fighting for are equal rights, but when it turns to putting men down and abusing them physically or even emotionally then that is a problem. Think of your children. Would you be okay with some bi+C# hitting him and cutting any body parts off just cause she was angry or because he wanted to leave her? That's BS. Other people might think it's funny but it's not. These women should be in jail doing hard time and if we just let it go on blindly things will never change.",2020-02-20T10:42:15Z,0
11,Ugw2iRrxguPt8kSEaS94AaABAg,Phoenix Rising,"oh, but were talking about violence against men here... know why?  because we always only talk about women... so, ah, in this forum, we are talking about the insane amount of violence women inflict upon men, and it goes virtually un noticed and it is laughed at... this is about WOMEN WHO GET AWAY WITH ABUSE BECAUSE THEY ARE WOMEN.....  #jail4amberheard  #justice4johnnydepp   #menslivesmatter   #hetoo",2020-02-19T19:35:45Z,1
