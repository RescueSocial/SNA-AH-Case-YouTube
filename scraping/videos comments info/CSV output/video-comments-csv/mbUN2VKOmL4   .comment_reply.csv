Yeah, once in a while, there will be a movie that everyone wants to see, like The Joker recently, for example.

104,Ugw2wihdfbkIFDdDcwJ4AaABAg,Mia Coleman,"@Bal Although she's attractive, I'm sorry but she's kind of a dime a dozen, unlike Scar Jo. That's why people call her ‚ÄúWalmart‚Äù Scarlett Johansson. She had to pay for bone structure, which just made her look old. She's really annoying, and even if she looked like Lauren German, I could not be attracted to that woman. So... Yeah no thanks",2021-07-27T04:17:50Z,1

112,UgzMXl1-BLWQfkVSRoJ4AaABAg,Whet Ones,"Indeed, the idea of staying in character has been around for at least four hundred years, likely longer. Richard Burbage, often regarded as one of the best (if not the best) actors under Elizabeth (and later James) and Shakespeare's go to leading man, was known to never break ""even in the tiring house"" - James Shapiro, ""The Year of Lear: Shakespeare in 1606"".",2020-08-30T17:06:20Z,12
113,UgzMXl1-BLWQfkVSRoJ4AaABAg,Tainiabellydance,Even during filming all she did was read  books. Makes her head not in character. I have degrees in theatre and I'm a professional dancer that 1st thing they teach is how stay in character an in the moment.,2020-08-30T16:38:10Z,4
114,UgzYHnebqHp5Bsx6jZl4AaABAg,Danielle Burchette,"You guys were great. I actually loved Aquaman. I thought it kept to the whole campy, pure spiritedness of the comics I remember reading as a kid. Jason Momoa was a great pick for Arthur, he has a comfortable in his skin vibe that works well . Aquaman was always so human. And while I love him and his films, I really just enjoyed the feeling I got as a whole from the film. Not to mention the excellent computer graphics. You have to admit, they were cool. üòâ",2020-09-14T16:47:54Z,0

117,UgzYHnebqHp5Bsx6jZl4AaABAg,Mel F,"I feel like starting another petition to get her removed now that I see her abysmal acting and Co star unviability with literally anyone. The single most hulking meathead actor in Hollywood couldnt feign likeness for her when everyone knows he's supposed to be ACTING. 

I can't blame him. But then, I can because he's supposed to be an actor. 

Sad sordid thing to get marred by such a she devil. On the job off the job, just please be this the last job! I feel sad they didn't put in his GoT costar. She complimented him. She compliments anyone she acts with because she's an actual actress!

We do a much better job of balancing commentary on technique and light hearted humor.

They bury you in kindness to reel you in and then when they have you they show what they really are.  Keep in mind Johnny has admitted his mother was the meanest woman he ever knew so he was likely deprived of love growing up and would be more vulnerable to a manipulative person who knew just what to do and say to lure someone like him in.,2020-08-29T20:02:23Z,18
