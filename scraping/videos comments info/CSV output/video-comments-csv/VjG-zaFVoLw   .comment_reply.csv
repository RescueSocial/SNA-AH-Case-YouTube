37,UgzMb1Hnoo7suhxWMOx4AaABAg,Spamachu Chan,"@ΔΕΣΠΟΙΝΑ ΑΘΑΝΑΣΟΠΟΥΛΟΥ  I also have a cosmetology license and this is also true! 👌 contrary to how TV portrays make up, it does in fact not cover or hide things well like bruises. The lighting will tell you differences in the amount of makeup covering an area. One would have to use a whole color correcting palet with yellow, red and orange to cover different surface areas. It will still look kinda like a bruise but more healed is all. I've also done zombie/attack victim makeup for Halloween, way easier to create a bruise with makeup than to cove it. Im also a survivor that tried to hide my bruises, they only looked like older bruises to throw off the time.",2021-05-04T02:01:42Z,6

39,UgzMb1Hnoo7suhxWMOx4AaABAg,Spamachu Chan,"@Dick Trickle This is true since in reality blood splatter on the walls would indicate a weapon, either a blunt object, a knife, or gun typically. Followed by CSI going over and determining what object was used if not located at the scene. Other than this they only other way to get blood on the wall, is to be thrown into the wall repeatedly with high force.
