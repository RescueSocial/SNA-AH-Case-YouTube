1,UgyLpSAz-PCqWiKS1SB4AaABAg,Debbie Schmidt,Hey John Paul..lol..watched your live chat last night...great stuff..REALLY GREAT STUFF! LOL..funny guy!  Thank you for all your hard work!!! And connecting all the dots!  Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!!! The power she was given to destroy this man is atrociously sickening. Thank you for taking the deep dive that you did! Greatly Appreciated!!!,2020-07-26T22:11:07Z,1
2,UgyLpSAz-PCqWiKS1SB4AaABAg,Kimber Blue,"@hunters videos  Lol, I think your'e totally right about Jon Paul and I understand as well what he was trying to say. I also agree that Johnny wouldn't want that, he's not that type. If he were then I would think that he would have gotten most of his girlfriends pregnant. The only thing I ever heard him say was that he would love to have another child. It was in an interview just before they got married and the rumor was that Amber was pregnant. Johnny isn't like Elon Musk. Yeah, Amber is desperate and it wouldn't surprise me if this acting coach helped get her started on this whole abuse hoax.",2020-07-26T20:09:50Z,0

Newspapers and the newscasters are becoming more tabloid-like, equality seems to be mostly one-sided and geared towards women, vengance and maliciousness seems to be encouraged rather than level-headedness, working things out, and calming down, etc. 
     For this, we have partly to thank the Feminazis, SJWs,  the Woke crowd, etc. Unless we strive for truth and impartiality in ALL things, regardless of gender, and stop caving in to these effed up groups then this atrocity will only continue. The police and courts have got to stop being brainwashed by nonsense. This applies from the outdated views on domestic violence to custody chiefly given to women after a divorce among other issues.
