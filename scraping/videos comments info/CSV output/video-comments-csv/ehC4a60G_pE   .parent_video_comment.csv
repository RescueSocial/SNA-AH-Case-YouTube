1,Ugzcli6khKYs_fCjgxp4AaABAg,"Johnny simply cannot lose this case.  All the evidence is on his side, and from where I am standing, it appears that the judge in this case won't put up with AH's nonsense and theatrics.  The judge who ruled in favour of the Sun was a man - the judge who appears to be on the side of justice in this case is a woman.",Susan Gavaghan,1,2021-07-26T19:35:45Z
2,UgxgRQ_CXG21nVw1c0d4AaABAg,"I completely agree with you, but I hope that AH will not get away like this and that she is really judged as it should be, because I think it will make a lot of noise, now that it has gone around the world, and that people are fed up with this corrupt justice so I think that Johnny will still win with all his overwhelming evidence and that she would do better to confess all his lies, because there, it aggravates his case more and more.",Brigitte,0,2021-07-17T12:24:11Z

6,UgzzGa_IaxeHKh_O-b54AaABAg,"üíó Well said and I totally agree! I pay attention to politics a little but for the most part I just stay out of it. Some of my family members have strong political views and it scares the crap out of me especially when they show clear signs of not actually having a clue about what goes on outside of their small town. But in this case specifically I see a woman attempting to use her power like a dangerous weapon. Seems to me that she is careless and doesn't care who gets hurt as long as she gets what she wants. Very scary. Hopefully she just moved on from Johnny. I don't like people who hold grudges. It's just not part of  my personal belief system. Plus, it's  not good 4 the soul. Move on live your best life. No one ever got ahead in life staying stuck on the past üíó",Katz Vlog,0,2021-07-16T10:00:13Z

16,UgwrlfQS1jmMqjhzmOV4AaABAg,Im betting that they are conceding that portion and banking on JD not being able to prove he lost money due to her defamation.

I can't take anything she says seriously whether it's 'she wants to be a mother, ' or her apparent support for women.  Many see through her calculated actions and I'm sure they have the same viewpoint. Even the fact that she keeps going with her shit on JD, the reason will be because it keeps her in the spotlight. Let's face it, she's a terrible actress. She's not famous for being that but for being JDs ex wife. All she's done since the divorce is gain notoriety since bringing the DV allegations. She's a pitiful excuse for a human being and she appears to have no self awareness. Again not surprising.",Paula Teetree,0,2021-07-15T21:48:20Z
