Where's the respect that WE the people who are on UTube must have from these kind of posts?
How can this recording be put out there? You can hardly understand what's being said and readers  understand whatever they want too. I've read some comments and that's exactly what's happening.
This is a serious thing that is happening to Johnny. I will block RIGHT NOW.",Flor Delgado,0,2021-11-20T01:22:27Z

19,Ugy01dGjuhkvgfFxxjZ4AaABAg,I’m a lifelong Johnny Depp fan but he really isn’t looking so good with some of this stuff coming out. I didn’t believe her at first but now I’m convinced it was a mutual abusive thing. His texts to Paul Betany. Him saying “I should have left her when I found out she dyed her hair. I see roots” is just douchy. And if you look at photos of the rented houses kitchen you do see a plastic phone on the counter.,Mary Elizabeth,7,2020-04-13T19:13:53Z

23,Ugzt1k7Ls241vVsI-HJ4AaABAg,"This is what I could make out of Jerry's convo:
6:56:
 I hear what you’re saying I’m just, look, I’ve seen Johny bad, I’ve never seen him THIS bad. What I’m saying is he wrecked this place. I mean it’s wrecked. Windows broken, there’s a TV…I..I think she did it. There was a cup thrown, it missed, there’s been bottles thrown, and she admits to me she threw the first one, she threw a bottle on him. She hit first. She hits him in the head. And I said to her “you lost it?” and she says I just threw [x] things [we do (?)] in my temper [X] admit what he did (?), “he was shouting at me screaming at me”. She has scratches on her left arm which Debby told me about, I looked at her, and I’ve seen those scratches before on other people and as far as I’m concerned they’re self-inflicted. I’m convinced of that: self-inflicted. Listen to me, at the moment, at the moment I’ll do a deal with the devil, to calm this lady down, because when we sat in the car with kipper [or “when we sent the car to kipper”] [X] she turned around and told me [X] like this. She [X] this whole thing calmed down. You know what I mean “I’ve been hurt this, I’ve been hurt that” he’s trying to say [X] couldn’t understand her [or something “amber”], and she admitted on this call that she hit him first. She actually hit him in the face. First. He has a small burn on his right hand side of his face, which she says – I’ve seen that yesterday – but she said, she said Friday he put a cigarette and burned his own face with a cigarette he was so bad. He is not well, we need to help him out in every way we possibly can. [“We need her out” or “calmed down”] and I can’t convince her. She [X] “I only got here”.  She’s still trying [X] listening, sometimes not. And I said you can’t help him. You can’t. You two need to be separated. You could speak on the phone… [Video cuts]  
there’s 75,000 dollars in breakage here, there’s blood everywhere and paint [X] full of these tears and these too are covered in blood steps(?) all through the haul, and the bedroom is upstairs [X] and the bar, he drank everything in the past week [x] incapacitated [X] she told dr. kipper in two hours he took 10, 10! Ecstasy tablets, and some coke. once this is all over, it’s not the time to talk about it, that’s what I’m saying I'm frightened if someone keeps supplying him he’s gonna OD on this. And Amber disagrees (or ""crazy""), she’s said, SHE’s had some. What I’m talking about, he drank tequila, he drank vodka. He start drinking vodka behind her back, because she said he didn’t want her to smell it. When I [x] knew he was drinking again to calm down, he can’t stop drinking tequila, and there he picked up one of the bottles and threw it through the window. Right, I know he’s asleep at the moment, resting. Hold on a second, our doctors agree, [doctor] has said, she did it or he did it, right now it wasn’t not so urgent. And David’s got down here, and David had said this. It has not poured down the sink. Now one of them is gonna get sick. She’s stone cold sober. she doesn’t spill her booze [or something about bruise], so [X] hand [X] trusted the motherfucking [too quiet] David if you could hear that… understand how she's talking to me [video cuts] 
Jerry talking to ben king: I don’t think she needs a firm hand [X] 
ben: so what then
jerry: I don’t think she needs a firm hand, she just needs someone to talk to and be looked of [?] her husband [X]
ben: speaking of cleaning up, I must be going. Safe to say we lost the deposit on this one [X] should we pay now
jerry: between me and you, I’m looking at about 30 to 75K  minimum. 
ben: a week? …",Ester Lev,53,2020-04-09T15:50:33Z
