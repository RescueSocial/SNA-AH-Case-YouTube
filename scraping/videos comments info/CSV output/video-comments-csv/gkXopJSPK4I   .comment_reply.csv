10,Ugy5lkeh_8TCWVEt9fl4AaABAg,VIDS2013,"@sweetieitreallyisme I highly recommend watching talks by Erin Pizzey, who opened the first DV shelter in the UK back in the early '70s. She has a wealth of insights on this issue.

11,Ugy5lkeh_8TCWVEt9fl4AaABAg,VIDS2013,"@sweetieitreallyisme Yes, it is true. Men and women are equally likely to be victims of or perpetrators of Domestic Violence. Assertions to the contrary are usually driven by an agenda--often financial--or by a lack of knowledge.

This recent NIH study put the number of male DV victims at 40%--and that figure is very likely low due to the male tendency to under report. (In instances where the violence was non-reciprocal, the aggressor was more than twice as likely to be *female"".) The conventional perception of male aggressor and female victim is a corrosive and abusive myth.
