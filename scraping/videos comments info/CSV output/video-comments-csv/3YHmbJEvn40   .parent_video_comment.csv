As far as charitable donations go, those will never see the light of day. Why? Because shes now got extra costs with her daughter. She will use that as the latest excuse. shes sat there and blantantly lied about the fact she cant afford to pay those donations, and blames it on the lawsuit 2 years after, but hey, she can afford the surrogacy fees, procedures etc, lets be honest, it doesnt always work first time so how many times did she have to pay for the procedures, then assuming the healthcare would not be for free in the US obviously there would be the scans, healthcare or the surrogate, hospital fees, yadda yadda yadda..
Unless this surrogate was in London as suspected, which she wouldnt have to pay for the healthcare as it would be on the NHS, cheeky! But still costs are involved with surrogacy anyway, surely she could have afforded the charitable donations to be paid, especially since shes still being employed by WB! I dont believe for one minute that shes broke from paying all these lawyers and legal stuff... I just hope she realises she will be paying hugely in other ways when she is charged after all this is done. Hope she feels its worth it.

 The older JD gets i think the better his movies would get.. He was legitimately honing his craft to deadly sharpness... the dude could wrap himself into characters in such an incredibly embraced capacity, that you couldnt even see the normal depp, he would become unrecognizable in such a talentful way, in a way that 98% of actors can only dream of... He IS the needle in the haystack of actors... the only other person ive seen come close to his level of, hmm whats the word.. Metamorphosis.. Is Heath Ledger playing Joker.. Which was crazy too, i didnt know it was him till after the movie.... I mean even like JD playing willy wonka, lol.. how in the hell is that Johnny Depp.. or edward scissor hands, grindlewald, and even his character in fear and loathing.. Hes quite possibly the best actor of our generation... He doesnt just act like himself going through these emotions the character would feel throughout the script... he creates a new persona, a split personality so genuine, its wild.. And honestly kinda humbling... Hes not just being his recognizable self, to build himself up in the publics eye, and make his personality even more recognizable to the public... He does things that sometimes people wont even realize is him... for example Grindlewald.. Lol like HL playing Joker,  i didnt even know that was him till AFTER i watched the movie and learned that it was him.. and i had to rewatch it to do a double take.. blew my mind man..

275,UgxdKfyYaL6D6hlPbLF4AaABAg,anyone else feel like the nameless should have a law named after her cause she has wasted so much time threw around so much libel and accused and threaten so many people for these trials I am just gonna call it one big case that she must have broken so many laws by not letting Johnny have a fair and speedy trail so naming a law after here that strictly says the minute you are proven to be wasting the courts time you lost the case.  Sorry if my ramble doesnt make sense but come on this has gone on long enough Johnny is behaving in the court room and the nameless one is crying everytime him or his legal team says something she  doesnt like.,Victor Montes,11,2021-07-23T17:51:32Z
