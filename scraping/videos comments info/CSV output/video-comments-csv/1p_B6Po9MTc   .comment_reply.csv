They can‚Äôt make me feel a thing. Bcuz they are fakes. Idk. Maybe if all people just took that into account, we‚Äôd all have that spidey sense. And I heard that on a channel I follow. This lady teaches physical and tell tale signs of lying. She also says the same thing. When someone is lying, (she did a lot of killer spouses lying to everyone about how sad they were about their victim being dead or missing) the compassion or the emotion is just not there.

I was one of those ‚Äúneutral‚Äù people when it came to her and my cousins. Until she did it to me, I couldn‚Äôt really see it. But after I went through it, of course I KNEW, and I felt that I had to go to my cousins and apologize for my lack of support to them. And I was really glad for how gracious they were to me. We then all became allies and became a lot closer. So one silver lining at least. They are utterly insidious tho‚Äîthe coverts. 

I think mostly I didn‚Äôt buy how quickly she cried victim. And how clear she seemed to be on everything. Most of us would run and hide in shame and be still very confused and not even be able to process that we were being abused yet. We‚Äôd have bits and pieces and would doubt ourselves and not be so sure or self assured about what just happened to us. She seemed to have had her ‚Äúabuse script‚Äù so well rehearsed and ‚Äúpolished‚Äù and that right quickly. Meanwhile Johnny was the one acting more like that. Drunk. Depressed. Broken. Messed up.

167,UgwqsN9yZJunrsODYzl4AaABAg,Sunny Exposure,"lisa richards That's not true at all. I am neither a Trump supporter nor am I pro Russia. On the topic of Amber Heard, from reading Kate James' testimony, it seems she did indeed employ the copycat mirroring strategy to ensnare him. However when she was with Tasya, she chose a feminine style quite different to Tasya and only Tasya wore hats. So, I'm not so sure that AH suffers a lack of identity. Amber's behaviour may just be the result of ambitious manipulation and/or narcissim and not a personality disorder.",2020-09-25T02:23:53Z,0

179,UgypCdpIRNm148GFW0l4AaABAg,Jonathan Johnson,"However, the DSM is not accurate. All Cluster B personality disorders have Kernberg's Borderline Personality ORGANIZATION (BPO) in common.  NPD occurs as a result of a person developing a pathological [grandiose] false self as a defense against the underlying BPO.  Relatedly, the maximum severity level of NPD abuts Antisocial Personality Disorder (Sociopathy/Psychopathy: a subset of severe NPD with zero empathy and zero desire for relationships), and can present with behavior that mimics BPD or APD/Psychopathy such that mental health practitioners Iacking psychoanalytic/psychodynamic training mistakenly diagnose comorbidity of BPD and NPD.  If a person's behavior sometimes fits BPD criteria, sometimes NPD, sometimes displaying elements of Sociopathy/Psychopathy, that is a syndrome occurring within the severe NPD population known as Malignant Narcissism.  Malignant Narcissists' behavior can be virtually indistinguishable from that of psychopaths in that they lack a conscience; however, they desire some type of connection with (a) love object(s).  Additionally, like Borderlines, they can be clingy and fear abandonment, experience extreme paranoia and/or psychosis, and many engage in self harm and/or suicidal ideation.  Malignant Narcissism can look just like BPD, but the self harm and suicidality are born of sadism and omnipotent control, not masochism and self-loathing (although self-loathing is at the core of BPO and all of the associated Cluster B personality disorders).  So if a person find themselves ""walking on eggshells"", but their partner ditches them - in contrast to the abandonment-fearing personality type (BPD) described in ""I hate you, don't leave me"" - they have found a malignant narcissist.  Expect no differently or less from them than you would from a psychopath.  It is worth distinguishing malignant narcissism from BPD, because the prognosis for treatment as I understand it is pretty close to zero.  Do not waste time thinking that DBT might help these BPD lookalikes, for they are simply O2-wasting humanoids with no redeeming qualities and no potential for self-reflection and desire for change.  BPD and NPD are mutually exclusive in theory and practice, but understanding the finer points is critical.

Abandon the DSM; Kernberg is the key (read ""borderline conditions and pathological narcissism"").",2020-09-23T10:37:49Z,3
180,UgypCdpIRNm148GFW0l4AaABAg,lisa richards,"DSD   Yes, exactly, and I‚Äôm glad you understand that.
I would love to go on your show sometime, and talk about these issues.
You cannot find someone guilty, just because they have a personality disorder. 
There are many people that have a personality disorder that are in therapy, and working on themselves.
in one way, having a personality disorder is like having it at an addiction. 
You have to take responsibility for your issues, admit you ha e a problem, and stop the horrible behavior, which Amber refuses to do.
It is the grandiosity and the sense of entitlement that makes these people continue their horrific behavior.",2020-09-22T22:57:18Z,4

The court systems need to recognize this diagnosis AND rule accordingly. I mean I guess every, including Johnny, should have recognized this before and just stayed away from her in the first place. I agree with you that narcissism and narcissist is so over used. Unfortunately it‚Äôs one of those terms that catches the attention.

Lol. Same for Wynona. I‚Äôm so glad the truth finally comes out on people like this tho. And Vanessa vouched for him also. And that was 14 years with two kids with no hint of abuse. Plus the stand up way he conducted himself with the people he worked for and with. People like Johnny and Wynona are just way too authentic and original and deep to be some fake narc chronic abuser. I could more likely believe that whatever he did was at most a small bit of highly provoked reactive counter abuse. Its like the equivalent of him getting in a small scratch on her when she effectively beat him to a pulp. And then she cries oh poor me. I‚Äôve been so abused. SMDH.,2020-09-22T22:06:37Z,4
