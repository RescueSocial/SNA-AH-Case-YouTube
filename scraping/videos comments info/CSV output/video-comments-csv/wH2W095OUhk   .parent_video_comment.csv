28,UgydrK2M9Ud4pNr6bZZ4AaABAg,"Amber Heard is the worst thing to happen to the cause of the victims of Domestic Abuse.  I am horrified as survivor myself, and disgusted as a counsellor of Abuse Victims.  As a counsellor, I am terrified that some young person will think attempting to surreptitiously film their abuser during an attack is the correct thing to do.  It is not.  It will result in physical violence.  If Mr. Depp HAD been abusive, Ms. Heard wouldn't have walked away laughing when Mr. Depp discovered her filming him, she would have ended up in the hospital, and her phone would have been destroyed.  

Originally, Ms. Heard sold the illegally made and edited ""abuse"" video to TMZ, alleging that when the video ended was when Mr. Depp began to physically assault her -- but when the unedited video was uncovered, Mr. Depp does exactly what Ms. Heard berates him for repeatedly on the tapes... he leaves, and she turns the phone off with a laugh.  

Ms. Heard's supporters like to minimize the importance of her previous arrest for the domestic assault of her wife, Tasya van Ree, at the Seattle/Tacoma International Airport, in 2009.  Ms. Heard, as a narcissist, attempted to have her former wife explain it away by releasing a statement ""In 2009, Amber was wrongfully accused for an incident that was misinterpreted and over-sensationalized by two individuals in a powerful position.  I recount hints of misogynistic attitudes towards us, which later appeared to be homophobic when they found out we were domestic partners and not just friends.  Charges were quickly dropped and she was released moments later.  It's disheartening that Amber's integrity and story are being questioned once again.  Amber is a brilliant, honest and beautiful woman, and I have the utmost respect for her.  We shared five wonderful years together, and remain close to this day.""  (June 8, 2016, eonline, ""Amber Heard's ex-girlfriend Tasya van Ree speaks out"")

The women thought that this explanation would suffice, because Ms. Heard had successfully applied to have the record destroyed.  Unfortunately for them, Airports must retain a record of arrests occurring on site.  Arresting Officer Beverly Leonard, an openly gay woman who works to support gay rights, and volunteers at Domestic Violence Shelters, was quoted ""I am not so homophobic or misogynistic!  An arrest was made because an assault occurred (I witnessed it) and the parties were in a domestic relationship.""  As a survivor, I find Ms. Heard's tendency to minimalize and marginalize the community of women working to support survivors, simply because their expertise doesn't fit her agenda, *very disturbing.*  Ms. van Ree not *only* lied about the severity of the crime, ""Police documents show there was actual property damage"" as a valuable necklace was torn from Ms. Van Ree's neck during the assault -- she also lied about how upset she was.  The arrest was made at *HER* request. (6/9/2016,TMZ, Amber Heard: Homophobic, Misogynistic Cop... A Gay Woman) 

Charges *WERE NOT* ""quickly dropped... and Amber Heard *WAS NOT* released moments later.  She was arrested, taken for her mug shot, and spent the night in jail, as Ms. van Ree did not make her bail.  Ms. Heard was arraigned the following day, where she did *NOT* protest her innocence, although the Judge was severe with her (a recording of the arraignment exists).  Because both women lived out of State, the Judge and the Prosecutor agreed to leave the case open for the next two years, on the chance that Ms. Heard would re-offend.  After the period had expired, and Ms. Heard was now dating Johnny Depp, she had her lawyer, Michele Shaw, request deletion of her criminal history. (9 June, 2016, Daily Mail: Police Officer Who Was Accused of Homophobia...)

If ""Amber's story and integrity are being questioned once again"", it is because she is a compulsive liar.  She certainly has proved that she is *NOT* ""honest""!  She did *NOT* donate her divorce settlement money to charity, she kept it herself, although she has given interviews where she claimed ""she wanted nothing"" and *had* divided the money between the charities, as well as sent out press releases that her donations were complete. She pled ""Guilty"" to falsifying legal documents in the Australian Dog Smuggling Case, and now Australia has re-opened the Case for further investigation, and is working with the American F.B.I. because it was revealed in the U.K. ""Sun"" Defamation Trial that Ms. Heard had suborned perjury of Kevin Murphy, under threat of having him fired, to lessen the severity of her sentence in Australia. 

 The L.A.P.D. have also opened a perjury investigation against Ms. Heard, for stating under oath in the ""Sun"" Defamation Trial that Mr. Depp had assaulted her, causing injury, and destroying their penthouse Apartment, and that the two sets of two Officers who responded to the two 911 calls lied when all four of them stated that there was no evidence of any crime.  Body-cam footage that Ms. Heard was unaware existed, shows the apartment in perfect order, no damage to the door, and no damage to her person.  This means that Ms. Heard and her co-conspirators fabricated evidence and a crime scene with the purpose of extorting Mr. Depp. (2016, Samantha Spector ""extortion"" Letter of demands)

Even the finding of the Judges in the ""Application for Appeal"" noted that Ms. Heard had committed perjury during the trial... but the extremely gullible ""Justice"" Nicol believed her stories, and took her word over the L.A.P.D. Officers.  Now that the Police Body-cam footage has surfaced, ""Justice"" Nicol is proven a fool, and his final Trial has been exposed as a joke, as well as a miscarriage of justice (or perhaps he was personal friends with Rupert Murdoch, owner of ""the Sun"", and his son worked for another of Murdoch's companies TALKradio.)",NIBS,19,2021-05-19T08:11:14Z

31,UgzxbU8vM0XbRBAHymt4AaABAg,"First we had Amberr Heard and then we had her close friends Evan Rachel Wood and Esme Bianco making allegations against Marilyn Manson, one of Johnny Depps best friends.  The problem is that Evan contacted and GROOMED ALL of the accusers.  Many of the women have serious crediblity issues - it does not help that we discovered ALL of the accusers are friends and have already been caught falsifying the little ""proof"" that they have.  People published photo's of Ashley Morgans scars but it has been discovered  it is not even her body AND the photo's came from pinterest.  The main stream media is not making any effort to determine if their is ANY truth in their claims.  They have already approached Manson and have said they will stop making the allegations in exchange for CASH.   I am glad that Manson said no and plans on fighting.  From the new evidence I have seen it will not be hard to prove that ALL of the women have ulterior motives, but absolutely NO EVIDENCE.",tammy koble,14,2021-05-19T06:40:59Z
