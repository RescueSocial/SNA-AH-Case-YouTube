20,UgyPclMl7NDU_50fKG54AaABAg,Dannie Mo,"@Chloe Reed Damn, your first sentence… my point is, if you’ve bothered to read and understand, that if Nicole Kidman listened to the audio tapes about AH admitting to abuse, then surely she must have changed her mind about her—if there’s integrity in her, of course.

52,UgxtaawMaldIReJWsfZ4AaABAg,Kelsey Anderson,"@michelle annor it's not just for women. There was a whole study done where they found incarcerated people who are ""attractive"" get lesser sentences. They also took groups of people and should them random photos of men and women and then provided fictitious crimes they committed, evidence, statements, and things from the court hearing. Everything was fake but the people participating in the study were told they were real court cases. They were told to act as a jury and to decide sentencing. When the group saw someone as attractive they would start assuming things to justify their actions and would give lighter sentences or find them innocent. Like one guy who beat and robbed an old women. They decided, with nothing from the court case to suggest this, that he was just trying to feed he's kids and it got out of had. When they found someone unattractive they should almost immediately start saying they were guilty. Even going so far as to say ""oh you can tell they are a criminal just by looking at them"". They would make assumptions for them like they committed the crime to support their drug habit. It was super gross. If you can find the videos I suggest watching it. It shows just how messed up the justice system can be.",2021-10-06T23:22:08Z,1
