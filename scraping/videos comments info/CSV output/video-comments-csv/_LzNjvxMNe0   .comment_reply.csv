Amber Heard Donates Entire $7 Million Settlement From Johnny Depp Divorce to Charity [Updated]

One of the charities is focused on protecting domestic violence survivors.



BY JULIE MILLER

AUGUST 19, 2016



Update: In a press release sent out on Thursday, Amber Heard announced that she would be donating her entire $7 million settlement from Depp to the American Civil Liberties Union, ‚Äúwith a particular focus to stop violence against women,‚Äù and the Children‚Äôs Hospital of Los Angeles.

‚ÄúAs described in the restraining order and divorce settlement, money played no role for me personally and never has, except to the extent that I could donate it to charity and, in doing so, hopefully help those less able to defend themselves,‚Äù Heard said. ‚ÄúAs reported in the media, the amount received in the divorce was $7 million and $7 million is being donated. This is over and above any funds that I have given away in the past and will continue to give away in the future.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know these organizations will put the funds to good use and look forward to continuing to support them in the future,‚Äù Heard continued. ‚ÄúHopefully, this experience results in a positive change in the lives of people who need it the most.‚Äù

Less than three months after Amber Heard filed for divorce from Johnny Depp, alleging domestic violence and igniting one of the most acrimonious splits in recent Hollywood memory, the former couple has reached a divorce settlement.



TMZ first broke the news Tuesday morning, claiming that ‚ÄúJohnny agreed to pay Amber approximately $7 million to walk away . . . that includes attorneys‚Äô fees.‚Äù According to the Associated Press, Heard is also ‚Äúwithdrawing allegations that Johnny Depp physically abused her.‚Äù In addition to the settlement, the actors, who were married for only 15 months, released a joint statement to the outlet.

‚ÄúOur relationship was intensely passionate and at times volatile, but always bound by love,‚Äù the actors say. ‚ÄúNeither party has made false accusations for financial gain. There was never an intent of physical or emotional harm. Amber wishes the best for Johnny in the future. Amber will be donating financial proceeds from the divorce to a charity.‚Äù

The settlement arrives four days after a grainy video showing Depp, believed to have been filmed by Heard, was leaked on the Internet. The video was only the latest ugly development in the actors‚Äô path towards separation, which was paved with conflicting allegations about substance abuse and domestic violence, and a flurry of tabloid headlines.

Depp and Heard, who met while filming 2011‚Äôs The Rum Diary, married in a private Los Angeles ceremony in February 2015. Days after, they celebrated with a slightly larger ceremony on Depp‚Äôs private island in the Bahamas.

Speaking to E! last year, Depp revealed what first drew him to Heard.

‚ÄúWe connect on a lot of levels but the first things that really got me was she‚Äôs an aficionado of the blues,‚Äù the actor said. ‚ÄúI would play a song, some old obscure blues song, and she knew what it was.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs very very literate,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs a voracious reader as I have been, so we connected on that as well and she‚Äôs kind of brilliant and beautiful.‚Äù

Last year, Heard also opened up about the marriage, telling The Times of London, ‚ÄúI never thought I would get married. But I‚Äôve always loved who I‚Äôve loved.‚Äù



Heard also spoke about the transition from being Depp‚Äôs girlfriend to his wife, telling Elle, ‚ÄúNothing is a dramatic change. We‚Äôve been together for a long time now, so it‚Äôs been a fairly organic process. . . . I have a fiercely independent spirit.

‚ÄúThe thing that really scares me is the potential of losing my freedom,‚Äù she added to the magazine. ‚ÄúI never want for my life to lose the ability to transverse the world, with freedom and ease.‚Äú",2020-04-04T16:24:36Z,0

I advocated(not that thats worth anything) for Depp not losing his job(s) in the past when he got blacklisted without even knowing of these tapes, and now i advocate for Heard not losing hers for the same reason, because this whole issue is not about gender, it is about power, making it about gender is their way to divide the people, nothing else and evidently they succeed with it.
Anyway this runs in circles so i'm out of here. Stay angry guys, keep fighting the good fight however misdirected it often is, keep believing that women in Hollywood don't eat the same shitsandwich men do because the media protects a select few of them for show while the abuse continues, and never stop throwing around your insults blindly.

91,Ugx3hVYtTbkqle8322l4AaABAg,Swole Calibur,"@Goukes Yes, but the media is a blown up example of our society. So yes this is onr big media spectacle, it's also something that is a big problem in our regular lives. Female offenders of any crime (not just abusers) get less punishment then men or even get away with a lot of stuff. One of the other reasons Heard should be fired and be called out as an offender is to set an example. To show that women can't just get away with everything.
Telling me when or how to use the word simp makes no sense since 90% of the people using the word don't even know what it realy means. Unless you're familiar with the MGTOW and red pill movement, where it's origin is from, you have no clue what you're talking about.",2020-04-02T16:02:02Z,0
92,Ugx3hVYtTbkqle8322l4AaABAg,Goukes,"Well good for you being ahead of the trend in using simp and similar terms inappropriately to undermine opposing opinions. 
I hope you realize that you are actually playing in the medias hand by building up¬†their potential scapegoat to get away with their hypocrisy again, 'cuz if it comes to it they'll just¬†let Heard take the hit while the producers/media that perpetuate this bullshit and¬†blacklisted Depp in the first place remain unscathed to move on to the next¬†hypocrisy spectacle, with you guys in tow. 
It is just a spectacle, the metoo movement is an absolute¬†mess yes, but while you are so concerned about¬†a¬†shitty girlfriend they present for you to focus on, abusers and their enablers(of either gender)¬†are still employed and esteemed there.",2020-04-02T12:01:55Z,0
93,Ugx3hVYtTbkqle8322l4AaABAg,Swole Calibur,"@Goukes Yes I was but not only in Depps case but also when the whole ""metoo"" bs started where men could be labeled as an abuser without any evidence. The reason I'm so mad about this case, is that the media slaughtered Depp without there being any evidence but now since the roles are not only reversed but this time WITH evidence, there are no consequences for Heard and the media just keeps things quite. The reason for all of this is, Hollywood saw this a an opportunity to skyrocket Heard's carreer as an abuse surviving heroine and womens rights activist. And feminazism isn't outdated because it's still a big problem plus I've been using the term ""simp"" way (years) before the mainstream picked up on the term.",2020-04-02T11:21:02Z,0
