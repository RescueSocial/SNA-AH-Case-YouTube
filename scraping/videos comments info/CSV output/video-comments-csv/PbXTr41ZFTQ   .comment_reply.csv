6,UgwzV2crAIpuu6Cyd7R4AaABAg,Michelle T.,"@JannieJohanne So, I understand it has been two months since the initial post you made that you are receiving comments on. I suggest that you re-watch the video so you can ‚Äúremember‚Äù what was so upsetting to you. 
Also, since you made it clear this has nothing to do with AH, and more about the ‚Äúowner of this canal‚Äù saying something you found offensive, again, I would suggest that you listen to the video again and really be clear on the context in what he was saying‚Ä¶and then ask yourself, is he directly insulting you and the literally millions of people who continue to watch his videos?
I really don‚Äôt want to get caught up in this kind of drama. I rarely respond to something like this. I guess I feel the need to defend Brian because he has done an outstanding job!

Based on the many recordings I've listened to and the many witness testimonies, I'm pretty positive she is a narcissistic sociopath. People like that don't feel normal empathy or emotions and tend to start mimicking it from an early age in an attempt to blend in and manipulate. As a result, they tend to be very skilled at love bombing and turning on the charm when it suits their goals. Then when they inevitably tear it away, their victim is left on a confusing roller coaster of approval seeking and chasing that dopamine hit that the abuser initially dolled out in spades. 

It's hard for normal people to wrap their mind around how anyone could be so devoid of compassion and love, so they find themselves making excuses for the abuser's behavior, self-blaming, or just trying to constantly appease them to avoid conflict. The gaslighting and up/down drama creates an addictively toxic combination for a gentle and empathetic partner. It's almost a form of trauma bonding. It's easy for even very intelligent, capable people to get sucked in, because the manipulation is so subversive and confusing at first. Finally though the victim realizes, just as Johnny did, that the person they loved never actually existed at all. I wish peace and healing for him. ‚ù§Ô∏èüôè 

The only thing worse than getting wrapped up emotionally in one of these toxic people is also having the painful saga unfold in the public eye. I'm very glad the truth has come to light! His patience, gentleness, and moral character really shines thru on the other side of this, whereas her's does as well -- in the opposite fashion.

Also when you get married to Johnny Depp, you can't logically expect him to have huge amounts of time. I feel like he does care, and a lot at that, but he also picked up a bad drug habit while he was with her which never helps with these things. Can't blame him though.

We've all done some pretty shitty things, but you seem to forget that Johhny depp is a brilliant guy, donating to charity, going to children's hospitals (secretly btw) and everyone who's known him, appart from Amber has nothing but great things to say, it's like the oppisite of the Pirates quote, something like  ""a man can't be forgiven for a few good deeds if he has commited a lifetime of tyranny"", Johhny isn't automatically a terrible person, if that were true, you would be terrible, I would, everyone would. Now Amber is very clearly, if you watched the video of her in questioning, a manipulitive sociopathic liar, she never actually acts with forgiveness, only speaks, it's easy to say your sorry, but she never does anything to mean so, and always blames it on someone else when, as you could see in the vid, the lie makes no sense and she blames it all on Johhny, even though she knows it's bullshit. Amber and Johhny are so obviously very different people and to say they are both guilty is just wrong, the only person he's hurt through this whole thing is himself for not recognizing Amber for what she is. *mic drop*",2020-03-23T02:56:14Z,2

339,UgyGXynbMKNw9L7voIJ4AaABAg,Arun Keshavadas,"@kaerbear Let me reiterate my point. If a man commits a reprehensible act, it is regarded as a result of toxic masculinity, but¬†If a women commits that same offense, I rarely see the words toxic femininity get thrown around. (at least, not to the same extent)

Now let me talk about the words toxic masculinity themselves. The first word 'toxic' has a blatantly obvious negative connotation attached to it and it is also a pronoun. If you've ever been to an English class you would know that a pronoun is used to describe the noun that comes after it. So what's the second half of this term? 'Masculinity', which has such a broad meaning that I sometimes wonder what's the point of using it. Now from an outsider's perspective, you can't blame someone for misunderstanding what this term means, because the immediate meaning you derive from it is ""masculinity is toxic"". Now you could go around trying to explain to people what it really means, but what I'm trying to get you to understand is that *using the word toxic masculinity will have a negative impact on the minds of men in the long run*. I think the word 'toxic masculinity' can easily be used to oppress members in a society (men) and get them to feel like there is something inherently wrong with them, and that will destroy their self-image and confidence. Perhaps this is what feminists want in the first place ie. to get the word toxic masculinity into the mainstream vocabulary, after which it's constant usage will create self-doubt and guilt in the minds of men. You keep saying that you shouldn't associate sensitivity to femininity, but you are doing the exact same thing by insisting on using the words toxic masculinity. The truth is that if you use a word with a negative connotation (toxic) along with a word that doesn't have one (masculinity), you can eventually get people to attach the negative connotation of the former to the latter in their minds. So you're being a hypocrite by using the term toxic masculinity.

Here's my advice, if you don't want  people to get turned off by your cause, come up with a better terminology than toxic masculinity.",2020-02-11T07:33:53Z,0
340,UgyGXynbMKNw9L7voIJ4AaABAg,Arun Keshavadas,"@kaerbear You weren't able to refute any of the points that I made in the first half of my comment and decided to focus on the fact that I said ""tit for tat, bitches"" instead. I personally do not like the term ""toxic masculinity"" because the words themselves in that order give a different meaning than the one that you detailed in your comment. I also do not like the fact that you claim toxic masculinity somehow encompasses toxic femininity too, because from what I understand your claim is that toxic femininity is somehow a by-product of toxic masculinity. You refuse to acknowledge toxic femininity as a problem of it's own and do not try to address it with the same level of seriousness as you do with toxic masculinity. (Side note: If you're so worried about people misunderstanding the meaning of toxic masculinity, why don't you come up with a better word instead. You won't, because you and feminists like you want to frame this as issue exclusive to men.) That's complete and utter bullshit and I know for a fact that a majority of women (feminists of course) who use the word toxic masculinity is only using it's as a way to shame and criticize the actions of men and men alone. 

Anyway, I think I've digressed. All I'm saying is that you're one of the very few feminists who use the word toxic masculinity with the definition that you've given above. In fact, I suspect that the original definition of toxic masculinity was altered in order to include feminine toxicity too after it received backlash from the MRAs. In fact, toxic femininity wasn't even an issue feminists addressed before MRAs brought it up. That's how blissfully ignorant the feminist movement is.",2020-02-11T06:59:58Z,0

342,UgyGXynbMKNw9L7voIJ4AaABAg,d.riddle,"@Alan J You clearly don't know what ""toxic masculinity"" means. If you think it's an attack against men, you are dead wrong. And it's never referring to all men, for fuck's sake. Stop being focused on hate and thinking everything feminists do is against you. Take a moment to breathe, understand the context, and then rethink of flinging hate in the wrong direction. Toxic masculinity is about the stereotype that men don't have feelings, can't be good fathers, shouldn't cry, etc. It's about pushing that image on men. Feminists say that such a stereotype shouldn't exist, that men do have feelings just like women, that they can be amazing parents, and there is no shame in them expressing emotion. That's why they use that term. You disagree with all that? You believe it's shameful for a man to cry and show emotion? If not, then you seem to be on the same line of thinking as the feminists you keep attacking.",2020-02-03T10:54:39Z,3

349,UgzgVjWirdyIFogicFB4AaABAg,Forgotten soul,"go check up the new video :) its Johnny and amber talking well Johnny talking calmly and amber screaming most of them time. You really do get the sense of how Johnny is his personality and how genuine he really is. He is very calm in the talk he rarely raises his voice and every 2 seconds she does. Everytime a fight ever arose and everytime it got physical he would WALK AWAY and go into another room. it's exactly what someone should do!He obviously does it to just get away but I'm very sure he did it as well to clear his head and calm himself so he can then figure out the RIGHT way to sort things out but SHE never wanted to sort things out SHE ALWAYS wanted to fight and poke at him. So I think he really can control himself, and if it really does get to hectic for himself he does walk away, if he cant get away then obviously something could happen, which I truly understand when I get to a point I can't control my anger I walk away before I do do something stupid so its to calm down then come back and try again to sort it out but sometimes if I'm stopped from leaving or that person wont allow me to leave then something could happen. (just incase  anyone wants to come back and say he couldnt control himself in other situations in other cases with other people like that one case he punched a guy)",2020-02-01T23:20:34Z,4

And where I am from there is an extreme feminist group that claims that only men can be evil, and that we should believe women always. Well my life story tells a different story. That woman tried to destroy my reputation and life with one disgusting lie. Rape is a horrible crime and one should take that seriously. But falsely accusing innocent men for such a thing is also disgusting, and there needs to be consequences for that also. Luckily for me everything was caught on tape so it was crystal clear I was innocent. But it still pisses me off today, cause what if we didn‚Äôt have recordings. Then what would my life be today. If I have learned anything from this experience then that is to always stay 6 feet away from women I don‚Äôt know. And we always have security at the stage so that I don‚Äôt personally have to help people down from the stage when they jump up. Women mainly jump up on stage cause they apparently think I‚Äôm an okay looking guy. But because of all this shit I‚Äôm not going anywhere near female fans. No selfies or hugs. I‚Äôm so done with that... That is sad, cause we have many friendly and wonderful fans. But because of this I‚Äôm not  taking any chances...

360,UgzlJ-L2u8-zcM4dAvx4AaABAg,kubel83,"Debbie Milburn Have feminists never said that ever? Okay do you live under a rock? Let me give you a personal experience little missy. I have one time been falsely accused of rape. It is a long story but I will keep it short. I was playing a gig with the band. During our show a drunk woman jumped up on stage and flashed her tits right in front of me. Even though she totally caught me by surprise and interrupted our song I stayed calm and polite. I told her she couldn‚Äôt be doing that and that she had to get down from stage before security showed up. She was drunk and just laughed. So I gently took her hand and followed her over to the edge of the stage and easily helped her down because I was afraid she would fall. I then returned to my post and continued the show... After the gig I was told by the establishment owners that the very same woman had accused me of rape. That I apparently had grabbed her by the pussy and tits when I helped her down. I never did any of that. The same crazy lady stormed over and screamed ""You fucking raped me! I ain‚Äôt lying!"" Well luckily for me we had a hidden GoPro camera on stage filming the entire band and audience. So I showed the clip. And clear as day all I did was taking her hand and helping her down. Then she stated that it wasn‚Äôt her on the clip. So i told the establishment owners to call the cops because this was getting ridiculous, and that I didn‚Äôt want to be accused of such a disgusting crime when I didn‚Äôt do anything. Guess what she said? 
""Omg maybe I was mistaking you for someone"" WTF BITCH! Either you know if you have been raped or not, you fucking tried to ruin my life with your sick little stunt and lie!
This is 5 years ago and I still think about that day. And she never got punished for her disgusting lie! But luckily a camera saved my life. So when you say ""NO ONE EVER SAID THAT"" Then I can only say how ignorant are you? Man what a load of crap. 
Rape is a disgusting crime and I hope people who do that will be buried 9 feet under... But people who falsely accuse innocent people for a crime this disgusting should face penalty also. Not only are they pissing on people that actually experienced such a horrible act. But they also destroy innocent people as well. Bad people do bad shit regardless their gender.

See let's be real. 

A man's lie is usually stupid. Like lying you was in one place, but was in another. 

But a women's lie could end your life. With lies, like it's your baby, or he hit me, or he touched or talked to me in a sexual manner, or he looked at me the wrong way.

Any of those things will ruin the life of a man. But when it turns out its actually the bitch being the aggressor, it doesn't ruin her life.

After all, she is pretty. Even if she was a criminal, any man like Elon Musk, would take her.

Even if she was a bloody murderer, there is a man who would still want to be with her if she got away with it.

I hope this ruins her life. No more money, movies and I hope the judge says she has to pay him $100M or more.

If you look closely at Kaplan's record, it's not that stellar.  On two of her cases, which she claims vicorry, is far from the truth.  Court docs show, both parties agreed to stop the litigation.  KAPLAN's client said she was ""fuzzy"" on the details because she was drunk.  Second case, it is still going on, but Kaplan declared victory!?  Kaplan is NOT what I would call a great lawyer.  She hates men, all men, and fights dirty.  I would question her ethics.
Did you notice kaplan's timing?  Just as JD's legal team asked that nothing about Heard/drugs/booze, would be mentioned in the trial on 10/7 with Rocky Brooks?  
I said before, if Heard & Kaplan wish for all if JD's arrest records, etc, then Heard's ""juvie"" sealed record needs to be open, as well.  Drunk driving, car accident, I think someone was injured also.  Sealed because of her age, and family ties to the community.
I'll say it again.  If there was ONE PETITION placed on facebook, twitter, etc., asking for signatures to have Heard REMOVED from:  Aquaman, (Hollywood in general), the face of Loreal, ((boycott sounds good), the Champion for rights, ACLU, the CBS series she weasel her way into, the cancel culture might kick in. Studios would start to listen .....  However, Heard is too busy pretending she is a model.  She wears a jacket, with no shirt, to expose herself, so our younger generation can get bug-eyed, and FORGET WHAT SHE REALLY IS, when she shows her breast.

You can also tell me if this story doesn't remind you of a particular dark fairytale? It's a narrative. There is a creative intervention behind it. I mean that Rihanna wants her pyramid everywhere fine but why the forensics. And I have a hunch that the guy playing the joker in birds of prey is supposed to be dead. Epstein alive, probably not pedo (not sure about the second part). I can continue with Rickman, bowie, Carrie fisher. Weinstein has probably bad touched mewtoo more often than metoo. It's all theater. Brie Larson's communication has been specifically designed to be divisive and to encourage hate. Artists on strike to denounce the society they have created.

It could have happened this way...
Anyway I'm just stating my opinion here...All I'm saying is that we have to wait and see who is a victim after all the evidence from both side will be reviewed again...also I have a feeling that he is capable of physically hurt Amber under the influence and I believe Amber's evidence, including Depp's text to her with apologies, made obviously in a drug haze, in which he  apologized for physically hurt her (and also one of Depp's evidence - the elevator footage, l wrote about it already) but at the same time I don't make statements that I know who is guilty for a fact, because I don't and neither are you or everybody else who protecting Depp or Heard here, we weren't there!

I don't know if it was the reason why people pulled away but I do think it was one of the key factors for that change. In a way, it reminds me of the situation with Melanie Martinez & Timothy Heller. This case was about sexual assault. There were fans that were destroying Melanie's merch that they or their families bought them & saying bad things about her because of what Timothy was saying despite the fact that it wasn't determined whether or not her story was true. Granted it could have been true but I feel like in a situation where everything is questionable for both parties and nobody knows anything with absolute certainty, the people that were not involved in any way should try to maintain a neutral but weary stance about it until something can be proven and confirmed. The situation feels similar since she was saying things that didn't quite add up & were proved to be inconsistent or false later. It's terrible when someone lies and says something horrific happened to them. I do think that cases like these should be taken seriously yet they should be taken with caution since there have been cases in the past where someone tried to take advantage of the opportunity to gain sympathy for something bad that didn't truly happen to them. That paints a bad image for real victims and harms the innocent party involved because the person lying hopes to gain something.

 I find it upsetting they don't use more psychological evaluations in court.
 Depp is like my son. He got in a fight once on the bus at 13 yrs old & they ordered a Psych eval on him. The psychologist said "" He's one of the most passive people  I've ever seen. What is he doing here?"". (The other kid went to a special school for anger management & it was his 8th fight that year).

 Her Dad was arrested for killing domesticated animals...psychopath.
 She is probably a sociopath with psychopathic tendencies. That includes most traits of NPD. 
 The ""vanity"" etc you spoke of & it's "" Superiority Complex"" , entitlement, thinking laws don't apply to them (the Australian incident), everything she did in that video.
 Her smirk & body language while they were together in pictures of them on the red carpet especially, 
 HE has a background conducive to being exploited by just such a person. 
 In the beginning they "" love bomb"" & ""mirror"" basically we love all the same things! We're soulmates! Very aggressive with the ""love"".
 Then they test boundaries ...verbal abuse, pushing, hitting, throwing dangerous objects....she was experiencing ""narcissistic injury"" because he asked for a post-nup & this led to the severing of his finger by the bottle & then she put a cigarette out on his left cheek. She then WENT TO SLEEP while he went into shock from loss of blood! 
 This LACK OF EMPATHY is the marker of Cluster B personality disorders, which most often overlap. (Except BPD, it shouldn't be a Cluster B & is almost always misdiagnosed). 
 THAT she is CLEARLY a abusive no empathy....dead eyes...should be part of the court's documentation.

 Men/people don't suddenly become violent, & towards their partner, in their 50's. 
 Heard has a personality disorder, & they all display the exact same behavior once you figure the personality. 
 When I saw the video she sold to TMZ, I knew not only did he never abuse her, but SHE WAS ABUSING HIM! Her words are SO ABUSIVE, gaslighting, baiting, lying, changing the narrative (which people believe! Even though she states on the tape SHE WASN'T THERE!). She's clearly exploiting the fact he was already very upset & trying to turn it into a fight between them. 
 JUST the things she did in that video were so deeply disturbing! She's been out all night, she claims she ""nothing happened this morning. I just woke up & you were so sweet"" (fake voice). JD "" Were you here this morning?"" AH "" No"". 
  She's saying he is ""crazy"" off camera, he responds (to nothing) "" You want to see crazy. I'll show you crazy. ALL YOUR CRAZY"" (my caps). Even when he finds the camera he never raises his voice at her, looks at her, faces her, calls her names, much less TOUCHES her.
 Yet people decide HE is the crazy, violent one????
 His behavior is totally passive, & she is verbally attacking him. He is perfectly aware of what she's doing.
 A normal wife
 1) wouldn't be coming home in the morning
 2) would ask what was wrong/what happened?
 3) would not be goading him, calling him names, saying something completely different is happening while it's happening (gaslighting). 
 You can tell from his responses this is ""normal"" behavior from her. He expects it. He knows what she's doing. He's ALREADY very upset & her hounding/manipulating him upsets him more. 
 He was upset because he just found out TMG had stolen "" Hundreds of millions""... (his words) over the 16/17 years they represented him, all the while telling him HE needed to sell properties, etc. 
 Very upsetting to find this out while married to a lying Ho, I'm sure he's feeling he's surrounded by evil exploitative people!
 Yes, they should be able to use THAT VIDEO to show her abusive behavior, the gaslighting, etc is TEXTBOOK & ONLY Cluster B ABUSIVE personality disorders display this behavior.
 SO many people who have been abused recognized this behavior. 
 It should be allowed in court to show "" PSYCHOLOGICAL ABUSE"". 
 Wounds heal much faster than the psychological abuse. I speak from personal experience & as a psychologist the experience of hundreds of victims.

The ""abuse"" and ""discrimination"" feminists keep talking about largely disappeared in the 70s and 80s. Since then it's been frivolous and baseless intersectional feminist rhetoric pretending that huge problems of misogyny still exists.

OG feminists hate whiny intersectional feminists, who like to infantalize women. There has been no pervasive abuse of male power in Hollywood. If you decide to enter an agreement with someone by sleeping with them for a role, fuck you if you complain. Bring it up with the police.

I agree that the pendulum has swung completely to the other side on this issue. But, men have been putting the screws to women for millennia, and we want it to stop. Which it should. When you have huge changes like this in society, things aren‚Äôt going to go smoothly. There is going to be collateral damage. Like, Louis CK & Aziz Ansari. This ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù is ridiculous! I don‚Äôt blame you for being afraid of women right now. So many guys out there feel the same. Is it right? No. But the way women have been treated forever isn‚Äôt right either. Eventually things will calm down and hopefully the pendulum will swing towards the center. Each case of rape or harassment should be dealt with on a case by case basis. Men should have their day in court to defend themselves... without losing everything first. It‚Äôs supposed to be...you‚Äôre innocent until proven guilty... but we all know that‚Äôs BS. I‚Äôm sorry that you have to go through this, but not that sorry. Things had to change... period. If we‚Äôre to grow as a species anyway. Yes, you have to watch yourself now. But, isn‚Äôt it worth it in the end, if men of power realize they can‚Äôt get away with abusing women?? You‚Äôre not willing to make the sacrifice of being extra careful right now, so that can happen for us? Of course, there will always be horrible men who don‚Äôt care and will do what they want. But, if we can significantly lower that rate, then it has to be done. 

Just hang in there. If you‚Äôre a good guy, you‚Äôll be okay. Be careful of who you date & don‚Äôt jump in the sack right away. If you‚Äôre rich and famous, then you have to be doubly careful. I don‚Äôt know how Johnny fell for Ambers BS, as I could tell just from looking at her that she was bad news. Yes, there are Psyho bitches out there. Just like women have to be careful all the time... now it‚Äôs your turn. You know we‚Äôre not all bad though, come on dude.

 I'm very sorry for what you've suffered. I'm a female DV survivor & I counsel men & women DV survivor's, if you ever want any help I can give you some resources. 
 Richard Grannon (on YT) has the best program I know of for reducing emotional flashbacks & emotional literacy. "" triggers"". My son was abused & all of this triggers me worse than my own DV experience, because I had even less control over it & he refuses to this day to speak of it. He was very young (19-22) & the situation was very bad with his babies abused as well. 
 Richard Grannon has been in 2 abusive relationships, he's been working on this program for many years & if done religiously it gets rid of emotional flashbacks in 80% of people & reduces them greatly in the remaining. It depends on how disciplined you are about following through.
 It doesn't take long & doesn't require you to be re-traumatized. 
 I hope you will look into it. I know the emotional literacy is free on his website, possibly all of it. 
 I'm a psychologist, & he has a much higher success rate than any other therapy. It's also free & not lengthy.

Thank you for this essay. You‚Äôve brought points to the surface which have been overlooked throughout the duration of this case, so i applaud you for that. 

However, i must disagree with some of your vital points. I also have to apologise that my argument will not be as concise and articulate as yours, as i‚Äôm currently sick out of hospital and on heavy painkillers, but i do hope you are able to see where i am coming from. 

Johnny Depp does have a temper. No doubt about it, as you said, he‚Äôs admitted it himself. However having a ‚Äútemper‚Äù doesn‚Äôt automatically equal being a risk to people or being an abuser. 
For reference: my father is slavic (and anyone who knows about slavic parents would have vietnam flashbacks from how they were raised) and he was brought up in a household of physical and mental abuse by the hands of his father (a holocaust survivor as a child, who later went on to fight in 3 other wars) so my grandfather was a damaged man who passed down some unfavourable traits to my father. He had a temper and a rage, that given the right circumstances, could be monstrous. However his temper and rage were moreso a liability to himself, vs those around him. 

The majority of your argument centres around the fact he had a temper, which i completely understand and is a valid point, however it does not directly link to being an abuser. You mentioned him trashing closets and hotel rooms, which are wrong but both Winona and Kate have come out in his defence and have said that that is not the Johnny they knew, and he was never like that in the duration of their relationships. That speaks volumes because we don‚Äôt know the full context behind why he trashed the closets or hotel rooms. Hell, i‚Äôm not defending it but rockstars did it all the time (even w groupies and whatnot present) and that doesn‚Äôt qualify as abuse. This is what i mean when i say having a temper doesn‚Äôt automatically equal violence/abuse, as Johnny would be the one who would have to pay off the debt for his episodes, therefore harming himself (financially) more than he harmed anyone. 

I also find it a little bit of a stretch for you to say he ‚Äúannihilated‚Äù Heard to the public. Johnny was condemned for over a year and rarely spoke about the charges, allowing himself to be publicly shamed, be a victim of character assassination (bc many false truths or lies also came about when this became international news), have his career and livelihood affected, etc etc. It wasn‚Äôt until the recent months he has come back with his own charges, because he‚Äôs spent the last few years gathering all the proof he could from as many sources as possible. He‚Äôs not ‚Äúannihilating‚Äù her, and she‚Äôs no where near as condemned by the media as he was when the story first broke. If anything, it‚Äôs the media creating scandals out of this so it‚Äôs quite unjust to blame Johnny for the way the media sensationalises the story. 

You also mention the coincidental timing of how after this fiasco, suddenly there are a slurry of horrific stories about Amber. You blame it on the machines at work behind the scenes however it seems you‚Äôre dismissing the part that when something goes as viral as these charges, everyone‚Äôs history is dug up and analysed, nomatter who you are. Another reason these stories also came to light is because of the publicity Amber was now receiving; of course now that she is in the spotlight, people who believe her and even those that don‚Äôt, will go looking for things in their past to criminalise them, or decriminalise them. It just so happens that Amber also had a past that wasn‚Äôt completely clean and she, too had been charged with domestic assault before this happened. Sure, her partner at the time has defended her and said it wasn‚Äôt abuse, the police were homophobic etc, but that doesn‚Äôt change the narrative or the facts that she, too has a temper and has been violent in the past. 

You have made many other good points (like when he assaulted a stunt double on set) that there‚Äôs no excusing of. Plus the various reports about his behaviour from multiple sources show he is not in the best frame of mind and most likely suffers from addiction. This is not an excuse but when you look at the situation in a bigger picture, you will realise abuse often isn‚Äôt completely one sided. 
I am by no means trying to fully defend Johnny and paint him as a victim, nor am I condemning Amber. 
If you put the timeline together, it‚Äôs clear that they were BOTH in a toxic relationship that, at times, escalated to physical abuse on BOTH sides. Before this, Johnny was well known to have a temper and trash closets, hotels etc but was never known to be abusive towards his partner. Amber on the other hand, was known for actually committing domestic violence in the past. They‚Äôve both admitted to hurting, hitting, throwing things etc at each party. This does not mean one is the abuser and one is the victim. It means it was a toxic relationship on both sides where both played a part in the severity of the abuse and downfall of the relationship/marriage. 

Personally, my belief is they were both hot heads with tempers. They both knew which buttons to press to get under the other‚Äôs skin and what started out as mild disagreements or fights slowly escalated over the years to spousal abuse against each other. None are innocent. They have both testified to committing abusive acts against the other, so even though you‚Äôve come here with a multitude of facts, that can barely be used as evidence of abuse. I‚Äôm not completely disagreeing as i said, you‚Äôve made some great points and I thank you for taking the time to write these out here, but to completely dismiss Ambers role in this is unjust. She‚Äôs been previously arrested for domestic violence, has testified to hitting, punching, throwing things at him etc under oath. There‚Äôs also a lot we don‚Äôt know because until the trial, the evidence will be withheld from the public. 
All i‚Äôm saying is, i don‚Äôt doubt Johnny probably let his temper (and/or addictions) get the best of him in this relationship. But I also don‚Äôt doubt Amber player just as big of a part in the abuse as Johnny did. To let her off because Johnny has a well documented temper (which we don‚Äôt know the extent of) is just wrong in my eyes. There wasn‚Äôt one victim and one abuser here. It‚Äôs complex with many intricacies and the only way to describe it is a toxic relationship that turned physical and eventually became an abusive relationship on both sides. It‚Äôs also unfair to make a judgement until all information is available to the public; Amber has her side publicly available (albeit, not all of it) but Johnny doesnt have half as much information given to the media. We‚Äôll have to wait for time to do its thing before any fair judgement can be made. 

Also just for reference; i grew up in an abusive/toxic household. The ‚Äúvictim‚Äù was not the victim, but the aggressor who pushed the ‚Äúabuser‚Äù to their limits (both physically, mentally and emotionally) just to cry abuse. They‚Äôre not together anymore, but that person is still claiming to be a victim when anyone who was there could see who the REAL victim was, and it was often the ‚Äúvictim‚Äù that turned things physical as a way to cry abuse. Therefore; the ‚Äúvictim‚Äù in this situation was more guilty than the abuser, but in society it isn‚Äôt seen that way. I‚Äôm studying Psych and in such complex cases, it‚Äôs hardly black and white. In cases like this, it‚Äôs often a result of 2 partners triggering each other and turning things physical. Before making a judgement, remember there is a lot we don‚Äôt know and not everyone is either a ‚Äúvictim‚Äù or ‚Äúabuser‚Äù. In such cases, the lines can be blurred which is why these cases are so difficult to handle, especially in the public eye.
Regardless, thank you for taking the time to write this out and use facts of incidents that have occurred. I do agree to a certain extent however there are things i could not agree with knowing what I know about psychology, toxic relationships, and abuse. It‚Äôs not clear cut so the onus should go on both of them, but again, only time will tell. I hope we can agree to disagree if you do not find my arguments compelling enough (once again i apologise for my writing skills, or lack thereof, but I hope i got my point across!)",2019-09-14T15:00:44Z,1

The manipulative media claim she made good and donated all of it after she made a big production to the press that she would after the divorce in 2016. However, she didn't and made a big stink when Johnny donated the money instead of giving it to her. She did get her bare minimal cut for the (divorce only), but waited until the end of 2018 to pledge some of the divorce money to a children's hospital in LA and the ACLU.  I only think she did that after pressure for not following up on her promise in 2016. And, even then, I can't find any evidence from these charities that actual money was given...so there's that. A pledge for donation is not the same as giving a donation. I am sure it was another scam for attention like everything she does. Even if she did give some of her divorce money(which I don't believe), she certainly did not pledge all seven million of it and the one million she did pledge was only to save face. Just another way she has twisted the facts for the press and public to make herself into some kind of freaking hero.üôÑ However, Johnny Depp has donated his personal time and money for children's hospitals and many other charities for years now and has done so quietly and humbly, because he is never been in it for the attention, unlike ScAmber.",2019-09-14T02:26:26Z,6

With my own abusive ex I stayed around through half a year of assaults, property damage, threats against family,theft and identity theft (bank accounts,email accounts,passports,computers) because I wanted my then spouse to get professional help about the abuse she suffered as a small child at the hands of her grandfather.
When it became clear she was always going to refuse help I left and she tracked me down with friends of hers including BIG men and assaulted me AT my workplace getting escorted off the grounds kicking and screaming by security with me shirtless,bruised and bleeding (scratch marks down my chest dripping blood) then at my new apartment , to ward off the friends she brought with her (she wanted the contents of my new bank account) I had to stand there and take another beating so .. then they realised SHE was the abuser and took her away. 

She then used stolen files and information from a friend of hers at my workplace to fabricate me leaking confidential information and got me out of a job till I proved what she had done. 

There are very masterful deceivers out there with vicious temperaments.

910,UgxHr8pPJU4G9qgsnR14AaABAg,Tim Marshall,"NO way. 

She has presented herself to the public as a saint and a victim, Depp did no such thing and hasn't tried to gaslight planet earth. Heard is now established as a serial domestic abuser and instigator and someone who is not to be believed and besides all the physical abuse and attempt to destroy Depps career + fleece him of funds she has had approximately 3-4 affairs during the time she was supposedly with him and supposedly controlling her via monstrous behaviour. 

Was she also a bad mix with her ex girlfriend who the police pulled her off in public when assaulting her ? 

I say this with respect, there is no evidence that Depp even significantly *defended* himself against her let alone that he is ""BAD"" and we should not be saying that. 

I have an old restraining order against someone like heard and needed to fight hard to get my job back and reputation after lies but managed and I hate to see people tending to just assume a man in a relationship must also be abusive if the woman is..
amber's previous relationship with a woman where she best the partner *proves* this isn't something that requires a man or condemns a man.

While Johnny remained mostly quiet to her accusations, she took every opportunity for the past three years to slander his name and blame him for DV. He allegedly lost his role of Captain Jack in Pirates of the Caribbean over her allegations. Now this year he¬¥s had enough of it, because her allegations effect his personal life and his career seriously, and he sues her now for defamation. Trial will be in February 2020. Johnny has loads of evidences against her, including CCTV, pics, audio, witnesses (some of who saw Amber abuse Johnny in real time), who saw no injuries, when Amber claimed to have been beaten and punched seriously, leaving black eyes, busted lips, ripped out hair etc. Until this day the only witness to her injuries is Amber herself. So far she didn¬¥t present any evidence against him. She can¬¥t disprove his evidences. Brian made 6 videos so far, analysing the court documents, and so exposing her lies and contradictions.

If you go back and read up news articles about her donations, we can only officially determine she donated just over one million dollars.

1003,Ugym4rfXbXAH65aEEWp4AaABAg,Gail,"@TheLittleThings I think Johnny will accept less then 50 million from Amber. I think the amount is so high, because that how all lawsuits go. Threaten with an over the top amount so you'll get what you want. If it is with a jury, they can give more or less of the amount asked for. If it is a judge making the decision, basically the same. Either way the amount decided on is what damages they feel should be rewarded. Rarely do they give a higher amount unless they feel (for instance in this case) that Johnny Depp's career, name and such was extremely damaged by her false accusations. 
But if she is smart, she will settle. I don't know if they decided on a jury or the judge yet, but Amber may be delusional that she can pull the wool over their eyes with her fake crying (always dry eyes, never any tears) and quivering voice.
