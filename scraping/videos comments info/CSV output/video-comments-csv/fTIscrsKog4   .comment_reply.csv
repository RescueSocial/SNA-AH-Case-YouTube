Because so many long time fans fear criticizing any of it or turning their backs on it least they be ousted out of the fan club. They need the human interaction they get from the fandom too much and loosing that will hurt.

There is nothing wrong with a fan who really finds something in an original work that he or she deems worthy of lifting up and sharing with others, but then fails to see that same special something in subsequent productions based on the original work. Doesn't make them any less of a fan than the person who buys anything with a title plastered all over something.

That's why shows like this really need to be careful of making references that can easily be dated. If you're going to do it make sure it's still entertaining just in case people don't get it or remember.
In this case it really worked against them thanks to the trials.
I guess they figured they would keep it and weather the backlash figuring it'll be over soon enough. 

But the problem remains it's a super dead meme that isn't entertaining as a gag as it relies on knowing that meme and not johnny.

""Monty Python and the Holy Grail,"" (but Americans might struggle to enjoy it), Every-one would say ""Gladiator"" (Cut version) however that film is still remembered. 
Maybe
""Team America: World Police (The Cut version, I repeat the Cut version (Yes, the cut version is better)),""  (only the first) ""Zoolander,"" ""Blades of Glory,"" ""Starship Troopers,"" ""Mr Bean's Holiday,""  ""Wallace and Gromit: The Wrong Trousers,"" ""Wallace and Gromit: Curse of the Were-rabbit,"" ""Independence Day,""  Disney's ""The Three Musketeers,"" trust me Tim Curry is the only reason to see the film but he is soooo good... so a film with high highs and low lows,  Only the first Men In Black film, maybe the first Austin Powers film, maybe the South Park Movie (only if you like musicals), (I think that ""The Wedding Singer"" is still remembered).
I'm guessing that there are at least four films on this list that you haven't seen.
