Ik that 10b is _WAAAAY_  too much for jus 1 IP, and only the film rights at that! (Even if it's Spider-man). 

Lol, But if it were me tho, I woulda said ""Fuck you Sony!"" & jus gave them the 10 billion and let them drool over it for a few years & burn it. 
Then proceed to slowly make my 10b dollars back + more over time wit dope Spider-man films/Team up films. ðŸŽ¥",Mirage Uchiha,1,2021-03-03T05:00:51Z

I feel like it was put in the third film as sort of a ""get-out-of-jail free"" card for Spidey's identity, instead of doing a smaller, more personal film about the struggles of his double life and all that jazz. 

I also do think we'll see some good stuff in the college films. This is also just a general problem I sorta had with the writing in the MCU, but I hope Im proven wrong, and if I'm not, itll be a good time at least! Also the shape Jacob Batalon has gotten into!",LeMelleKH2,1,2021-03-01T22:27:56Z
