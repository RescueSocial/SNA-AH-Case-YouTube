If you listen to both recordings it's 100% clear who is abusing who. Depp never at any point disrespects or degrades her because he genuinely loves her at that time. She, does nothing but gaslight and assign all blame onto him however. He doesn't get provoked or fed up until the end of the second recording when he realises that she has actually convinced herself that all of these lies and stories she's telling are true and he realises she's insane and can't be reasoned with. She can't accept any responsibility and she's caught several times stating that she didn't do or say something, only to later contradict herself in the recording and prove that she's a liar.

183,UgyN0OU9pgBMtcYPrSl4AaABAg,mememeome,"Vince Kinney I‚Äôm curious to know where you‚Äôve found that study or statistic to support your statement there.. I fully believe many men have been abused, and likely hide it for many reasons, but I don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôre the ‚Äúmajority‚Äù of cases as you say.

Edited: Little bit of education: copy and pasted from the national domestic violence hotline. There are many other sites that provide similar statistics and have other specifics on abuse against men. 

‚ÄúNearly 3 in 10 women (29%) and 1 in 10 men (10%) in the US have experienced rape, physical violence and/or stalking by a partner and report a related impact on their< functioning.[ii]
Nearly, 15% of women (14.8%) and 4% of men have been injured as a result of IPV that included rape, physical violence and/or stalking by an intimate partner in their lifetime.[iii]
1 in 4 women (24.3%) and 1 in 7 men (13.8%) aged 18 and older in the United States have been the victim of severe physical violence by an intimate partner in their lifetime.[iv]
IPV alone affects more than 12 million people each year.[v]
More than 1 in 3 women (35.6%) and more than 1 in 4 men (28.5%) in the United States have experienced rape, physical violence and/or stalking by an intimate partner in their lifetime.[vi]
Nearly half of all women and men in the United States have experienced psychological aggression by an intimate partner in their lifetime (48.4% and 48.8%, respectively).[vii]‚Äù

186,UgyN0OU9pgBMtcYPrSl4AaABAg,Matthew Callaghan,@JohnLevel30 Calhoun I am with you brother.  In saying this let us not take away from female victims of domestic violence but let us also acknowledge male victims of domestic violence.  If we are serious about combating domestic violence in society then we must stand against all domestic violence regardless of what gender the victim or offender may be. Excluding males victims and failing to acknowledge male victims actually contributes to the problem and is not part of the solution,2020-02-13T05:16:53Z,3
187,Ugx_BA1oCK7BTXbaeW94AaABAg,Stronger than hate,"@wendus93 yes he was yelling, slamming cabinet doors and kicking furniture. When talking to her he didn't yell. He only became enraged at her when he found out that she was recording him. How would you feel if you were going through one of the worst days in your life to find your manipulative and abusive wife filming a private breakdown?",2020-02-17T01:26:52Z,3
188,Ugx_BA1oCK7BTXbaeW94AaABAg,wendus93,"Because there was that video of Johnny Depp yelling, which apparently was enough proof that he was abusive. Nobody cared that it was filmed right after his mom died either. Nobody cared that all of Johnny's ex'es came out and defended him. Johnny had his run-ins with the law in the past, but they were never related to domestic abuse. Ever. Of course, nobody knows what he's actually like in real life, but I think it is now very safe to say that he in fact is the victim here.",2020-02-13T15:45:13Z,4
189,Ugx_BA1oCK7BTXbaeW94AaABAg,Skittles,There‚Äôs a lot of proof that shows she is indeed the guilty one and Johnny is a victim of an abusive relationship. Johnny sent mountains of audio recordings and surveillance footage to the case. People who worked for amber came forward and admitted she was the abusive one. If you listen to the one of the audios she admits that she painted on the bruises and that she was physical with him. The only thing Johnny ever done to her was push her and she has no proof that he ever hit her. It angers and disgusts me that she went on being an advocate for domestic abuse women and groups like that while she abused and ruin Johnny‚Äôs career and reputation and he didn‚Äôt do anything.,2020-02-13T01:24:11Z,10

History is a good guideline.
For example, if I knew certain individual had a history of violent fight with their roommates, I would go out of my way to *NOT* be his next roommate.

195,Ugyp3MA-nXihsSdHxvR4AaABAg,Sarah Bee,"@Spice Gyal Lili Also as you pointed out and you're very right : the body language is very important. We unconsciously feel when someone's body is telling sthg else than their words. We feel sthg is wrong. And we'd rather listen to our gust feeling telling us so, or else we choose to listen to what they (those ppl) say instead (and ignore the discomfort that we feel when with them) and end up in a relationship being brainwashed and having no self-esteem anymore..I experienced that. Though the red flag was there from the beginning : his eyes scared me first glance but I didn't trust myself and instead I listened to this ""so nice person""'s words and trusted him (his words) more and more. His glance was feeling like he was literally getting through me, penetrating my soul. This was very scary. In fact that's what they do, they bore (fathom) yourself. But not only that, with this glance they try to hypnotize you, petrify your mind (just like lions do before catching their prey) And that's how you feel : petrified, freaked out. That's your body telling you to run away. But you don't understand what's going on. And then your mind comes up trying to reassure you : telling you ""Calm down. What you feel is not true, can't be. He/she's as nice as he/she says"". But you still feel discomfort. But you try to rationalize, and again and again, to the point that he/she is now in your life and you almost lose your mind cause there's nothing rational about them. My ex was a malignant narcissist and maybe Amber Heard is too. She's got such an intense, hypnotic glance that I tend to think she could be one. Not to speak about the typical behaviour she shares with those ppl : lying, playing the victim, trying to make the situation look the other way around, etc",2020-05-03T00:35:14Z,0
196,Ugyp3MA-nXihsSdHxvR4AaABAg,Sarah Bee,"@Spice Gyal Lili Thanks for speaking about Amber Heards' eyes : this ""deadly look in her eyes"" as you said. And you couldn't say it better : sociopaths are dead inside, they nurrish themselves (like vampires) from other persons' inner beauty. (Sorry for my bad English). That's exactly how I always felt about her : I don't like her eyes at all, they make me feel not at ease, nay scared even. Those icy cold eyes remind me of my malignant narcissist ex's ones..",2020-05-03T00:01:00Z,0

I was waiting for the proof because I didn‚Äôt believe her, and it finally came out. But there was evidence beforehand. The dead look in Ambers eyes. The domestic violence case she had with her ex girlfriend. The video where Johnny was mad looked staged. Check out Autumn on Venus channel, she goes through body language and mannerisms. Not enough people were paying enough attention to detail. Johnny has a dark vampy look and vibe about him, but he‚Äôs not abusive",2020-02-13T00:22:08Z,9

203,UgyX1W1mlsbpuwCtiGh4AaABAg,M McKenzie,@Maya W. Actually that video was when my doubts were confirmed as I saw her manipulation.  Johnny was an easy target then due to being drunk and upset about something else.  Just like bullies pick on victims when they are vulnerable so she manipulated that situation.  Watch that video again with fresh eyes but watch her actions and words rather than just Johnny being loud and drunk.,2020-03-21T03:52:31Z,1

If people actually listen to all of them, particularly some of the long ones she has stereotypical abuser behaviour.  I have listened to them and I feel exhausted and quite sick to the stomach.
