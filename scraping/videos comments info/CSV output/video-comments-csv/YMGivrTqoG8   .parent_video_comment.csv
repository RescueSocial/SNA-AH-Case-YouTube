All Amber is  doing with her ""evidence"" is showing classic signs of an abuser.  Everything she does to try to paint him in a  bad light is exactly what an abuser does. 

¬†So many men hide abuse as they feel first they wont be believed and they feel less of a man and wont admit it.  Wrong guys, I would be full of admiration for you standing up against the system of what men are supposed to be.  Good on Johnny being brave enough to face all the unpleasantness that he knew he would get thrown at him.  He knew for a while that she was setting him up.  He was warned by people close to him but at first he thought she loved him and wanted to not believe it as she is a calculating manipulator and I believe set him up from day one and never loved him.  He is a softy and quite a vulnerable man and she took advantage of that in my opinion.  This is classic abuse.  How many women who have been abused recognise this as classic abuse?  It is transparent.

Well feminists fight for EQUALITY that means women AND MEN.
When Jonny was accused all mas media turned on him, he was fired, and even a lot of his fans said that they were disgusted of him but when the truth came out I barely heard about it out of YouTube. When Amber accused Jonny all these feminists where saying           "" Men are disgusting"", ""Poor Amber!"" etc. But when the truth about Amber came out they were saying "" so what if he almost lost a finger, that's no excuse for men abusers!"", ""so what if he was fired, he filmed 5 movies of Pirates of Carabineer, it was just a matter of time before he would actually be fired!"".

482,Ugz-nd1O7w5uRiOQoWN4AaABAg,"The weirdest thing about this from Warner Bros's perspective is that they seemingly support Amber when it comes to the DCEU but also seemingly support Johnny when it comes to Fantastic Beasts. 

Their allegiance to Depp, even two years ago when he was completely vilified, seems to suggest that Warner understands that all the allegations against him are unsubstantiated and likely has even seen concrete evidence convincing them of his innocence (because why else would they hold onto him so tightly when no one else would and when they were getting so much flack for the decision). 

But... if they're that convinced that he's worth holding onto, then why the hell would they continue to also hold onto Amber in their other big franchise. It's not even about a gendered double standard. It just shows that Warner wants to have it both ways. 

It's like when someone goes through a bad breakup with a bad person and their own best friend decides he's gonna keep being friends with both you and the ex despite him being closer to you, knowing what you went through, and yet still without the balls to pick a side.",Jonathan Guito,0,2020-05-01T03:14:27Z

It is already extremely hard to come forward and get proof (especially when abusers are so manipulative). Now people will use her as an excuse to not believe victims when they come forward. How dare she use that as a means of manipulation. Domestic abuse is not a game. It's what a lot of kids have to grow up with and a lot women and men have dealt with. It's not just physical, it's verbal and psychological. They know how to warp one's sense of reality. To live in a home like that is a mindfuck. I grew up with it until I was 13. I'm 21 now and the emotional and psychological scars still run deep and I have to fight it everyday. So how dare she. How dare she use my life, my experience, and the experiences of so many others and use it as a mockery as an excuse to ruin someone's life. Now all the people who think domestic abuse is a myth are going to think they're right. I'm terrified for future victims who come forward. She needs to be fired and blacklisted like Depp was. It's definitely a gender thing which is bullshit. All abusers should be punished and held accountable no matter what gender they are. They should replace her with Isla Fisher in Aquaman 2 since Isla is beautiful, a real redhead, and unlike Heard, she's actually GOOD at acting.

He was a good actor about 25  years ago but has mainly played on his looks for about the last 20 years.  If he is careful to select a good script and works on acting his part, I believe he could have a Leonardo DiCaprio type career.  He was good in What's Eating Gilbert Grape.

Her accusations seemed far fetched when not one of Johnny Depp's  previous partners had supported her claims yet she had a known history. It doesn't make sense why this has dragged on so long despite the evidence uncovered. It is very unfair that being female has enabled her to do this.

_""both amber and depp have their sides to the story, it isn't fair to blindly validate her claims as 100% fact, and not consider Depp's.

1008,Ugy7zG7vOZ0fs4rB8W14AaABAg,"I think all you have to do is look at how this all unfolded:
When her allegations first came out, Johnny was stripped of work and was ripped to shreds by the press. Even the media abroad called for a total ban and boycott of Johnny (I'm Swedish and remember how the Swedish press ripped him to pieces and urged a boycott on the upcoming Hollywood Vampires-gig in Stockholm). It didn't take long for him to lose both work and opportunities.
Now fast forward to when the truth about all this started coming out and Amber was exposed. Total silence. There were no people calling for her to get cancelled, she kept all her jobs and opportunities. She is still being viewed as a spokesperson for DV and women everywhere. Even now that there has started to be a growing backlash against her, people (and companies) continue to back her up. Unfortunately, I don't think she will be facing even half of what Johnny had to go through and unfortunately I doubt that she will get more than a slap on the wrist from the courts either. In that sense, she was right when she told him that nobody would believe him, that nobody would believe that a big man would allow a petit woman to abuse him.
I am a female survivor of DV and went through the same thing Johnny did, albeit on a much smaller scale (THANK GOD, I'M NOT FAMOUS). I knew he was innocent the instant that video of him ""attacking"" her was released, because I have been in the same situation. People called me crazy for backing him up and I don't blame them for one simple reason; if you haven't gone through it yourself, it is hard to know. I'm sure I would have been team Amber if I hadn't gone through the same thing myself as well. I don't blame anyone for believing her - that kind of abuse is incredibly insidious. I am really happy for him that the truth has come out about what happened, but unfortunately, like I said; I don't think she will get more than a slap on the wrist for what she has done.",Niko,223,2020-04-30T00:21:21Z
