Are you 100% English-American? I doubt it. Most European-Americans whose ancestors have been here for generations have at least some Irish and German ancestry. But we don't know a lick of Gaelic or German. So STFU. Knowing English is way more important while schooling in the USA.,2021-04-18T04:57:22Z,0

126,Ugyu3e3SWckDn6L35jF4AaABAg,123 456,"@George R muy desafortunado tu comentario, en primer lugar ella habla muy bien espa√±ol, obviamente tiene muchas cosas que pulir pero lo importante al hablar otro idioma es expresar tus ideas con claridad y que otros te entiendan, ella se expres√≥ correctamente y se entendi√≥ todo lo que quiso decir. El creer que un dialecto o acento es superior a otro s√≥lo porque si es muy est√∫pido, que se haya originado en Espa√±a no quiere decir que el espa√±ol de otros pa√≠ses sea ""incorrecto"" o ""malo"" o en todo caso, ¬øqu√©  ciudad de Espa√±a tiene el ""espa√±ol perfecto"" con el acento perfecto e ideal? Elegir determinado dialecto/acento como est√°ndar fue algo totalmente arbitrario, y que se hizo reci√©n cuando surgi√≥ la necesidad de ense√±ar un idioma est√°ndar en las escuelas cuando la poblaci√≥n comenz√≥ a tener acceso a la educaci√≥n, a ella no le ""faltan millas"" para llegar al ""espa√±ol de espa√±a"" porque si prestas un poco atenci√≥n al v√≠deo; a su pronunciaci√≥n, l√©xico y las conjugaciones que usa, su objetivo est√° casi alcanzado ya que se nota que en primer lugar nunca quiso ""ir hacia el espa√±ol de Espa√±a"" se nota que se enfoc√≥ en aprender espa√±ol latinoamericano y lo habla bastante bien, y no es nada malo elegir un acento a la hora de aprender un idioma, quiz√° el espa√±ol de Latinoam√©rica le gust√≥ m√°s, quiz√° porque s√≥lo le gust√≥ como sonaba, o porque vio una manera de llegar a m√°s gente, o porque es el acento de su propio continente, ya que es americana, quiz√° le gustaban m√°s los doblajes latinos, quiz√° se le hizo m√°s f√°cil aprenderlo, quiz√° tiene familiares o amigos latinos, quiz√° vivi√≥  en una ciudad en donde hab√≠a muchos latinos y pod√≠a practicar con ellos, en fin, puede haber 1000 razones y mas por las que haya elegido ese acento, pero se nota que desde un principio se enfoc√≥ en el espa√±ol latino y eso no la hace m√°s ni menos. Yo ahora mismo estoy estudiando franc√©s, se toma como franc√©s est√°ndar el franc√©s de Par√≠s pero si yo quiero aprender y usar el franc√©s de Lyon o Marsella o Hait√≠ no estar√≠a mal y no ser√≠a para nada incorrecto y no significa que me ""falten millas"" para llegar al parisino, simplemente porque me gusta otro dialecto y quiero estudiar otro, se entiende lo que quiero decir?
