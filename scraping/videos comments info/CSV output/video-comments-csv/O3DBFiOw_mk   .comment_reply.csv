I’ve only watched one or two videos — sometimes Johnny comes across to me as hugely insincere (something about his voice and the tone like he’s trying to act super macho or something) but she does seem out of her mind.  But like my grandmother always says “it takes two to tango”.  She was who she is from day one and he put up with it for this long so he’s as much to blame as she is.  He also seems like a raging alcoholic and possible drug addict so I’m not all that interested in either one of them.  Über-rich, out of touch people drama.",2020-04-20T16:19:40Z,1

Say this is exactly how shit goes down in Hollyweird ( Where what it seems like nowadays anyone can become a star😳😵😤😱😔) I think back to High School and Grade school 90s hip hop an R&B to me was the greatest of all time!! Some of the early 00s were dope ASF too. I don't expect anything or anyone to agree with me BC its just my opinion on the matter. I feel now that youtube is huge and Most of the music sounds terrible... I am not trying to come at u if you are a fan of the Music to me hip hop is for the most part in my opinion COMPLETELY WACK.... A smart mouth little 14yr old brat is seen on Dr. Phil. Not trying to be a nasty person bc she's ran her mouth about anybody an everybody. And most of stuff she said in past IG stories or a radio or video interview she's not very smart. Really tho I believe if it is necessary she's capital of the knowledge. The ultimate crumb moment ( yea been lots an lots) ID say was the audacity to come at literally a female who had to actually do the work in every single way possible to be taken seriously by hip hop The One and only Queen B Lil Kim! One of the maybe at the time her 1st solo drop Kim was 1 of 7 at most famous serious taken female MCs to break ground and pave a way for the likes of Bhad Bhabe( I know she's got it misspelled dnt care to ck if it's this)  I couldn't believe what this little girl was saying to her Instagram viewers. Ive only heard how left she was going with the viewers comments.  Mainly disrespectful and had the nerve to compare herself in anyway to legit a legend in hip hop but I believe the biggest FEMALE MC so tiny and nasty as can be. All of Kim's Junior Mafia tracks to obviously her solo career So many hott features! So how's the nerve of this little girl have anything but praise and thanks towards Kim???? It I was blatant disrespect.. An MY BOY NAS AN  Ether is the dopest it is to my opinion the best lyrically written diss record EVER!!!

237,UgykWPfOxkIHcMS5yoV4AaABAg,Ali Ross,"@Taylor Sky All cluster B personality disorders sit on the malignant narcissistic spectrum, therefore they are all narcissistic in nature. Borderline Personality Disorder is a cluster B personality disorder. That means that Borderline Personalities are narcissists. This of course does not mean that Borderline Personality Disordered-people are the same as someone with Antisocial Personality Disorder, or that they are like a psychopath. Narcissism is a spectrum, so some will be more narcissistic than others. It just depends. Some Borderline Personalities are very narcissistic and others are less affected by it, but they are all affected by it on some level.
It's also true that other cluster b personality disorders often occur with BPD. It's not uncommon at all for someone to be diagnosed with BPD and NPD, or BPD and HPD. NPD is the most common co-morbid personality disorder with Borderline Personality Disorder. Some studies put it at 50%. These Borderline Personalities are so narcissistic that it warranted a separate diagnosis. And of course, others may have NPD or HPD in addition to BPD but be undiagnosed. Others may not have a lot of overt narcissistic qualities at all. Again, it's a spectrum. . The most common comorbid condition - besides substance abuse - with a cluster b personality disorder is another cluster b personality disorder. This means that people with cluster b personality disorders are pathologically narcissistic. Their focus on themselves is so disproportionate, so obsessive and so toxic that it literally affects their way their brain works.

So why does this happen? There can be many factors. When a child is abused, for example, their brain reacts to this defensively. The child's needs are not being fulfilled, so (among other things) they begin to focus on themselves in self-defense. ""If I cannot rely on my family to fulfill my needs, I will have to do it myself."" Over time, and since abuse usually continues over years, this turns into inflexible, pathological focus on the self and their own needs.
While many of them likely had the capacity for empathy at one point, they are unable to develop empathy or learn to care about other people because they are too focused on surviving. Unfortunately, the things that need to happen with children's development so that they learn to fulfill their own needs does not seem to happen with narcissists, probably because they are never able to recover from the abuse since it never stops. They can never process things and heal or move on. They become stuck in a loop of defending themselves and trying to survive, and they are unable to progress in their development past a certain point. They use immature ""emergency"" type of defense mechanisms and coping strategies to deal with things in between incidents of abuse - such as creating a false self that is all-powerful and immune to abuse (as with NPD), or a victim persona that endlessly seeks sympathy (as with HPD) -- and this becomes the only way they know how to deal with anything. This is why we still see these same childish coping mechanisms when they are adults. They were never able to develop more mature coping mechanisms or learn how to deal with their emotions or situations correctly.
This is why everything is a tragedy to some narcissists, everything is an emergency and everything is the worst thing that ever happened. It is also why nothing is a tragedy to other narcissists and nothing seems to matter at all. These particular narcissists learned to cope by not reacting. The differences here are probably based on individual personalities and what worked for them in their lives. The narcissists who overreact as adults were probably able to get what they needed by doing so, whereas the ""under-reacting"" narcissists were probably not.
Let's say there are two different children who are living in abusive situations. Child A may have found that crying and becoming emotional caused the abuser to back off, while Child B may have found that this only made the abuse worse. Over time, Child A would be conditioned to react emotionally and Child B would be conditioned to not react at all. This is just an example, of course, because there are as many different types of situations as there are people in the world, but in general, that is how human behavior works: behavior that has been rewarded will be repeated and behavior that has been punished or even just not rewarded will be abandoned. It is the case with both types of people that their feelings are overwhelming, disproportionate and threatening to them because they have never learned how to experience or deal with them normally. Consequently, their feelings dictate their entire experience. This is their only reality. It is sadly ironic that the very feelings which run their entire lives are experienced as so frightening and alien by narcissists, as if they are coming from some unknown source and cannot be trusted.
There is also the biological factor. It may be that some people are predisposed to narcissism for whatever reason. In these cases, abuse or environmental situations would still factor in, but would only be part of it. There is research going on with this now, and maybe they will have an answer for it someday. At any rate, it seems that the earlier and the more abusive the childhood situation is, the worse the narcissism will be in general. Abusing children, neglecting them, invalidating them, ignoring them, spoiling them, abandoning them, enabling them... all of these things can play a role in the development of narcissistic adults. Most narcissistic people, including psychopaths, do have a history of abuse.
There are different levels of narcissism in human behavior. Some are helpful, others are not helpful or even detrimental. The further down the spectrum it goes, the more toxic these traits become, until you end up with someone who has no understanding or feeling for other living things at all.",2020-07-16T13:10:15Z,1
238,UgykWPfOxkIHcMS5yoV4AaABAg,Ali Ross,"@Taylor Sky I haven't really found any type in particular that Narcissists are especially drawn to. Although Empaths find themselves entangled with Narcissists a disproportionate amount of the time comparatively speaking and because it seems such an unlikely pairing in a lot of ways,. At first glance, it's easy to see why the Narcissist is attracted to the Empath. Empaths are everything the Narcissist is not: kind, caring, emotionally aware, supportive, in control, able to have relationships and make friends... True to his nature, The Narcissist covets things he does not have and he endeavors to take them from anyone who does have them (or at least ruin them so that no one has them). The Empath gives freely of themself, making them a glowing beacon for the Narcissist. It's like waving a red flag in front of a bull. He senses an emotional source he can leech off of nearly indefinitely, like a battery that never dies. He can take and take and take, and in return she will give and give and give. This is the nature of the relationship between the two and it will never change.

 In the beginning, the powerful ""vibe"" the Narcissist gives off will resonate very deeply within the Empath. It catches her attention, and she is drawn to him as magnetically as he is drawn to her because of it. His presence is often very emotionally intense and most Empaths are attracted to that, whether they realize it or not. He may also be hard to read emotionally (his vibe is intense but it may be very distorted, like static on a TV where one cannot see the true picture) and since reading other people's emotional states is often very easy for the Empath to do, she may be drawn to him in spite of herself in an attempt to figure him out. Who is this guy? What's going on with him? What's he about? In short order, he will reveal his lifetime of abuse (real or embellished) along with a carefully-crafted commercial pitch showcasing how wonderful he is (usually not real) - and how wonderful she is, even though he just met her - and she will be effectively snared because she does not realize at first that the intense emotionality she is reading from him has nothing to do with her. It is all for himself.

It would seem unlikely that the Empath would fall for this considering that she is very in tune with others' emotions and their true selves. Can't she see what he really is? The answer is yes, she can. Most Empaths sense something ""wrong"" about the Narcissist very quickly, sometimes during the first conversation. But she can also see something else, and it overrides everything else: how wounded and broken he is inside, beneath all the lies and abuse. He needs. It's not an act on his part or a mistake on the Empath's part; the Narcissist really is fundamentally wounded and broken inside. A large number of Narcissists are skilled at appearing helpless and lost. That's because in many ways, they truly are. Her mistake is in thinking she can help him.

This is the attraction. She wants to help him. It is her fatal blind spot, because the Narcissist cannot be helped and more importantly, he does not want help. Yet even when she can see this clearly, his wounds are clearer. They are evident in everything he does, even in the horrible things. Especially in the horrible things.
He is adept at making her believe she is the only one who can help him, or that she already has helped him. This is what she wants. It feeds her need to help, and no one is more convincing than the Narcissist when he is showering someone with praise or pushing their emotional buttons to get a response. She gives him the emotional sustenance he both wants and needs, allowing him to bask in the light of her care and attention all the time. It is a dangerously codependent relationship which revolves around superficially fulfilling the needs of only one person who can be neither satisfied nor happy. The Narcissist is like a cup with a hole in the bottom: no matter how much you pour into it, it is never enough.

There is an important distinction to make here, however. We say ""superficially fulfilling"" because it is important to remember that the Empath's needs are being fulfilled, too, even if this does not seem to be the case. She is usually the obvious injured party in the relationship but she is a willing injured party; she has locked herself in a situation where she can perpetually ""help"" someone who will always need her. She has made a ""career"" out of taking care of a professional victim who does not want to get better. This may seem like victim-blaming to some, but it is only by recognizing this very thing that the Empath can empower herself to get away from the Narcissist for good: she has to understand that she is choosing to stay and she can choose to leave. He only has the power over her that she is giving to him.

Lots of Narcissists are arrogant overachievers but most are crippled by their disorder in many ways, unable to function in the world normally in more than a very superficial way. The Empath sees an opportunity to take care of someone in perpetuity - and even if she doesn't want to, her caring nature can make her feel that she must. What will he do without her? It doesn't seem fair to abandon him, regardless of how horrible he is because he is sick and the sickness is not his fault. It's true that the way his brain works is not his fault. Maybe no one loved him enough when he was a child. Maybe he was abused. Maybe none of it is really the Narcissist's fault. However, it is not hers, either. She does not need to be punished forever because of someone else's mistakes. If she stays in the relationship with the Narcissist, she will be.

This is the Empath's nightmare: abandoning those who need her when she could have helped. That is the problem with her logic, though: she cannot help him. No one can.
Since it is unrealistic to expect that the Narcissist possesses the insight to be able to recognize his problems, it is up to the Empath to recognize the situation and resolve it. The first (and most important) thing she must realize is that the only way to resolve the situation is to get out of it. That can be a very hard truth to face. No one wants to believe they have wasted years of their life on someone who literally does not care or appreciate it at all, but this is the trap the Empath finds herself in - especially when she is dealing with a Narcissist who (in his manipulative moments) swears this is not the case. Don't be fooled. It is the case, and it will never change.

The Narcissist cannot and will not change. He is not capable of the type of emotion, empathy and compassion necessary to render him a fair, loving, satisfying partner - and he can never learn. He cannot learn how to be a ""real"" person. This ability is learned in the first few years of life. By the time the Empath meets the Narcissist, it is already far, far too late. He cannot be helped.

It is important here, too, to remember that all blame is not laid squarely on the Narcissist. The Empath must take responsibility for her own actions and acknowledge the hard and embarrassing truth that her needs were being fulfilled on some level by the relationship, regardless of how painful or horrible the relationship was. If she cannot do this, she will continue to seek out relationships with other Narcissists and the pattern will not be broken. The problem (and pattern) is not solely with one person, because any relationship - even one with a Narcissist - is reciprocal. The Empath stayed in the relationship far past the time when she knew the relationship was unhealthy, dangerous, abusive or unfair and she must take responsibility for that. Only by acknowledging this can she truly break the cycle and be free.",2020-07-16T13:05:46Z,1

He may have mistakenly believed that she could be ""fixed"", that he could help her with her disorder and maybe didn't hold her as personally responsible as he should have.

591,Ugxv8lMaVaQOKV8DONN4AaABAg,Ali Ross,"Borderline Personalities are paranoid, they are hypersensitive, they are frightened and they are pathologically insecure. They believe they are striking out at others in self-defense. They believe they are being attacked first. They read rejection and abandonment into everything that is said to them because that is what they are afraid of. They fear their loved ones don't really love them, and are going to leave them. As with other types of narcissists, the Borderline  believes they are garbage, that they are no good at all and no one will ever love them. They abuses, manipulate and control in order to prevent this from happening. 
 A lot of Borderlines mistakenly believe that when ppl call them on their behavior, these ppl are trying to control them and force them to conform to everyone else's way of thinking. Theres a disconnect and an inability to understand the gravity of the situation.

 Stopping the agony will stop the behaviors. One of the ways to do this is to try and show them that the many things they are getting upset about are harmless, misunderstood, wrongly perceived, etc. Unfortunately, they often don't believe it. They insist they're being lied to, or tricked, or somehow manipulated.
Borderlines often seem to believe that ppl are lining up to possess and control them, they  believe their pain and problems are caused by othes. The problem is not what they think it is, and many refuse to even entertain the idea that they could be wrong. This results in them insisting that the only thing that will alleviate their pain is if ppl stop doing things they are already not doing.

The Borderline's loved ones are at a loss, because you cannot stop doing something you're already not doing. This creates an untenable situation where the disordered person asks for something over and over again that they will not accept, then attempts to viciously punish the other person for not giving it to them. The problem is that they want something they cannot accept, understand or recognize. This does not stop them from wanting it, however. Sadly, it only stops them from getting it.
When someone with BPD gets close to another person emotionally, that other person will often become the ""enemy."" They expect that you will eventually hurt them, and they behave accordingly, punishing you for things they think you have done or will do. The reason behind this is that people with BPD believe they are fundamentally broken or damaged, and they project that onto other ppl. The problem isn’t you. It’s their illness. Loved ones are seen as either iconically benevolent or cruelly punitive and there is no in-between because ppl with BPD cannot really sustain ambivalent or contradicting emotions. They cannot love somebody and be angry at them. Their thinking is extremely black and white. A person is either all good or all bad in their perception and this changes with their moods. One minute you are the best thing that ever happened to them and you have made them the happiest they’ve ever been, and then literally the next minute they cannot remember anything good you have ever done, you are scum, you are trash, you hate them and are trying to destroy them, you are the lowest piece of crap that ever came along. This is called “splitting.”
They also have problems with  emotional permanence—similar to the concept of object permanence.They have trouble “remembering” someone’s love and connection when the person is not there or when they can't feel it. Because of this, they are never confident that really cares about them, and they are always anxious and unsure. This is why you may notice that they are able to walk away remarkably easily in some cases; they truly embody “out of sight, out of mind.” Past interactions—even in the very recent past—often seems impossibly distant to them. It is not uncommon for them to have difficulty remembering these events, and their emotional connection with others can be lost very easily.

They  also have problems with schema. They tend to put everyone into certain categories rather than evaluate them individually. Because of this, it is very hard to change their perception of you because, essentially, the perception has already been formed. On top of this, the borderline's schemas have an affinity for negative interactions. Any positive interactions you may have had with them will likely be overwritten by a negative interaction—similar to how a file will be written over if you save a new version of it. This is why they cannot remember anything good about the person they are angry at. And even when they aren't angry, they'll have trouble remembering the good things about the person. The memory literally isn’t there.
 when something good happens that does not fit into their ""this person is bad"" schema, it is simply ignored or forgotten. So if the borderline patient perceives a person as ""bad,"" and that person does something good, it does not register with them, or it may be perceived in a negative light—even if they have to really stretch and distort the facts to see it that way. For ppl with BPD, facts are fit to their feelings. For everyone else, feelings are fit to the facts.
Borderlines interpret reality according to how they feel. Situations that aren't threatening are perceived by the borderline as threatening because the borderlinealready feels threatened. Comments that aren't hurtful or rejecting are perceived as hurtful and rejecting because they already feels hurt and rejected. This is why no matter how much care is taken not to upset a loved one suffering from BPD, you can't avoid upsetting them. They are already upset.
In a relationship with a borderline , in their mind, you are the enemy, and they are the victim. Their illness precludes them from taking personal responsibility for themselves or their lives, or even understanding what personal responsibility really means. Indeed, they expect to be taken care of. It is always somebody else’s fault because their defense mechanisms are in place to protect them from being hurt or blamed. They cannot tolerate having to take responsibility for their actions. If they have to choose between you or them, they will always choose themselves. Always. Sadly, their illness creates a situation where no other choice is possible. Therefore, you are the enemy because they feel bad, and it has to be somebody’s fault. It can’t be theirs, so it must be yours.

 Nothing matters to them but themselves when they are upset. When you tell the borderline how their actions have affected others, they cannot understand what you are saying, and even if they do, it is not something they feel they can control. If they have to hurt someone to get what they think they need, they will do so because they are so emotionally fragile; they feel they are constantly under attack by everyone around them. In their eyes, their selfish behavior is self-defense.
They see things in an extremely distorted way. They often believe things that are not true, and they will continue to believe these things, even when the facts in front of them spell out the complete opposite. No amount of arguing, persuading, reasoning, or logic will change their mind.
There's no question of whether they care about other ppl’s needs and well-being; the borderline is just not wired that way. It never even crosses their minds when they are upset. However, afterward, they may feel very guilty and remorseful, even to the point of being suicidal. This may be one of the only differentiating characteristics between BPD and NPD: the borderline  is capable of remorse. The narcissist is not.",2020-04-09T21:46:16Z,1

I think that unless they determine that the amount of money they would make is guaranteed to be SIGNIFICANTLY higher than what they can still make without him or even the POTC franchise, they won’t risk bringing someone with a big public controversy back on. They would likely be more willing to lose the entire franchise than risk bringing him back on. They are Disney. They can easily replace old major franchises with new major franchises and make even more money than the previous one, that or just buy another company out and make all their properties into money machines.

713,UgzTWuAlrDROTNY2Wgx4AaABAg,Crystal Spears,"I am a survivor of Domestic violence and speaking from experience, the more if this that is uncovered, the more Amber reminds me of my ex. The constant victim role, changing stories to somehow make it the other parties fault that the abuse happened and dismissive attitude towards any wrong doing on their part. Yes these are behaviors I know all too well. It doesn't surprise me at all that he lied about the finger injury. I lied to countless E.R. doctors, at a number of emergency rooms. (We would go to emergency rooms in other counties because after coming into the same one with similar injuries and insufficient accounts they tend to get suspicious.) I lied to family and friends to protect him because I thought I loved him and because I was afraid of what he might do to me or my family if I told the truth.  This only further proves the abuse Johnny suffered. I wish all thoughts of healing and comfort to him and I truly hope that Amber is brought to justice. I know the world is so focused on the virus right now and as it should be but hopefully enough people will wake up to the fact that you cannot just blindly believe someone because of their sex. True equality.",2020-04-07T05:26:16Z,19
