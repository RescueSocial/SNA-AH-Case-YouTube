3,UgzfCfag3mUtf22_Yfl4AaABAg,Jo Pearson,"For one, the interviewer called her Amber not Amanda and she is not the one posting the videos for this show and typing the titles with the mistake. Two, her doing the chapstick (not lipstick) is in reference to the kiss he did with Jimmy Kimmel, go watch it, he puts on chapstick first...it's a joke.",2020-08-11T00:47:31Z,2

5,Ugx96_RWerIcbRhkfsB4AaABAg,Pop Tart,"He immediately picked up on the flirtation and started talking about Jimmy Kimmel. Then when she asked him about kissing his co-stars, he said Amber was the best. How sweet of him! Sadly, if he only knew then what he knows now.",2021-09-01T23:04:47Z,0
6,Ugx96_RWerIcbRhkfsB4AaABAg,Sam Erdrich,I think the reason why Johnny Depp hasn't been able to find a stable long term relationship with a woman is because he doesn't understand that women are attracted to him for what he is not who he is. That's his problem.,2021-04-03T23:22:49Z,4
7,Ugx96_RWerIcbRhkfsB4AaABAg,Laura Biegel,@bearta She is making reference to Johnny kissing Jimmy Kimmel. Johnny put lip balm on when he kissed him. Johnny and Jimmy have this long running joke with each other everytime Johnny appears on his show.,2020-08-29T15:23:34Z,8

13,UgyA4WkrjdY6_LHeS414AaABAg,Laura Biegel,@Fevie J Interviewer is making reference to Johnny and Jimmy Kimmels long standing joke that Johnny kisses him every time he is on the talk show.
