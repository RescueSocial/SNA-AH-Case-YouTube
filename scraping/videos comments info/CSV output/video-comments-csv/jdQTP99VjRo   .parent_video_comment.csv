If I only watched films that starred actors I thought were nice human beings I would probably struggle to find anything to watch. Some of my favourite actors were (allegedly) shitty in their private lives but if they can act I really couldn't care. Sadly, Amber is a shitty person and a shitty actor and the lack of judgement Depp showed in marrying the silly woman just proved the adage 'there's no fool like and old fool'. In fact neither of them come out of this covered in glory. The tape recordings of them arguing were a real eye-opener - if I were either of them I would have been ashamed to have these in the public domain. They both come across as retarded and can barely string a coherent sentence together let alone a sentient argument. I imagined Depp to be articulate and funny - instead he turns out to be below average when it comes to acerbic repartee and his sparring partner even dumber.

He has done nothing to harm his image nor that of Disney's.he's gone out of his way to make children in hospitals happy by bringing Captain Jack Sparrow to their besides. Why should Disney kowtow to Amber Heard and lies. They are vilifying the villain which is wrong by any stretch of the imagination. Drop Heard and reinstate Depp. You'll make more money by standing with Depp than you ever will with Amber Heard. He was the injured party and they backed the abuser.

EDIT: on a serious note, recastings used to happen very often with movies and sequels throughout the past century of film. It's only been since 2014 that we've seen more drastic measures for settling characters played by actors who leave or are fired. Before that, recasting was the defacto solution

So I support a recasting in this situation, and Emilia would be perfect: she's beautiful, in great shape, a good actress, lots of charisma, and she's shown to already have a ton of chemistry with Momoa on-screen.",Nick Corvello,1,2020-05-05T03:10:05Z

But unfortunately she is very pretty so people are gonna get suckered. Men and women... There are plenty of Hollywood women who overlook shit harder than men do.

The real solution is jailing women for longer sentences. It makes no sense to let them out earlier than male counterparts. Women's prison is far less punishing than men's prison... Technically, they should get longer sentences. Especially if they have a child. No reason not to protect children from dangerous women who have far more opportunities to abuse and will rarely get caught.",TyPhenirW0LF,0,2020-04-28T02:27:43Z

Now, Johnny depp still fought back and amber still gets to keep her reputation for months? That's a bullcrap mindset. Stop giving woman a handicap.

285,UgyhCWooCQGMEKiboRt4AaABAg,"What has happened to Johnny Depp is disgusting and I pray he gets Justice and recover from this. I hope Amber gets punished for this and I‚Äôm glad that this has come about as it shows how neglected Male domestic abuse is and how easy it is for a women to ruin a man, and how Feminism fails to campaign for things to benefit men and protect them from things like this. 

What I‚Äôm about to say may not be liked by many but I understand that. In all honesty I hate Feminism because of the man-hating cult it‚Äôs become and how there is inequality in the world that is neglected by them that puts men at a disadvantage, however I share my opinion as a human, not an anti-feminist:

‚Ä™I don‚Äôt condone what Amber Heard‚Äôs done. It‚Äôs disgusting, and she should be punished. But we have to remember people can change and can redeem themselves. 

I‚Äôm glad people are seeing domestic Male abuse and how a women can ruin a man, and the inequalities of gender when it comes to the Criminal Justice System. I‚Äôm glad Johnny Depp is going to get justice and Amber Heard will pay the price. I hope this proves that Feminism isn‚Äôt as great as it thinks it is and has done a lot for women, but what‚Äôs it done for men.

But she shouldn‚Äôt lose her whole career. She‚Äôs a part of the DCEU, and based on videos online she seems nice and I loved her in Aquaman. She has made a criminal offence and I have lost some love and respect for her for that, but she is a human who just needs to be punished and taught the error of her way. 

Instead of firing her from everything just make her unable to star in anything other than what she‚Äôs contracted to for ‚ÄúX‚Äù number of years. Let her do an Aquaman 2 of she‚Äôs contracted to do it, but don‚Äôt let her do another if she isn‚Äôt contracted to.

Make her make a public apology to Johnny Depp and admit what she‚Äôs done, pay him a large sum of money for what she‚Äôs done to him. Then make her serve some kind of punishments like House Arrest and Community Service and have a restraining order against Johnny Depp put on her.

Make her realise that what she‚Äôs done is scummy, but give her a chance to redeem herself like we would want ourselves if we were her.

Based on what happened with Caroline Flack, we can see the damage the internet can do to someone even if they do deserve it and if we push someone to do something like that and take a life, we‚Äôve done worse than what we‚Äôve criticised them for.‚Ä¨

Give her a chance to redeem herself. It will take a long time, and it won‚Äôt be easy, she will still be hated by some and she may not completely deserve it, but if we were her, we would want it. Punish her, but give her a chance to redeem herself. Make her realise she is a criminal, but make her realise that she can sort of comeback from this.

Yes, people make mistakes.  I don't think it's up to lynch mobs to adjudicate those mistakes, just like when Heard had accused Johnny, or when Chloe Dykstra accused Christ Hardwick and on and on.  Maybe there's some weird evidence that will come out in the case that throws a different light on her actions, even though I'd be hard pressed to imagine what that could be at this point.  However, in a just society, this is up to the courts to decide.  If she's guilty, she'll have to, at the very least, pay a boatload of cash in a settlement, if not serve actual time, and hopefully that will prompt her to seek treatment and rethink her life.  But if you're calling for her to never work again rather than letting the justice system decide her penalty, you're acting no better than a Zoe Quinn and putting yourself above the justice system.

If he supports Depp and Johnny was somehow guilty he's an asshole. You have to let things play out. He worked with her on a film. She could have been kind to him as a co star.

But when it comes to this shit it's best to not get involved publicly because no matter what your always in the wrong.

She defamed his character, she lied to police, she abstructed a case, and she lied in testimony. She is NOT getting away with this and this case will not and should not be dropped. Hell the police have a case against even if Johnny WEREN'T to press on with charges. The fact that so many news people and publications STILL are not caught up and people running youtube channels have more information and are sharing more than they are is pathetic.


She should lose her job, she isn't a good actress to begin with, and people get replaced all the time. If Disney only took mere days to fire Johnny, then why shouldn't it be the same for Amber? I know WB stood by Johnny with Crimes of Grindelwald (probably because of pushing from JK Rowling) yet it still lost money over this and people tried to claim he was a bad actor all of a sudden in it.


Amber could never act. is a horrible person, and a manipulator. She gets away with it because she has a pretty face. Honestly with the drugs the doctors mentioned, how she acted after the fight, and her personality and the way things have been described, I think she has BPD and isn't taking her meds properly since the doctors have to be there to constantly administer. And it doesn't excuse how she is acting in the slightest",Tisha,0,2020-04-24T23:49:17Z

Like the Pirates of the Caribbean are an awesome franchise and ppl will react if they change something, with Aquaman will be practically the same. People will see the movie no matter what (like Wonder Woman, or Cpt. Marvel, or Shazam, or any other superhero movie) because they want to see those kinds of movies. If they ""need"" to change something (and I'm not saying they don't need to make changes) they need to be VERY careful with that. 
Let's be frank over here, they can't put the wife of the king of the F***ing Atlantis without being at least resemble pretty much to Ariel (white skin, red hair, and very beautiful)(and NO! ""Beautiful"" in this case is not from inside). It seems racist (I know) BUT IT'S TRUE.

If they make a bad change they will ruin the film. It will be much worse than just almost cutting out the character. Now they can substitute the person for one very much alike (Batman The Dark Knight did that and was an awesome film) but if they try to become very ""creative"", as Hollywood do nowadays, they will ruin one of the last good movies that DC still has.",rfixe,0,2020-04-23T20:56:04Z
