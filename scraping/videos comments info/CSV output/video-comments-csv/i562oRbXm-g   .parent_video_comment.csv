WB has shown us repeatedly that they don‚Äôt care about public opinion. They only care about protecting a Domestic Abuser.  Maybe they‚Äôll change their minds when the movie bombs",Linda Landry,0,2021-02-25T18:24:26Z
1,UgzcHj0Py-RivVd7TmB4AaABAg,"Sorry I missed this one. Amelia Clarke getting the role would be good, but we can only believe it when we see it! And as for not filming in Australia, if true, we still need Scamber Turd back here to face perjury charges. I want that to happen and I am sure many others do too.",Peta Bulmer,1,2021-02-25T00:17:09Z
2,UgzFKvhidjTaQk98TCB4AaABAg,"Any studio would be thinking she's a liability at this point. After all she could screw them in a totally unrelated way...screw up filming, sue them over something, have altercations with the cast members, f*ck some married guy and cause a blow up. Really, the possibilities are endless...
And yes L'Oreal does suck....",Karen Oliver,4,2021-02-23T12:38:33Z

4,UgyemRv8XRPzwQGDoW54AaABAg,"O.k. This is false. First,  the article was written a couple of months ago. The guy that wrote it doesn't cover movies. If it were true it wouldn't be buried in an article about a home being sold! If it were true it would be all over the news. She is not going to get fired. She is being investigated for lying under oath in Australia.",tom thorn,0,2021-02-22T19:20:19Z

8,UgzeyFywfTw2iO8iyil4AaABAg,I think it‚Äôs a rumour unfortunately. But i‚Äôd love Emilia Clark to play Mera. She‚Äôs a great actress I just loved them both in GOT. It would be worth watching then for sure!,Mia Della,1,2021-02-21T23:46:38Z
9,Ugw9Zf6t0PTnkVaQWIR4AaABAg,"Hi Doctor Soup, I was actually hoping AH didn't lose any roles until the trial because then JD would have had a stronger case against AH that he had lost earnings where AH had not,  But having said that, JD has not actually said anything negative about AH publicly, he's just released evidence.  AH is the one who's publicly defamed JD & tried to be smart about it by not mentioning his name, & it ended up backfiring against her.  The Ironic thing is that JD actually warned AH about this in the Phone Recordings. I'm paraphrasing here but he stated something like ( You can't get ahead by throwing someone under the bus ). Anyway AH massively under estimated JD on so many levels, & because of her greed she never realized how good she actually had it.",Alan Lubin,3,2021-02-21T17:52:11Z

13,Ugwe-8A5x0b0ZkXPvmN4AaABAg,"I missed this live,but from how I understood, WB dropped JD because he supposedly created to much drama. I say really? This nasty chick , pooped in a bed she shared with her husband! I think that constitutes creating drama. But she's still standing. Smh. What double sided expectations WB has right?",Danielle Burchette,2,2021-02-21T08:50:10Z
14,UgzJyHyf4-mFOyJwMpx4AaABAg,It would be FANTASTIC if this rumor is true. After she's pulled all that crap on Johnny and getting him fired from movies. AH needs to be fired.,Joni Kaltenbach,2,2021-02-21T06:00:14Z

22,UgwrzlBk3nfn1BlTnHx4AaABAg,She couldn‚Äôt sue Depp for defamation because defamation is a false claim that causes someone to lose reputation and therefore work.
