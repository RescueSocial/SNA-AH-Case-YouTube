You're just one step less pathetic then these idiots that are still supporting AH's claims.

Did you have a little look in the mirror and have you questioned yourself how and or why you were so readily able to condemn a man just on the basis of some random celebrity's claims.. neither of which you know personally and apparently without even questioning her side of the story in the first place.

Ridiculous, let me guess.. you hate Trump, you think slavery was invented by Europeans, Cleopatra was black, the middle east has women's rights, and Islam is a religion of peace and it's perfectly fine to do business with China... not like they are racist or anything.

I'm sorry I'm being a bit harsh, but I've just had it with so many people just glancing over the fact that they are so easily indoctrinated by media and even though you and many others think they are so educated, very few of you use that education to dig deeper than face value when it comes to these serious issues and hold very stern opinions on various matters (of which they usually know little about).",2020-10-18T11:19:06Z,0

21,UgxoenfCRjHd2sHfSeh4AaABAg,Samantha Moran,Why does everyone keep saying it's mutual? His drug taking was outrageous but that's self abuse. All evidence I've seen points to Amber being abusive. Is there evidence out there that shows otherwise? It looks like victim blaming when people say this shit,2020-10-26T18:10:13Z,3
22,UgxoenfCRjHd2sHfSeh4AaABAg,caomhan84,"Anyone in the media is going to be afraid to publicly show support for a male victim because they think that doing so will undercut the ""Believe women"" mantra that has been chanted non-stop since 2017.  That's the long and short of it.  What we should be doing instead is believing the evidence.  But believing the evidence somehow has negative connotations attached to it, which is a shame.

I have personal reasons why I don't automatically ""believe women."" In 2006 while I was still in college, I witnessed a physical altercation between a couple. The man slapped the woman harder than I've ever seen anyone slapped in my life, and then he walked away.  He slapped her so hard she fell and skinned her knee.  When he was gone I am very cautiously approached her and asked if she needed help. I didn't try to touch her, I really didn't get close to her, I just knelt and asked her if she needed help or needed me to call the campus police.  She looked at me with absolute venom and said that if I didn't get away from her, she would start screaming and tell the police that I was the one that hit her.  And then she did scream.  14 years later, I can still recall the sharp tone in her voice when she said ""I'll tell the police YOU did this!""

Me.  Not her boyfriend who slapped the living shit out of her, so hard I'm surprised she didn't get whiplash, but me. An innocent bystander who offered to help.  And just like that, my view of women changed irrevocably.  And this was 11 years before MeToo.

Now, this doesn't mean that when I hear an abuse accusation I automatically DISbelieve women and think they're all lying.  But I am never going to automatically believe anyone. I believe evidence instead.  To automatically believe them just invites anyone to take advantage of how naive you are.",2020-10-21T16:25:01Z,6
