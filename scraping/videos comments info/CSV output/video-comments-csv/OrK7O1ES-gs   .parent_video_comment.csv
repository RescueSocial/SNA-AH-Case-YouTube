11,UgymJ-lGnG24s34FKnp4AaABAg,I think ALL. JD fans will boycott the latest Fantastic Beasts movie. Not that there is much Fantastic Beasts in the films after the first one the beasts are a sideline now. WB are a horrible company to the fans. They only let fans have stuff from them any fan made items are stamped on by copyright. BUT WB won‚Äôt release their props versions. We fans have asked for years for the TEXTBOOKS but WB will not release them. Also there a hundreds of MONOPOLY sets for different films but not Harry Potter or Fantastic Beasts cos they own the copyright to EVERYTHING to do with Harry Potter etc.,Dawn Mason,0,2021-08-02T19:55:14Z

14,Ugy73tzUvICg3QclBTF4AaABAg,"Just a short word on this issue, I wanted to see Fantastic Beast 3 hoping JD would be in it, but now it's a movie I will pass on due to WB cancelling JD and doubling down on Amber Heard, same thing with Pirates without JD which is not a true Pirates without JD, so these decisions/choices were easy, but...
Growing up on comic books both by DC and Marvel, it's a must for me to see all those super hero's movies, even if they have bad reviews before I go see them. But when it comes down to ""Aquaman 2"" and as much I enjoy Jason Momoa as Aquaman, this will be the first super hero movie that I will deliberately pass on due to Amber Heard being in it.

I can not support a company nor business who rewards such people. I will support anything Johnny does in the feature films he is in. My mother was a victim as well before she met my step dad who treated her and me like royalty. I seriously wish   AH all the bad karma and bad luck and I pity any child she has or will ever have,  cause if she can do that to another person what's stopping her from doing it to her child ,nothing is going to stop her from doing it because she  was rewarded instead of punished.

65,UgwSSn-XhX3R0lWZH9d4AaABAg,"This Dior thing isn't the only win Depp's getting. It's been revealed that Johnny Depp is not only involved with the Hollywood vampires' third album, but is also collaborating with guitarist Jeff Beck for Beck's new album. From what it appears, Depp's focus is currently on making music. He wants a return to acting in the future but for now he wants to mainly make and perform songs. 

The only bullshit setback is that Minamata, Depp's latest film, isn't being released in America because the studio that was going to distribute it is now pussing out because of the ""controversy"". But im pretty sure that the film will become accessible online after it comes out I the UK in August.

I'll keep saying it: Depp being dropped from the Wizarding World and POTC franchises is a blessing on disguise. Even when Depp was in them, they were going downhill and losing their quality. Dead Men Tell No Tales was the worst of POTC, and even Depp couldn't save it. Crimes of Grindelwald was the same thing for the Wizarding World franchise. Depp and Jude Law were the only good parts of that film. Depp should do more stuff like The Proffesor and Waiting for the Barbarians, rather then shitty Hollywood films like FB 3.",Gamemediafan 17,0,2021-07-28T22:25:54Z

Especially after WB basically stabbed him the back, based solely on the word of a violent, emotionally  abusive woman who had already been accused & convicted for the abuse of her previous lover.  It is very obvious she was also the abuser in her relationship with Johnny, too.  He always chose leaving a fight, just to avoid being beaten up, yet it enraged her. The tapes prove that she was gaslighting him repeatedly, a form of emotional abuse.  He remained a gentlemen by not doing anything back except try to reason with her or leaving.  She even chopped his dang finger off!  Because of Warner's having taken sides with Amber, I won't be paying a penny to see anything produced by them in the future, just because of what they did to further the abuse of a highly beloved, decent, good man & very talented actor.  Firing Amber would be a good start if they want to stay in business.  Warner's Grand Poo Bahs say that our voices & our petitions are a useless effort on Johnny's behalf & that they do not take them seriously.
