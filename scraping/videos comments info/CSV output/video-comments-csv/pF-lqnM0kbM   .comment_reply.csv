10,Ugzp7xyfCuiay8qGV5l4AaABAg,Willy Gonutz,"@Rock Candy  Hahaha!, Nice! We don't want her here. Although I'm sad to say she'd prob fit right in the way our politics are at the moment. People in the spotlight: tv hosts, news presenters, etc,.. are disappearing and being replaced with every PC minority based on : religion, gender, ethnicity,  physical disability, etc, ...  It goes without saying that people in those demographics should be able to get those jobs, but it shouldn't be the REASON they get the job.
Brie Larson's whinging about getting her own Marvel movie, was the reason Scarlet Johannsen's Black Widow movie was pushed back. 
A lot of these chicks talk about their 'sisterhood', but the truth is most of them would eat each other to get to the top, which is probably not far off how AH and BL and one or two others got this far in the first place.",2021-06-05T23:11:30Z,1

24,UgwrQnQEh2HcsqvV2Jt4AaABAg,Rock Candy,this is what happens when you read something for a video but you don't actually follow the case.  but overall the evidence presented is still pretty good (lapd) but something is off..i think it's a lack of real emotion of someone who actually cares about the case.

38,Ugz35H0-eWsxvp29XCx4AaABAg,Rock Candy,"@PNHassett Amber used makeup and photoshop to get those b ruises.  There were NO br uises from the night of the incident until days later when she got the TRO (b ruises appeared)  and then no br uises afterwards.  They just magically appear when needed.  Johnny never hit her - he's a v ictim of her false allegations.  It was a hoax with her friends to frame him and obtain better leverage in the divorce.  There's newly released lapd bodycam footage which vindicates him. 
 If you are talking about the incident the day before the James Corden show - she had no b ruises, no black eyes, no broken nose, no pulled out hair, no b ruised ribs...it's obvious to everybody who watches the show clip that she lied.  And the makeup artist testified the same.  
Amber really likes the attention and being a v ictim - sooo all the parading.  And just to mention, after severing his finger she then took a cigarette and burned his cheek.  sometimes people forget that part...and she didnt call for medical attention to help him either.",2021-06-05T16:42:47Z,1

40,Ugz35H0-eWsxvp29XCx4AaABAg,PNHassett,"What's there to know?  Chronic anger.  Goes over the same supposed slights to their ego over and over again which eventually ends in some sort of violence if they feel it's not resolved...... unfortunately, they'll find something else to grind against. It's a chronic manic state with no peace, bipolar disorder.  My father exhibited pressure speech, which was endless talking, mostly yelling, that lasted for hours on end, sometimes days.  He mostly went on about the injustices he encountered which after a time becomes borish and endless. Your fear and sense of compassion turn into resentment and STFU mentality. If any of this sounds familiar, it's because it's bipolar behavior.",2021-06-02T11:50:17Z,1

But couldn't passed the opportunity to use him as a stepping stone. Money and power hungry. A lot of people didn't know who she was, until Johnny Deep. He figured out too late... he asked for a prenup and that's when she went crazy and all this started. Her father said, ""she had to say, she was a victim of domestic violence "" so she wouldn't be homeless. It was the only way, she could keep the apartment and money.
