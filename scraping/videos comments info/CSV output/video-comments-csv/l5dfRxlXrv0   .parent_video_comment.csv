If she's been fired   you would have to have a solid case for her to be fired and none of these 'reports' give the reason for her sacking.  That's why I  would take these reports with a pinch of salt. The only person losing jobs from the fall out from the court case is Depp. If there is no credible reason given for the sacking. She would have a good enough reason to take Warner Brothers to court for her firing. There is nothing to suggest they have a reason to get rid of her.

I mean to me Garrett Hedlund is like the perfect Aquaman Choice. No no we'll get that guy who did Conan..
Radha Mitchell is the perfect invisible woman. No we'lll get Jessica Alba lol.
