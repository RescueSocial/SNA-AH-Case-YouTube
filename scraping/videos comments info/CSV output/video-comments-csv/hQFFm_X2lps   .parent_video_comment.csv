22,UgzJLz0xR-Fya8_EqQN4AaABAg,"Her non verbal behavior while sitting and eating ect prior to answering questions in contrast with her non verbal and verbal while responding to the question (between 11:10 or so and 12:00 or so) displays almost 2 different people. Not implying multiple personalities as that is not her mental illness I am quite sure..it is indicative of dissociative behavior and then pathological lying-verbal and non verbal. She is an actress so it looks and feels and smells ect like an actress in between takes having a snack and relaxing until filming resumes and the actor snaps into the role. That is what she did and she is a professional at this mind you. All I can do is shake my head as this person wastes the time and energy..money of the court space and personnel, the attorneys..and continues to scar and traumatize a darn good soul which is the darkest and deeply unnerving part of this type of horrendous situation. She really is doing great as you see she isn‚Äôt appearing to be suffering from issues related to ptsd or the intense stress of a court case related to her abuse. She appears to be thriving which is no surprise as she will always take care of herself no matter what, she is number 1 in her mind, her world. She is above any God she may claim to believe in..any person that she knows or just a person in general. Her world revolves around her, she is perfection and above everything and one. She can do no wrong in this world..she writes the script and it is reality for her period, doesn‚Äôt matter who gets hurt. People in her life are there because they fit her narrative at the time, she will discard them when they no longer fit and this person has no ability to feel empathy, guilt, cannot reflect on herself. I can go in and on anyways she is a NARCISSIST, Clinically I‚Äôd diagnose  her right now with zero doubt and 100% confidence as having Narcissistic personality disorder as she meets all diagnostic criteria. With more research I could expand the dx further as there are subtypes essentially. My gut says Narcissistic personality disorder/psychopathy. She doesn‚Äôt exhibit sociopathic attributes-if so a few here and there not enough to meet criteria to diagnose. Psychopathic behavior is evident..exhibited clearly from the moment this deeply unfortunate and unjust ordeal surfaced. You can see her psychopathic behavior right here. If she was put in a proper behavioral health center for 30 days minimum the staff would see signs immediately that would intensify and become more and more evident with each passing hour no exaggeration, it would not take but 2 weeks max to diagnose and begin treating her. In a proper facility not a resort like place that people go to when they can afford it. She will hurt countless others including children and she will not be held accountable on a level that could possibly prevent that‚Ä¶this I know. And it isn‚Äôt right in a soul level. people like her are unpredictable and very dangerous. send Johnny energy highly charged with healing, strength, love, compassion, cleansing/balance, guidance and a clear path to renewed grounding, a new solid foundation so to speak, self love and care so his light can shine brighter than ever and grow from his strong roots anchored to his new found better than ever ground!!! also energy to assist with anything else his soul energy needsüí´ü§çüåôü§ç‚ú® love and light charged with the creators light channeled to you J.D. you will transcend and ascend beautiful soul!",IndigoGypsyMoodyBlue Goddess,0,2021-11-15T10:56:15Z
23,UgyQ5uTm1RHrAGhbmx14AaABAg,"Whoa I already knew she had severe mental issues but this shows it big time. Just 11 min in and yes she is in Lala land essentially, eating like that on the stand?? I guess if you are a celebrity you can do that? A victim of domestic violence would not just be snacking while recounting traumatic events. I am a survivor of 18 years of abuse, with my children as well and I go to court and it is a nightmare. I couldn‚Äôt imagine having an appetite, I am 98 lbs and I can handle myself in court, deal with the re-victimization that occurs and carry myself with dignity in all aspects. I will pray for Johnny Bc I know all too well how abusers are. They unfortunately are master manipulators so people do believe them, they get away with things that they should be jailed for. Her behavior will repeat in her future relationships Bc they thrive off of chaos, ego, playing the puppeteer but with people and the people closest to them, playing the poor mistreated victim and blaming others for incidents in order for them to not see the reality of what they are, to escape the consequences of that reality and to ensure that they can carry on with their behavior.

You may be recalling something you know was wrong, but there was some part of you or some part of the chaos that you enjoyed at the time, and it can be hard to separate the unhealthy behaviors from the sort of deviant attachment to it. That's why it isn't a genuine smile, because you don't want anyone to know that you not only tolerated the behaviours, but that some part of you has an almost fond attachment to it. I could definitely see this being a trait moreso in men as well because of the stigma attached to domestic abuse perpetrated by a woman. The smile could be a knee jerk reaction to not wanting to seriously discuss the abuse since it could be portrayed as unmasculine, or it could be a recall to happier times of her acting wild in a way that wasn't negatively directed at him.

And when new information comes out and turns out this ""victim"" was lying, no one wants to apologize and for some, it's just an ""oh well"" meanwhile, the person whose reputation and livelihood was heavily affected because of the accusation is left to pick up the pieces by themselves. Just because someone's rich or famous, or a man, doesn't mean it's any less difficult to get back up on their feet.

Notice that when asked AH she looks up in a nervous manner her eyes shuffle up, forward, then up a couple more times taking away that solid eye contact  with the person asking them the question they know they are about to be untrue about which a person will tend to do when they know what they're about to say is NOT the truth. She looks around a lot which tends to be an indicator the person is not recollecting they're making it up.

What hes doing I call a 'Sad Half Smile'. Its basically a reflexive half smile that you do when youre remembering something bad/sad but you wanna not become depressed by it or bring the listener down by it so youre trying to keep a Positive vibe....Well....some how your face just makes a Half Smile as if your brain is trying to FORCE you to be happy but because of your sad emotional state it only Half takes.

Its almost the same situation as Nervous Laughter.
Thats a situation where someone is Highly Uncomfortable but theyll Laugh Or Giggle.
Basically from what my Therapist told me when I asked her about the Sad Half Smile because it legit freaked me out at first she said ""It is literally like a case of your Brain and your Body having a disconnect of sorts brought on by a stressful moment in time.
Your brain is trying to help you cope by making things lighter, but your body isnt fully invested in that notion so it only Half smiles."" She said that in time as I become more able to cope and process sharing my story itll likely lessen. And for the most part its not as bad as it was.

Though when I do a LONG life story with people I have it happen ALOT because Ive had MANY sad things happen in my life and my heart sometimes feels like crying but my Brain is like ""Keep It Together People Are Here No One Wants To See You Ballin' Your Eyes Out."" SO....What comes out is that same exact half sad smile that Johnny does....
And knowing that I know what that look means makes it all the more sad listening to him and it makes me love him as a person even more.

Hes 100% gonna always be my Favorite Actor and I hope when Karma comes back to Bite Amber in the azz for what she did to him....I Hope It Bites HARD.

The weight being lifted off of his shoulders and coming out of the darkness is bringing him joy and relief. He is choosing his words very carefully as this holds a lot of emotional weight for him, as apposed to AH who couldn't be bothered to make eye contact or even pretend to have a shred of interest even when it's made it to trial. She's likely spent so much of her life getting away with things by manipulating people that her humanity has withered away with apathy to the point she can't even be bothered to pretend she cares.

As men we tend to put on a brave face, but when we finally break down, we choke on our own words as we fight back the nearly impossible urge to cry. You can see in his eyes that he's been holding onto to this too long and it's broken him. Each time he's saying the words he scoffs or gives a faint chuckle, it's because after years of dismissing or justifying each individual incident and separating them mentally, now that they've all been laid together in front of him, even he can't really believe what he's saying, as he realizes how ridiculous it all sounds out loud, when up until now it's all been an internal monologue, how he's come to realize that he's been abused and manipulated and should have sought intervention a long time ago.

I've never been in his situation, but years ago I had met my ""one"" and when things didn't work out I ran myself through the ringer for years after, even years after not seeing her, I was remembering it all about a week ago and tried to admit to myself out loud the words ""Because I was afraid I would never see her again"" and got choked up as I was saying it that I couldn't get the last of it out, I ground to a halt and let out a smirk like Johnny did, I didn't think it was funny, I was internally admonishing myself for my emotional weakness in the face of a truth I was finally ready to admit.",Mr Freeman,3,2021-10-08T17:39:24Z

No micro communication in the eyes, the face, the body reveals victimhood. The emotion is misaligned with the expression. Which means her intent is different from her focus. (what she intends to accomplish with what she is focusing to convey) However, all body language and micro-expression from Depp show the feeling behind the words.

I see so many people try to 'Body Read' without having a Base Line on the subject.  Doesn't work.  All they're doing is assuming the individual to be a statistical 'average'.  You aren't reading the person then, you're just reading a text book and applying that to the individual instead.

Also the nod and no misalignment could just be her responding to both questions separately. Her mind is probably racing here- and I know that if she does have bipolar disorder as is indicated... then that's probably what happened there.

322,UgzcUT2ToHjXO_Nibrp4AaABAg,"To be honest, I am biased,  as I have had a crush on Johnny Depp since I first saw him as a teenager (so roughly half my life) and he has never disappointed. Truth be told, his seemingly sweet nature, his gentle demeanor and his soft-spoken approach are WHY I have had this ever-lasting crush. As that is the case for me, I cannot possibly imagine someone like that ever being physically abusive. I had a dream as a 15 year old in which Johnny told me ""You should never let yourself be someone's trash can."" I feel so strongly for this person who has always come across to me as a gentle person, that when he is being faced with the reality that the person he loved became so abusive, it hurts him. I see the pain in that half-smile, almost as if he doesn't want to believe it, doesn't want to think something so negative about someone so important and special in his life. This is NOT the attitude of someone who is angry at another. This is someone who cares and is hurt, distressed, upset. Contrast that with Amber's testimonial, in which she goes back and forth between seeming bored or uncomfortable, and being varying levels of defensive (even raising her voice and leaning forward pointedly). It's so clear to me that Johnny Depp is the person I have always seen him as, not some abusive monster who would push someone down a flight of stairs without a thought... at the risk of sounding like a Beatles-struck school girl, I love you Johnny. You are a beacon of light for many, many thousands of people and we all love you. You are not alone, and you are allowed to be strong.

341,UgwOvDsrFlYLfbOslYJ4AaABAg,"Hi.  I was just sitting here, hating Amber Heard with the intensity of a thousand suns, when I noticed various clips of her doing the whole movie promo interviews, and talking during interviews, and either she's the worst actress on the planet, or she genuinely has zero fucks to give that anyone can tell at a glance she harbors nothing but contempt for you, and she will have forgotten about you completely about 3 minutes before the interview ends.  Seriously, I haven't seen anything like it since Chevy Chase was still doing the talk show circuit.  I know you only interpret body language, but after being married to a certified sociopath for 10 soul-crushing years, I've become really good at spotting them. I've wished this series was around when I kept confronting my husband about blatant, obvious lies, only to have him turn it around on me every time as being wrong, and not understanding that letter he wrote to his friend about how, now he's married, he badly he wanted to fuck this woman he was ""just friends with.""  Apparently I read it completely wrong and it said nothing of the sort.  Like Amber Heard's performance telling people she donated 7 million dollars to the ACLU and the LA Children's hospital, and that she ""wanted nothing for myself.""  There's still some gold to be mined in that psychopath that suddenly has a baby as a prop to try to make the world hate her less.

Now, if only I could find a channel to describe what kind of person would defecate on their marriage bed, and proudly tell people about this act of revenge for Johnny showing up several minutes late for her 30th birthday party.

342,UgyI64fgjAWONWUQUYB4AaABAg,"I read her reactions as her feeling very uncomfortable with being asked questions that she did not want to answer truthfully;  many instances were not mentioned in this video that indicated that she either was about to deliver what she knew to be a lie or had just told a lie and instinctively followed it with forming a defensive barrier using her hand(s) / arm(s) - a few examples being 12:48 - having concluded answering the question, she could not contain showing a micro-aggression and her contempt for being questioned, by way of trying to bat away the person and question before her, and symbolically dismissing the person that had asked her the unwelcome question;  13:44 - her mouth grimace, indicating her discomfort from knowingly having told a lie;  14:15 - her placement of her hand to give her a small amount of soothing-self-comfort whilst more importantly her arm forms a defensive barrier between herself and her nemesis, created no doubt because she realised that her answer was too absurd to quash the question that had been asked.  As for JD, I suspect that he has long been  guilty of hiding the fact that he was a victim of domestic abuse and violence; and that when publicly questioned about such, that he still held back from fully revealing the traumas that he suffered. Furthermore, -15:27 - did you notice that Amber mocks the use of the verbs  used to describe her physical attack(s) ... and in doing so is reluctant to label such as a punch, hit or strike, opting to refer to one such attack as trying to 'push'' - which is a typical response by domestic abusers, to downplay the abuse that they commited and in doing so, often as not, to also mock the victim (which Amber did when she made the accusation 'whenever he was INJURED or touched it was always referred to in these ways of PUNCHING or OCKED or WHATEVER!' at this point she frantically delivers a lot of dismissive hand gesturing.",James James,0,2021-09-12T01:49:42Z

That lady Amber is a bonafide sociopath, through & through. Everything I've seen and heard about her, which I've now sat and watched hours of today , I've seen a mirror likeness of before. She is cold, calculating, methodical! Bitterness & resentment governs her every action and emotion. 
Johnny Depp was/IS in the fight of his life to escape her clutches, and I FULLY BELIEVE one of the comments he made, when he said, ""He was scared to death and didn't know what to do."" He said it because he realized he fell in love with pure evil and the only escape he had would be a never ending nightmare, which he's been living now for years!! He knew it, and I assure you, he foresaw the outcome he now fights with. 
We have not heard the last of Amber Heard. If we could ever a fly on the wall, or secretly record what her own sister has to say about her, THAT is where we'd find the real truth. Her family knows what she is and what she's capable of, but say nothing b/c they are trapped in her web too! I again stake my life on that fact!
Here is the absolute truth about what happens when your sociopath partner knows you've figured them out... YOU BECOME THEIR PUREST ENEMY & NOTHING IS HELD BACK FOR THEM TO DESTROY EVERYTHING THEY CAN ABOUT YOU! And I mean everything.

That being said, this is not the main reason that I believe Johnny Depo. I believe him because I find Amber Heard to be not credible, in any way. I do not believe a word she says. That video she showed of Johnny kicking the cabinet and drinking, shows me that yes he was an angry drunk in the moment. But I don‚Äôt believe she ever suffered any physical abuse.

620,UgwS_ivfKcMeZ_xwuHt4AaABAg,"Only half way through and had to stop as there are so many problems with your analysis. I have no particular care for Amber Herd and don‚Äôt have an opinion on whether she was the victim or perpetrator so this comment is not a defence of her, it‚Äôs merely to point out your inaccuracies. The very first one (which didn‚Äôt bode well for the rest of the video) was when she nodded yes but said no right at the start. That happened because she was nodding yes to the question ‚Äúdo you understand?‚Äù while answering no to the question ‚Äúdid you hit Johnny?‚Äù It doesn‚Äôt say anything about her own disbelief in her answer. Then you speak about her self-soothing actions as soon as she answers an uncomfortable question. That happens when she is describing a situation of violence toward herself. It is common for victims to self sooth and shake their heads when recalling abuse they suffered. Your response to her eating is oddly passionate, perhaps making it the strongest indicator of your bias. She would have needed permission to have food in a trial in the first place so whatever the reason she needs to eat during the trial, that reason was obviously acceptable to the court. It‚Äôs not something she‚Äôd just randomly do. In fact, the first time she puts food in her mouth she looks off to the corner as if to confirm it‚Äôs ok. Your problem with her babbled response to the question about the audio of her apology is unfounded as it is exactly the type of response you should expect from someone who feels they‚Äôre being led into a verbal trap with a piece of evidence taken out of context. It‚Äôs clear that the audio evidence is to point out that Amber must have hit him otherwise she wouldn‚Äôt be apologising for it and her response indicates she knows that‚Äôs what they‚Äôre trying to imply. It‚Äôs incredibly common for abuse victims to apologise to perpetrators later when the perpetrator accuses the victim of hurting them during their own attack. Again, I don‚Äôt necessarily think Amber is the victim in this case, I‚Äôm just pointing out that your analysis takes none of that into account. Finally, you keep talking about her nonchalance as if it points to her guilt when in fact it could just as easily do the opposite. When someone who has been traumatised is trying to deal with a situation of reliving the trauma without getting emotional, one way to do that is disassociate as if the entire situation doesn‚Äôt matter. However, in this case I get the impression her nonchalant behaviour is purposeful to express the fact she doesn‚Äôt think she should be there at all, which any victim would feel if they were being questioned as if they were the perpetrator. AGAIN not saying that‚Äôs my personal belief, just that it‚Äôs a reading of the situation you‚Äôve completely missed. I‚Äôm not sure if you‚Äôre reading this unfavourably because of your own opinion against Amber Herd or because you know popular opinion sways toward Johnny Depp but the one thing that I am sure of is that no one should rely on your body language analyses.",Linga Relaxes,0,2021-08-13T01:07:42Z

648,UgxTakhX_79DmvXjL8V4AaABAg,"I don't know nor do I care if she's guilty, but, this body language reading is bullsh*t and/or sloppy: 
 
The nodding and saying no: She nods to say/show that she understands the question, and says ""no"" as an answer to the question it self at the same time. It's so obvious that I can't believe no-one else points it out. It's not weird or confused. 
 
The ""duh""-behaviour is obvious to me: she's been asked the same thing a thousand times. Although not smart behaviour, it's not strange considering. 
 
The obsessive eating might seem strange, but it could be comfort-/nervous eating, not strange at all to me - but strange that it's allowed in court. If someone gave her snacks as a possibility to think answers through it's even weirder, BUT comparing being able to talk with a small piece in her mouth (which she had no problem with) and a LARGE piece (which might seem rude) is just silly. You can see the size difference of the pieces. But yes, it seems to be a concious decicion to eat a large piece at that exact moment, I agree with that.

I've heard that I have defensive body language, when I'm just holding my arms confortably, and have many examples of body language analysis that is 100% wrong.

Most people who know me will know me as a peace-loving, gentle, mild-mannered and generous person.  I've been told this countless times. And I like to think it's true.  When I'm sober, it's true.  But when I've been drunk in the past - and especially to the point of blackout - a different person has come out. Violent, abusive, physically destructive (even if I've never hit another person in my life).  I've been arrested and Sectioned for criminal damage and social disturbance.  All of these things have happened (including suicide attempts) during periods of extreme emotional stress - and most often they've been connected to emotional relationships (especially my last relationship, which was with - wouldn't you know - a narcissist).  Sober, I can look at these things and shake my head in despair and disbelief, as well as guilt and deep remorse for the hurt I've caused other people.  But that's what alcohol and drugs can do.  When I say they make me into a different person, I should qualify:  the person they turn me into is still me; the Dr Jekyll side of me.  The dark side that sobriety manages to control.  The id of me comes out.  I'm not proud of that side of me.  That's why I'm still on Johnny Depp's side over all of this.  I believe he is gentle, peace-loving and generous - but that adverse emotional circumstances with a dangerous and manipulative narcissist, coupled with alcohol, could easily have pushed him over the edge.  I hope he manages to recover his career and his well-being.  As for Heard... I wish she could be neither seen nor heard!

711,Ugzr9j5S6GRja9N766x4AaABAg,"When reading body language one must consider the person's age, upbringing, culture, idiosyncrasies, current mental state, or if they have a disorder. For example, in Hispanic culture, it is expected for a person being reprimanded to look down in shame when being corrected. I believe this is also true in several Asian cultures.¬† However, in American culture it is expected for a person being reprimanded to look their superior in the eyes to show that they are paying attention and show respect. 

Another example is that pointing with their index finger is considered very offensive in certain cultures. So most Americans wouldn't think much of a foreign person pointing with their index finger. However, if you consider that in their culture, that gesture is considered an offense, the meaning changes substantially.¬† 

Also, woman in many foreign cultures are expected to be meek and show as little expression/emotion as possible. Some cultures have that whole ""women should be seen and not heard"" mentality. This would affect how women of these culture express body language, or lack thereof. 

Similarly,¬† many (but not all) autistic people show little to no emotion in  their body language and/or verbal expressions. Many avoid eye contact. Many speak in a monotone emotionless voice while also not displaying any apparent body language. Other disorders/diseases may cause misread body language as well, such as Tourettes syndrome, ataxia, dystonia, Parkinson, etc.",11cylynt11,13,2021-08-08T06:59:37Z

And she nodded as a response of ""ye sure, I'm listening, I know what you are saying"" and said """"no"" as the answer to the question that was told aloud twice about the dv. So yes - two distant communication devices - two different questions one of which she is answering with yes and one of which she is answering with no. 

""wow its interesting, now she doesnt talk with her mouth full"" - its not interesting, she just took a bigger chunk of that food. She faked it after a moment, which you did not comment. That is more intresting. 

Its obviously uncomfortable asi it is, as her body language states throught the whole thing, so why is it surprising that the whispering bothers her? How did you not comment the narcisitic smirk? To me it seems she is trying to portray this defensless victim that she does not believe she actually is. 

Hit vs punechd with a closed fist is a different qeustion, not the same, are you even commenting what u are showing? If you want ot be objective you shouldnt present you opinion with so much frustration - it makes You seem untrustworthy. 

Johny does smirk, but you call his reaction out as hesitation. Its not hesitation, he is forcing to portray an emotion that is not true to him and he is proud about him slef.  What is there to be proud about bragging about injury? How about - ""I have physical evidence against her"" kind of feeling? 

The photo says nothing of the sort, tis not a display of what u described. Vid - good body movement coment, good assumption that it was not a healthy relationship, but u would not upload your vid if it was, so thats kind of unnecesary. Not a good exmpale though, he is obviously under influence of something. I see her trying to make sure that he has the situation under control, that could portraty as controlling under diffferent circumstance, but here it it shouldnt be.
 
I get it, you want to show how she is shifty and she kinda is in her speech. I am not in any way defending anyone, I actually see narcisistic vs borderline description of a situation here, but I call bullshit on your assesment. You got the points, but you are shifting them to your liking. And how you mock people is just the most annoying thing. Can you comment and make asessment without mocking someone? U are already making something of their misery, so at least try to be human about it dude. U can have some good points, so why ruin it with childishness and bias.",Jana Borbina,0,2021-08-03T22:38:30Z

Johnny Depp is intelligent. You can see it. He has influence and power. He has experience, and he's a very talented actor. To engage in conflict with him would be a mental game for sure. 
Amber doesn't seem as calculating as he does. I honestly don't think she's that smart, and she's obviously not as good an actor as he is. She doesn't have the influence or power either. And, he's a man, so he's physically stronger than she is. 
I don't think every aggression she ever committed was justified, and that's why she has a hard time defending herself. But they become more understandable if you consider the toxicity she was quite possibly enduring for an extended period of time.

Anyone with a head on shoulders would know not to behave this way if you want people to believe you I mean she should be expecting some questions and be prepared on how to react if she is lying 
Is it her  way of being strong or pretending to be strong .Being acting as if you're not hurt so as not to look vulnerable to people who affected you or maybe coping mechanism or something similar because i know cases wwhere people are traumatized to the point where remembering it leaves you bitter and cold so you ignore it or pretend it didn't happen Like the cases where  your brain blanks or blurs at the memory when you recollect it 
Also the clip on them being together isn't that the obvious height difference between them  I mean she would have to look down to maintain eye contact wheras the reasons for the guy looking down could be many like the crowd , maybe talkin to a mic .He has to lower his head. 
Besides soft spoken and not maintaing eye contact dont neceesary mean submissive it could also be manipulating .Since some dudes gets so used to masking emotions to be the society called MAN that it seems to me that  it is easier for them to manipulate /generally personating something they are not as they already so good at not showing they own true emotions .",Sarra Anjum,0,2021-08-01T17:36:16Z

To me, she seems uninterested, because she gave up, she thinks the verdict is already decided, she told these same things many times already and she saw she isn't believed. This is her defense mechanism, I'm not gonna give you the pleasure of showing frustration and anger, for you to ignore it or laugh at it.

948,UgxmhtapOB8RoZ_9U7R4AaABAg,"The fact is that society needs to change a lot even to this day. Many good men and women aren't violent because of who they are, when you add an abuser to either of their lives it can make physical and mental obstacles or trauma. Which then can create triggers that other rude or violent people can tap into... I myself even get nervous / triggered when toxic people (violent, alcoholic etc.) argue or fight with other people that don't even concern me because it's putting myself in between a rock and a hard place. For example, either I stop the women / man being beaten up by her / his partner which puts me in a lot of danger... or I don't do anything until police prescience is needed. Then again involving myself in general could get myself in deep trouble depending on who I confront / call the cops on. 

We all have struggles as either gender but at in the same light have many similar struggles... and sometimes emotions can hurt a hell of a lot more than physical abuse!
The only thing I can say to help at this moment is that women should be more careful and analytical as most of the time they're weaker physically which can get them in even more dangerous situations. Same with weaker men, think really hard about intervening etc! We all can be broken mentally but try to build a strong mind through self analytical measures & knowledge, if we all change our-selves to be better we'll slowly improve society, halting some of those potential toxic people which usually create more toxic people (similar to a pandemic).",Deadvenom,3,2021-07-24T04:10:39Z

I am a huge Johnny Depp fan and can't believe what is happening and how unfair he gets treated. But such videos, where you try to find out who is guilty should be made in a objective way. It showes when you explain the body language of Amber. You always give examples, but only negative ones to make her seem guilty. But there is always another possibility why she is acting that way, not only the negative ones. When you start to Analyse Depp you give two different possibility for the way he acts. But you make Sure, that the positive one is the better alternative.

1136,UgyypCeTc7Rejs3mFuZ4AaABAg,"Does anyone pay attention to the symmetry between left and right eye lid openness, and left versus right side of mouth openness symmetry?  I am pretty ignorant of body language analysis versus truth telling, but I do intuitively use left right symmetry of eye lids and mouth.  My theory is that the left side of the face is more open when the right side of the brain is dominating communication, and the right side is more open when the language center of the left side of the brain is dominating; the language center takes over when using words to lie.  The right side of the brain closes down the left side of the face when it does not agree with what the language center on the left side of the brain is communicating.  And conversely, the right side of the face closes down when the left side of the brain is trying to hold back truthful communications that it does not want released.  Amber is tough to read with eye and mouth symmetry; she is very symmetrical throughout this video.  The only time her left side is more open is when she is talking about defending her sister, which in my analysis means she is relating some episode in her life when she defended her sister.  Also, anger slips through during this answer which could be intentional acting, though she does not seem to be that good an actor.  In the Johnny Depp segment his left eye lid is consistently more open and, other than a few smirks he talks out of the left side of his mouth.",Dino Mite,0,2021-07-13T04:23:09Z

What I hear Johnny talk about having bottles thrown at him think about my ex-wife picking up the bag potatoes and hitting me with it a bunch of times or how she tore our marriage certificate within a week of our being married even though we're married for another 20 years we never had the original marriage certificate. I can think of the time she threw a crystal bowl  into my face. I can think of numerous times she punched me to square in the face. One time she dislocated my jaw and it's one of her proudest moments. She tells the kids about how she made my jaw hurt for a month. If there is people around she would literally take me around a corner to hit me and tell me how stupid I was before we went back to company. And during our marriage all she did was sleep and leave with her friends leaving me to do all the childcare whenever I wasn't working. And by the way she never worked. But I guarantee you if we went to court she would have a narrative where I was the scary guy and she was the victim. I'm a big dude. People have a hard time looking at me and seeing somebody who wad pushed around for 20 years. There is one time early in our marriage when I wanted to leave her and I was collecting some stuff and trying to leave with my mother. My mother was in her car waiting for me and I was taking some stuff out to her car and my ex came up behind me and started tearing at my clothes and grabbing at my hair and clawing at me and I was just trying to get to the car my hands are full of stuff and I didn't even have the ability to grab her because of what was in my hands but she was clawing at me and grabbing at me in the whole time screaming for help. She was actually screaming for me to let go of her. I had a box in my hands she had my hair in her hands and she was screaming for anybody in the distance to make it seem like I was assaulting her. If something would have happened and her neighbor would have called the police reporting that they heard a woman screaming for help they would have put my giant ass in jail and I'd still be dealing with an assault charge that she would probably treat like it was a real assault against her. She's kicked me and my children out of the house forcing us to stay in our car overnight because we disagreed with her. But if we're in court she would say she kicked me out because she was scared for her safety. I can't imagine how she would reason that should take the kids out to or how she would explain why they stood up for me , which is why she kicked them out with me. I have a lot to contend with and I'm going to go through the wringer just like Johnny Depp and I don't have money for lawyer. Scariest kind of woman the woman who doesn't care about what's real or who she hurts but will do anything you can to get the upper hand in the situation.

while moving the camera around and film the ""episodes"" they don't mesh together. Good example is you talk throughout the last episode on this video. say how loud it is while, you point the camera all around.

1267,UgyxHBEnKHjVNal0cFl4AaABAg,"The judge ruled Johnny Depp assaulted Amber Heard on 12 different occasions and put her in actual fear for her very life on 3 different occasions. In a court of law he IS considered a wife beater and the Sun is perfectly in the right to call him so. 

Our dude is greasy. He needs to take a gd shower and go to rehab before he dies from $30k a month worth of wine, pills, ecstacy and cocaine. He ""seems awkward in public"" because he's intoxicated. Drugged and drunk to the very extent to which the human body can withstand. You'd be awkward too if you had, ""been awake 3 days snorting powder, pills, wine, 2 bottles of champers on the plane.."", probably the same plane he admits to attempting to ""playfully tap"" kick Amber on the ass during an argument as she was walking away. 

Can you imagine if your husband tried to kick you during an argument as you were walking away?! The witnesses to the event said that Amber continued to walk off crying. If that was me I would have wrecked that entire plane into the ground to get to his wasted ass if my husband was as disrespctful of me, his life partner, as JD was of his wife and life partner, AH. 

All these JD ass kissing videos with lies about amber and the case clickbait that I've watched never bring up the fact that Amber only started recording the things he did because the next day when she had to tell him what he did and said and how much it sucked for her when he was black out wasted, he couldn't remember anything! 

There's probably a reason JD couldn't get Vanessa to marry him. He's a disaster, a walking drug overdose. The last person that can be a good husband. Ladies that have been in a marriage with someone that was constantly drunk and drugged, was it a decent marriage? Was he a decent, competent husband or was he very sick, toxic to his marriage and to you, and need psychiatric care? Did you feel more like a babysitter than a wife? JD needs to go straight from the courtroom to his room in a rehab in my opinion, and I'm sure many psychiatrist's opinions are well.

Smfh....""$30k a month on 'wine'"". Btw, to deny to himself how big a problem he has, he claims the wines he buys are ""investments"". His accountants counter that, ""it's not an investment if you drink it as soon as you buy it."" ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è He's really gone downhill. I know he was always a drug addict and an alcoholic, but now that he's 60 it's really starting to show. I don't think he's gonna live much longer abusing drugs and alcohol to the extent he does...he's pushing 60 partying like a 24 year old. 

Shame. HUGE shame, he is one of my favorite actors and I don't believe in enabling and letting people remain in denial about their substance abuse disorder until it kills them. Why doesn't Vanessa and or his daughter and son stage an intervention for their Father, or the father of their children??! Will he rough them up too if they said something like what he did to A when she tried to intervene? Ignoring this will not make this go away, but it will make him go away. Forever. This is how people die. He needs to address this issue. His family needs to take him for a 9 month in patient stay at Betty Ford. No more going to the Bahamas to his private island to ""dry out"" he needs to be in an actual rehab that uses intensive therapy all day and mental health medication, therefore he has to have doctors and he needs to stay inpatient for at least 6 to 9 months. No jumping over the fence after less than a day and going home and doing an huge shot to the arm and then a shot in the head like kurt. We've seen this happen to all of our heroes.

One night, we were over-served on wine when the topic came up again.  Tempers flared.  Other than the arguing, details are scrambled.  At some point, he had me pressed against a wall, with his hands around my throat.  I don't believe that I was actually frightened at any point, but I was certainly angry about his mistreatment.

A victim does feel insecure and blocks when verbally questioned. Not that i believe she is a true victim. I definitely feel this is disingenuous, and is a studied act. Another thing about depositions i have to say- the other side cuts you off and doesn‚Äôt listen which is very frustrating- a lot of people then look like they don‚Äôt want to be there (look bored) and do self soothing gestures.

1398,UgyMsvRdtVEBlOO2BQl4AaABAg,"If I remember this from 2016, it took them three times to get her to testify at the deposition.  Johnny had flown in for the depo from I think France.  She claimed she was too scared to be in the same room with him and that‚Äôs why she didn‚Äôt want to do the depo.  The Judge didn‚Äôt by her story. They kept setting up a date and she didn‚Äôt show up.  The Judge ordered her to testify the third time and if she didn‚Äôt show up, he would find her in contempt of court and put her in jail.  She didn‚Äôt have a choice.  I think Amber is a sociopath and when she talks about the stair fight, she appeared to be acting or portraying the aggressor.  There is something very wrong with Amber, she‚Äôs too violent and she immediately becomes the aggressor when they‚Äôre fighting.  Johnny is a pacifist, and she is domineering and controlling.  You know it‚Äôs bad when she tried to get Gloria Allred to be her attorney, the champion feminist lawyer and her daughter, Lisa Bloom to represent her.

At any time someone witnessed an event, a truthful person speaks in past tense. If someone is speaking in present tense of an event that happened previously, it is only natural for them to speak in past tense! Besides all that what kind of ignorant buffoon would be stuffing her ugly face being fully cognizant of a conversation involving them? Never in my 58 years of being on this planet have I ever witnessed anyone not even a four-year-old child stuffing their face when being spoken to! Is it not customary for humans to stuff their face while seated at a table with a napkin on their lamp with a spoon or fork in their hand While others are also participating in the same activity?

Johnny is obviously a troubled man. But his testimony is just so believable. He is serious but has this chagrin going on, he answers the questions properly with no emotive 'ehhhh my baby sisssteerrr' kind of rubbish. All the relationships of any kind, romantic or otherwise, haven't shown any kind of disregard for others feelings or any physical abuse.

Watching specifically to see if she's guilty or innocent, interrupts your ability to evaluate why she may have reacted in that way in the first place and begins to incorrectly paint a picture that matches some narrative. Your personal frustrations and misunderstanding of the situation lead to false assumptions, opinions, and accusations as to why she's behaving or responding in a certain way. 
For example; you ask, ""Why is she so uninterested in being here if she's the victim?"" Well, I'd say it's because they're trying to paint her like she's not a victim and actually the monster. Which then makes perfect sense to me why she would be reacting that way, and honestly baffles me how you find it confusing. But then I remember, you're not properly analyzing. You believe she's guilty and are trying to prove yourself right.  Lawyers are always trying to play some sorta 'HA GOT YA' game and it's very tiring and that's the main thing I'm seeing from her.

None of this pans out. Theres no way she'd try ""escaping"" with her abuser actively pursuing her. Thats called engaging . None of Her behavior is reasonable.  She shows zero fear, zero shame (which whether or not we deserve it, there's ALWAYS shame) . This is really disgusting. YEARS later I still couldn't portray this much apathy IF I TRIED when discussing the abuse.

To an accomplished golden shining example of the anomaly that is a celebrity with longevity and stability happiness, all this drama is a blight that he has every right to be embarrassed of, by way of a ""yeah, I know this looks bad, I am so ashamed embarrassed, trust me nobody is more disappointed in me than I am"" bitter kind of half smile.

Right from the start it looked fake and unnatural to me. Like, somehow it seemed like She is lying and actually creating a story for everyone to listen to.
4.55 - Look at her acting all innocent and cute, like she knows nothing about what's going on and she is actually the victim here.
10.03 - A victim would actually be unable to eat anything, as the victim would be filled with trauma at the mention of continuous abuse, if it really happened to her. The fact that she can eat, so casually even after the mention of her continuous abuse, indicates to the fact that She is not the victim here, but the Oppressor. She is not affected by the mention of the fact of continuous, simply because it never happened to here. IT WAS DONE BY HER.
16.05 - She kinda forgets that SHE'S ACTUALLY AN ACTRESS AND US AS A VIEWER CAN SEE THROUGH IT EVEN IN REAL LIFE. She was trying to sneak in her professional skill into it, but nope!

It is trying to force ideas through these two channels, but that non-verbal channel is so much harder to consciously control. It makes lying (usually) see a disconnect between those two channels because they are in conflict. 

I don't know the full situation between these two but it is plainly clear who has less conflict between those two channels. I know nothing of Heard, but just looking at this short clip, her communication seems very forced which is strange; if she was being honest, she wouldn't have to force her communication.

1844,UgyljuK3NgXDq8yf5PN4AaABAg,"I actually came here to watch this with a very open mind. But I am only 5min in, and can already detect bias in _your_ behaviour and expressions. That ""Oh my god"" you blurt out after you first hear her speak in the clip (5:19). Then right after you list things that could explain why she doesn't want to be there (5:23). You say boredom, guilt, or she doesn't want to be caught. How about listing 'innocence' as a possible reason for not wanting to be part of this interview...?!
I have no opinion in this case either way, and personally believe that both probably carry a bit of guilt. But when I watch an analysis on YT, I expect the person doing it to be impartial. And not show after five minutes that he's already picked sides.

Edit: 5:57 It's not really a misalignment. She nods 'yes' to the person indicating she understands what the interviewer is asking. She says 'no' as an answer to the initial question (whether she was violent). The interviewer asked two questions after another, so it's not Amber being misaligned, it's actually poor questioning of the interviewer. Watch it again: 4:59

7:30 Omg, and in the next part you are criticising her for shaking her head, although this time that is aligned with her 'no' answer. So, it's pretty clear that either way she does it, you criticise it... That's enough for me to think you have no idea what you are talking about and try to find things to criticise about her. You are clearly not unbiased, so I personally won't watch the rest of your clip, and will see whether there is a more impartial analysis out there.

Last thing I will say is, her being innocent and being asked again and again whether she engaged in domestic violence by various people, would equally explain shrugging and blocking gestures and her not wanting to be there, especially if you feel that your interviewer (and half the world) is already biased like in this case.

1885,Ugxc7t8kYG-R79ZmoPh4AaABAg,"As a man that was in an abusive relationship with a female I can kind of explain Johnny Depp's seeming half smirk possibly. Assuming Johnny Depp is a victim of abuse himself which I do not presume to know the answer to... Men are generally held to a certain standard socially. Women are as well and they have to deal with their own negative and unfair social pressures. For men it is this perception that you have to be tough, calm, and you can never be a victim. This obviously is not true across the board for all men just as assumptions about women are not always true. But it is something most men deal with growing up, and only marginally gets lessened with age. Depp is recalling what he claims to be a traumatic experience of being victimized by an abusive woman. if it is true his smirk is his male ego deflecting the severity of the attack in order to preserve his masculinity. It is in general unintentional. It took me a long time to be able to admit my tiny ex fiance abused me. I make jokes or smirk when I talk about it sometimes as well, especially if I were forced to in a very public deposition. It is humiliating - men and women tend to respond to humiliation in different ways and to different things. To me there is nothing odd about that half smirk.

And to be fair and play devil's advocate Amber could be a victim of abuse. Her boredom could be explained by the fact she has had to explain this so many times, her lack of passion could be because she truly does not feel that passionate about it. Not everyone responds to abuse in the same way. But whether or not she is ""passionate"" about being victimized has no relevance. If Johnny Depp abused her she is not required to respond in any one way to it. Maybe she is a bit of a ""tougher"" person (using this language as delicately as possible to make a point) who often fought back against the abuse but never presented herself as a victim. Eventually one like that can come to terms with the fact they have been abused and had to be defensive so often against the abuser and is perhaps overly defensive when that abusers lawyers are grilling her? Maybe some things she struggles to recall clearly are because it was not that traumatizing to her and she simply forgot every occasion because there were so many? I really do not know but I do know not every victim is required to behave the same way or to accept that they are a victim in order for abuse to occur. Many people who grew up seeing abuse of some kind stay in abusive relationships because it seems normal to them and simply do not recognize it as abuse (even though it is)

Overall my opinion which does not matter at all because I do not know these people nor do I have any authority in the outcome, but I feel Johnny Depp is probably telling the truth. She seems deceitful to me. But I am a biased person who was in an abusive relationship before so I would not do well on this jury.",Jacob J. Oliver,1,2021-05-28T19:54:43Z

When she does answer the question with the stairs you can clearly tell that this story has been rehearsed in a mirror over and over and after confident that she had it nailed she probably then started trying it out on friends and family to get their reaction to it before coming to this hearing. When they are on the red carpet at the end, you can clearly see that he continues to look at her searching for her approval after each time that he speaks. To me I agree with you, she is definitely the one in control and I think that she probably micro- manages every aspect of their relationship because if she does that then she is in complete control over how they are viewed by the public and what she allows and wants people to see and how she wants them to see and hear in all of it.",Nicole Catlin,0,2021-05-28T15:04:43Z

She is so irritating and I don't believe that this ABUSE she supposedly endured was ever anything more than a few pushes back and forth between the two of them. she talks about him exaggerating her pushing him as a cold clockI think she's the one that is exaggerating the seriousness of these physical altercations. Just how dismissive she is with these questions, that is very indicative of an abuser. Abusers act exactly like she is acting through this whole deposition.

1900,UgwWcNpWiZV70D-miwV4AaABAg,"As a body language analyst do you have 'tells' to identify if someone is neurodiverse? Like, in Amber's case it's striking how she presents with quite a few mannerisms a person with a mental disorder would. For example, if she had ADHD or ASD, many of the things she does would make sense, even if she was, in fact, the victim. I'm not writing this in her defense, I do not know or care for her. However, I do care for the neurodivergent community and some bits of your video, unbeknownst to you, may be a bit offensive. Quite a few people do struggle with sensory issues, are stimulus seeking, need to self soothe, and have a poor working memory and executive function they may need to use strategies to compensate for. It would be great if some of these typically non-neurotypical tells were not straight off the bat associated with psychopathology... Similarly, people who have PTSD or have experienced trauma and are forced to recall may also act strange at face value. (To my knowledge it is the nature of trauma that memories of the event may get jumbled and mixed up. It's a cognitive defense mechanism.) I am not hinting you are mistaken.

She commands ‚Äútop dog‚Äù respect and not in a healthy way. In a very belittling and hateful way. Which is crazy anyone would treat someone like this. She‚Äôs a liar until it‚Äôs relevant for her story. When it came to her sister that probably did happen she probably did get defensive over her at one point (her eye contact and passion case in point- something never seen up until that moment). But all of THAT was PURE deflection on any questions and pointed to ONE random situation outside the point just to try to get SOME type of truth out of her mouth that was completely irrelevant anyway. In that story it was a ‚Äúit could have‚Äù. Nothing to lead up to WHY she thought Johnny would ever attempt to push her. I think she was just enraged at Johnny and stepped in out of pure anger using her sisters location as a crutch to treat him poorly. She could never just say yes or no her lawyer/team was DEFINITELY breaking down watching her stuff her foot in her mouth over and over. It‚Äôs upsetting to see someone you can see is full of love in his true soul- be in this situation. Yeah women and men both can be abusers and people need to admit and remember that. It‚Äôs not SO out of question that she did him so so so badly. You can see it in her speaking, in her PUBLIC actions towards him. It‚Äôs all very blunt and in the open.

The thing Johnny Depp does, where he smirks or tries to smile or even tries to laugh. When talking about these instances/memories. Is a very common thing, amongst people who have lived under/with abuse. Especially for such a long time that they've had to develop coping and self-soothing mechanism, just to withstand and accept it and their reality. While I have been free of the abuse for going on 10yrs now, and have been in and out of therapy, as well as a special type of therapy meant to help me be able to recall and remember past moments and instances of abuse, without total mental/emotional and physical breakdown... I still, to this day, do things like that. I'll smile or even laugh, when recalling or talking about past moments. I've been told by people that care about me, now. That they really don't know how to respond because they say it looks like I'm about to cry or breakdown, but I smile and laugh instead. It's literally a coping mechanism. Making light, or a very dark situation (for your sake and others) because the reality and truth of it is so heavy. So, I just wanted to say as someone who's also been abused, and not just physical abuse but mental and emotional as well...

This is a deposition. The judge is not present to rule on objections; those will be argued later before the judge. Any objection to a question has to be recorded *during* the deposition, or else it's not timely and silence indicates acceptance of the question as valid.

So what many lawyers do in depositions -- particularly if they're in defensive mode -- is raise every objection they can imagine *might* be sustained, even if it's slim odds.

So what that objection is, is not the lawyer declaring that it's irrelevant so much as marking the issue for later argument, more or less on spec.

They check them being pushed together and the forehead and skin between brows crinkled. I'm now studying to be a social worker and we have to learn body language and a sure sign of a person in pain (even if mentally only) is the brows. A forensic body language specialist caught a murderer in British Columbia this way when he saw her interview on tv asking to please return her disappeared daughter. He called the cops saying her brows showed anger and frustration (going down, compared to pain going up). The police investigated her and turned out she murdered her daughter. - point being: with everything happening in that clip Amber's face only shows disinterest and her being annoyed. No pain retelling the story whatsoever. Johnny on the other hand, when he begins his brows are furrowed upward which shows it's painful to recall and when he tells of the bottle incident his forehead crinkles and his brows are expressive.

She needed reassurance because of how insecure she is, and her facial expressions, omg, she really disgusts me. I never liked her but after all of this I dread her. He seems so sad, he's always looking down at the floor, like a guilty puppy. Poor Johnny. I feel for him, he must have been really in love with her and didn't want to believe what a monster she was and he was clearly struggling perhaps still trying to think he could work things out, but he does not look happy at all. He is such a good person, because nobody has ever complained about him EVER and because of all people, 2 of his former partners spoke up for him, Winona Ryder and his ex wife, mother of his children, Vanessa Paradis. Abusers are abusers all their lives. I've been there. Had my own experience with some of those and you know what? They don't change. And they definitely don't start abusing like, after having behaved in a nice way for decades. It's not like Johnny Depp was nice to everybody and had good relationships, even stayed friends with some of his exes and now, all of a sudden, he went mad and thought ""hey, I'm gonna start being an asshole and abusing and treating women like shit"". No, sir. She's a LIAR. She has to be cancelled for being so mean, and so cynic and trying to destroy such a good man and actor's career out of resentment because she clearly lost the battle here. The guy got sick of being abused and got the hell out of that relationship, so she hates him deeply, because she didn't get what she wanted, for him to be her personal puppet. I hope she never works in a movie again and I hope justice rules in favour of Johnny. It's crystal clear to everybody that this child, because she does not act like a woman, is deceitful. She belongs in jail, not in front of a camera anymore. #justiceforjohnnydepp",Natalia Berrittella,0,2021-05-12T02:42:06Z

And ANYTHING she did was 'She gave me an evil look.' 'I can't take her abusiveness any more.' That was when she tried to get away to a neighbour's house for safety with the two children. It's the calm. logical responses we are trained to prefer in society but this is used to manipulate everyone into buying his (or her) story and make a joke out of the victim's lack of composure or she used the wrong word ad nauseum.

2438,UgyYeKEu8CRGlvF83KV4AaABAg,This man has No qualification in complex traumatic reactions (often dissociated and/or seemingly detached (bored or uninterested). Read any book on this. It won't take long to find this. Recall the days in earlier eras where the police did not believe rape victims because they weren't screaming and rolling all over the floor bur seemed dissociated and even calm or bored. That is the traumatic reaction in a nutshell. Domestic abuse victims are so accustomed to being ridiculed and gaslighted that they do come across as confused and tentative when telling their stories because their bodies are still reacting to the complex trauma reaction.,Tara Walsh-Arpaia,0,2021-05-02T01:58:28Z

I am a lawyer and a Dr of Psychology and have devoted a great deal of my professional life to working with domestic abuse cases. First off, I have never seen a victim 'allow themselves to crack' emotionally while being deposed. It is a hostile environment and these individuals are generally extremely jumpy, nervous and desperately trying to appear normal and composed (even if we think they fail in a normal context). The abuse is emotional in every event and has an enormous emotionally traumatic, even dissociative, effect on the victims. What this man sees as not taking the situation seriously, we call dissociating because it is the best they can do. See comment below from a victim. The problem is that, in Court or in the legal context, crying etc is, to be blunt, going to irritate the judge and other lawyers and become more hostile toward the testifying victim. The best ones are so lost in a hardened shell in which they have had to live, mostly for their children's sakes. The moment they crack, not in Court or while being deposed, they can begin to feel again and heal.",Tara Walsh-Arpaia,0,2021-05-02T01:52:49Z

The scratching the shoulder, and arm is a tell tale sign.
Which is also the shaking of the head but responding the opposite.
The lack of emotion in her face and swaying of her head, also a sign.
The looking around and ""subtle eye roll"" is because she's not in control, she's an alpha control freaks being cornered.
The head on the hand is not boredom, it's nodding and sleepiness.
Like ""you guys are killing my buzz""
The eating is her way of being in control, she will be rude and talk to you with her mouth full, or make you wait for an answer.
Her lawyers know she's high and rambling, that's why they kept objecting, they didn't want her to say a yes or no answer, they wanted her to explain that yes she did hit him and that it was self defense for her sister.
Which was a lie, and her ""awareness"" and angry defensiveness kicked in high gear trying to build up a hugely fabricated story.
Her lawyers have certainly coached her.
As for him.
His half smile and light laughter is something he has always done when telling personal information that he's uncomfortable with.
He was an enabler to her abuse.
And he knows it.
 And he's embarrassed about it, and you can see it in his responses.
Trying to make light of it instead of looking like a ""battered husband"" which I'm sure is embarrassing for any man.
But moreso to a man who is in the public eye, and who has worked so hard and built this sexy steamy persona with the ladies 
(although he is very shy and modest in reality and was never his intent).
But it sells, it pays the bills.
She is an alpha, a huge, huge, aggressive alpha.
And he is very timid, almost shy.
It's like she told him what to say as when he talks at the end, he is looking in her direction but at the ground out of the corner of his eye to see her body language.
He even says that they were discussing a trip, and at the very end, he even has his head down and asks her ""right?""

2517,Ugw3uaxWSVStk-v1nYl4AaABAg,"I've been conflicted on this since allegations first came out. I'm not particularly attached to either of these celebrities. I try to just look at it like two random people.
The awkward nod/saying ""no"" at the beginning didn't seem suspect to me, because she was answered two questions at once ""Do you understand?"" (yes) and ""Did you abuse Depp?"" (no). I think she nodded to indicate she understood, then said ""no"" outloud. Awkward, but not suspicious. I also believe if Heard had been cool and collected, people would have still make the same accusations against her. I don't think it's outside the spectrum of possibility that she's tired and fatigued and nervous all at once, and that translates in her deposition. 

I watched this video because I'm open to all possibilities here. I found your channel from the Demi ""sorry not sorry"" apology video, and was impressed by your objective approach. I didn't find that same approach from you this time. For example, you ask why isn't she more interested in the beginning on the video. Later, when she IS emotional, you say ""interesting"" but still no.
Also, her lawyer was definitely edgy. That raised more flags for me than Heard's actual behavior. I know that being under the influence can make someone a different person, which could have happened with Depp. Unfortunately, I'm still undecided on this one. I think probably both people acted deplorably, but I'll never be sure.

Little Richard is a ""Crucial Detail"".  Are you actually reading the body language of someone who has been drinking??? Isn't she taller than him? Johnny's height 5'10"" Amber 5' 7' ish high heels which are dressy and she is almost certainly wearing can add up to 3 inches, he might quite literally be looking up at her. His posture is consistent with being depressed or being drunk, or both. She might be irritated he is blasted off his ass.  I know my ex used to get piisssssed when I drank.  Actually, she seemed to get pissed anytime I was happy and she wasn't, then again she would get pissed at me when we both drank, not that we did that often.

2557,Ugx9hJ-SvMPMROGT5YJ4AaABAg,"I don't know that quick answers with food in someone's mouth is a good indicator, a short answer yes, no, three or four words, I think it is somewhat common to clear your mouth for longer more complex answers. That complexity may indicate avoidance. When she says she was trying to escape she uses very laboredly dispassionate language and shakes her head, which seems more consistent with not believing what she is saying.. So the problem you have is in martial arts, they teach you to engage long enough for your escape, the state of Minnesota has a duty to withdraw, and military training teaches rules of engagement. Meaning if she has had martial arts training, was in the military, or knows the law, that story would become far more believable. I was in a physical altercation, where the exit was locked in a subway, I was forced to engage, I warned the other party, three times, then proceeded to defend my self with force after being struck by a mop, I engaged long enough to subdue the threats, and then stopped, when the police came the witnesses behind the counter relayed the story and it matched mine, the other party was arrested. If she had training like this several times in her life, it would seem like a dumb question. Especially, if you knew the law, had martial arts training and were in the military, you would think that is common knowledge. Someone's disinterest in a situation may come from assholes asking over and over again, you do get tired of it, the defensive gestures might be from trying to ward of a lawyer that just became a threat, the smile might indicate she knew what the lawyer was doing, thus showing she was a threat.

You mock her, it seems you have a bias against her here, the not answering the question after being asked three times, you here all the lawyers start to pipe up, she appears to be waiting for her lawyer to tell her to speak. So the answer was yes, she seems passionate, I think she might be telling the truth here. Johnny smirks, during his pause, that is pretty clear. 

Your statement is absolutely incorrect you couldn't be further from the truth, you should study people with very good memories, I can tell you the event in the subway, I can tell you where each person was standing, I can tell you where the mop bucket was, where my friend was standing. I can tell you the time, where the person behind the counter was, where the squad cars parked.. 
When I was arrested I can tell you where in the house I walked tell you I went to the gas station, so many details, I can tell you the color of the carpet, where the couches were, I can tell you if the curtains were closed in which rooms, what color the paint was on the walls, where each person was standing, I can tell you that the coffee table had a maroon stain top and black legs, the lamp on the table was black and gold base. There was a tower lamp by the switches by the door, the dimmer had lost its nob, and one of the switches was removed, There were scone lights on the way to the basement, there was a lion photo on the wall going down to the basement. in the living room, there was a Thomas Kincade tapestry, with my ex's degrees in frames on the wall, there were long mirrors on the dining room wall. I remember all of this, in vivid detail because my ex and I picked out all those colors, painted those walls, and I resurfaced the coffee table, hung the tapestry, laid the carpet, with some help on the carpet stretching, but I did a majority of the work and carried in those hundred lb rolls of carpet. I remember what was said, where people were,...  It made me a little angry to hear that. So when people question your ability to remember I would say some people prove it be describing details all parties know existed and can be proven with purchase records, IE there are purchases on my credit cards and my ex credit cards proving she bought the paint at home depot, conclusive, rock-solid evidence. Also, they might add details because they know the tactics the other side might use, like saying they did all the work when the reality is, they both did some, though the one that was home more likely did more to maintain it. I remodeled the basement mostly by myself with exception of the cleanup and hanging drywall where I need help with the ceiling. This is an important detail because it would directly refute claims that I was parasitic as I was maintaining the home WHILE working, and doing the cooking on the weekends by making salads, soups, and sandwiches, though we implemented a rule after I got tired of doing it alone where the family had to help prepare the weeks meals with me. That is important in case someone says I took all the credit, I vacuumed the entire basement by hand with a shop vac that is important in case someone says I didn't do housekeeping, I did all the carpet cleaning.  Just because you don't understand the relevance of certain pieces of information does not mean it isn't important to the overall picture. What it demonstrates is your lack of understanding of the law and how people discredit one another in relationship battles.  Statements like he was never around refuted by the fact that I could work remotely and was available, Statements that I never wanted to do anything fun, refuted by the camping and boating trips that SHE enjoyed. what utter garbage.",Louis S,0,2021-04-27T10:49:25Z

So yes, all of his analysist are true. And i learned that myself too, when im about to speak a lie or lying about something, first is the story. The make up story obviously never happened. So in order to make it believeable you need time to think about it, and you cant simply prepare a whole story becuz you cant predict what the question would be (ofc depend on the situation like if you just watching a victoria secret as a kid or commit murder as an adult)
2. You will often make weird gesture, which later i found that might not be the clue to find out whos the liar, but the eyes are special, a bad liar will try to dodge the question and look for ""clue"" around them, a clock to make up for time, a person to make up for witness, anything that can add up  to the story they are fabricating, someone say a good liar are the people who can lie while looking straight to the opposite person, which can be true sometime, but that will often come with an unusual confident or a non consistent behaviour which we can see in the clip when AH talking about her interupting JD from pushing the babysister, up until that point she was a different person",Koba Raika,0,2021-04-22T14:43:53Z

People mistake it for evidence, when it's nothing more than an unreliable indication that requires actual investigation to unearth actual evidence.



Body language analysis is the posterchild of the soft sciences. It's based on an individual's interpretation of deeply personal behaviors that, more often than not, have completely contradictory definitions. A smile can indicate actual happiness, or it can be a manifestation of extreme discomfort. 



Body language defies standardized application because a person's behavior, due to circumstances/upbringing, can be completely unique to them. In which case it's like trying to understand Chinese by using a Spanish dictionary: there might be a word in Chinese that's also a word in Spanish, but obviously they won't have the same meaning. Establishing a ""base line"" by watching a couple of videos for reference, is the equivalent of trying to learn Chinese in a couple of minutes.

I was cringing while seeing it. She's nervous and is sending many mixed signals. One moment she looks sad, next she looks like 'I don't give a f*'.

2703,UgzQlPIoc3l7fOkJYXB4AaABAg,"My trick for remembering vs faking is to look at the hands while the narration happens. For an invented story, the sense I get is distinctly one like a director setting up a shot. It is hard to describe, but instant recognition when you see it. There are more ""revised"" hand movements like you place something here, then another thing there, then you move them a bit so they fit better.... not exact description. When remembering, gestures are often less and rarely revised/moved when setting up the scene, because all the pointing happens to the remembered location of things. Maybe it could be ""tricked"" with a physical rehearsal of the claimed event before having to describe to have remembered locations for the hands to gesture at in the scene, but I don't think very many do that. Most times, you look at the hands, and you see a director telling the crew how the shot is set up and go ""not what happened, is it?"" Also the body movements are more ""real"" - for lack of a better descriptor. Like most people remembering going through a door placed behind them will turn around as though reaching for a handle rather than over their shoulder - which would not be how they actually approached the door.",Vidyut Gore,1,2021-04-19T05:16:00Z

It is a substantial literature. Vrij's (2008) seminal book included more than 1,000 references to the research literature and the recent review by Vrij et al. (2019) identified 206 scientific papers published in 2016 alone. Thus, any reliable non-verbal cues to lies and deceit ought to have been identified by now, anno 2020. However, the conclusions drawn by DePaulo et al. (2003), who analyzed 116 studies more than 15 years ago, still appear to be valid. They concluded that ‚Äúthe looks and sounds of deceit are faint,‚Äù and the recent review by Vrij et al. (2019) seconded this: ‚Äú‚Ä¶the non-verbal cues to deceit discovered to date are faint and unreliable and ‚Ä¶ people are mediocre lie catchers when they pay attention to behavior.‚Äù In other words, no reliable non-verbal cues to deception have to-date been identified.

2811,UgxKTUyK3qzfAjbzSzZ4AaABAg,"I think it‚Äôs normal that she stumbled on the questioning about her committing domestic abuse. If she was defending herself she likely would have committed domestic abuse but admitting that only serves to minimise the abuse she suffered (which is why his lawyer asked this line of questioning to begin with). Also her not pausing when she had her mouth full and then pausing later when she had her mouth full is completely immaterial. In the latter, she had a noticeably larger quantity of food in her mouth. Not one piece of body language identified in this video constitutes grounds for establishing her guilt/innocence. Johnny Depp lost a defamation (libel) case. The only defence to defamation is truth. The fact that he lost, I‚Äôll be it on the balance of probabilities, is actually telling that Amber is being truthful. It‚Äôs certainly more telling than a body language reading. This feels like a biased (potentially misogynistic) character assassination based on pseudoscience which is why this type of evidence isn‚Äôt weighted heavily in court, if it‚Äôs even deemed admissible at all.",Sarah,0,2021-04-09T20:19:14Z

I just want to say for the people in the comments section that part of the struggle domestic violence victims face is the expectation that if you aren't an absolute angel then you aren't a victim. The truth is, domestic violence is messy. The truth is, you don't know how you are going to react until you feel trapped and your adrenaline in making you sick to your stomach. I tried so hard to do the right thing, to do the least harm, to walk away, and sometimes run away. But I couldn't, always. And despite how often I tried to do the right thing, the least harmful thing, despite how much I tried to get him on the same page and recognize that this was not safe or healthy and needed to change, in the end he didn't care about me enough to stop. In the end, I lost almost everything. It has taken years to rebuild. 

Men can absolutely be victims of domestic violence, and they deserve support and help when they are. However, it doesn't look the same as when women are victims of domestic violence, it plays out differently because of the role society plays, so we can't expect them to look the same. Also, male perpetrators of domestic violence ALWAYS say, ""she was abusive too."" They believe it; the problem is they equate you drawing boundaries and expressing your negative emotions in a direct way to them hitting you, destroying your things, hurting your pets and loved ones, etc... Idk what is going on with these two people. I know that people who experience trauma can't always walk you through what happened with perfect clarity, because your brain wants to protect you from that. 

I am not really commenting on the video, but about domestic violence in general, because knowledge is power. Sorry for the essay.

2860,UgzpfrgSw2FLl8jxHYB4AaABAg,"Something that occurred to me as I‚Äôve watched all of this unfold was the jewelry JD wears, specifically his rings; if he physically assaulted her to the extent that she claims, wouldn‚Äôt there be some evidence of that on his rings in one form or another? Blood in particular, as skin cells or touch/trace DNA does not prove anything. Even if he had them cleaned thoroughly, especially multiple times, bleach is very corrosive and damaging to silver & particularly gold, so there would likely be evidence of that too. Cleaned or not cleaned, I would imagine if he truly assaulted her as violently & frequently as she claims, there would likely still be trace blood evidence in the nooks and crannies of those rings. 

I dunno, food for thought I suppose. She provided elaborate, detailed accounts of his ‚Äòviolence‚Äô. If I had his resources, I‚Äôd have hired a forensic team to check for her blood everywhere & anywhere she alleged where all of this had taken place. 

It‚Äôs such a shame that the most obvious of details do not appear to be enough to instill serious doubt in both the courts of law & ‚Äòpublic opinion‚Äô. Aside from the fact that abusive people always have some history of it in some form or another, the behavior of AH‚Äôs parents alone speaks volumes. Although at some point there were text messages that came to light about AH texting her mother about JD being violent towards her & not wanting to tell her father (before or after their divorce, I can‚Äôt remember). You‚Äôd think that the parents of an alleged victim in fear for their life due to a man‚Äôs ‚Äònever ending violence‚Äô would be infuriated, upset, confrontational, etc. and *not* pleading with him to forgive _her_ because it was the lawyers‚Äô idea to create such allegations in order to avoid eviction from his home. The same ‚Äòvictim‚Äô who is *so* afraid of her husband bringing different men into his penthouse at late hours while he is out of town. Even *if* the recorded conversations are out of context, there are still so many other telling details like AH‚Äôs history of physical assault with her ex wife on the record, including allegedly against her own sister (the same grown up ‚Äòbaby sister‚Äô she unnecessarily went on that tangent about so desperately & vehemently needing to protect from JD during the UK libel trial while avoiding a direct question), testimony from her former assistant, the ordeal with the $7 million dollar (lack of) donation, the video(s) AH released where she clearly is attempting to instigate a nasty fight caught on tape, and so on. 

I am frustrated just by following this case, so I can‚Äôt begin to fathom how JD feels. The man is no saint, and I do not doubt for a moment that he has made some poor decisions in the heat of the moment fighting with AH, but not for a moment do these allegations scream chronically, violently abusive husband...",Miss Nearwater,1,2021-04-06T06:58:55Z

2920,UgyCsPxMJBKaMVOgl-l4AaABAg,"What I see is the exact opposite. Johnny Depp has a much bigger, giant fanbase. Of course, he would twist the story and get away with this in the end, even if it took a couple years... What I see is a woman under an enormous amount of pressure, trying to figure out a way to disassociate with this mess.
About that one phone call recording, I believe it only exposes a small part of the truth... Maybe they had a sadomasochistic relationship and she came to the point that she understood that's not she wanted anymore. And Johnny is using their previous SM experiences against her.  That phone call can be about it too.
I mean... I have been in an abusive relationship and trust me, there are times you get fed up being the victim and you lash back.
I am not a fan of Amber Heard, I only saw her in Aquaman and I was fine with her acting. But to me, all this hate towards her feels obnoxious to me. Maybe Johnny bought her lawyer too, who knows? It is all about how you prefer to perceive things... She may be a diva (that's what I gathered from other people's comments) but being a diva and being a predator are totally different things. Despite how much I used to love Johnny Depp, I wouldn't vouch for him or anyone, even my relatives or friends. Because we may never know what kind of monsters are lurking among us under disguise. I'd rather avoid taking sides in this kind of situation. Even ""proven"" guilty, it may be a twisted version of the reality...
Just like how it was with my ex. Nobody, none of his friends would believe me when I told them what he has been doing to me because he was all sweet and cutesy around other people, he was showing his true face when we were alone.",EugeneArgus,1,2021-04-01T22:42:07Z

Obviously I don't him personally, but from these clips and the things I do know about him, it is absolutely REVOLTING that one of the rare good men in this world was abused by this borderline sociopathic woman who almost took everything away from him, everything he had worked so hard for.

I think he probably did hit her - in fact he admitted to doing so in one of the recordings he released. I think they both assaulted each other, because there are some people that set you off in ways that nobody in your life ever has and when you've had your first physical altercation with heavy drinking involved, that becomes the first of many. Each one after becomes worse, and both become more physically involved.
What bothers me is that you were harder to watch than either one of them. You have no idea what happened, yet you're depicting one as the sole victim and one as the sole abuser. Much of your analysis was based on ridiculous circumstances, like when he was looking up to her, and she back at him - well yeah - she was standing behind him and slightly to the side, and he's shorter than she is.  It's not that deep. Amber isn't innocent, she's abusive and toxic - but in this specific relationship - so was he. They are toxic together.

I'm glad he had made such an impact on so many lives to give him the support to find truth. It's almost been 10 years for me since I had everything taken away and was pinned as a violent monster.

Like she's twitchy because she's ""traumatized"". I can't say I know what happens to everyone who is abused, because I honestly don't. Different people show different body language. However, I do know one instance dealing with abuse. My cousins are abused by their ""dad"", and they react in different ways. Two of them are more shut off about it. They mumble when they talk about him, or don't talk at all. My other cousin, who has a more fiery temper, gets very passionate. She tends to get very angry, and rants about him. She also barley moves unless she's working as she talks. Amber is way too relaxed to be ""abused"". From what I've seen, people who deal with abuse are very tense. Some prefer to disappear from the conversation, while others try to control their emotions when being questioned. Amber's shoulders are kind of slouched, while she's making all these hand movements. She's making up a story, and she's moving to make it seem more legit. Like hoe she describes hitting, and raises her hand as she does. There's also her eyes. Even through the fuzziness of the camera, I can tell her eyes are dead. Normally abuse victims eyes are filled with repressed emotion. Not Amber. Her eyes are cold and almost defensive. She doesn't want to be caught. Like I said, I can't speak for every abuse case, but I have seen what it can do to some people. Heck, I myself have grown in a bad household, but that doesn't mean everyone is going to react the same. Please, if you are being abused tell a professional, or a trusted adult. Don't hold it it.

She accused Johnny of domestic abuse, yes?
They're there to discuss domestic abuse, yes?
They why the hell does her lawyer keep objecting TO questions about domestic abuse?
I mean, I only studied law for 4 years, but I'm pretty sure you can't say ""this is irrelevant"" to a relevant question
EDIT: Never have I ever heard not just the ""victim"" but her fucking lawyer complain about people... whispering? I- 
Also the way she narrowed her eyes and smiled condescendingly after pointing at the other side and saying ""no, I was talking about them."" seems like, evil to me. I don't know how to explain it. It's what you'd see from the narcisisstic school queen in a movie. Definitely not how a victim would act
EDIT: (again because her laywer - I'm guessing - is seriously boggling) If given a yes or no question, obviously if it is relevant to the matter, the person asked should answer yes or no. Not only is it logical and moral, but also it is important proof. Dodging the question will only play against you. They wanted a clear statement they could use, whether in your favour or not. What is he talking about, ""answer the question however you would like"" and her saying ""thank you"" in that appreciative way, as if he saved her life? Jesus fuck

3214,UgyJbO_iDd5hkDtORl14AaABAg,"My initial thought especially during the 2nd vid with amber answering Q & A 
Her eyes are slightly drooped, skin looked flushed (possibly due to lighting), above average eye movements, and the locking of the lips could be due to being under the influence of a psychoactive substance of some sort. Her reaction time is much slower as well. As a damn good liar/manipulator myself; not as much as in the past, and as a user of various substance as well as being on psych meds I feel as though this definitely could be plausible. Though w/o being present one would not know for certain. 
Social behaviors, linguistic terms, psyche, past criminal behavior, 1st person testimonies regarding her character; including past/current drug abuse and misuse including increased probability of the misuse and abuse of drugs due to such a stressful situation makes me conclude she's guilty. 
Plus if she was sober and smart, she should have anticipated any and all potential questions that are to be asked in such a case, therefore allowing you the time to rehearse and recite your answers in a manor one would do when preparing for a job interview....aka...utilizing mock interviews

3283,UgyxWZQVwucWHPWb6mJ4AaABAg,"When I saw this video, I had flashbacks of my own life. I am a man and I experienced that nothing I said was believed. There are psychological reports about me that are as far from the truth as one can hardly imagine. I testified against the mother of our son and I was ""crucified"" for it. I didn't make up any of the bad things the mother did and out of shame I didn't tell everything from the beginning. It's been the toughest 10 years of my life and the story isn't over yet. At some point I even brought solid evidence. For this I had to make recordings. They had not been ""officially"" analyzed to this day (and they don`t will), but I have been charged with making such recordings and this ""criminal"" act has finally been included in the reports on me. I want and always wanted to protect my child from violent - especially emotional - abuse. I am reporting here because, on the one hand, I have experienced how a man is doing, whose ex-wife is believed every lie by official authorities, but everything I tell is interpreted as a lie. (And I have witnesses! ... but nobody asks them!) At the same time I have experienced that the psychological analysis of a survey is or can be completely irrational. When you are asked things over and over again, sometimes in front of your opponent in court, and you keep hearing his lies, about things that were sometimes years ago, about which you are ashamed to mention them, you are repeatedly confronted with disbelief and accusations and with interpretations of why you say something or the things you say are always put into perspective, etc. The result is that you no longer act rationally in such a survey, everything is emotionally overlaid in many layers. It's not like being asked directly about a situation, the matter is highly dynamic and complex. (I could scream out of a second just by thinking of it. This all got traumatic to me.) All of this creates exactly the symtomatics that one displays when one lies.

Had to write again, this is an edit, i figured it out... She's obviously a liar, but i noticed what makes her such a bad liar, it's around the part she's explaining she was ""defending her sister from fatal injury""... I realized, she's never been a good person for one second of her life, and has nothing to draw from to even put a front of virtue... She is so vile and rotten, that her ego is annoyed by the notion that she would even have to lie to defend herself, like she is above all of this, and none of it should be happening at all...

Most of my stable exgfs have hit me... They'd lose their temper, i wouldnt, that would upset them, so i'd try to bail, which would prompt their physical violence towards me, and they would only stop when i was finally out, or their hands would hurt after hitting me so much while i just stood there apatheticly deadpanning.

3313,Ugzu4Qn60qA4YoIMY_h4AaABAg,"So about that smile. the moment I saw him smirking I connected his gesture to the gestures I always make. 

When I was younger my Russian language arts instructor would yell and embarrass me in class. I was an irresponsible student and Russian education is very strict so it was justifiable. anyways, I would smile in return. as if her yelling had no effect on me. it was a way of both making her look like she's crazy and holding back my tears. well, actually, I can't really explain why I uncontrollably smile when being verbally attacked by someone or when I'm in a ridiculous situation. Johnny was in a ridiculous situation. He would've thought that he was obviously the victim but the world seemed to think differently. it was hilarious. but not in a funny way.

I don't think anything I just said made sense but I can safely say that his smile was not something to hold against him. It could be that this smile is an INFP thing or just me and Johnny in particular. Can anyone else relate? I'm curious.",arisu kuroruwa,2,2021-03-16T01:03:21Z

Then Johnny's smile/smirk is when he's looking down at his finger (he was flexing it back and forth a bit), maybe shame/embarrassment from the toxic masculinity/idea that men ""can't be abused"" and maybe because ""little Richard"" (which is a joke to lighten the mood) 

Then in the Japan clip he's asked a question and says ""the only problem I have is that I have no time (to come back to Japan)"" while his eyes go between her and back to the ground which feels like he's unconsciously saying she's the problem.

3336,Ugz2QRN9JwT98ahx9gt4AaABAg,"Sorry Observe, don't mean to jump your train, but I think I'm good at this too. Let's see. I'm pausing and giving my read before I hear yours: When she stalls in her speech, watch her eyes... she is looking for answers, ""her"" truth even over small stuff. It appears she's looking around the room. She is not. She is literally looking around her mind. A consummate liar can't stop and always fear triggering an avalanche of truths. In a liars mind, if I can't remember it, it's time to lie again.

When we move to her deposition, at around 5:30, she says no, head shakes yes. She does look around a lot. She is looking for several things, an escape, an excuse to end this, a lifeline of any sort, a friend, an out... and always her truth. The lick thing, is two-fold, she's being intentionally rude, F you, and arrogant, notice how pronounced it is. Combine it with the unblinking stare at the interviewer, and you know its target! First it's no to domestic violence, then it's yes. I defended myself. It bothers me I can't see her hands and legs. They are great tellers! First, don't look at what she's doing and saying once we hit ""DOORMAT,"" look at what she's not doing!!! Absolutely no emotion, totally devoid of expression. We're exploring her claims of human misery and abuses, and she's nowhere in the room. She's gone. These are indicators: one, she's not even in the room, and there is no truth to her words. Reaching across to her shoulder is a blocking gesture, but it's also an attempt to solicit sympathy, by suggesting a past violence. How do I know this? She immediately looks to her attorney, why am I paying you!!! Help me! The eyebrows go up. Aren't you going to help? Damn I need to see those hands. Hands tell a LOT!!! The isn't it true, question: she stretches her lips in a suggested smile that never surfaces. It's there though. Head tilt is a challenging gesture, get this over with bitch! Easy. The eyes tell its meaning. The immediacy of the head snap to her attorney shows I was right. Finally, dumb ass, you're gonna help me now! Wrinkle forehead, face goes sad. She's about to say something intended to be disarming. Many times, no not many times, hmmm, what was my lie again, I forget!!! Observe and I def saw that the same! I read more but he could have too. Okay. He hit me for a very longtime before I ever um, I'm lost. First it's a lie. No doubt! How do I know. It makes no sense and it's already in conflict with her, I'm not a doormat sentiment. Move to strike, followed by listen to this, would you, is intended to make Amber reel, and is setting her up for a solid punch. Hit, ""play."" Observe asked why is she eating? She's eating to busy her mouth in case what she is about to hear is so damning she can gather up a lie. Observe, this is woman who already realizes she has lost. This is all damage control. You totally missed the ball on this section IMO. Lol, now you finally pick up on the emotionless relation. No need to pick up on the abuser thing. That's a given. We already know that. That's why we're here! Look at that penetrating stare at the ground. She may be passionless, but that, my friends, is shame and admission of guilt. She answered while eating. A question with no risk. Now, I want to see off to her left. I know her lawyer is there, but there is something she's finding a measure of comfort from too? What? Don't know, but it lifts her head. She's thinking, I got this. Lol, I um, I was trying to escape is what she is trying to do... funny admission, especially staccato and pronounced!!! Believe me! This is truth. LIE!!! As she continues with her account she drags, she pulling at lies cartwheeling through her head, that good say that, nope, yep say that, etc. Liar. Suddenly she is acting out the actions of the story with her HANDS: is this isn't true, how can I be demonstrating what happened. Please believe me once. PLEASE. Okay, isn't it true, head goes down immediately, I am not going to be believed F! She for that instant wants to cry. Disagree on the push and tested. Amber is on the verge of wanting to tell the truth here, she's tired of the lies. The right series of questions right there would bring it out. A truth came out, amazing. Then came the into the room gesture right back to the lies, that truth scared her. BOO. If you're ""blocking"" a door as stated, he can't push the door into her. He can try, but her proximity to it, means that can't work. Were Johnny Lou Ferigno maybe, but Amber in my opinion is stronger than Johnny physically and emotionally. She can't be broken, because she just doesn't care anymore. She is buried in lies. I am quitting at the 13 minute mark. She's too easy.

Anytime anyone, anyone, ever tells you ""it's true,"" or words to that effect, 90% of the time it's a lie. Truth tellers never think to say that. Because they are telling the truth. That's why.

No worries Observe. I actually find this boring.

Okay. I have to step back in for a second, 20:07, alright, we started this story in a room by a couch, when security enters. But no, we're not in a room, doesn't fit my story, we end up on a stair's landing, but no, no (not dangerous enough yet) now Johnny magically appears somehow at the top of the stairs behind sister and is actually handling her threateningly. We were on top of the Empire State building, yeah, that's it!!! Now Amber too magically appears at stair top too, in a rage blackout supposedly, but the story still comes. She's blackout with rage but not so blacked out she can't assert with authority what was happening... hmmm? lmfao. Amber, please stop lying, would be what I would say.

Nope. Johnny now: his hemming and hawing is different. There's emotion, and shame. He doesn't want to be here either, but for an entirely different reason. He's embarrassed and doesn't want to say what he has to, he's so done with all this. Observe, you missed the base on Johnny's smile, because it's not a smile. It was only one side of his mouth. Do that. Does that feel like a smile? When would you do that? That's right. He's frustrated and exasperated, he's said this too many times already, and I'm about to say something again, but not because I want to, but because you're making me! Don't you own a pen? My truth isn't changing in other words, so write this shit down, please. On the red carpet, he looks like he's just had the crap beaten out of him. He's defeated. He lies about wanting to go out to the country with his girl (graciousness to the Japanese people), his body language is the truth, she's poison to him. Even looking her in the eye makes him sick to his stomach at this point.

You see it everywhere, in interviews, in paparazzi videos, even in his movies.  I have always thought of it as him being uncomfortable with all the fame he has.  I don't think he thinks he deserves as much admiration as he gets.  He stayed calm during his deposition because he had nothing to hide.

3445,UgzbbwZ52EKcY9hbfXB4AaABAg,"Sorry but if you're supposed to be an expert, how is it difficult to see that she is trying to answer ""yes I understand the question"" (nodding) and then said ""no"" as the answer to the question. She's answering 2 questions at once, ""Do you understand"" and ""did you commit domestic violence"". She even tries to clarify. Why would you act like she's answering one question and just randomly nodding yes but saying no? People are really going to overlook that? It was very obvious she was nodding yes I understand and verbally saying no I did not.

I highly doubt she was casually snacking as you said, she looks uncomfortable and someone probably told her to use that tactic to buy time because she has a habit of blurting out things she thinks and feels. Maybe her lawyer told her to do it but it does not come across as carefree. Sorry but if you genuinely believe what you're saying and not just pandering to simpletons, you're not very insightful. 

I'm not even defending her, they both admitted in audio to abusing each other. But people's simplistic views of her body language are way off. She's not communicating boredom, she appears fatigued, uncomfortable and you don't even know if she's on medication etc. Being fed up and burned out does not equal boredom. Even if he was never abusive in any way and she was completely lying, someone's not going to feel BORED. They'll feel frustrated and overwhelmed which leads to fatigued body language. 

Whispering is completely distracting and anyome would feel attacked in this situation as you have people trying to invalidate and manipulate what you're saying. It's conflict between numerous people in the room, it's continuous arguing and normal for people to smile, roll their eyes and act completely fed up just as you would if you were arguing with a partner and feeling like it was going nowhere or like the other party has no interest in finding real truth or solution. 

I think plenty of what she says is true, but I think they were both abusive towards each other due to their own admissions. I'm not sure what Ambers case is exactly, but even if she did hit him at some stage, that doesn't necessarily mean she has no case as it could have been self defence or retaliation. But based on their own admissions, it seems neither of them were viewing throwing objects, smashing cupboards shut etc as violence, which it is violence in the home. There are a lot of semantics but it's quite clear they both were violent, as to who initiated things, we have no business commenting. 

The way you wear a suit and try to give a professional impression, state your views will be around 70% accurate, and that you can get a good view of the situation, then proceed to make whiny voices impersonating Amber, which is bullying... and you're doing this for attention without a care about how you are affecting people or perpetuating inaccurate views about victims... all for the sake of revenue and pumping your merch. Cutesy music at the end after you laughed and teased people in a case of domestic violence. I'd be ashamed of myself and view my revenue as dirty money quite frankly. Commenting on people's personal lives in such a childish and inappropriate way has just become standard entertainment for you and the sheep that buy into this type of sick entertainment. This type of content is nothing more than gossip with your own version of ""somewhere between pseudoscience"" thrown in. I'd be ashamed. I did one polite reaction video that was supportive of someone and even that made me feel like a sell out and I removed it. It's beyond me how anyone can feel comfortable making a living with this level of deterimental gossip. It's truly immoral.

When she gets aggressive talking about her sister, she's genuinely aggressive. I don't doubt Depp was attacked, she's clearly ashamed about the way the relationship was handled as a whole. She does indeed have control over him, obviously he left his family to marry her. His body language when they're together is riddled with doubt and internal conflict, she tries to get him to talk but smiles at the challenge of being shut out, I think she asked him if he wanted to leave the event and he decided against it.

You needn't the excuse or trickery of having your mouth full to take a pause before answering any question. A calculated answer in court is accepted just as fine as something off the cuff. There is nothing dishonest about taking your time to answer a question in any setting and in my opinion its a refined behavior. Im not saying she is very smart or refined, but there is nothing wrong with giving a calculated answer if and when one chooses to. TLDR.

Its definitely not a tactic to buy time, I doubt she is that incredibly attentive and obsessive. Shes more like someone who thinks shes above the hearing, not someone who would stoop to such minute details and tactics to play victim and gain every edge possible.

Johnny talks/behaves that way with the mouth quirk in a lot of interviews. Watch his interviews with ""in the actor's studio"". They brought out the worst in each other.

Johnny on the other hand is appearing to be just trying to lighten the subject and by giving his finger the nick name to make jokes about his trauma, which is actually a very common thing. Amber gets very defensive, Johnny stays calm. Amber looks like she doesn't want to be there, why would a self proclaimed victim who is accusing some one of domestic abuse not want to be there? Surely she would want to tell her story. Amber didn't seem to care, she smiled when asked about hitting Johnny, yeah Johnny smirked but that was when it came to his OWN abuse and trauma. Looking at these videos and listening to the phone calls and audio tapes, I am 100% on Johnny's side and he deserves so much better. #justiceforjohnnydepp",yes no,1,2021-03-07T21:34:16Z

People who have been through traumatic events, especially prolonged abuse (of any kind), when recalling them/having to retell them it's not all sobs and crying.

Even if you're not a Johnny Depp fan you should be mad at her. She's making the Me Too movement look like a joke because she's showing that women obviously lie. 

She needs to be canceled from Aquaman and from anything else... 

Please get started on canceling her right away. She's a bad selfish person who has no trouble ruining a good person's life for revenge or money.

3627,Ugx8qUf5nv7xLS6ZFyJ4AaABAg,"As a survivor of domestic violence, and have also done advocacy for abused women AND men. Im not buying what she's selling. And JUST to be clear,  IM NO SUPER FAN of Johnny Depp or Amber Heard. 

The way Depp recollects he seems to be more believable as tiny details aren't remembered by victims. Its major things and the result. So I'm going to say my vote is for Depp being the true ""victim"" . Hopefully, thev truth comes out. If it is found  she was the abuser, I hope something is done about it. As too many times women lie (men do lie as well but not as often) but those who lie make it very difficult for true victims.  Not only are they wasting time and valuable resources by lying, but when a true victim shows up that victim can feel as if they are being victimized again due to the line of questioning and scrutiny they have to endure. 

And before anyone goes crazy on me for NOT taking Amber Heards side.  With  stuff like ""how do you know how she would  react"" why should she act like a ""victim"" stuff like that.  I am a SURVIVOR  domestic violence.  I was once a victim. when I was questioned and when ba have sat by the side of many victims being questioned,  the ONLY time they will hesitate to answer a question  its due to FEAR that nothing will be done to their abuser. So they FEAR that their abuser hears about what they said. That that victim will end up getting more severely beat up or possibly killed. Or even worse in a victims eyes, that their abuser decides that whatever or whoever in the victims family or friend group the abuser has threatened harm to. That victim FEARS  their abuser will finally act on that threat. 

Hopefully this doesn't drag out in court however. As when that happens it is very difficult for the victim. Abusers find control and power by using the courts and lawyers to continue to abuse their victim.",Nunya D***-BIZ,0,2021-03-05T00:39:57Z

so that' why amber heard has that kind of body language. you don't even have to believe jungian personality types specifically. you can just think this way: she is not a feeler (except anger). don't you believe there are people like that? people who run away from negative feelings? exhaust those negative feelings via anger?

This is where it starts to get philosophical and a lot of people lose interest. Hold on for just one second for me and try to finish this comment out (:

When one person doesn't have DIRECT access to another persons mental state/qualia/experience, this doesn't mean you can't have some sense of access to those states to produce some hypothesis about what their behavior and body language are MEANING. 

Just like the English language, body language can also have meaning. We don't sit here and argue about whether or not one can really know what someone is thinking from what they're saying. WE ALL DO THAT ANYWAY! Even if Amber directly looked at the camera and said outright that she was lying, and all of this story between their marriage was fabricated on her part, this argument would stand against her claims. How can we really know that's what she's thinking?

Spoiler alert! We can't :) We can make educated guesses on what happened based on all the evidence we have, up to and including Amber Heard's body language. Thanks for reading!",PALEX XX,0,2021-03-03T23:26:45Z

How do they do it? First time asking entire story from start to finish. Second time they ask the ending of the story. Third time they mix up ending and beginning and the last time, they ask random questions about beginning, ending, middle part and come up with ""small"" lies as if they forgot, to make sure if the person says the right thing. I am sure Amber would have told 5 times the different story because majority of liars aren't able to keep their story correct. If someone is the REAL victim of the abuse, every tiny word and action gets stuck to their head due strong emotion. Brain remembers extreme shocks very well. Even rape victims can say the story the same 20 years later as if it happened yesterday. I am sure if they asked that from her, she would have gotten caught pretty quickly.

This can be seen in Johnny Depp in other videos where he is saying something potentially serious like ""I'm scared, I'm confused, I want to go home"", but he laughs about it. It's seen in this video where he's making light of his serious injury by calling his finger ""little Richard"". From what I've heard, Johnny Depp's mother was abusive and he most likely endured a lot of trauma.

Amber: **doesn‚Äôt answer**

reporter: ‚Äúdo you understand the question‚Äù (because Amber did not answer her)

Amber: **nods her head** saying yes; i do understand your question (and then says) ‚Äúno.‚Äù (saying no to the first question: did you commit domestic violence)

It is a reminder of all the joking descriptions he has made about the finger and he even made one in this video. ""this finger, which I now call it a Richard, laughs"". 

The first time he described his finger, the first interview I ever watched of him describing the finger, he made me laugh when describing it, I think it was on the Ellen show, but he very clearly to me uses humor to dampen a pretty serious situation. It is a finger and it can be pretty funny that it was a smashed up finger, I'm sure if it was his elbow or knee, he would not be joking or smirking

Choice of guys, goes for the richer guy; Elon Musk, after the movie-star??? 
Probably flirting before the relationship between Johnny and Amber was done... 
climbing the stair of cash are we??? hmm... 
No deep musician inbetween??? hmm... 

That care to ""eat"" while being asked lawsuit questions, is behavior which could partly be the reason why I left my 10 billions in DB, and agreed to let the bank lend for house loans in DK, instead of wallowing in cash and getting girlfriends...
Because I believe I've got more temper then Johnny, and I do not need a golddigger, whom unbelieveably suits her own case, and leaves the realition-ship as if Johnny never mattered, and gave her nothing good.

I'm not a bodylanguistic pro, but I do read body language, and Amber is honestly rude with the eating; delighting her way out of bad questions = gold-digging behavior.

Johnny had a carriere, a well established quantity of major parts in movies, and sues for 50 million. 
Amber counter sues for a 100 = Major gold digging carriere value assessment.
So Ambers carriere is twice the worth of Johnny's, according to Amber??? hmm...

I will not be the deep musician of the inbetween relationships for Amber, in case she switch tactics for credibility, to golddig...
 but my abandonment of my 10 billion in DB probably makes her uninterested anyways :P 
Date Amber = I think not, so no thanks, I don't want to be ruined, although I could be the richest man in the world, if only the west made organic energy, from my awareness about methode, and paid me for it, after only 1 year.

She's acting,  and she's not very good at it.  I've listened to audio previous to this,  and there are many times that Amber admits to being physical with him, and she twists things  that she says,  or that he says,  when clearly he's trying to rationalize with an irrational  person. 

I've been in toxic relationships,  I understand that there is a really screwed up dynamic when looking back at things,  but I never allowed anything to go so far as to physically hurt myself or my partner.  Emotionally,  yes,  all over the place.  Totally unhealthy.  In fact, sometimes during our worst fights we  actually became flirty with each other,  and started laughing or getting sexual. Again, it's not a healthy relationship, and while it's certainly an emotional  mind fuck, my relationship  was never physically  abusive.  (At least the one I'm referring to presently)
So I can understand that really fucked up dynamic, especially  when trying to recall things.

I‚Äôve already menchen this one earlier on a the Lisa lam video but was wondering if you‚Äôd do the KENEKA JENKINS video not sure if your aware of this case but trust me it is fascinating and very mysterious the other case is someone everyone knows AILEEN WORTHOS  which of course the conclusion came out in the very end after I believe her 3 rd interview years after her first few we definitely learned about her hustle on the system but if you look back to the beginning she was a master manipulator I‚Äôm pretty good at reading people but I also know how you sometimes gotta play the system to beat the system and she even had me convinced üôÅ I really believed some of what she said and the reason I think I did is because I think she had a masterful way of telling mainly the truth but mixing and adding lies in between that way it was easy to remember cause like they say it‚Äôs hard to remember a lie but it‚Äôs easy to remember the truth I honestly believe when she first started robbing men it was for the money and I also honestly believe she felt below men and eventually angered her to the point of murder I genuinely believe she was a kind loyal person but I also believe it was easy for her to care about some people and harder to care about others in other words she only had a handful of people that actually meant something to her and that‚Äôs how she kept it,liked it and how it stayed I don‚Äôt think she was a monster I think life was very unfair to her she got treated badly & people try and say you have choices and  you know right from wrong but when people are constantly mean and cruel to you over and over especially throughout your whole life it‚Äôs so easy to start and just hate people and not know your own worth anymore I think Aileen either loved you or hated you and no in between I don‚Äôt think she was evil I just think she made the wrong choices through life. Anyways hope you‚Äôll do the reading in both videos to see if you can pick up on deception cause she had me fooled about a lot it‚Äôs crazy cause some of the things I thought she was lying about she was actually telling the truth bout  & vice versa ü§® that said hope you do reacting video. Aside from it all there is one thing I üíØ believe and that is She really did love that girl Ty no doubt in my mindüòâ I know a how a woman‚Äôs eyes can light up when they see someone they love & her eyes lit up when she talked about her.

I'm having some trouble finding the right words that could best explain what I feel from her when I look at her and what I feel from her while listening to her.

3989,UgzJUrSE-cUOgrAZAyd4AaABAg,"If I may ask a question or 2 Sir (I don‚Äôt remember if you said your name in the video, haven‚Äôt seen your videos before) but are you ALSO a therapist that specializes in domestic violence?? Because if not, you don‚Äôt know what to look for in how somewhat acts or what mannerisms they use to express what they feel. I‚Äôll use myself as an example. I had to pull my teacher aside after parenting class and explain to her about my panic disorder. I was afraid she would notice my excessive fidgeting and taking notes and see it as being irritated, uninterested in being there, and or rude. I let her know, if I need a few minutes to collect myself and cannot in that moment speak to or express how I‚Äôm feeling in front of everyone, that I may silently excuse myself and I‚Äôm not trying to be disrespectful. When I am nervous or a certain situation hurts my heart, I fidget, I look around the room, I try my coping mechanisms, singing a soothing song in my head, taking notes actually helps me keep my attention not on the anxiety. I had to go to court many times and experienced severe anxiety and panic attacks a lot. Court can be very traumatic especially if they are labeling you as an abuser. I remember sitting in court next to my Mom waiting my turn and braiding my hair. Trying to keep my mind focused on anything, but the anxiety. Sometimes I couldn‚Äôt breathe, I had a full on melt down before I could even get to the court room and had to sit on the floor with my head between my knees, begging to leave. If it wasn‚Äôt for God and my Mother and Church family, I NEVER would have gotten through it. It‚Äôs not something I talk about as it retraumatizes me. But I just want to make sure that you‚Äôre really taking into account both of them and their mental health. I have selective mutism and don‚Äôt always speak to my fianc√©‚Äôs family, they usually speak to me first. The whole time I‚Äôm afraid they think I‚Äôm rude. Which is kinda what his parents thought originally, unfortunately. They treat me a lot kinder now that we are engaged. They just really hated us living together without being married. When I was with my abuser, there were times he was always so cool calm and collected. I had to face him in court, and I was excited but nervous. I wanted justice for myself, but I was so scared they‚Äôd believe his charming act. Surprisingly he seemed very standoffish and angry, arrogant and cocky. I for whatever reason thought he‚Äôd handle things a lot more collectedly. My lawyer was unbelievably kind. They let him get bailed out knowing he was a flight risk and he‚Äôs been on the run all this time. Years. I remember things in bits and pieces. I worry that since I can‚Äôt remember things in chronological order, I‚Äôll forget something super important and if I bring it up later, I‚Äôll be looked at as a liar. So I write things down in order as specifically as I can. I want to write a book, I want to help other women (and some men) but I also don‚Äôt want to retraumatize myself. I‚Äôm in a safe committed relationship now. From suicidal and stuck in an abusive relationship with a horrible man and his wretched family, to a kind, God loving man, who always holds me and speaks words of wisdom and encouragement to me. And his family has excepted me as one of their own finally and his sisters aren‚Äôt mean, they are exceptionally kind, inclusive and talented. I‚Äôm so blessed. But there are still people crying stuck in a dark place like I was and I want to help them find the light like I did. It is possible to find happiness, to find peace. If you have Stockholm Syndrome, it is possible to break those binds. It is possible to love someone who is good to you, and it is possible to find someone who truly loves you. And you deserve love. I don‚Äôt care who you are, what you‚Äôve done or what you‚Äôve said. You deserve love. I‚Äôm sorry for rambling. But I just want to make sure you‚Äôre being careful in case Amber is not the one who is the abuser, because you could re-traumatize her. No offense at all to Johnny but isn‚Äôt he a depressed alcoholic?? That could be why he looks at the ground and stumbles over his words a lot. Definitely not saying either of them are the abuser, I‚Äôm just saying it could go a lot deeper than this. Technically they could both be abusers.

The fact that her eyes are always roaming around the room, especially when she talks, gives the impression that she is looking around to see how people are reacting to her words so she can process and adjust her story accordingly.

Narcissists and sociopaths are both skilled at lying.
Only Amber Heard is a Narcissist plain and simple because she exhibits a lot, if not all of the signs of Narcissistic Personality Disorder.
For instance, she becomes impatient or angry when she doesn't receive special treatment.
Has reacted with rage or contempt and tried to belittle others to make herself appear superior.
Has taken advantage of others to get what she wants.
Exaggerates achievements and talents.
Has a sense of entitlement and requires constant, excessive admiration.
Expects special favors and unquestioning compliance with her expectations.
Has an inability or unwillingness to recognize the needs and feelings of others.
Behaves in an arrogant or haughty manner, coming across as conceited, boastful and pretentious.
Has significant interpersonal problems and easily feels slighted.

She cares for no one but herself and it's painfully obvious.

She and Joss Whedon should date.

She obviously looks to distance herself from him, like with one part of her telling that she is there for her husband and with the other part telling that she is sober and doesn't approve of his not being at his best, and is a little ashamed of him, not just a little bit haughty. He is aware of this distancing and kind of pleads for more solidarity, her giving a greater show of affection (""me and my girl have been talking"") - but despite of him talking with non-native English speakers, he speaks very unclearly, in a situation when one expects anybody to do their best to speak with very distinct pronunciation for better understanding. He speaks like one who is used to be drunk and pretend he isn't.
I don't know what to make out of their relationship. ""Not healthy"" is of course the least one can say. Why would a young girl marry a man who could be her father? Why would a mature man marry a little girl who could be his daughter? Where's the sanity in that? What miracles have they expected the other to perform for them, what curious needs to be fulfilled? What illusions have been crushed, causing deep hurt, envy, jealousy, hurt, enraged need of revenge? 
Perhaps they both started with an immense need to be adored and admired? And it turned out none of them could get enough to quench that craving.

We hesitate because our brains are constantly in fight or flight mode and it could have been that he hesitated expecting something bad to come out of speaking out because that usually happens, there's nothing but danger everywhere if we so much as give the wrong facial expression and that mentality can take from days to years to break out of. Nervous laughs and such are our way of covering up how terrified we really are because THEY are either in the room or on our minds. Again, this is just how I saw it and you can totally disagree since everyone is different in responses to that. In conclusion, it's mostly forcing on a mask because that's the norm for us in every stressful situation, this one is no different, and considering the people, it involves it's to be expected because it's around those people that we formed habits because of and/or for.

(Edit: I also see some double standard when it comes to Johnny‚Äôs stumbling and hesitation.. Also, usually when men lie they tend to be much more sustained, not looking around etc‚Ä¶ Honestly, his whole demeanour could be considered JUST as deceptive as Amber‚Äôs‚Ä¶
But people seem to not like defiant women who are willing to stand their ground..
As for the interview‚Ä¶.. Again, TOO much speculation, too much spinning of details that could have more to do with personality (rather than situation), too much leniency on ‚Äúquirks‚Äù that could otherwise even be considered signs of psychopathy - and that‚Äôs again by following YOUR logic)",Red CD,0,2021-02-22T16:18:11Z

4370,Ugzx4ljBPeIl-aPnB3Z4AaABAg,"I think the smirk from JD is what I usually do. When something makes me uncomfortable or a bad memory and instead of showing a more appropriate facial gesture I would smirk or smile because it comforts me a little. Like life isn't fair so smile and things will be a little better. It isnt an ideal response but I can't fully control it. I also smirk or smile when I recall an uncomfortable situation I know I do that to also comfort myself because when I recall it the situation already happened. When you survive a bad childhood you tend to learn certain coping mechanisms that help you deal with the obserdity of the world. The injustice and unfairness of how things plays out. You try to focus on the light of things so you can move forward instead of feeling the bad parts of things. And sometimes I smirk when I see how ironic the whole situation was... I helped someone but that person ended up hurting me... Then I recall how dumb I was allowing that person into my life and recalling red flags I ignored.
I don't know how many people do that but in psychology it is a neural coping mechanism",Niomie Shirleah Low,1,2021-02-21T08:42:21Z

So I‚Äôll say this abuse victims SPECIFICALLY WOMEN who are abused or talking about their abuse & have not yet gotten to that stage where they‚Äôve overcame it or have become stronger usually always look the same :
Hunched over or closed into themselves 
Crying or tearful the entire recount of what happened 
Quiet unless spoken to
Timid 
Keep their head down or avoid looking around
Jumpy 
Arms folded or holding hands together

this is just a general observation now I am aware everyone processes things differently & don‚Äôt have the same reactions BUT this is generally the reaction for female abuse victims . 
Amber seems to be none of these things in fact her entire demeanor gives of the vibe of ‚Äú ok I did it and ‚Äú she‚Äôs bored looks totally uninterested about what‚Äôs going but the reality is she‚Äôs supposed to be recounting her terrible abuse story yet all she seems to care about is stuffing her face . In between questions she‚Äôs bored / uninterested When asked about what she did to Johnny slight annoyance peeks through then throws out her ‚Äú fear ‚Äú then proceeds to flip it over to Johnny being the abuser & her fake crying then the stutters while trying to speak about what he did .",Chanteek Smith,1,2021-02-19T13:48:28Z

4559,Ugy98CeRB6g1ld4ZH-R4AaABAg,"@Observe ...Interessting. I'd like to say: as a person who has been abused myself, i understand the little smiley thing jhonny does when he tells his story. It is difficult to explain in few words...but it goes along the lines of:  remembering a situation like that and considering having stayed in an abusive relationship you had to always find some way, some reason to stay. So you keep telling yourself that it wasn't that bad and you might even ridicule the situation. Somehow you might even not believe it yourself that you at all stayed with that person allthough these bad things happened. If you fully admit it to yourself you might lose your mind. And keeping these things 'funny' in your mind is what actually helped you to survive it all. I found myself many times sort of laughing while telling my therapist about one or the other thing and actually only realized through the seriousnes of my oposit how bad it actually was what happened. Thing is, when you grow up being abused your mind choses ways to survive these situations. Unfortunately we tend to re-live over and over what we grew up with, unless we chose to change ourselfs which involves longterm work with your inner children and more. But it is possible! :)

I have been in a abusive relationship and whenever he would lie and make it look like I was lieing and he was the good guy he would say he was trying to restrain me because he thought I would hit him when the truth was he was beating me and I was curled up in a ball on the floor why would I need to be restrained while running for my life or curled up trying to not me to injured its what abusers do make it out as in there view that u are the aggressor and then they need to convince them selves they where the hero of someone else or protecting themselves to not feel guilt for what actually happened. and going into long stories to cover up the fact they did something wrong some times they will go so far as weeks or years before to justify their actions that happened on that event.

It's clear to me that a person with anger or hate will display it in body language just as an affection person will. Young children display body. I haven't checked but if the DMS-V doesnt carry a section on body language they have just taken away 60% or most of a psychologist accuracy in a diagnosis. Even FBI profilers use body language to determine someone's honesty. So how can we get this to be taken more seriously. Look at candid photos of any couple if their head lean together they are likely happy with each other. Look at siblings in a photo you know who dislike who.

At the end my dad divorced her and she got admitted to psychiatry. Leaving my dad alone with three little girls. Until this day she acts like she didn‚Äôt do anything wrong. 

Fortunately he met my stepmom who is the most wonderful woman on this planet who takes amazing care of him and my sister. But sadly my das got to see how is oldest daughter turned in his ex wife when she started to lie, and exhibit agressive behavior. She attacked my other sister multiple times. She attacked my father. 

I really recognize my mother and sister in amber. She‚Äôs the abuser, Johnny the victim. 

You can clearly see Johnny being very sweet and gentle towards her, my dad was too. Always comforting my mum when she was crying. You can see Johnny being uncomfortable talking about the abuse, my das never ever said a word about it. He only said: ‚Äú what your mother did wasn‚Äôt just bad, it‚Äôs ruining someone‚Äôs life.‚Äù 

Instead of my mom who constantly can‚Äôt stop talking about my das as if they never divorced, she‚Äôs not the victim, my dad is.

She is desperately trying to conceal her contempt and feeling of superiority over the people in the room and over Johny. Her mouth at a few times is about to stretch enough only to the one side,  it's sort of a half-smile that is the classic tell tell sign for contempt. She keeps trying to suppress that throughout the conversation and appear sullen and sad. The frantic eyes twitching and looking around, the hand supporting her head all are ways to dissipate her energy from feeling  arrogance and not being able to show it since she has to pretend she's a victim. Notice how she almost smiles at a few times like she thinks she got them like ""her lie is winning over"" this is what you expect to see from frequent liars being happy to be able to get away with it. Also the biggest tell is the forehead. No action there whatsoever. If you look at real victims of abuse or people feeling sadness or pain you'd see that thing wrinkle and twirl and the eyebrows getting close together - her - recalling what's supposed to be a beating - no action. I can say her anger is real about protecting her sister but then again we'd have to remember that is a situation she came up with and in an imaginary situation you can  imagine reacting to it and the reaction will be real even though the situation maybe made up. Unless there is prove that the thing with the stairs happened I doubt there is truth to it.

Overall, I think they are both a little immature, Depp is probably blind to people being manipulative at all. He seems so naive towards this.  If there weren't those millions that they both have we'd never hear of this since their divorce is like children splitting up they both seem more frustrated and trying to make the other look bad rather than actually being abusive towards one another.

I'd say she probably even married him for the money after the initial thrill of dating Johny Depp was over...",Moxie,0,2021-02-17T00:43:40Z

The eyes up and away as she checks her inner storyline numerous times  prior to answering  and the chin down and forward thrusting as she wants to assert what she want others to believe 11:20 same clip has wrinkled brow with tight eyebrows trying to convince fear but mixed with previous chin thrusting is false. 12:35 again sharp look up as she stumbles her narrative followed by a chin thrust to the side as if to say this is fact ignor my bad words. 12:45 rapid side to side eye movement reaffirming her own beliefs in the false narrative (lies to self). 13:27 slow head roll to side ""I'm giving full weight and consideration to your words"" with lowered eyebrow in response but stumbles closes eyes at 13:43 and hand on chin 13:45 accepts that her words didn't sound true 14:50 agree with you she gave up and didn't want to be there anymore. 15:10 smirks yeah she did that 15:15 trys to lawer speak showing disdain and a lack of respect for the process.

I am sad and you should be sad for me to. Interrupted by ""whispering"" fake narcissistic for not being the center of attention 17:25 answers no but then looks down and smiles then looks away in denial 17:40 thusts chin again to assert her words as facts 18:25 shakes head and looks away because they would not allow her to sidetrack the question 19:05 closing and opening mouth wants to say something but has already tried and failed than looks side to side saying ""I give up argue with my lawyer""  19:40 she is being honest she gives direct eye contact when saying she was protecting her sister even as she claims she doesn't know what she was doing 19:45 rapid eye flutter as she says the word fatal indicating she's lying she knows it wasn't fatal but trying to overdramatize it to justify her actions 20:00 direct eye contact feels absolutely Justified and would do it again. final verdict everything Amber said up to the end was fake she started the argument and escalated it to the point of violence. she was whooping on him and once he tryed to stand up for himself the sister stepped in to block him and that drove her (amber)  to further acts of violence.

Many of us end up being so confused, in real life, about what's true and what isn't - who has witnessed complete mess-ups within their own family, while everyone pretended that everything was allright? etc - that in the end, the way we function in society is a big reflection of this pattern as well. Politics are the best example, where lies areblatent, yet somehow we agree to pretend they're not lies.

Also we know drug addicts (Depp) can absolutely be violent. Drugs make you violent very often. Just read the stories of Lou Reed and various rockstars or common people which are drug addicts. Couldn't her body language be simply the result that she knows many don't believe her, she hates Depp and she's tremendously nervous? I mean, innocent or not imagine what that person is going through, it's tough, it would be tough even for an Oscar winning actress. Also, don't people prepare before talking in front of a judge? Also probably she took drugs and alcohol too and she might be confused and uncertain about the memories. I'm not saying I believe her! I'm saying I don't know who I should believe! And in the end it's not really up to us to determine who's the victim. Sometimes I feel people defend Depp just because it's part of their childhood, not because they really have proofs. In the end, we don't have any proofs, just speculations. In my opinion they could both be abusers and victims.

These phenomenon are then called disorders. These disorders are treated with varies different medications and treatments. Its rational to think that most people who exhibit phenomenons at this ooint are most likely bot being truthful and have in fact thought they had a certain phenomenon and now present woth indicators to a disorder. The point is...most people have to merely say they have a disorder and have never really had a disorder. Once a professional diagnosis the disorder the chances a person is going to actually develoo the disorder in time are high even though they had never reslly had a disorder they are exhibiting known markers bc they want to confirm that the way they feel is out of their control. It doesnt mean that these disorders do t exist, just at a much smaller rate. Almost all others are phenomenon exhibited from a persons varies experiences or lack thereof.

4949,UgwHcOmoA59_2QW-jKd4AaABAg,"Observing body language is an important part of communication and, as you stated, it isn't necessarily foolproof.  I really like that you are showing people how to do that.


Edit:  It's also interesting that when asked other questions, she looks around a lot and demonstrates reluctance to answer directly yet when she was asked who was on the audio recording, she gave direct eye contact and her following responses seemed rehearsed- note she looks left following her explanations of the event being asked about.  This is a good indication of deception in her body language.  It's the discomfort she exhibits is _somewhat_ commensurate with behavior of domestic violence survivors and sexual assault survivors.  In the latter instance, there is almost always a sense of shame combined with dread in the survivor's responses and body language.  She doesn't really exhibit those things plausibly.  Further, she seems to find the proceeding boring and just prior to her resting her face on her hand, her eye contact bordered on hostile.  At this point, for me, she's lost all credibility.  So did the lawyer by asserting that she could answer a yes or no question however she wanted.  That's a tactic used by lawyers to assuage guilt and deflect the question altogether.  Similarly, demands for yes or no questions aren't always followed by a demand for explanation and are often used to box someone in.  

Johnny exhibits the same kind of behavior survivors do when trying to recall something very painful or frightening to recall.  

I also completely agree with your conclusion regarding the dynamic of their relationship as demonstrated in the final clip.

She knows she‚Äôs guilty but it didn‚Äôt start out like that! Now she looks like the bad guy. I‚Äôm sure she is aware that it was wrong.

She has obviously gotta whole lotta craaaaazy going on. Look at those eyes of hers. It's called crazy eyes. Honestly, i feel they need to have that wobble. And the eating in court. The judge allowed that, reeeeaaallly. I've never seen that in the 50 years I've been around. It almost seems as if the judge had already made the decision before the case was even tried. I had a very abusive EX-husband. My divorce went to trial. And not 1 time did i behave like that wacko of a person. (can't call her a woman). Wacko def suits her best. Rolling eyes, eating, careless, lying. There are not enough words to describe her kind of crazy. I guarantee if her sister went flying down the stairs it would have been because she got in the way of Amber and 1 of her hissy fits. Not Johnny's. With the abuse i suffered, i know when a person is lying about that. And Lil Miss Heard is a big fat Liar. Without 1 single doubt as far as I'm concerned, or any other normal thinking person. Amber is an all together different kind of crazy. Even after all of that, she is still an in demand actress. Johnny will recover. Unfortunately it will take a lil bit of time for him to make a rebound. But he is loved by his true fans. Even after what Johnny put his ex-wife thru to be with Amber, she still took his side and stated that Johnny was NEVER an abuser. I totally believe Vanessa and that statement. I just find it extremely disturbing that a woman can get away with that kind of behavior. For the simple fact that she is a woman. Unbelievable and tragic.

It could be that very early in her life she had, or never had, someone who told her what to do, or who never adequately told her what is right, so that she simply had to act, to simulate, to live the right quality of life for herself. That's what I think. She only eats because in her childhood she always ate when there was no one around to tell her what is right to do. Amber Heard is not a robot ... She has an incredible amount of anger that she swallows along with her eating habits. A real analyst does not make fun of the person to be analyzed, you make fun of this person Amber Heard and do not recognize her as human being.

Which is what she does all the time in other interviews as well.   So to base most of the baseline off that concept just throws too many flaws into the other subjective contexts further down the reading..........  But what do I know.  I do this in real time scenarios in war zones.  Forensic behavioralism to the point of assessing legal aspects is too corrupt for me to get into.  Truth will never set you free, when there are others claiming truth is opposite of what it is.

The whole concept of eyes darting around, as showing lack of interest.  It's true in her mentality at the moment, due to her ADHD and public life circumstances.  It's her mind being over loaded with ocular events that she is trying to buffer out.  ADHD.  The misalignment is caused by the ADHD and indication of any guilt or concept of guilt.

5248,UgytLXNZe1ekfp9FHpR4AaABAg,"Where you point out how Johnny kinda smirks at the beginning of his recollection i think its important to note that some people that have experienced a lot of trauma have developed a coping mechanism of making the trauma funny or trying to diffuse an abuser with humor so its totally possible that that reaction upon thinking about this horrible situation was this type of coping mechanism playing out. Like when he recalls the actual trauma he also recalls the way he made it funny and/or was trying to make it comfortable for everyone else.  

Its also kinda obvious to me that amber could very well be a psychopath or sociopath that doesn't feel emotions or doesn't feel them appropriately which is made evident by her inability to even fake any kind of emotion she thinks she should have because she has never really had them.

Again just my two cents, there is a Gallos humor that's part and parcel to that scene. Regarding his smirk, notice it comes up right before he describes her throwing a vodka bottle. Just my opinion but I read that, as him acknowledging the absurdity of that act. Little Amber heard throwing a big vodka bottle at him is an absurd image, I I myself was in an abusive relationship with a small woman, and I'm a big bald man. It never got physical. But there were occasions, because of her inability to value me as a human being, where she literally put my life in jeopardy. My existential being was threatened due to her negligence because she did not value me as a human being. I won't go into the details, needless to say when I have told the story, I laugh. Because it is both terrifying, tragic and absurd.

For an actress, she can't seem to know what to do with her body, and I would say she has some kind of desorder, mostly bc of her dead fish eyes.
Anyway, back to Johnny, he is clearly in a verry charming mode. He's not childish, he is a mature man with way more experiences and knows how to tell a story in a trustfull manner. I think he just knows better, but it doesn't mean he is not lying.
In this last video you showed however, I desagree strongly. He just looks and sounds drunk af. Almost embarrasing to watch, seriously. And he's just mumbling the most empty answer you can imagine. And she's just.... being her smilling nevrotic self I guess.
I think they are being the cixtim of themselves and the way they are living their destructive and addictive lives.

He also fiddles with his rings and looks down at his hands which to me seems like an anxiety tick to help self soothe himself. His uncomfortable body language is so obvious if you watch other interviews and you learn to pick up his subtle movements. He was able to answer the question that was being asked with only the necessary details and got to the point. 
Ambers movements make her seem like she's trying way to hard to get others to believe her and you can tell she's not fully convinced with what she's saying, she couldn't even answer a yes or no question without telling this huge elaborate story that had nothing to do with the question being asked. Eating in a court room situation is extremely rude and I doubt if you were being asked questions about your abuser that you would be eating because if that was me I would not even have an apatite. Her lawyer also seemed very unprofessional and rude to the questioner and made a big deal over something so small to buy her more time to answer the question.

I rolled out of bed, crawled in to the livingroom and called the police. Now when I tell someone about that experience I always tell it like I was in an action movie.

Hitting me and then trivialize on the act, saying that ""It wasnt THAT hard"" and ""You're such a pussy"" etc. Hitting another person isnt allways about physical damage but also mental. Its very hurtfull to beeing struck by someone close to you, who you care for (Or thought you cared for). And this happens too much towards men, cause women just think its okey cause we're men and we should be able to take it, no problem.

However, EVERY action men does towards women, is too often blown out of proportion. Im not saying however physically, verbally or mentally abuse of women (or men) is by any means OK. But it is happening too often in the modern ""Fuck the patriarchy"" days that men are painted in a picture that does not represent a truthfull reality because of certain modern movements. I think its time this is balanced out to an equal level. Abuse is NOT okey towards women OR men.

I'm not saying Johnny Depp is 100% Innocent, he very well may NOT be. But its clear and obvious that amber is no saint either, and the public treatment is harsh on depp whilst amber is painted as an innocent victim by the press, media and public.

It's no wonder it flopped. So I'm guessing you did a three week internet course to become a ""Body Language Analyst"" to cash in on the REACT craze, made even more ""substantial"" with your ""Analyst"" title. 

Personally, I find it offensive to see that you are exploiting this new market of ""Let's all hate on personalities' crimes and misdemeanors"". And I find it strange that in your ""Analyst"" studies, they didn't teach you about voice evidence. Surely it would constitute a decent chunk of the curriculum, Logan. Why don't you explain exactly what your qualifications are because I don't think a genuine analyst would so cartoonishly mimic or parody someone whether they are guilty or not, as you did Amber about that whispering part. Red flag. 

For the record, I think Amber Heard is a total narcissist and my ""YouTuber Analyst"" skills tell me you are a con-artist. Stop abusing this resource for monetary gain if you are not a true analyst.

And details, women give them.

I suffer from depression, anxiety, ADHD, and as a result, I tend to do all of those quick movements, shrugging, eye rolling etc as a result of my insecurities. I always thought that what I was doing was a reflection of my discomfort and inner struggles, however,  I've always had issues everywhere I go. School, workplace, etc. It's always been the same thing. My ""attitude"". I'm the nicest, kindest, most loyal person, and people that truly know me can vouch for that.. But my demeanor gives everyone an impression that I have a ""diva"" attitude, I come across as rude and insufferable, and have struggled with this ever since i was a kid. Worst thing is, I wasn't even aware of my movements up until a few months ago, but all along, my depression got worse mostly because of how horribly people treated me, trying to ""put me where I belong"" when I was always nice to them as much as I was aware of. My facial expressions, resting bitch face, everything has fetched me so much problems and even in cases where others were framing me for things I didn't do, the others got away with it because my ""attitude"" aligned with their accusations against me.

Will ALL people behave the same way when answering questions that are outside of their comfort zone? They both display disgust for the people bothering them with baited questions.

Before watching or hearing evidence such as this deposition or phone calls, i thought ""she might be some cold opportunist""... now what i think is that she might be really struggling with her mental health, which has interfered with her actions during who knows how many years from now. Ultimately she is still to be held accountable for all of her actions and words, but i strongly suspect that there is a substantial percentage of all which is ""unintentional"" and driven by her issues, basically i think she is not a victim of his ex-husband, but partially a victim of herself.

Another thing people don't consider much is abuse isn't just physical, it can be emotional, physical, psychological abuse.  Also, speaking from my own experience, Alcoholics can present differently sober as they do drunk, and they also can be completely oblivious to their actions they carry out while drunk.

As for Johnny: my impression of the ‚Äúsmirk‚Äù is something that shows in the face when feeling sarcastic, recalling a scene from memory perceived by the storyteller to be ridiculous, or feeling embarrassed/regret-maybe even a twinge of feeling caught of guard with sadness

As for an overall take on these two and their relationship. Most people are amazing when they present themselves as individuals. But what I have learned most from relationships is that one person‚Äôs amazing experience with anyone can be the next person‚Äôs nightmare. 

It all depends on the interactive elements and variables that occur between the couple.

He has to make her seem like the greatest thing in the world (in his eyes) so that others will think she's great too. I've experienced what Johnny had experienced. Abusers want their victim to treat them as a higher power (in a way) because they want to show that they are in control for one, and also to gain a higher confidence about their power over others. Abusers like this seem to be the ones that were spoiled by their guardians for a ""gift"" they have. That's the only thing that they seem to have to hold themselves up in this world, to make people like them. They want more though, so they make ""close friends"" or get into a relationship to gain more of this power.

As a woman that was on the receiving end of many years of abuse, physical and mentally. I don't see her displays any emotion when recalling the attacks that she claims he inflicted on her. The stubbling on her words could be panic, but I don't feel like it is panic in the sense that she has been so mentally torn apart that her confidence is at an all time low and is unsure of how to word it.
J Depp, the forced little one side smile, I still do this now, it's a coping mechanism, almost like if I can smile about it then I'm OK, I'll joke about it because I don't want others to see my hurt and vulnerability, it's like my wall between my exposed nerves and them being able to touch on it.

6268,UgyyEx4iXFzbn6bs4CV4AaABAg,"I‚Äôm disappointed. I was really looking forward to an analysis on their body language while in court, but there are too many misunderstandings and points not being noticed. 

For example:

She nodded her head that she understood the question and responded ‚Äúno‚Äù to the question.. I feel like this isn‚Äôt taking into the account that this has been a very long, very public case in which Amber has been attacked on many platforms by many of Depp‚Äôs fans. Yes, her body clearly states that she‚Äôs contradicting herself, but it is understandable that she doesn‚Äôt want to be there. Not necessarily because she‚Äôs guilty, but more likely because she‚Äôs tired of the abuse she‚Äôs receiving from the public throughout the trial.

The licking on the side of the mouth could be an indication of nerves, resulting in a dry mouth. As someone who struggles with anxiety, I recognize this symptom. The corners of your mouth get dry and cracked and it becomes difficult to talk, so you subconsciously lick the area to lubricate so you can speak without trouble. However, it could also be caused by salty food.

At 14:43 there is an eye flutter. She did indeed hear that question, and her eyes indicate that the statement is untrue.


No, I am not a fan of hers. Before this case I didn‚Äôt even know her name. However, I can clearly see that she is purposefully acting bored. She is clearly nervous and there are signs of depression, but she‚Äôs acting blas√© to try and show her innocence. 
Please remember that should she be innocent, her discomfort is understandable. She‚Äôs being publicly accused of lying and being an abuser herself, and she is clearly losing this case. Abusive victims hardly ever come forward as it is humiliating to have their trauma replayed for strangers to judge. At this point she probably feels as if she‚Äôs already lost the battle, although she is sticking to her guns and seeing the trial through to the end instead of appealing for a lighter sentence or settlement of some kind, which means she has something to fight for.

 I fully support Johnny, however I feel that this video isn‚Äôt being entirely fair, taking into consideration how both parties may feel at this point, and it is certainly not unbiased. Seeing as this is a legal case, it‚Äôs not right to cast judgement from the get-go. I would‚Äôve preferred a more detailed analysis based purely on her actions, without pre-studying the video so that their are no pre-formed opinions.

I like the idea behind this video, but hope future ones might take my words into account.",Kai Ives,1,2021-01-27T14:10:33Z

You pointed out a few things I noticed in Amber's non-verbal ques that I agree with and also pointed out and explained a lot for Johnny & Amber separately and together that I didn't notice. Very insightful. When I first heard they were dating I thought they were cute but I also wondering if she was just using Johnny. Then I heard about their marriage and thought it was quick based on Johnny's past relationships - shocked and kinda thought it was a red flag. If the genders were reversed serious alarms would have been going off because a rush to the altar seems possibly controlling. When the accusations flew I stayed neutral until both parties revealed their perspective of the truth. I'm a feminist on Johnny's side. Need to say that because it seems feminists are taking Amber's side without questions just because she's a woman. I hate how Amber is potentially damaging the efforts to stop domestic violence against women and may as well be openly mocking the survivors of abuse. On the other hand she's showing everyone something equally important I became aware of years ago: that women can be the abusers, that men can be abused by women regardless of their age or size in comparison. While many women don't come forward with abuse, even less men come forward if they're abused. Especially if the abuser is a woman.

6327,Ugw3B5ol4tnZmlz-0dB4AaABAg,"Classic narc behaviour to turn everything around to make the victim into the abuser. It's what narcs do because they can't fathom that it is them being abusive, they believe that they are infallible, but they live in turmoil , unable to feel authentic emotions, and they want everyone else to feel like them, try to bring others down to their level to feel better, to feel normal and vindicated. They attribute their negative feelings to someone else, because they are unable to self reflect, they are fragile and fearful and hostile, rude and full of  vengeance. She will never , ever, ever, admit any wrongdoing because to do that would be to admit that she is as fallible and prone to lower emotions as other human. She will not be happy until she has ruined her victims self esteem and life because she holds the victim responsible for her violence, and believes that the victim deserved it.",char shill,0,2021-01-23T12:10:39Z

It can be conflicting to understand their body language together, because Johnny could be very absurd in his actions and Amber has No Choice but to Tame him, and this downward Look he gives her could be a ""am I doing Okay"" Look. I think a lot of Ambers ""I don't care Gestures"" has to do with the fact she is OVER dealing with an abusive Drug Addict. I know when my Mother left my Alcoholic Pothead of a Father, she would act similarly as if she has No Interest Being in that situation yet alone thinking about it. I think her attitude has to do with the fact No One else knows what she has had to deal with, and shes sick of becoming the Predator because hes a World Famous Supper Star and he could never be abusive.

Which then may differ from the normal way women communicate and especially connect. Especially in this kind of situation. Especially when presented with a masculin energy/interigator.

Not saying that she is not guilty. I'm quite certain she did it. Just wanted to know in general as I see some conspicuous behavior that more or less just makes me see a little, angry, neglected child. An individual, who thinks getting physically agressiv, when she feels helpless and small, maybe belittled, and has no other way to communicate with someone that may intellectually outsmarted her.

As someone with ADHD, the looking around while talking is normal for us. 
I'm not saying she has it but please remember those of us with ADHD.

Example: I was with three other people at subways, we all have ADHD, out faces and eyes were wondering around the entire time. Our phones were out and we were messing with them. But our bodies were all pointed towards each other. Me were moving alot paying attention to out side and inside while have a conversation with each other. I was taking to my friend Sky and a girl as well as the other guy there. While Sky, he was talking to me and the other guy. The other guy and the girl were having a conversation while he talked to Sky. 


For me:
People say when they speak to me I'm not really listening but I am. And if I was to focus on you in full, body and eyes, they tend to get uncomfortable and lose their train of thoughts. 
Which is why I don't look people in the eyes when I talk. Only when it is needed. Even though I'm soft spoken, I do have a tendency when you have my full attention.  My friends can contest to that.",ALICE the GAME LAND,0,2021-01-15T00:29:19Z

Her entire life is being disrupted as a result of her husband beating her and as if that wasn‚Äôt enough, she has to spend hours with lawyers & judges and deposition takers so of course she doesn‚Äôt want to be there. I‚Äôve been through that experience on a much smaller scale bc of the lack of public scrutiny & I‚Äôm sure I seemed just as disinterested.  She was in her mid 20s & her biggest mistake was marrying an asshole who conned her and MILLIONS of others into thinking he was a decent guy. Who wouldn‚Äôt be frustrated? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I really think you‚Äôre missing the mark on this analysis. I subscribed to your channel after watching your Olivia Jade Red Table analysis but you might have lost me as a subscriber after this one. Did you consider that she was just hungry and chose a snack food bc it wouldn‚Äôt be messy or stink up the room? Women‚Äôs lives are extremely hectic and a lot of us are juggling so much we‚Äôre stuck eating on the go. At this point I think you‚Äôre being a bit judgmental.  You‚Äôve attacked her manners, her diet & eating habits and I‚Äôm not even halfway through the video.",w1ldflwr572,0,2021-01-07T01:26:15Z
6579,UgzSSN4XZ825cOrR_2p4AaABAg,"Your first point is simply a misunderstanding. She was being asked two independent questions by the person taking the deposition and the answer to one question (do you understand?) was yes, while the answer to the original question was ‚Äòno‚Äô. So she was nodding to say she understood while verbally answering the question.  You also initially pointed out that she DOES normally look around a lot when being interviewed so wouldn‚Äôt that just suggest she isn‚Äôt comfortable in any interview type situation where she is being recorded and therefore not an indication about how she specifically feels about the questions?",w1ldflwr572,0,2021-01-07T01:02:09Z

6581,UgwqO-7-9rbaoFa4Ol94AaABAg,"The little smirk Johnny does as he's going into the explanation of his severed finger tip, is actually bc when he looks at or talks about that finger, he laughs at the name he gave it, Little Richard. By the end of his explanation of what happened to his finger, he looks down at it again and smirks or smiles a bit more as he reveals the nickname he gave his finger. This is why I think he smirks at the beginning of his explanation bc he's named his finger now and gets a kick out of it now as a lot of us do, when we try to make a negative situation more positive after we're able to actually find humor in it once some time passes.

ALSO- as a mental health counselor in training, I can tell you his half smile is _likely_ a defense mechanism we call sublimation: expressing the opposite emotion in the face of feeling a very uncomfortable emotion. This type of defense mechanism in particular manifests almost unwillingly/subconsiously.

6762,UgyEEEn8ePvbO7MrmPJ4AaABAg,"I've been in a relationship with someone this toxic..

I will never forget when my ex (year long relationship) accused me of cheating when I'd didn't. At 24 years old I was working every day and night to pay the bills and was getting 3 hours of sleep every night from working 3 jobs. She was going to school and living off of my income. I got tired of it and I said ""if you're going to falsely accuse me of always cheating than I might as well do it anyways"".

She pulled a knife on me in my own kitchen and told me I wouldn't live to tell the story. She even asked me ""even if I was to stab you in 'self defense' who do you think the cops would believe you as a man or me?"". She even started fake crying with a knife pointed at my stomach while I was doing dishes and started talking to me as if she was speaking to cops afterwards.. saying things  in a sobbing voice like ""he was coming at me and I didn't know what to do"".

I then planned my escape that weekend afterwards, and moved out.. bought a gun (carry it on me 24/7) and have never looked back. But all I remember thinking all the time is there's women out there who are this crazy, abusive and hide that they think this way. They will hurt or threaten anyone to get what they want.

Still to this day my current wife tells me I have issues trusting people (like friends and family). We even reflected and it took me about a year or two to properly fall asleep overnight in the same bed together since we've started.

She's uncomfortable, bites her lower lip whenever asked if she was violent towards Depp (an act that usually indicates guilt or feeling uncomfortable with what you're about to say), she stumbles in her wording and she is defensive, keeping her arms tight to her body, tense posture. Generally speaking, someone that is accused wrongly of something they didn't do would get angry and offensive. Not leaning back or away from the interviewer but towards them to establish dominance and keep make a stance. This is done to indicate clearly and strongly that the accusation is false. Whenever asked a yes or no she occasionally gives a wordy answer that deviates from the question. She's not involved into the discussion at all either.. She doesn't care at all... She's angry but PAUSES and dodges the question when their questions are tougher or that position her in a negative light, therefore it means she doesn't have an answer ready.. you would know what to answer when it already happened because is the truth and it is an easy answer BUT if the truth condemns you... then... you wouldn't rush it: example 17:35 there is no passion involved.. *time to think* 19:35 Confident answer + passion in her words.

6952,UgwTnEof3lE7UJ0JGzR4AaABAg,"As an actual victim of domestic violence I find what she‚Äôs doing appalling. I suffered extreme physical mental emotional and psychological abuse at the hands of my ex-husband for six years.  I have had countless broken bones which included A broken arm, a cracked skull , several broken ribs and he hit me so hard and dry broke my do out. He beat me so bad during my pregnancy that I almost lost my child and was put in the hospital for months. Psychological psychological abuse was just as bad as his fists. He belittled me, criticize me for every little thing, blamed me for his shortcomings, and broke me down made me feel like I was nothing and completely broke my spirit. It took years to be able to aging the courage to leave him. I left him with our two children $200 to my name. 
She is not only making a mockery of every woman who has suffered but the hands of an abuser she is a classic abuser her self who is trying to justify her actions because she has a self-righteous attitude and believes she can play victim and get away with it. She‚Äôs disgusting. She is using the movement that is meant for true victims to try to ruin a man‚Äôs life for financial gain and sympathy in hopes to boost her career. I honestly think she never loved him , she‚Äôs been a Golddigger from day one. 
Oh and as a sidenote Johnny Depp‚Äòs reactions are those of a man that suffers from abuse, it comes from the embarrassment from the stigma it brings. There are so many men that suffer domestic abuse that don‚Äôt report it because of the out right embarrassment of admitting that a woman is abusing them. Other men can be extremely harsh and even the law can as they find it hard for a ‚Äútiny little woman‚Äù to be the aggressor. Men don‚Äôt report it for the sympathy because it brings backlash of criticism and disbelief. You can see his embarrassment and shame. I have been in several support groups that included men and I see in the very same luxe and I‚Äôve seen them speak of their trauma in the exact same way. His pain is genuine, her story is rehearsed and poorly acted. You would think for an actress she could make a better performance to sound convincing but nope because she‚Äôs so arrogant she just believes that we will believe whatever she says. She‚Äôs a lier and a horrible person. I absolutely will not be watching any movie she‚Äôs in nor will I purchase any product that she‚Äôs a representative of.

I recognized it when I first started seeing it in interviews,  it was even more obvious in the recordings between them and then I heard her actually tell him to take them as soon as he started getting a handle on what she was really doing to him. He was tranqed big time. Ive heard it when I was on them after my trauma, I've heard it in patients, it even reminds me of Stevie Nicks interviews during her klonopin years. Its a very obvious disconnect and slow draw. Plus hes definitely using dark humor to cope and try to make less of things.

She's not comfort seeking eating, she's bored eating and time buying. Even with victims who play the tough guys as a coping mechanism,  there is a notable somber tone change when addressing actual moments of abuse. Nevermind that after I saw this I heard the audio of her discussing this same event with him in private and she clearly admitted details which meant he was the one locked in, she was trying to get in and angry at him for leaving and that she hit him with her hand in the face after the door opened, of course she made sure to keep the whole convo focused on the fact that the door scratched her toe when it swung open.... still boggles my mind that that didn't prove anything in court.

Just sharing my opinion because it's the first thought that came to my untrained mind. Eating can also be a way of reducing stress, not necessarily a lack of regard for the process. Obviously she doesn't want to be there, but here behaviors seem more to reflect discomfort, distress, and being emotionally drained. I know we are looking at her as a perpetrator, not a victim, in this scenario. But, even if that's true, it gives us a bias in interpreting her behavior. I don't know anything about this situation and this video is the first time I'm hearing about this, I don't even know who this woman is. But maybe an outside perspective that does not carry preconceptions is a good thing? Like maybe she did hit him, but I see her as very emotionally affected by the process, and she is suppressing loads of distress, and is emotionally drained. But I wouldn't conclude that she is apathetic to the situation. Just my opinion, that's all. Not intending to fight, you can disagree if you want. I also think she's super frustrated with the redundancy of the process.

Sadly a man isn't supposed to use force to fight off a female attacker apparently and that isn't fair.

1. They‚Äôre at a public gathering
2. Why would amber curl her hair?

Now him not combing his hair could show either a lack of confidence or from sleep deprivation. Especially when you compare this with most pictures of Johnny Depp, where his bangs are at least slicked back, so how could this be? I think we all know the answer to that.

I'm sure the circumstances she finds herself in, the setting in which the depo is held in, revisiting trauma by being asked these questions are all part of the body language you're reading.

Is NO ONE pointing out 15:30  ""..and Johnny, whenever he was injured or touched at all, he would always refer to it in these ways: punching, or clocked, or whatever....and whether you discussed it with him or not."" 

This statement literally admits she knows in detail how Johnny describes being the victim and how he reacts to the ensuing discussion after the fact. She then tries to play it down by insinuating he would categorize a gentle push as ""cold clocking"". This seems extremely far fetched and a way of wiggling out of her previous statement. 

Occam's Razor principle: usually the explanation with the least amount of assumptions is the right one. Here this leads to only one solution: her knowing his reaction is that she regularly hit him.

Basically it means little dick. As he recalled the injury he was recalling the joke he'd been using about the finger that got hurt, the birdie. Mine got injured once, I accidently gave a dr the bird when asked which finger got hurt, but I was 8 or so at the time. Was probably some forced positivity, it's a bittersweet joke instead of thinking only about pain.
I have chronic pain. Humour is sometimes necessary for it.
While I don't like what Amber has done I get a sense she was oversimplistically misunderstood in these videos, and perhaps things you said were present in various footage you saw but in these tidbits it comes across a lot less concrete. So while I've seen other footage of her and can understand many concerns of her behaviour, if relying on this video alone I would have more doubts.
I could easily think she was exhausted, and she may have missed a meal and missed sleep. I wouldn't doubt it much given the hot mess she's in, but it doesn't seem overall relevant to the topic. I do believe she mentally struggles to communicate and has mental health issues, which need to be appropriately addressed, which I don't think are.
The first problem you pointed out was weird to point out in the instance, even if normally considered a thing. In this instance though she takes time to process what is said and what to say; you already established that was normal for her. Right during processing she was asked a second question. She had two different answers and so then had to process how to answer, again. She made it clear where the problem was when she clarified ""yes I understand the question."" while trying to say no to the first question. She didn't have to doubt her answers to doubt how to communicate them.
When asked if she ever punched Depp with a closed fist, she answered yes. Multiple times, but no doubt with strong feelings preventing her being utterly clear she was actually answering. I believe she feels a regret of sorts, not that it really changes her guilt.
It would be more unusual for her not to have strong feelings to a question about her doing something wrong, whether having done it or not. I believe her, she said she hit him. She then got defensive saying what lead up to it. Whether that part is true or not... I think she really wants to believe it is. She rose with conviction and literally went red in the face and neck regarding her sister. She slipped her temper. In the heat of the moment she may really have believed there was a danger even if there wasn't one because she was seeing red at the time. She needs a good therapist to help her manage her emotions and help her with her processing ability.
However regarding Depp she needs to apologize publicly, and leave him be. She's ruined his life and she had no right or excuse to be so vindictive. The most frightening for her thing she could do is understand and accept what she's done. She doesn't want to be seen as the bad guy.
For her sake and everyone else's, I really hope she gets the right mental health care.",Elaya,0,2020-12-09T18:03:53Z

I mean if someone could've went and put him in hot water, it was Vanessa with all the years they were together. But the way she defended him almost made me wonder why they split up. As years goes by, I'm starting to think that I'm not bias and Amber is a lunatic. My gut feeling is that he wanted to leave her, so she did this in order to try to destroy him and gain popularity from it, but it badly back fire at her, as his reputation might have suffered, but not as much as she had hoped. And she did gain popularity, but not in a good way. I do not hear much positivity associated with her name and more comments laughing at her.

Depp has a few things (tells).

It's both forced emotion to discuss it and shame.

Johnny Depp is one of those gorgeous men that are completely convinced that they are ugly.

Amber is a Narcisist. It saddens me so deeply how she has dragged his good reputation through the mud and ruined his life. For what? She's extremely spoiled and used to getting her own way. Johnny wasn't going to put up with that forever and she had to figure out a way to come out looking like a rose and the victim. Johnny has always been a humble gentle and kind soul. Yes, can he get angry or have a temper? OFCOURSE we ALL do! But I would bet my life that this insane abuse she tries to blame on him, was the other way around. With the past few years and all the women comming forward and being brave about their sexual assault in the media and how large the women's rights movement has become in Hollywood etc she used that to her advantage to gain sympathy. She jumped right on that train! I am in no way bashing abuse or women for speaking up about assaults, or the women who spoke out against Harvey Weinstein and bill Cosby etc... I empathise as a woman myself who has been raped at 15 by a 25 year old man. I have nothing but respect for those who speak out. My point is, I think she used the anger and frustration towards that whole situation to her advantage knowing so many would sympathize and lump her with another victim of abuse and run with it. And a chance to tear a HUGE a list star down. What a way to sell magazine's! Everyone jumped on board. Her ""good looks"" didn't hurt either. Although, her personality makes her very ugly imo.

She seems to show signs of frustration and anger throughout that first interrogation as if she is being treated unfairly and things aren‚Äôt going her way, which I find very peculiar. A victim of abuse does not act like that when they are asked about their trauma - her behaviour shows signs of a narcissistic personality. I‚Äôm not saying that Depp is innocent - it is impossible to know if you don‚Äôt know the people personally, and even then it may be difficult. I just really don‚Äôt like Amber Heard.

So, I would guess he might have similar reasons. Plus, other people also mentioned possible reasons for him half smiling. 
The hesitation could very well be to gaslighting, and other types of emotional and psychological abuse. Which makes you doubt your own memory and emotions. And from the way A.H. acts and behaves it seems highly likely that she did stuff like this.

And use them for everything they got.... Her body language her facial expressions... You can tell she did some research...her lawyer even interrupted the conversation when he knew she was getting too dramatic... I think she believes by destroying his career it'll build hers up...Then she can throw it in his face like I took everything from you.... Mental disease is a real thing.... We need to start talking about it more... I think she only got close to Johnny to help her career... I never really felt like they loved each other it was just an opportunity like the Jeffersons say moving on up.... And you can tell she's one of those women who use their brains their looks...

1 - Eating snacks - almost seems like a nervous gesture, not as much from boredom. ""Comfort Food"".

2 - When she moves her hands in front of her at 15:38 - a protective, blocking gesture she also closes her eyes a lot - then and thereafter, as she explains the situation. Either completely closed or partially, while also turning away from the questioner and toward her lawyer (?) - someone else to her left.

7479,UgyxH-LY2tTxiD9jzoV4AaABAg,"Clearly another presentation by someone lacking knowledge of dynamics of abuse between more vulnerable narcissistic presenting abusers and those that have been subjected to and dealing with that type of abuser. You state multiple times victim blaming statements, as from the start you don‚Äôt consider her not wanting to be there from a victim stance. Your assumptions and bias clearly reflect throughout, and you even go on to predict it yourself, indeed based on your limited knowledge of such dynamics, you were beating a dead horse of not understanding domestic violence and the myriad of ways it presents, aside from the more socially projected images and narratives. and those in the comments supposedly victims of abuse themselves clearly did not experience the same levels or types of manipulation inherent in certain abusive situations.  If you were, then her statement and interviews would make more sense, and no, a victim of that type of abuse would actually be more likely to try to give more details, and an expert covert liar would want to keep his/her statements brief...much more could be said, and sadly much of the videos on this topic and commenters lack knowledge, and/or biased.  Also, no one should say how a victim should react, you have made multiple statements as have supposed victims in comments of ‚Äúshould‚Äù and how they reacted and ‚Äúwould never eat‚Äù etc. it‚Äôs mind boggling the lack of awareness and seething disdain for her based on her not following a socially dominant image of victim, thus why he comes off looking that way and why actual knowledge of abuse systems and victims experiences and dynamics and tactics used would dispel such horrid biased ‚Äúanalysis‚Äù.  As a side note, narcissists view people as objects, take a look at his words in that abhorrent text regarding her and how it isn‚Äôt just someone angry at her, but how he views women more generally, and while not relevant if you are going to just go off made up leaps and persona bias, may I remind ya‚Äôll he is/was friends with RomanPolanksky, the admitted predator of minors who escaped the country to avoid sentencing, but you know, let‚Äôs all just continue to talk out of our biased arse‚Äôs about things we only know from media and how we think things would look, rather than hearing the person and trying to understand what this would look like if she is telling the truth, how all your points would actually be able to be explained or hypothesized just as casually as you did in the reverse, but not once did you bother to try that, instead short cutting to victim blaming ‚Äúif you were a victim you would behave look like xyz‚Äù domestic violence 101, a victim does not have to act a certain way, doesn‚Äôt have to conform to a imaginary script, and indeed its that pressure to come off a certain way in order to be believed that is part of what makes responding stressful and difficult to pinpoint the direction it would look to someone unfamiliar with the dynamics, let alone when your being accused of being the primary aggressor, not just reporting to police.
Regardless on the actual situation between these two people, which we can‚Äôt actually speak on, my point is if you are going to demonize someone, or throw out comments and videos stereotyping reactions, you should be more informed of various abuse dynamics and the ways the genuine victims get falsely ‚Äúread‚Äù, s extremely harmful to our society to continue this narrative and informal interpretation, as it also shows a mind boggling blindness to inherit bias...
I short, this video, and these comments and other videos with similar comments sections are extremely problematic for those in domestic violence situations and it reinforces insecurity of the victim, speaking out, as such uneducated opinions formed on biased and socially informed expectations worsen the situation. It is dangerous to continue to practice this type of narrative of what victims should look like or sound like, particularly when their words and behaviors do align with many survivors in certain dynamics of abuse, yet much of society regurgitates the same shallow understanding, also some people just blatantly have a bias depending on other factors, which seems apparent in this case, btw it would be distracting  to be a victim of abuse and be accused and then people are whispering as you attempt to recall traumatic experiences, but of,course, you assumed she is lying, so...the insensitive reaction fits.  This whole video and others like it fits so well into angry assumptions, perhaps she is unlike able in her demeanor, like that first video, however, that doesn‚Äôt mean you can overlook the scenario she is explaining, because she makes actual sense, and you tried to pick times when she had her mouth full to answer a question that required much more detailed response question vs a simpler one, where she had less in her mouth to begin with, ( best example of grasping at straws I‚Äôve seen yet) also, just because she was chewing doesn‚Äôt mean she is doing it to bide time to lie (inane to think that‚Äôs the only explanation you put forth, an observation of  clear bias and limited interpretation options in ‚Äúobservation‚Äù in this video), it can be extremely nerve wracking and actual survivors need time in between questions, but aren‚Äôt usually given it, like serious there is so much blatant disturbing bias and lack of knowledge here that the community in the comments and elsewhere that clearly show showing empathy and being likable have nothing to do with being a victim.

No. She is a liar. If he did anything to ever hurt her, it was definately NOT what she claimed. I know people who behave and look like her... when they exaggarate things to turn them in their favor.
And her aggressiveness is not out of protectiveness for her sister. It's because she aggressively wants to be taken as right, she wants to manipulate and intimidate the people listening.

Hello, child of a narcissistic mother, here. 

This whole act she does - I've seen time and time and time and time and time again when my mom was put in the hotspot. Worked EVERY time, too. People think ""oh, she's so full of conviction she can't possibly be lying!"" -- but trust me. You can see it in the core of their eyes. That isn't conviction - it's desperation. People confuse the two - especially if they've had great parents and wonderful people around them their entire lives.

She got out of fucking E V E R Y T H I N G with that little song and dance with normal people. Her shoulders, her 'trying to cry' her excuse and using 'baby' sister. All of these things were things my mom did in order to look like the victim...and it worked with every child welfare employee who came to our house. 

Some total crap. I am so angry she is using her gender to her advantage and is crying out that she is a woman being hit by a man - that's all she's crying.... but let's not ask about her behavior, right? We can't do that - if we do - we're being mean to the victim!

7541,Ugzmjm-dfpwA6A2ALyR4AaABAg,"Subbed last night and this is the second of your videos that I've watched. One very strong thing I noticed in Amber was that its the lower half of her face which animates when she's talking naturally - the baseline showcased quite a range of mouth shapes, but her eyes and brow never moved! (With me, it's very much the other way around!). Yet in the deposition, her brow wrinkled quite a lot. And every time it did, she was saying something dodgy. I wonder if the brow-wrinkle is her particular 'tell' - when she's consciously working to convince someone of what she's saying, she engages more of her face in the performance; but when she's being herself, that part of her face is naturally inert.

And with that in mind, it was interesting to watch how much her mouth worked most of the time. It was as if she wanted to really give a massive monologue and was really having to work to keep from saying something she'd regret. I bet that's what the snacks were for - to keep that overactive mouth occupied. The moment when she leaned her chin on her hand was the point where it looked as if she was having to force her mouth to stay shut. Yes, she was signalling boredom and contempt, but she was doing that from the start. The chin on her hand was extra - forcibly keeping her mouth closed.

Overall, I didn't think this was the general behaviour of someone about to discuss the physical abuse they'd suffered from someone they'd previously loved and trusted. There was no grief, no fear and, most of all, no focus on the person questioning her and by doing so, casting doubt on her side of the story.  If she was a genuine victim, I would expect her to have her eyes fixed on the person questioning her. Maybe her mouth would work out of anxiety and the desire to talk about the crime committed against her - likewise self-soothing gestures. But she looked as if she was constantly looking for an escape route. Again, comparing with the baseline - she quite clearly didn't want to be there. But it wasn't fear - the overriding impression I got was of passionate anger barely suppressed of the 'how dare you question me, peasant!' variety.

7543,Ugzpozh9Cvp6ESTmGuJ4AaABAg,"Heard admits in the audio that she deliberately punched Johnny.  She then diverts to another incident rather that answering the question directly.  Johnny's lawyer isn't very good in questioning.  She could have specifically asked about what was said in the audio.  She also could have asked more information about where Amber was vis a vis Johnny in that incident.  Johnny was locked in a bathroom and she was trying to barrel into the bathroom.  The bathroom door opens into the bathroom which is why Amber hit him in the head with the door (which she admits to in the audio).  If she was trying to get away from him, did she start out in the bathroom?  What was she doing with him in the bathroom?  That would have exposed her lie about her getting away from him when it was him getting away from her.

I feel defensive when I tell people the things I've done to my ex partner while trying to get away from them. Ive scratched, punched, and pushed.  Ive threatened to stab him with scissors when he wouldn't let me close the door, similar to a situation amber was explaining. I'm always surpised when they tell me they would have done the same. I always expect a very different reaction. 

Also side note, I love Johnny Depp. However, he is a great actor and if he just so happens to be a narcissist as well, thats a very dangerous combo. I naturally believe him 100%.

As for Johnny's smirk and laugh.. It is very much him trying to lighten up the situation that is not so light. I behave like that a lot. I also get shit for it -_- I call it my ""depressing humor"" and I consider it a coping mechanism and people with give me death treats for not taking mental help so seriously when I do take it very seriously.

Her stumbling with words is constant, and is consistent with her use of drugs, but her lack of interest really shows how she feels a victorious in the situation, she feels like she's going through a long wait in this interview.

She did however at points go way over the top in her ramblings causing the public gallery & even staff to burst out in laughter at the sheer ridiculousness of some of the answers she gave. She was caught lying multiple times by Johnny's defence & many times was literally throwing random words in to confuse her answers so they were completely non sensical. Also, the 'incident' she describes at the beginning of this video where Johnny tried to enter a room & attack her... she completely messed that one up &  retold it differently as Johnny being the person in the room",deborah,0,2020-11-18T03:00:12Z

7716,UgzibRLe7SXps_MXfuZ4AaABAg,"Yes, you pretty much confirm what I think since the beginning, when I watched a video Amber took ""to prove"" her point. But I what I saw was a girl who was confident and wanted to get the reaction she wanted by pushing her husband, not a victim who was insecure. And even then, I only saw a man who was angry for something she did before. 

In no case he was physically abusive to her.  It was very suspicious in my point of view, like when someone try to trap another, as we can watch in bad movies.",Coco S.,0,2020-11-16T21:41:12Z

Amber is not really aware of what is really going on around her in a way that she understands. I bet she is brilliant at maths!! I believe she has been lead by the people around her and legal team to make these claims but not really understood in her own mind what this all means.

All people thought he was very kind because he have two faces when he is with me and when we are outside. I was almost in the position of Johnny Depp where you will lost your selfesteem and identity. After 8yrs I have broken loss with a PTSD due to domestic violence and its 7 years beforw I found strength to sue that man. I realised this people sometimes win because the victims couldn't afford to soeak in courage. Only those who are open to body language will realise this in court. I won the case after many years..

Yet, I found out about Heard when her allegations became public. As a survivor, my first instinct was to believe her, my heart went out to her! Then I saw this video, and every alarm bell went off in my head. I knew instantly this was a grift! Then I heard the entirety of those taped conversations, and I can tell you that it was Heard who reminded me of my abuser, and not the other way around. (BTW, that room Heard is claiming she was trying to escape to, was the bathroom in which Depp had locked himself into, in order to get away from her. That protection of the baby sister is laughable as well, considering her history of abusing her ‚Äúbaby‚Äù sister, and kicking her out of the Penthouse)  It was the Text between Depp, and Heards mother that closed the case to me. This person is a sociopath, a jackal. She is single handedly destroying ‚Äúme too‚Äù. I never been invested in any celebrity drama, but after what I experienced in my own life, I feel strongly about Depps vindication. This store is truly evil.",138abob,286,2020-11-15T14:06:37Z

There is no straightforward answer - they always deflect questions about them onto other people because it‚Äôs ‚Äúalways someone else‚Äôs fault‚Äù.

7821,UgwA-sg7lTNnaI7K20t4AaABAg,"Seeing Johnny and Amber together towards the end of the video was actually a little shocking when you look at it a bit more closely. I almost wonder if Amber is a bit jealous and insecure with all of the attention Johnny is getting. I mean, the interviewer is asking him questions and not her. It sort of feels like she's trying to make it clear to everyone that she's his focus and therefore more important between the two of them. Johnny looked terrified when Amber initially looked down on him almost with an aggressive, sly smirk. ""You better acknowledge we're together and that you're here with me because I'm the love of your life and I deserve some attention if you're getting some as well or there will be hell to pay later,"" and it's the perfect trap because if Johnny doesn't introduce her she can feign that she's been egregiously offended and unappreciated by him. She's smirking because she's confident Johnny will introduce her into the discussion as his girl as she expects him to. She's also trying to play nice and look like the smiling, happy girlfriend that Johnny is head over heels for. He probably knows she expects him to do this because she's harrassed him to a million times over with similar encounters. Being introduced is very formal. She's playing with her status in relation to him. As far as she's concerned, Johnny is her arm candy and afterwards she gives him a smile albeit condescending to let him know she approves of his introduction of her and to reinforce that expectation and power imbalance. She's delusional.",Timberlyn Miles,0,2020-11-13T20:59:29Z

He was trying to be jokey about it, which was super sad, and was asking if I think he should do something about it, I said yes, he said he doesn't know what she gave him, told him to go get a toxicology test, find out wtf she slipped him then sue the living shit out of her.

7824,UgwUXZXe1IsaMEUYyLZ4AaABAg,"The half smirk near the end from JD's side off could actually have had to do with Amber indeed tearing off his finger with the vodka bottle. It's fairly common for people to make these tiny smirks when they just can't believe that somehow so horrid actually happened to them. My father lived a life that few I would argue would be able to, and whenever he was looking back at the darker moments he actually did the same thing. Half smirk, only he would get very mad afterwards and tell us to go outside and play because obviously it wasn't something that we should ever be involved in. Through that we actually do have Amber Heard confessing to having both physically and mentally hurt Johnny Depp, so there's really nothing else to this story. She admitted it, several former friends of her spoke about about it as well, and all of Johnny Depp's ex-lovers came to his rescue so to speak too. The reason why Amber Heard hasn't been incarcerated yet? ‚Äî Favouritism. Well, that, and that she's a supposed woman. Now, I don't know just how experienced you are when it comes to that of body language, but to me she's not just guilty, she's showing it with proudness and carelessness for Johnny Depp and the hearing. I do however actually believe that Johnny might have had enough of her at some point (everyone has a boiling point after all), and it even appears according to herself that the security guards also could 't take anymore of her constant nagging and violent behaviour. Howbeit I do not believe that Johnny ever hit her, but that he deep down wanted to.

7850,UgzBq_Qk13k15or00m14AaABAg,"Some of the questions they asked Amber I feel like are way too self-incriminating, especially the ""did you hit Johnny Depp"" question.  If I was a victim of abuse and I was asked that I would say a resounding YES because I would fight back if someone was hurting/abusing me.   I get why they asked her that question it was an easy (and cheap) jab at her to make her say she's guilty.   In the beginning of the video,  that lady who is asking questions was trying to trap Amber, she asked Amber if she is a domestic abuser and then asked if she understood the question.  Amber of course answered the first question and the lady was like, you don't understand my question? lol  That looked like another tactic to trap people, which is pretty scary.  Because what if it was anyone else in that situation and decided to answer yes to answer the follow up question instead of the first question of ""did you commit this crime.""  
Amber had a good lawyer, but I want to know who that lady who's asking Amber the questions is.  If that lady is Johnny's lawyer then I'm not surprised that he lost this case because she's a crappy lawyer to me (if she is a lawyer that is).   I feel like that lady lawyer's angle was to try and get Amber to admit guilt but I would think a better tactic would be to ask for the story first then poke holes in the story.  Trying to take cheap shots obviously  didn't help Johnny's case at all.  For whatever reason, Amber did seem unprepared, so her lawyer did lack in trying to get her head straight.
The hesitation from Johnny can probably play into him having to choose his words wisely due to lawyers trying to use a ""trap tactic"" in order to self-incriminate, but there's not much recordings on him so can't really tell much from that.  
This recording is just a small drop of an ocean so it doesn't really tell the whole picture.",DJ NCniK,0,2020-11-13T05:07:59Z

I will give a small example. I had a super abusive significant other and after we broke up a lot of my friends would ask me about very specific stories and I would do the smirk or even giggle and my friends would be shocked at this because, the story is no remotely funny but, I am not trying to make it funny.

7986,UgwhprHmYjWDpL4C-b14AaABAg,"I'd suggest you read the current DSM. Not everyone's the same. She has hallmarks of PTSD. There's that hypervigilance in both the baseline and the deposition videos and also the grounding behaviour. Incongruency+spottiness of memories of traumatic events is pretty normal too for PTS sufferers. People in abusive relationships often wind up with PTSD and, speaking as someone who's been there, this is exactly what it looks like. Also, that recording speaks for itself. ""I just got hit in the head with the corner of the F@(%!ng door"". There's only one way that could have happened, short of her ripping the door from its hinges and chasing him around the house with it; he attempted to deprive her of the time-out she had every right to assert. Period.

The abuse is on his part right there because he had no right to decide for her if or when she could take a time-out from him. There's no ""what about..."". He shouldn't have done that in the first place and, had the police been present, his attempt to invade her space while she was trying to disengage from him would have led to a much more physical intervention long before his head had the opportunity to make contact with the door. As it stands, her ejecting him forcefully from her space is neither assault nor abuse in this context. Cornering someone and triggering their PTSD for purely sadistic reasons, on the other hand, is something I've seen plenty of and that really is abuse of the worst kind. And if you won't let her have her time-out when she needs it, what else are you trying to do to her?

Maybe there's more to this. I have no idea. I'm only commenting on what I've seen here. More than that, it simply makes me sad; especially considering that this is not the first time I've seen someone villified for the apparent crime of having PTSD.",Mercurio Morat's Bughunting Channel,0,2020-11-09T12:32:55Z

When my dad filed for divorce she accused him for physical and sexual assault, which is taken extremely seriously. towards the end of their relationship my dad recorded several incidents where it clearly shows that his wife abused him and even sometimes their 2 years old son. he had whatsapp chats, voice recordings and neighbor  testimonies confirming that they've seen the wife hitting the child in public. we all thought that her allegations wont mean anything and that my dad will get at least partial custody of his son. but somehow not only did she get full custody of the child, but also my dad will never be able to see his son (not until the boy is 18 and can decide for himself). when i helped him through the case, watched every deposition and read all the scripts, i was really astonished ... the overwhelming evidence against this woman, and the lack of any evidence on him. i couldnt understand how could they conclude that he was the abuser. some of the hearings were laughable, the woman would just start screaming and fake crying in an attempt to show the court how scared she is of him, to the point where he couldnt even be in his own hearing. usually am not the type to use race in an argument, i think its cheap and a hail mary attempt to salvage a lost argument. but if u look at my name u can figure out am middle eastern, and so is my dad ofc.

8150,UgyPbWQREwI7ryUPnel4AaABAg,"Logan,
I would like to offer a different take on many of the Amber Heard deposition readings. 
1. The first conflicted nod (misaligned communication) did not just follow the question ‚ÄúDid you commit an act of domestic violence against Johnny Depp?‚Äù After Heard‚Äôs attorney interrupted, the deposing lawyer asked ‚Äúdid you understand my question?‚Äù I believe Heard was nodding yes to that, then answering ‚ÄúNo‚Äù to the question of having committed domestic violence [DV] on that date.
2. 2nd question. Part of reading body language is figuring out what‚Äôs going on in the person‚Äôs head. I believe some of her non-verbal language is an on-going reaction to her internal dialogue. Notice that the deposing lawyer has changed tack. This question changes from ‚Äúdid you commit DV on this date...‚Äù to ‚Äúis it your testimony that you NEVER committed ANY act of what is considered DV...?‚Äù Here you can see Heard register the new question &  process the implications. Her head shakes ‚Äòno‚Äô and the words come out parsed into smaller blocks as she takes in the enormity of ‚Äúdid you ever‚Äù vs. ‚Äúdid this happen on said date.‚Äù Her adjustment verbally moved from ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt commit DV‚Äù to ‚ÄúI did my best... to defend myself‚Ä¶ And not... not... not get seriously hurt‚Ä¶ And not become a doormat... to whom this happened to.‚Äù And as she says that, each pause is assessment & reflection that seems to say ‚Äúwhen he hit me, did I hit him back or just defend? Were MY actions justifiable or did I go beyond?‚Äù Her face never changes from concern to ‚Äôoops‚Äô or gloating. It remains consistent rather than revealing an internal epiphany. I see her reaction as that of someone who understands the social implications of women getting beaten and not having recourse because they are not believed. But, also knowledge that even though women are generally weaker, they will be punished more severely for crossing the line that men cross so casually. I also think that these aren‚Äôt two strikes against Amber, as you said.
3. 3rd question. Did you tell Johnny you beat him? It‚Äôs a poorly phrased question with no sensible segue from prior questions. You‚Äôve already noted that she was disoriented prior to this and she clearly does not follow the shift from ‚Äúdid you hit him‚Äù to ‚Äúdid you TELL Johnny you hit him.‚Äù It makes sense that questioning if she told him she hit him would be confusing, especially after she just said she has been defending herself against his beatings... many times. The attorney cuts her off claiming the answer as non-responsive. That‚Äôs because she is not answering the new question. Hasn‚Äôt realized the context has changed. She is still clarifying (poorly) that she was acting in defense. 
4. ‚ÄúJohnny and I.‚Äù Point 1: having not yet seen the later eating incident, I will say that people are comfortable giving a short answer while chewing. Point 2: going back to the idea that she physically respond to her own thoughts, the ‚ÄúNo‚Äù shake of the head could have been in response to her own statement of trying to get away from Johnny; ‚Äúno, it wasn‚Äôt possible to escape.‚Äù Baseline Observation: earlier you mentioned her baseline as eyes that constantly roam over the room (especially when she‚Äôs uncomfortable with questioning). Her response is so visceral here that she‚Äôs become laser focused on what‚Äôs in front of her. 
5. Of course I hit him, duh. You asked ‚Äúif this were in any other situation would you believe it?‚Äù No. But, abuse situations are very particular. If her allegations are true, she would do anything to back him up enough to close the door. And even then it would probably only give a short respite. Even though you say this answer is rehearsed. I contend that a moment ago (answer 4), she had laser focus, but by this she has returned to the roaming eyes baseline and stumbling over her words. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs as rehearsed as it looked on prior viewings. And she backs it up with a very clear non-verbal hand motion to push someone away. In a tussle that push could‚Äôve turned into an accidental hit. Clarification after listening to Q6: The next question makes it clear that this was not her hitting him with her hand, but with the door. That makes even more sense when you‚Äôre trying to shut the door and there‚Äôs a body blocking the way. It was an unintentional consequence of the moment.
6. I‚Äôm bored. All too frequently, the police and reporters get upset because abused women don‚Äôt respond the way they think women should. The women are excoriated for being either overly emotional or affectless. Each resulting in an accusation¬†of faking it. Whether it‚Äôs rape or physical abuse, many women realize the cards are stacked against them and adopt this flat affect of ‚Äúyou won‚Äôt believe me anyway.‚Äù Other times, that affect is shock. Plus, she‚Äôs beginning to see where the lawyer is going. So, you are right, she DOES NOT want to be here.
7. Did you say you didn‚Äôt intend to hit him? Depositions are high stress environments. She has already borne through a barrage of questions and emotions. At this point she could very well be reliving the moment through the fog of memory and just didn‚Äôt hear the exact words on the tape. It might not look good to the casual viewer, but this happens a lot.
8. Misrepresentation by deposing lawyer. Heard‚Äôs response corroborates everything I said earlier about defending against an abuser and how a door can be slammed in the heart of the moment. Yes she did realize she had made a mistake by losing focus, not by misstating. Her lawyer should inform her she has the right to request the tape be replayed.
9. The mouthful pause. As stated earlier. An in depth answer can‚Äôt be talked through as easily. She shouldn‚Äôt be eating, but this is a legitimate moment of having a lot to say and not wanting to do it while masticating. 
10. The whisper. Mock her for it, if you must. But her lawyer is right. These whispers are distracting & annoying. Consider though that she didn‚Äôt have the tantrum that you re-enacted. Her response was to let them say what was needed before she finished. And waiting through one whisper is not a delay tactic.
11. Asked and answered. You are 100% correct. This looks bad. It‚Äôs why lawyers ask yes/no questions. To get you to say something incriminating. Her lawyer‚Äôs job is to get her explanation on cross examination. If he were a better lawyer, he‚Äôd instruct her to answer yes or no & stop telling her to answer however she wants.
12. Johnny Depp section: how much baseline tape did you watch for Depp? A. He does that smile a few times. Are we right to so quickly discount duper‚Äôs delight? B. I think he does throw in lots of excess details. He‚Äôs just more smooth about it. C. Mellow. I knew a guy in the 70‚Äôs who won most of his court cases by taking a quaalude beforehand. The opposing attorneys could never rattle him as he was unshakeable in his demeanor & delivery. D. Not mentioned in your video, but worth noting about both parties; abusers are incredibly charming and winsome when on display. They don‚Äôt present in public as the monsters they are.",Warren Cancilla,0,2020-11-02T02:48:44Z
8151,UgwvuoqPBTuW5GrxYoJ4AaABAg,"Witching this actually makes me feel relieved that I left an abusive relationship. She is exactly how my ex was.

Never for a second did I think that he was ever abusive towards her. You can see at that event at the end of the video that he looked very nervous to be around her.",Georgia Stergiadis,0,2020-11-01T21:45:17Z
8152,UgzeHgZH8H8GAF_uLAd4AaABAg,"23:53 - The difference between Amber Heard's details and Johnny Depp's details go deeper than that. It's not merely that Amber adds details that ""don't need to be there"" - she adds and emphasises details that shift the focus away from the facts of the case, and towards her victimhood and/or self-righteousness. 

This is the primary difference between the abuser's ""side of the story"" vs the victim's. See, I would actually argue that Amber doesn't actually give detailed accounts at all - most of her details are vague. She doesn't remember exactly how things happened, who was there, what exactly Johnny did or how exactly she responded. Note that by the end of that long-winded explanation she still has no answer for the lawyer's question (Did you hit Johnny with a closed fist, yes or no?) But what she *does* vividly recount is the way she *felt* justified at the time because of the perceived threat to her sister's wellbeing, and she repeats this three or four times with unbridled conviction so that the audience can be sure to sympathise with her. It's a classic trick to emotionally manipulate the audience into feeling sorry for you. 

Real victims, on the other hand, usually want the truth to be judged for what it is, and for their own vindication to feel justly earned. They will recount in detail the *facts* of the case - who was where, what was said, what exactly happened. This is the contrast we see in Johnny Depp's vs Amber Heard's testimony. Real victims are able to deliver details about context, facts, exact words, exact actions, because they know that these details vindicate them. Fake victims are - at least subconsciously - aware of how bad their actions would look in full context, so they flub away as much of it as they can and keep the focus on the authenticity of their *emotional response,* and hope nobody notices the difference.

Warning: if you are in or have just managed to escape an abusive familial situation, some of the articles may hit quite close to home for you.",Sneezy Reviews,104,2020-11-01T20:34:15Z

8188,UgwXlEQT4ijIyi5Iihl4AaABAg,"I love your show!!  But I must disagree to a certain extent.  Not with your professional assessment as you are excellent at your job!!  I just believe because everyone was so emotional regarding the way Amber was that they missed a ton!  I believe they were both abusive and his nice guy act is actually just that..acting.  Your right I have watched several videos of Amber and see always seems to stumble her words..almost like she is confused.  But I noticed with her that she is very defensive, and almost masculine that is also a common thing in her interviews.  She has a sort of defense mechanism that shows off as masculinity and she attempts for it to appear as power but I am not buying it.  

I am not pledging her innocence, however, I believe he is being protected and not completely honest.  Johnny Depp may speak softly, but he has some interesting dark things in his past and behavior that cannot be ignored.  I believe she was being vengeful which is evil, but he is not that innocent.  He has said some awful things about his sexes and his behaviors do not seem to line up with the character he portrays in front of the world stage.

8199,UgwIt4nYmjA1_3uGdyN4AaABAg,In these situations I do belive they do need to look at the past of the person being accused in this case johnny Depp! And what I mean by that is hes been out with loads of women and not one has ever said what she is saying here I watched a video clip of of a fight in their kitchen I think it was and she was causing everything ! I have sadly over 13 year experience of narsassision and she is definitely a narcissist! Have any previous partners of hers come forward because they should ! I can see right through her I know she is an actress but she actually isnt that good because she is not convincing one bit but to people who dont know them it's hard for them to judge I was attacked once for nothing! And the police were called and because the narsassist was that convincing because that's all they know and all they have done all their life he was belived and I was completely innocent of everything but because they didnt know them took their word that it hadnt happend I was shoved over a wall and to stop myself from falling tried  grabb onto them to stop me falling  I scraped them yet I had bruises all up my arms on my face I basically had many many Mark's yet they had a single scratch from my fingernail ! Amber you are a narcissist fact ! Sorry to ramble great vid just to add I am aware that people can act differently with different partners interestingly this is why everyone is so hooked on the watts case because they belive they see someone harmless who has never acted violent etc but I disagree I think watts cleverly convinced alot of people he even brought up the fact he convinced his teacher once that he had to china and he was proud of that fact which tells me instantly hes knows how act and play the situation to his own,Katy waffling mama,0,2020-10-27T12:03:36Z

If she was more abused though (which I think may be likely when Johnny was drinking)... I wouldn't want to be in court to defend myself again either and be retraumatized over and over by reliving the abusive relationship...as lawyers make the same kinds of accusations that the abuser did in harsh tones.   CPTSD of victims CAN look like how Amber is acting...flustered, confused, brain fog, stress, distracted, disinterested, trying to escape mentally.  Real victims are NOT always sure they were being abused because of the emotional and mental manipulations by the abuser that make them think it's their own fault.  So if you aren't confident (many abused people aren't), you wouldn't show a lot of conviction about the messy relationship being all the abuser's fault.

8323,UgzdFiGfGbYbMT1lhwd4AaABAg,"I was abused as a child then I was abused in a long term relationship. I have PTSD and anxiety from the violence. My ex was handsome, had a hero complex and most likely a sociopath that without effort or remorse made himself look like a victim. In private he was very abusive, aggressive, and threatening. Being abused and gaslighted. I believed, and he proved to me many times, that he could make anyone believe that I was the aggressor even with my family and friends. I didn't seem credible to anyone because I was already defeated. I used too many details and people picked me apart.
If she is already mentally defeated: 
I see the eating and nonchalant attitude as stuffing down anxiety and mental self protection against being rejected because she is already self defeated. 
I see that she thinks if she admits to hitting that she will be preseived as the monster that hit the beloved. 
I see the her anger rise when speaking of protecting her sister. This shows that she has 0 self esteem to defend herself but will fight to protect her loved one.
I see her confidence in public with him as her trying to present herself with dignity because in public an abuser will usually not show any aggression in public and it is the time where the abused can feel some personal strength and put a wall up so they don't completely fall apart in front of others. I also believe it is a gesture saying  ""you haven't broken me yet"" in a visceral way. Although you are very broken.
I do believe the relationship revved up to a level of abuse most likely became mutual
I see Depp's as the truth in that recollection of time but that doesn't speak to what happened before or after she threw the bottles at him.

8349,UgyJFENoXgMhB1bTpI94AaABAg,"The degree of misogyny BY WOMEN towards this woman is mind-bending. I would expect women to be a little more perceptive. I did a pretty detailed critique of this guy's analysis of Amber's body language in a previous comment today. You might want to read it. THIS IS WHY WOMEN WHO ARE ABUSED DON'T TELL ANYONE. Look at how you people responded. Does she act weird? Yes! But why and in what ways? God, I hope none of you are in social services, a teacher, law enforcement, are judges or work with kids. You are clueless. Until I saw this video, based on news stories I'd read, I also thought she was just saying she was abused in order to get money out of the divorce, and maybe she was attention seeking. Now, I can CLEARLY see she WAS abused, worn down, used up, and tired of answering questions from people who already made up their minds about her. She isn't the sharpest tack in the box and so she shoots herself in the foot during this deposition. And that's sad. The comments I am reading here are just plain ignorant and cruel. But that's what ""social media"" is famous for, isn't it?",HTNPSullivan,0,2020-10-15T04:29:32Z
8350,UgyrPIbBkSsA9uBW8SN4AaABAg,"Wow, this guy is such a poor reader of body language. Let me count the ways... 

Regarding the first observation during the deposition. She nods ""yes"" to ""do you understand the question?,"" and is actually saying ""no"" in answer to the question itself!, as in ""No, I didn't physically abuse him."" So, that's a big miss by this presenter.  

Regarding the ""mouth shrugs"" - I don't think she's trying to ""come up with a story,"" I think she's trying to find the right words -- as in, ""yes there were physical confrontations, but I wasn't the aggressor, i was trying to protect myself."" My sense is that this person isn't terribly bright or articulate and under pressure, even if what she's saying is truthful, she doesn't have confidence in her ability to convince other people, that she already feels like people don't believe her. 

About eating -- she's eating because she's nervous. Good God, that's such a common thing, how can this guy misinterpret it? Granted, it's WEIRD to eat during a deposition, but it's the equivalent of biting your nails. Good old Freud would tell you it's a throwback to being a baby and needing to put something in your mouth when you're anxious, i.e. your mother's breast (thus all the ""oral fixation"" theories about why people smoke or overeat).  

Also, this is important --  I was in a (verbal/psychologically) abusive relationship for 11 years. Very bad shit happens to your self-image and confidence when you are abused over time. Like shame. Especially when the abuser is well liked, and therefore people don't believe you when you make the rare attempt to describe what's going on behind closed doors. I cannot begin to tell you how lame I sounded the few times I tried to explain how my ex chipped away at me on a daily basis. He was very talented at constant and classic ""gaslighting."" 

If you had told me I would someday let someone with a highschool education, a ""recovering"" alcoholic who worked in a convenience store/cleaned offices at night/took care of a disabled man part-time -- despite being very intelligent, attractive,  articulate and able-bodied (versus my 30 years as a reporter and teacher, with a degree from an ivy league university, and a published photographer, and a Garden Master for a community garden I built in 2008) make me feel like dirt under his shoes, I would have laughed at you. But narcissists are very good at finding the places where you are NOT confident and really ripping away at those wounds until you feel like you are stupid and helpless. This is how they feel better about themselves.

As for the time she ate something (again, that's nerves and frustration) and she takes time to chew - that's not ""what a pause!,"" she just that second put the friggin food in her mouth. Nobody but a two-year old would attempt to talk right after putting something in her mouth. Duh. 

And as for avoiding the ""yes or no"" question, f*ck the person asking it. You don't answer a ""yes or no"" question about punching someone. That's like, ""Yes or no,"" have you stopped beating your wife?"" when you never hit your wife in the first place. I agree with her counsel - answer the way you want to. ""Yes or no"" is a bullying tactic. 

And finally, Johnny Depp's body language while being interviewed in Japan may or may have had more to do with how much he had to drink by that time of the day, or how wasted he was the night before. Anyone who's known a chronic drinker/drug-abuser, which even Depp would say he is, should recognize the body language. Please also bear in mind what a good actor he is in his films. He certainly could fake sincerity during a deposition, and he's at an advantage because he's much better known and loved by movie goers than Amber. 

This is a terrible, terrible analysis. And if you think I am biased because I was abused (Mr. Wrong is now long gone -- after my having a stress induced heart attack and surgery, and finally finding my courage. He left pre-pandemic lockdown, thank God!), let me say this -- previous to watching this video, I believed Amber was a money-grabbing, publicity-seeking liar. I'd read some pretty negative stuff about her, and the few quotes from her I read sounded fishy. But watching this actually changed my mind!

Her looking around the room all the time isn't ADHD or drugs? She's been on a Provigil script since her early twenties. Relevant provigil side effects: nervousness, anxiety, agitation, dry mouth You should do your homework on your victims before victim blaming in your videos.
You point out her answering a question while eating and the first instance she has the food in her mouth longer before the question is even asked than second time when the question is asked simultaneous to the food reaching her cheak, yet you don't point the timing out. Next video, you shovel food in your face while talking, see what happens.
You ask ""Why is she so disinterested in being there if she's the victim?"" Clearly you have no understanding of her position and zero empathy .  They are interogating her and their sole role is to try to incriminate her, not to support her. I was in a situation just like hers, where I was trying to escape behind a door while be attacked, and I was railroaded and victimized by the justice department because the attacker fell and hurt themselves, and after hurting themselves they continued to hurl themselves at the door, and like Johnny Depp they were A) on drugs at the time of the attack and B) calm and collected when they gave their wholly bogus statement to the police, and then the officer was calm and non-expressive when he gave his misrepresentation of my statement to the court. Liars can be very calm and non expressive, especially under the influence or when they have no emotional investment in the lie because they know from their own experience they will get away with it. The police force this cop was on blew up a guys house to catch one shoplifter and got away with it, then when laws were passed in Colorado to make police accountable the city council of that town said ""Nah, we won't make them accountable, state laws don't apply to us""...but that's another story. Johnny Depp is a life long drug user, his reactions and mannerisms are drug induced. You introduce a public appearance at the end and completely misread it: Johnny is looking down because A) everyone around him is five foot tall  B) he has ADHD.

As a DV survivor myself I am thankful for people calling her out because it makes me furious she is lying about this and I recognize all of the traits of a victim in him watching their dynamic as well. She never looked better in her life then when she was with him and that is very typical of abusers because they are getting their supply and what an ego boost he must have been to get.

Sadly some people just aren't suited to each other, and that's always apparent when people can have a string of perfectly normal relationships, yet can fall into one and it can literally alter the way a person reacts. 

Amber is a drama queen, and knows how to trigger guys, and importantly, cares to when it suits her. The fact Depp was married for, what, nearly two decades and his ex has never claimed he was violent says a lot. I've no doubt Depp was pushed to be more angry than any of his past girlfriends or wife ever experienced makes sense because of what Amber does, and is capable of. 

The truth will be revealed when she comes out and confesses a future boyfriend or husband is violent! I've no doubt their relationship was genuine in many respects, but I'm convinced, probably like most, that he was as much a means to advance her career as he was a partner. 

She absolutely will trigger a future partner; this won't be the last time she claims someone's been violent towards her. The fact she punched a boyfriend/husband says a lot. Punching a partner is outright unacceptable irrespective of gender. I don't care about Depp; I'm not defending a star who I'm a fan of. 

Amber is big trouble, and she needs to be extremely careful and a lot more wiser about who she's with, and certainly who she marries in future.

I do not see why our host is unable to understand this simple and common combination of verbal and nonverbal communication.  He even says that it is ""two distinct communication devices that are used one right after the other, rather than at the same time.""  Yet he fails to consider that they might be two separate communications, answering the two separate questions she has been asked.  This is something that I consider painfully obvious, all that is required is to watch the video while listening to the audio. 

     At this point, I thought that there was little point in my watching the rest of the video.  I thought that there was no way the host could regain my confidence in their ability or lack of bias, and I was wrong.  Other than that gaff at the start, the worst thing I could say is that the host might not have been charitable enough when assessing Ms. Heard's reaction to some confusingly framed questions.  But that is not a real complaint, that would just be me trying to find falt in order to support a cherished conclusion.  Seriously, I saw no flaw in anything else, including his choice of how to read her reaction to the questioning.

The last segment is her trying to make sure he doesn't show himself up. The first part is her justification of dealing with her anger about being in a relationship with an addict. They are both at fault but unless you've lived with an addict, you can't blame the other partner, especially an inexperienced one 20 years younger and millions of dollars poorer of being the controller.

Not to mention psychological TORMENT, gas lighting and mental and verbal abuse which i would rather take twice the amount of physical to not have had the mental emotional and verbal. Well I never reported him, when he broke up with me and already had a new girlfriend i tried to report him and no one believed me because i hid his abuse so god damn well so my friends and family wouldnt hate him (because he had trained me so well) So then i tried to tell his new girlfriend my story and they got a restraining order against me for harrassing them. Really i scared the girl because in an effort to try to prove that he was a fraud i guessed all the spots in town he was taking her to hang out (because it was where he took me and acted like they were special spots he only went alone) Well instead of seeing he was full of shit she thought i was following them around which although i fully admit i was insane I WASNT THAT INSANE! Anyways my reason for this long ass story is that i have been abused about as bad as a person can be abused and ITS REAL ABUSE THAT I HAVE YET TO RECOVER FROM NEARLY TWO YEARS LATER.

8446,Ugw0SzjfsD3TzAvDHVB4AaABAg,"Her bored, defiant behavior (which, btw, wasn't at ALL hidden and was loudly broadcasting an intended message) could have been because she was being questioned by Depp's lawyer to make her look guilty. It could easily be a passive aggressive move expressing contempt for having to, once again, defend herself.  I don't know if that is what is going on but I don't think this guy interpreting her actions has thought about all the possibilities. He definitely isn't analyzing her body language objectively. It seems he had made up his mind about her from the beginning.

Her ""defensive move"", for example, could have been to ward off the perceived attack she felt she was under by Depp's lawyer and all the other people who don't believe her. She could have been trying to push a memory away -one of Depp arguing that she clocked him with a closed fist. Did she or didn't she? I don't know. But those defensive moves don't automatically equate to lying.

Her long pause while she chewed could have been to, yes, collect her thoughts because she didn't want to say, ""Yes, I've hit him."" when that statement doesn't present the truth. The truth could easily have been, ""Yes, I've hit him... once, when he was attacking me and my sister on a stair landing and he was about to push her down the stairs for protecting me."" If that's the truth, who could blame her for wanting to say it and NOT have her mouth full of food?!

It also helps that she was accusing Johnny Depp, a person who's been in the public eye for decades and as far as I know , widely documented by his ex's and colleagues for being the nicest person.  

If you're going to accuse someone of being a monster , you should at least pick someone that could plausibly be one. That being said , if Depp hadn't recorded his conversation with her admitting abuse, the court of public opinion would most likely have sided with her and crucified him, which they almost did.",VI5H,0,2020-10-08T07:05:41Z

I think he seems to have problems with alcohol but that doesn't mean he's abusive. I just don't see him being the abuser here.

He wants and needs to tell the truth, but he knows she‚Äôll be in deep shiznit if he does. 
Also, I believe it‚Äôs worth mentioning, at the end of the clip, when he says ‚Äúmy girl and I were thinking of going to the country‚Äù, or something along those lines, this is not verbatim, he is clearly feeling her condescending and controlling non verbal behavior and he includes her, I‚Äôd say forcefully, in the conversation only to show her that she is number one in his heart and very important, but also to try and avoid any possible fight that might arise from this situation once they‚Äôre alone in the hotel room.

8485,UgydwpZ_O9EZlQmYrZh4AaABAg,"End of 6:42, I believe beside the points u mentioned she also display tension, anxiety, stress. The way she look around also can be base on how she rethink something, she might have worse memory than most people or thinking or memory issue but that doesnt only conclude to the one youre saying as in this video. Your comments on this are all very narrowed into only 1 degree of cause and have no intention of widening it for other aspect. The ability to concentrate also display on Amber throughout her life on interviews.

End of  8:20, its very true on what you said but also it could due to implication on the careful selection on her words, also could due to the bad experience she had been through, also could due to the drugs she was using throughout her career, literally the range is pretty wide. She might even feel uncomfortable trying to rethink that bad experience she might even hurt herself much by saying that out because feeling might still exist between her and her ex husband..
 You assumption and read on her might be accurate but in this video u did not fully explain other implication, its like in this video ure just giving her a death sentence, u know? 2 strike that fast into 8 minutes. Im no expert like u but I do have some years in psychology.. Signs and reading are not always the best to establish a character especially if u have nothing 100% to set a standard with for herself.

End of 9:20, very well said and professional that is the kind of reading that should be conclude in the fairness of all parties instead of just giving a death sentence immediately without exploring other possibilities.. 

End of 10:02 base on what you said, why cant she be eating food? Does it have any concern? It doesn't. Ppl can request to eat and drink while getting questioned in a court room as long as it doesnt pose a threat or danger or as of a disturbance to that of the hearing. Follow by what u said ppl believe that food buying her time etc. This shouldnt even be considerate in a video like this BASE on your profession because u can do basic reading as of later as she eat and the comments like this is really passing her a death sentence and u mentally prepared and misled us viewers her intention of being a fraud.

End of 16:42, against biased assumption by u. U have to understand the natural of court rules when ure being questioned. Anything sensitive enough to trigger another legal concern or implication of the case should always be pause and answer correctly , wit hthe right choice of words, also ppl will tend to look into their defender eyes to see if it's ok to answer or sign to answer it in another way whether be it a lie, or truth, the concern here is to pick every words carefully thus, the pause because the question is sensitive enough to trigger other implication and the final verdict of the case.

18:32 ure laughing constantly like Amber is a joke. True as of this video as in all other 95% of the cases out there. Im sry but have u attended a court before with ur patient? Or just normal civil hearing? Ppl tend to answer in longer question, again, this might be they are making stuffs up just to try to convince everyone in that room this is call DEFENSIVE STANCE. The very basic of all human natural.. At this point of time taken this long into the hearing she might already be in another mode incontrast to fight or flight mode, defensive stance is alrdy triggered. Nth will stop her defending herself by misleading unless she is properly trained and advise with a representative beside her if she request. So why are u laughing this bad against the clip? Is it really that funny that she display her defense stance and talk right out of topic?  Youre a body language analyst and you said right in the video youre ""frustrated"" by that? Then what is your limit? This is only 18:51 into the video and u said ure annoyed by that.. How much time limit u given ur patient usually? 10 mins or 5 before they annoyed/frustate u sir?

Sry I cant watch this any longer, I know most ppl on internet does not study psychology or even close to understanding/read a person until their frontal cortex develop and mature but I have to say this video is VERY BIASED and does not really fit well with the title itself. Maybe the title should be something like ""Body Language REACTS to Amber Heard's false cringe statement | Faces Episode 15"" .. Why? Cause everything is against her, its not an ANALYSIS at all it's call biased..

PS: I do not know how this video is recommended for me. I am not Johnny Depp or Amber Heard fanboy I do not care about them Im not here to judge u nor ur video however I find it least interesting for someone to comment on something with the least amount of effort and with only 1 direction towards them. You seems to dress nicely you seems to have knowledge about body language, please represent the world of psychology analyst in a proper manner sir. Video title is really important too if u not gonna do a serious 360 analysis then do not misled ppl just for your views. I seriously doubt the legitimacy of your background, tbh I did a little linkin search and return with no results. Maybe it's for the viewers, the money, whatever it is it has nth to do with me but using a point from analyst and then throw everyone under the bus with biased assumption is really bad. I hope ppl read this and understnad that do take this channel as a grind of salt,  reading a person is not only base on their body language and it can never be that is why in courtroom body language can NEVER be use as a form of evidence. IF ANYTHING then body language is use to extrapolate and exploit a person but never as a judgement moreover a BIAS one..",Jason Hong,3,2020-10-07T13:17:06Z

The lawyers and whoever else was not visible were talking over each other and trying to figure out who was asking what was confusing to me, the viewer.  The woman who said The question required a yes/no answer was correct.  Amber should have said yes and then her lawyer would have a chance to give her an opportunity to explain..

8507,Ugz7i5HutN9i2ghw0N94AaABAg,"Okay so I tried to post this and it was too long but I have to get this out there. 

(Sorry guys! Please don't hate on me- but as a person who genuinely struggles with nonverbal miscommunications while everyone is just so quick to jump on bandwagons and assumptions and stuff it's damaging. really damaging. and it's a legit struggle for me. Nonverbals really don't always have to show what a person is thinking or how they feel. at least for me it really doesn't and I always get insulted when people assume I just want to write this for anyone else out there who is like me and has been misjudged or just idk what even to call it. People just love to make assumptions and idk if Amber really is acting I want to advocate for everyone who actually are being genuine and people want to just assume because they really don't understand..I LOVE Johnny Depp. Hands down team Johnny. So please don't come for me. ).

I also trip over my words and look around when I'm speaking. It helps us think because the barrier between the connection of thought and the actual product of the words and emotions aren't always matching. It's a disconnect. Like her base line is my base line. Doesn't mean she's a liar because of it. She's nervous. Naturally very nervous which means she's been through some shit. 

Looking around the room when someone talks to you also shows anxiety. The disconnect between the yes and no thing, I do that too. 

I do think this is a different situation but that's because if she is like me she definitely hit him. there's no way- she's very emotional, probably can't collect her thoughts, probably a very anxious and nervous person in general daily life. 

Shrugging shows neutrality in my opinion. Like ""oh yeah well I don't really have an opinion about it/don't think about it too much"" DOES NOT MEAN she's manipulating or anything. Actually it's a very strong defense when people get particular accusatory tones. 

That female Lawyer tone is SO accusatory. Let's look at nonverbal sure but let's look at WHY she would act nonverbally like that. 1. That ladies tone even triggers me. I want to smack her because it's a type of tone that's like ""uh huh sure you definitely are guilty of hurting Johnny Depp"" without being actually neutral. You can hear it in her voice with the way that lady said ""YoU DoN'T UnDeRsTaNd ThE QuEsTiOn?""  LIKE WOMAN TO WOMAN WHAT ARE YOU DOING FEMALE LAWYER. CHECK YOURSELF. 

Let's talk about the mouth. ""Mouth Shrugs"" ok. Maybe she is actually surprising emotions. I do that. I will get a rise or a sudden spike  in my emotions which then causes them to make my eyes tears up and my lip pout. What do I always do? I shrug with my mouth because I don't want to make a scene. A way to detach and try to control the emotions.  Trying to remember something that caused any kind of emotion causes that. Sometimes tears don't even fill my eyes. My lip just quivers. 

THE FOOD? omg. I have been abused all of my life. Yes, while what you're saying about the food here could be true for her try to picture it yourself. (NOT FOR AMBER JUST FOR A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE) Let's say you went through something traumatic- which myself and many other women and men have and again everyone is different- you had to deal with it how ever many years ago. Then it goes to court and it's a LONG process for that to happen. You finally have to relive all of your trauma. Idk about others. But for me- When I went through that.  didn't eat properly and couldn't sleep until that date. In the interview there were snacks. It's a comfort thing because it's traumatic to even step foot in the same place as your potential abuser. I definitely nibbled because it's a nervous habit and nothing at all like what could be going on here.

I remember when my dad met his mistress, he went with me to see her and we went to the mall, and met coincidently to his colleague, him asking my father, ""are they your wife and daughter ?"" or are you with your family.. something like that. I was about to say no, she is not my mom. but dad interrupt me.
I remember they took me to the mistress house. I left alone in the living room, she bought me toys (piano toys and comic books, my mom threw them all later on) so I played alone.

before they officially divorced, dad asked me if I want to live with him. I was the closest child to him, I am middle child of 3. and now I really feel betrayed. no one knew what happened to me when I was child. I told everyone when I was 30 or late 20s. no one knew that, nor my mom or my siblings. because mom said, when I was in middle school dad said to her (years after divorced dad visited once in while), I was not like I used to be, I was not that close to dad anymore, not clinging to him anymore, I shut him off,  I was like different person (because I already felt betrayed at that time). I never knew dad thought like that to me, so I told mom everything. as much as I could remember.

I am not a victim of domestic abuse, I only witnessed the process how my parents divorced. and I could remember, I say, quite good detail.

She is looking down at him because her eyes are inches higher and they are standing close.  I am not sure what depo this was, I haven't followed the case.  I am assuming this is the depo she gave when HE sued HER for defamation.  Of course, she doesn't want to be there and he does.  Of course, she is irritated.    He won 50 million earlier this year.  Maybe she should've cared a little more.  Like I said, I love Johnny Depp but the man has pickled his brain.",Paint Pink,0,2020-10-06T00:08:26Z

I always tried to relay my experience to others in a way I thought that they would be more comfortable,  if that makes sense.  I didn't want to make others uncomfortable with my pain and trauma. I dissociate when I talk about it like it's not a big deal or make light of it,  but its always in my effort to make sure I'm not making them feel uncomfortable or feel bad for me.
Edit:  Also,  I just realized the incident she's referring to at around 12:32 and later,  she's bold face lying.  JD was the one who was trying to get away from her by locking himself in the bathroom,  and SHE is the one trying to get in.  She pushes the bathroom door open,  he tries to keep her out by pushing the door back in her direction the door then goes over her toes,  he bends down to check on her toes and she slams the door into his head,  and then punches him in the face.

She is eating food to upset people and distract issues to her benefit like a little kid. No maturity. The sooner you learn that adults can behave like three-year-olds in a really dangerous way the better, it saves you from a lot of harm. 

Upset/annoyed people concentrate less, especially when they are against you. People like her are the best teacher for yourself re emotional self-discipline. She is used to get out of situations by her looks, she doesn't care about manners or a good personality. Because she was rarely held accountable, I guess.

8591,UgzH9P2jxXtNvTDFiHt4AaABAg,"First off, I also don't think she is totally innocent and that some of her appearance or behavior is contradictory to her words, BUT I like to be fair and I do think that some things she does that you point out, are explainable in a different way. For one thing, I think her whole cool and kind of bored impression can also be grounded on being fed up with the whole thing (the trial and attention and all) and yes, she surely doesn't like doing the questioning but that doesn't mean she is (all) guilty does it? 
Also, there is this thing a lot of people often disinterpret on people, it's when people seem to not care or play cool and arrogant and actually they are unsure and maybe not fine with themselves- which could still point to a certain guilt on her side but it could also not do. But to be fair here again, I have to say that seeing more clips of her,  I'd say, in her case, she probably is somewhat arrogant and selfrighteous but let us still not forget that arrogant appearance actually often does *not* mean that the person doesn't care!
To the scene on the red carpet- I do get dominant vibes from her but in no way can one judge from this scene that she is bad to him through out the whole relationship. Also let us not forget that Johnny mostly appears rather shy or calm in public and not exactly extroverted. And, she is taller than him and also wears high heels so it would be difficult for her to not look down on him. XD I only get some tension vibes here which can be grounded on quarrel they had before but that doesn't have to mean it was physical.
Frankly, I just don't think you should state that she or he *must* be guilty, personally I think it is the most plausible that they both were violent against each other and in the end there is a court and a judgement for a reason.",Jul H,0,2020-10-02T23:35:52Z

There is a lot of guilt and shame that the victims feel which is why this type of abuse is so horrible. Take for example children of abusive parents who grow up blaming themselves. We can guess what her body language might be saying but this is ambiguous as she may be re-experiencing past trauma whilst she is talking about it. There are so many reasons for her body language to be off. People behave differently under pressure or when being watched.  NO ONE knows what happened in their relationship.

8795,UgwFddAmFFUR2h8HO4Z4AaABAg,"I honestly think that you were a little critical of the defensive responses she was giving. 

First of all, I want to clarify that I don't know much about this situation and I definitely find some of her affect, particularly the lack of caring she is showing here and the mouth-full pauses, kinda sus. 

But also, I am looking at this from a victim's advocate perspective. I have a background as a legal advocate for victims of domestic violence, SA, and human trafficking. It is not uncommon for victim-survivors to have a defensive reaction when pressed about these circumstances. This is largely because of the stigma surrounding being a victim and the way that the legal system can treat victims.

You point out her defensive 'palms-out' response when she is being asked about the recordjng in which she admits to hitting Johnny with a door. Her response is that yes, she did, but it was because she was in a situation where he was trying to break into a room she was trying to hide in, and she feared for her imminant safety. The attorney who was addressing her very clearly wanted her to answer with no context, and simply say ""yeah I hit Johnny with a door."" Which ultimately is a statement that without context, creates a narrative that she was abusive towards him, instead of the other way around. She is defending her statement that she was doing this and self-defense, from an attorney who was asking a question that is designed to cast doubt on whether or not she was telling the truth about her victimhood.

Another point that you reference is around the 18:30 mark, where instead of directly answering the attorney's question about whether or not she has hit Johnny Depp with a closed fist, she tells a story leading up to it. Again, I think that this is similar to the situation above, where this attorney is asking questions that specifically are designed to cast out onto whether or not she is a victim. I think that anyone in that circumstance would feel defensive. Sometimes, defensiveness isn't because of guilt, it's because it's what you've had to do to survive and get this far. In fact, if she wasn't defensive about the circumstances of those questions, I would find it a lot more suspicious.

I've been in many courtrooms with victims of domestic violence, as a supporting advocate. And I will definitely say that there are parts of this deposition that align with what I have seen from victims of these types of crimes. I will also say that there are some things that she does in this deposition that definitely DON'T align. 

If I had to make a complete guess, as an outsider just solely watching this deposition, my conclusion would be that she is telling the truth about being the victim here. But, I also get the sense that she also had abusive tendencies or behaviors that she doesn't want people knowing about. But of course, I really want to underline, that even with my experience, there is no way that I can make that claim with 100% certainty. If is entirely a hunch based on my experience, observation, and opinion.

I love your content, and I really love the way that you approach these things in a very non-biased way. But I also feel that there may have been some missed nuance in the way that these types of cases present themselves, especially in the legal system.

8857,UgxUHAXJUVt6gwS6aTt4AaABAg,"Very biased delivery. I mean, she shows some signs of what you are describing, but only in like 20% of your statements. 80% are non-issues.
From your analysis, you would conclude she's guilty, even when we would switch the facts in this video to show she is innocent. Like... You first decided she is guilty and then you interpret her behavior with that result. ""Oh, she thinks before she speaks? She must be guilty. Surely she is creating a lie instead of trying to remember."" You judge every ""insignificant behavior"" like that. While at the same time missing/ignoring the logical inconsistencies in her statements, which point to her guilt more objectively. After seeing this video, I am very glad ""feeling shamans"" are not an accepted method to prove guilt or innocence.
Not to mentions you have trouble following what is going on in the video. Which is surprising, since the video is edited. Like she gets 2 questions at the same time: ""did you commit domestic violence"" followed by ""do you understand the question"". And she replies to both - first she nods as in ""yes, I understand the question"" and then answers ""No, I did not commit domestic violence"" - which you seem to be very confused by; or she whispers and they tell her she should not whisper - and you flip it like she's complaining that there is whispering in the room - that only happened in your head.

And, where Johnny is looking to her for validation...watching for Amber's approval/disapproval.

That scene wouldn't have been uncovered/discovered if the interviewer were putting the questions towards Amber as Johnny would have simply taken it all in, as a majority of men do when in abusive relationships.

I think that many men defer to the wife to answer questions from the public to such a degree that the public bypasses men/husbands and simply asks the wife/woman the questions, to the point of the woman speaking on behalf of the man.

I remember my abusive ex chiding me after eating at restaurants telling me that I have no business ordering food for myself as I am consistently ordering bizarre food that I don't enjoy eating.

8889,UgyoPe0Q1VY95TOtgEp4AaABAg,"Regarding the eating-thing. I do agree with people who say that they probably gave her food to buy her time to think out answers. You can see it a few times when she conveniently takes a bite just as she is asked a question.
That aside though, I think it works to her disadvantage in general here. As a survivor of domestic violence myself, I know for a fact that there is no way I could be eating or snacking while discussing what I have been through - and this despite the fact that I am an emotional eater and use food to self-soothe. If I am put in a position to recall and re-tell my experience, my emotional response would be so strong that I actually lose my appetite, again; despite being an emotional eater. The fact that she can sit there and casually snack while talking about this tells me a lot already.

Also just looking at her face, I feel like she has those moments when she suddenly remembers ""Oh, right, I'm supposed to look sad"" and then she tries to make a sad face before going back to just looking bored. Neither does she ever look scared. I don't know if Johnny is actually present during these interrogations, but even if he wasn't, I feel like she would have an emotional response to having to re-live these experiences through these interrogations. It has been years since I left my ex-husband, and I would say that I have ""recovered"" quite well since then, but if I had to talk about what happened, I still get an emotional response from it and I can still feel the fear that I felt while going through these experiences, even all these years later. The fact that she can sit there and look bored while talking about something that was supposedly really traumatizing, again, speaks volumes. And don't even get me started on her smirking..

Johnny comes off as a lot more genuine to me. Yes, he smiles and laughs while talking as well, but I don't get the feeling that it comes from a place of him actually thinking it's funny or that he's winning and got everyone fooled (like Amber's smirk does). In his case, it feels more like he's trying to wrap his mind around the absurdity of everything she's done, like ""I can't believe this actually happened and I can't believe it happened to Me"". I also think it might be a nervous response. When I went through a traumatic event many years ago, I was laughing and cracking jokes right after it happened. It wasn't because I thought it was funny (quite the opposite), but I think a reaction to the shock and a way of trying to protect myself from the trauma. Once it actually sunk in what had happened, is when I had the ""normal"" response that someone would expect from a traumatic event (crying and depression). I think that is what was happening with Johnny in this interrogation; it was a nervous response and a way to distance himself from the trauma of what he has been through. And that is entirely different from the smirking coming from Amber through this; she is clearly not reacting to trauma. Nothing about her behaviour would suggest that to me.

Lastly, the clip of the two of them together. I have been noticing in a lot of photos of the two of them together that Johnny has that blank hollow look in his eyes when next to her, whereas her stance next to him really suggests that she is the dominant one in the relationship. She definitely doesn't look like someone who is afraid of her husband, not even a little bit. I think in this clip to, I feel like when he looks at her, he looks at her for confirmation. It's not like someone looking at the person they love, it feels more like he is seeking her approval. If he indeed was the abuser, he wouldn't look at her like that because he wouldn't need her approval for anything. And if she was as terrified of him as she claims, she would be shrunk over next to him, she wouldn't stand tall and confident, like she does.

Everyone in the room aside from her lawyer seems to be very visibly in belief that she is lying or holding something back, that she has acted violently upon Johnny multiple times. If she's innocent then this is a lie or a misrepresentation, and if you're a victim it's got to be incredibly tiring and frustrating and annoying to be constantly having to prove yourself as the victim, and to be asked the same questions multiple times, with less patience for the answer every time.

There were things that I noticed, that rang so untrue about AHs deposition, but it wasn't until you unpacked it and pointed out they why of it, that I realised I had reached the same conclusion without being able to verbalise why.
Johnny is such a gentle guy now, always not wanting to upset Pete or do anything wrong (I think probably because of his ""wild child"" past) that he was unfortunately a prime target for someone like AH who seems to manipulate people, the same way we breathe air.
Its a disgusting how Johnny was prejudged by social media and popular news media.
I think he didn't say anything in the beginning because of the stigma attached to being a male victim of DV  and he thought it would blow over.
But when his career was literally destroyed by AH he had to come forward to tell the truth, which must have been very difficult for him, as he's always seemed the private type.

He has always behaved in this way at different times, but as his age has advanced, the effects of a lifetime of substance abuses worsen.

Since finding your videos, I‚Äôve learned so much about body language in neurotypical people. Your videos have really helped me read others and sniff out bad intentions before I get hurt.

I do have to wonder what it would be like for you to analyze the body language of autistic people. It is generally different than expected and sometimes gives off the wrong impression to neurotypical people.

For example, I have a hard time looking people in the eye and get distracted by my surroundings a lot which, to typical people, looks like I‚Äôm nervous or lying. Another example is that I don‚Äôt gesture with my hands much and I have a flat affect (neutral facial expression and monotonous voice), especially when I‚Äôm tired.

And the way she looked at him the whole time really showed she was the dominant one. Something that I noticed about Johnny in each clip was that in the first one he was sober and really considered his words to make sure he got it right, and in the one with Amber, he seemed like he wasn't sober, he was slurring his speech and he was far less aware of what he was saying. He definitely wasn't in a healthy and coherent state, while Amber was clearly sober and she looked down on him. 

Johnny little smirk to me seemed like he was trying to find humour or he was disgusted by the reality of the situation, I've caught myself doing it during councilling sessions too, and it's really a way of acknowledging the incident, as of to finally say ""Yes, this happened."" Maybe he sees the rediculousness of the situation or just how horrible it was. It's also sometimes a feeling of overcoming a situation and feeling like it's in the past, but still very real, like it's an emotional moment to realise a detail or that it happened, and it's almost intriguing to compare the feelings of then and now, or the contrast between the situation then and the situation now.

Had I been the one questioning her, I would have said ‚Äúlet‚Äôs take a 5 minute break so your client can finish her meal because the eating and speaking simultaneously is rude and disrespectful to both me and the court reporter as it‚Äôs difficult to to hear what Ms Heard is saying with a mouth full of food.‚Äù

Though, from what I understand, it was difficult to get Amber to sit for the deposition and she and her counsel put up all kinds of stumbling blocks before they sat at the deposition table.  I‚Äôm sure Johnny‚Äôs attorney was looking forward to  questioning Amber and getting Amber to contradict herself, so she may have been willing to tolerate a bit of chewing.

It‚Äôs normal to have water, coffee, soft drinks, gum, mints, even hard candy is ok as long as the person keeps it under control and isn‚Äôt crunching and/or slurping.

From what I can see I can tell that Heard thinks that she is a better actress than she really is. Her conduct shows that she has narcissistic and antisocial personality traits. She can also exhibit violent conduct and other behavioral disorders, which she thinks are completely okay because she thinks it is always someone else's fault. There are definitely signs of disinhibition in her conduct which come across as a lack of respect towards the court as well as entitlement, which are traits often found in antisocial individuals. I believe that she is driven by the economic profit (which is usually the incentive of these personality disorders). She believes she is better than the rest of the people around her and she can manipulate everyone into thinking what she wants them to think. An that she is more clever than the others so that her reputation will not only remain intact, but also be even more loveable as a victim. And that Depp has a flawed control over reality due to his problems and more to lose due to exposure (that he will fear exposure) and therefore that it is not her fault, but he will let her get what she wants as a result of his cowardice.(that's what she believes) Depp exhibits psychomotor retardation which is a symptom.

She has made it harder for women who have been abused and at the same time brought forth more awareness of men being abused in relationships.  

She had an agenda when she married Depp. Her greed of money and fame. I don‚Äôt know for sure but it seem as though she was pushing him to the edge mentally too.

I question whether reading micro-expressions can be accurately applied to a domestic violence victim because all abusive relationships include psychological abuse, making the victim question their memory and experience of the relationship. This could cause them to be unsure of their own responses. I have accompanied many victims to court and they commonly have things with them to self-sooth because of the inner anxiety that they feel. I actually give them items to fidget with to help them in court. I also would caution anyone against saying things such as ‚Äùa real victim would not behave this way‚Äù or ‚Äùif she was a victim, she would behave this way‚Äù. Victims respond to trauma in very different ways. Some respond in what is seen as a ‚Äùtypical‚Äù way - frightened, teary, etc. Many victims respond to trauma by emotionally distancing themselves.

9839,UgyVDYhSizlUrcck3gx4AaABAg,"I get so annoyed when ppl dont get WHY ppl who've been through trauma like abusive relationship, (and I'm stating this from my earlier work as counselor, being a kid of violent mom who hit my dad and me being in a violent relationship for 7 of the 11years abusive and bit after, anywho, I've been lucky and had lots of counselling AND motivational speaker too, so I've dealt with it in many ways, especially as an observant) here you see 2 ppl who are far from having dealt with it 
But as a victim( I hate that word) the dupid delight smile can be 3 things!
 1. Coping mechanism. You make jokes, smile even laugh oddly in very inappropriate situation or when you're retelling about the hurtful situation! 
For if you are serious and sad everytime you have to explain certain aspect/situation of your life that was awful, you'd be afraid you'll but you're scared that IF you do get sad ,perhaps cry, the pain would never go away, so its easier to cope almost in non serious way! (Most men or women who's masculine (specially in front of other/s ) The body feel the pain again and by joking, laughing or smiling, it releases sometimes soothing feeling in your body like taking a puff from a smoke!  It's hard to explain but I've seen it on numerous victims and I still do it today(the  was the masculine type,but have become a crybaby, but rarely when I gotta explain about that part of my life, I think I'm still afraid the pain will reappear and never dissapear (I know the pain have already become bearable,and I'm.I'm.even mad at my ex or myself anymore(only the part where the kids were inflicted) and its 14 year ago I left the twat!And I've heard men say the same and handful women, but it depends on stages of the healing) IF the healing have started,here you see it's still early, but amber havent acknowledge or taken any responsibility, will she ever???
2. I call it ""redemption smile"" (I dont think that was the case here, maybe a fraction?) But when its OVER, you're free so much free that you're able to talk about it and 
A.the abuser has been caught 
B. You know the abuser IS getting caught cuz of the stuff you're saying at that moment, the smile appear , kind of ""finally, karma or eat that jerk"" and a natural smirk shows,for its finally your time to talk after being silenced!
3. Personality (you say it yourself in lots of other vids) that depends on the person, often you only have few seconds/minutes to figure ""main expressions"" out!
I'm not a pro, but by having observed my parents, later on I had my reason to be better at reading ppl as counselor and later as drugdealer (sometimes you have few seconds to see if they're gonna screw you or is it genuine etc) you learn to read ppl.
Having a violent parent or partner you learn to read body language early on,walking on eggshells to see the state the abuser are at?!!

SO my conclusion on this infamous dupid delight or what else ppl call it, for Johnny it's one of his trades,personality, the prankster,funny gu√Ω, mixed with coping and HaHa ,I'm gonna get'ya so I'd say all 3 above! Which is very common to see, women often are more soft!

I've learned it's much harder to see when its male victims. 
My guess is most men are taught to be masculine, no crying,no emotions etc, so the natural way of coping has a huge wall cuz while he NEED in this case to show he's a victim, he have the funnyman personality but also ""men do no crying upbringining""
For me it's obvious that's what he's doing. 
But the balance has changed but many  peoples emotions havent learned to live like this, and that's ppl, especially men who are brought up the oldfasioned way.
Today you almost let your son play with dolls and wear skirts, so they're are more easily to show real feelings.
But if you look at Johnny's Italian background, age, etc, it's obvious HE have to hide & be funny while sharing something very hurtful.

I feel often many YouTube body language reader forget some important factors that actually also can and often changes the body language, not only the sexes and wether you're most masculine vs feminine but CULTURE! 

Now the ppl most youtubers are studying are American! So that's fine.
But I've learned from early age it really also depends on country,class,religion too.
I'm most familiar with culture cus I was born and raised in Japan (we don't talk or show our feeling, we don't tough each other, imagine and pride is VERY important and older you are,more respect you show,get,gain)
While here in Denmark, omg it's the opposite!( let's sit in a circle, sing a song,play guitar,paint, we hug and hold hands even kiss and we SHARE ALL our feeling to everyone, then we are healthy, respect is something I'm not sure how you gain, old ppl are look down on) 
So to say these 2 cultures have same body language is impossible! 
1 have been taught with breastmilk not to show anything, the other cry as high and let it  ALL out) tho it's fun to see for I know many mixed marriages and confused kids (me,lmfao) 
Yes, there are many HUMAN trades,but many are removed or added!
I'm taught to be very square but after living here for so many years I'm become round, I don't fit in,both cultures have hard time reading me, even if i make a joke i see some are afraid to laugh cuz they're not sure iF I'm serious or not. I know i can be monotone when I need too, and it also depends where and who im with what part of me I show, and I'm VERY aware what I portray, and have been very manipulative!
And I guess its same issue with classes, religion and colour/culture for it has nothing to do with amount of melanin, it's how you're raised and been exposed too.

So its so hard (unless if you have studied this like you, and I'm self taught cuz I had too in order to survive)

ButIi think many readers are generalizing and forget other factors! 
And also wether you're left/righthand can change the ""norm"" or are you logic person.or artistic person(they often gave bigger hand gestures,dont know why, just observed it)!

Most importantly to be a great reader LIFE EXPERIENCE ! Without that, you cant use the tools, then it's cold reading like Caputo lady! 
So I do sometime laugh when I see a student in psychology,still in university using the body language ABZ but you obviously hear they havent lived.
In order to read ppl you have had to had a life and the brain should be fully developed ! 
But gotta admit some do surprise me and they're a natural, and I can almost guess why.

Back to Johnny;

I'm a woman, I can't imagine how it is for men to.be the victim. 
I had zero respect for my huge danish dad who got beaten by a tiny japanese woman & I waited many years for him to one day snap, but nope, he was like Johnny. (I have the biggest respect today, my dad,Johnny were more MAN than most men are! ) 

It really takes balls, self control,respect for you and others to not hit back as a man who's bigger!

That's why this particular relationship is for me so transparent and I'm angry that Amber Poo have made it hard on women/victims in the future 
But I think and hope by a masculine man as johnny both men and women respect and look upto openly stating,yes this tiny turd chopped my finger, butchered me and beat me! That MORE men are inclined to step forward.
I hope this will change the way we look at men!

Damn,sry for the book I wrote he its 06.16 I gotta get up soon

But I enjoyed your videos and looking forward to watch many many more

She shouldn't be expected to exactly be able to quote it and she knows that. She doesn't want to misquote it obviously, so she doesn't try.

9978,UgwL0bBqYozmlSTeTw54AaABAg,"You could do a 2 hour video peoving Amber is a narcissistic violent abuser and I'd gladly watch every minute of it. Plenty of specialists (between psychologists, other body language experts, even lawyers) have dissected her tapes and testimonies, including the latest ones from Johnny's defamation case against The Sun, and there are only transcripts for now, but even in reading form, she is caught lying several times during the trial and with her own witnesses (which weren't many ü§£l. Her own sister messes up the story, and the next testimony she changes the story (definitely cause Amber hit her till she memorized the story she needed to tell - oh yeah, her father and her are the abusive in the relationship, while her sister and her mother - who unfortunately passed away this year - are victims of them. Whitney - her sister - is mainly a victim of Amber. There is even a video where people are talking about one of the times Amber hit Whitney, while they're present, and while Amber laughs it off, Whitney wants to change the subject. Says it wasn't like that, etc. A woman, her friend, says she needs to stand up for herself. I feel for Whitney, she didn't have a healthy family so she goes with the flow. During the trial some friends of Whitney, including one of the witness for JOHNNY wrote her a letter saying she needed to run from her sister, that it wasn't healthy, and she would tell the real story and hoped Whitney would eventually do the same, for he own sake, and that she had people in her life who would give her support, she didn't need that scumbag in her life nor clean up her mess again. Her hoax was so bad planned, that in this latest casez the testimonies of her, IO and Rachel, who were involved in one particular story, all had different details. It was a mess. I felt like I had done drugs while reading the testimonies cause it was so obviously fake, even the judge cut her off several times cause he already knows she's lying so he basically says the same as you, get to the point, answer the question asked, no need to spin this tale of 15mins each question. I wish, oooh how I wish there was video from the infamous tapes of Amber confessing to throwing things at himx and hitting him, etc and the one with the aftermath of the finger chopping incident when Johnny is sent to the hospital and eeeeeeeeveryone around is talking about how crazy she is and how they had to get her away from Johnny, etc. Alas the only video we have is he one she faked and leaked to TMZ, and that we now have the rest of it and shows that everything she said was a loe, Johnny was mad cause one of his managers was stealing from him and he had just found out, Amber wasn't even awake till going to where he was, and she said he broke her phone and beat her, but the rest of the footage shows that it was HER picking the phone up and when she goes to turn the camera off, she's smiling. Fecking lying abusive whore. If you try to catch all the inconsistencies with her stories you'll fall down a rabbit hole that's hard to climb out of.and might make you feel enraged and pity for poor Johnny. The guy didn't use ACTUAL proof he had, just because Amber's mom, who loved Johnny and he loved very much (she would constantly ask him if she could be his adoptive mother - probably wanting to leave her own messes up family), asked him not to use their textx between each other in  court cause Amber would never forgive her. The only reason the texts were released is because AMBER SUBPOENAED JOHNNY for them, probably thinking her mother was her puppet and only saying bad things to him. Meanwhile, she's telling him she lives him and to forgive Amber, that she sent him the blackmail letter before going to court (to get a restraining order with fake injury photos) because the LAWYERS MADE HEEEERRRRR. ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ man, Amber was sent straight from hell.

Amber begins nodding that yes, she understands the question, then says ‚ÄúNo‚Äù (that she has not engaged in domestic violence) as a response to that question. 
A minor detail, but maybe not if you‚Äôre using it as a predictor that she‚Äôs going to be extremely deceptive with what follows. I‚Äôm in no way defending her (in fact, I believe she‚Äôs guilty as sin of perpetrating domestic violence), just pointing out that it was interpreted incorrectly.

But, that hand on the chin gesture really looks like she was coached to avoid covering her mouth and so she settled for this ""I'm  not worried, I'm so bored pose"". In fact, through the whole thing she flashes these ""bored, unconcerned tells"", followed by some serious anxiety tells. I think in her own mind she decided to try to convince everyone of her truthfulness by appearing unconcerned- because she thinks she is a better actress than she is.
Shortly after the hand/chin gesture we see some micro smile flashes in odd places, which I think she also does innapropriately (hence the food?).
She also does a fair amount of chin jutting, daring her opponents to question her answers",Lacy W,0,2020-09-14T18:17:11Z

10146,UgwPfcotvQ9cdq3RQ5N4AaABAg,"When you‚Äôre reading, how do you look out for signs of neurodivergency (autism, ADHD, trauma, etc?). To me it seems like Amber exhibits some ADHD symptoms at her baseline, such as the scanning the room while engaged, and the way she expressed her artistic inclination in relation to her family both could be because of ADHD. In the clip of her deposition things such as her boredom and her inability to recall the exact details of events could also be perceived as symptoms. A red carpet setting would also be an added layer of overwhelming for people who are not neurotypical as well because of the bombardment of stimuli, this could explain both of their behaviors‚Äô in this setting. When in a calm environment they could interact very differently. I still think your reading supports that she is likely an abuser but it‚Äôs also interesting to me that you so readily note Depp‚Äôs ability to recall and recite his side as an indicator he is being truthful when he is such a gifted actor. In Shane‚Äôs reading you often cited him being an ‚Äúactor‚Äù as something to consider but don‚Äôt mention it in regards to Johnny... smells a bit like bias to me.

10183,UgxYN_8Gfh6NRoag-bR4AaABAg,"Im sorry, i don't know much about this case and i've loved every single video i watched of you, but there's something i find very troubling about this one. As far as i understand, there Is no specific way a victim of abuse would respond to this type of questions. And i find troubling that one of the main resons she Is found to be not believable is because she Is not reacting like people asume victims of abuse should act... She's not crying, she's not super invested in the questioning... But if this Is a recolection of abuse she suffered for a really long time and probably has had to talk about many many times to prepare for the depositions and etc, it's not wild to think she would not react as emotionally to it anymore, if she ever did, which again, she wouldn't have to, just to prove it's true. 
Another thing Is that it's extremely common for recollections of abuse to be incongruent when retold. What Is not very common at all, is for a woman to lie about being abused. It's extremely rare. 
To be honest, it's not that i believe her and i'm trying to jump in her defense, because i truly don't know what happened. It's just that every reason you've given in the video i could not find compelling in the slightless. 
Another thing Is that there's no mention to both of them being actors which you've Said before, could make it a Lot harder to read. He Is taken as genuine without mentioning that very important factor.
I really dislike leaving negative comments but when it comes to important subjects like this i just feel it's necessary.
Perhaps you did have in consideration all the things i said about victims of abuse reacting differently, and the studies that have been done surrounding the topic, (un fact i would asume you do because you seem to be a very well educsted person) but non of that comes across in the video, and it worries me. 
Because it normalizes the idea that a victim has to be bawling her eyes out in order to be truthfull, and that v√≠ctims lying about abuse it's not an extremely rare thing. 
I hope you get to read this comment and take it to heart to be More careful in how you handle topics of abuse.

10221,UgxALz4-basowazT--d4AaABAg,"Hi, love your channel, but I have some questions. I think some crucial things might have been left out in the analysis of Amber's video, one being that the case was about Johnny, not her. She wasn't on trial, so why would she be nervous? If she looked bored and didn't want to be there.. probably because they wanted to (theoretically) twist her story and victim blame her. If he did abuse her than she would probably feel real contempt for Johnny's lawyers as their whole goal would be to call her a liar when she is telling the truth? I'm not saying one way or the other, but I'm just not sure all the facts were considered when analysing her deposition? If she IS a victim and their whole purpose was to discredit her, she would hate them. Or maybe they had badgered her over and over again. Or even consider the hypothetical situation where you are an abuse victim, but a lawyer brings up one of the only times you defended yourself, that would make you so mad and upset, maybe even cause you to trip up on your words? I haven't seen a video where Johny is questioned on how many times he has abused her? Is there one? If so I'd be interested to see an analysis of that, where he denies abusing her and we can look at his nonverbal to see if that is the truth. Because, let's say she did hit him those few times she was questioned about and she was lying, that doesn't automatically mean he didn't abuse her? So how can we have a clear picture?
Furthermore, with the interpretation of the footage of them together, Johnny is obviously drunk. Maybe he was looking at her for guidance because he was a mess? And perhaps she was upset with him for something? I think its quite a big call to say that proves she abused him. Say Johnny had recently abused her, what's to say he didn't act submissive after because he felt shame or guilt? These are genuine questions. I'm just not understanding why certain possibilities don't play into the analysis, but other things do (in favour of Johnny).
Perhaps a longer video would be cool to see, maybe you had already considered these things but didn't have time to say? It's just, I don't mean this in a bad way, but this analysis seemed more emotional than others (i.e. more anger and frustration directed towards Amber than other videos I have seen) and I'm wondering if this could have swayed the analysis at all? I ask these questions with all the love and respect! :) Thanks for sharing your videos :)",MoonBaked,0,2020-09-14T12:43:04Z

I found it surprising that suddenly everyone believed that he could be this manipulative abuser with so many other romantic partners of his indicating the opposite. I'm aware you can't always tell a persons private life from publicity interviews but the nonverbal signs are there. He has always shown himself to be a mellow and laidback person. To hear that he had ""fits of rage"" toward Amber just seemed inconsistent with his outward personality.

But to tear him down while he's also found that ""his team"" or whoever had been stealing MILLIONS from him over the course of YEARS. He NEEDED her. For her to do THIS. Try to discredit his name. His fucking LEGACY. Have him blacklisted and dropped from one of the biggest movie franchises of his career! To publicly drag him through the multiple court proceedings for YEARS. She is a disgusting cancerous tumor in everyone's life she has infiltrated. I hope Jason Momoa refuses to work with her. Seeing as she had YET to be dropped from Aquaman 2.

10407,UgzbGc4CUnEzlA7rgId4AaABAg,"Honestly I think people who are victims of abuse for extremely long periods of time have to disassociate the intensity of what they experience. I can say this as a survivor myself of domestic violence. People would say the same thing about me. That I am not passionate enough about what happened therefor I must be lying. She is upset. Eating is something she is doing to distract herself from the callousness of the question asker, who is attempting to twist her words or discount important facts. When you respond emotionally by the way you come off a bit immature. I noticed it in your video with the family who gave up on their adopted child as well. From my personal perspective and... as a suggestion, I think that you should avoid subjects that cause you to have emotional responses and avoid anything... ANYTHING, where you are trying explain HOW to be a victim and the appropriate way to be a victim. There is nothing more frustrating than telling your story 1000 times to people who don't care and simply want to prove you wrong. Considering this entire case rests on conjecture, and there isn't enough evidence. I think people need to make their opinionated choices and allow things to move forward and to move on.

""I was trying to escape, from a room. Uh, where Johnny was attacking me, and in order to escape, I was trying to, get to on the other side of the door. Attempting to close the door, and he was attempting to get in, despite my attempts to try and escape an assault.""
In this saying there is one thing that stood out for me, the ending part, where she used the word escape. If she was a victim I don't think she would have used that word as many times as she did, she would have said ""despite my desperate attempts to try and stop him"" or ""despite my attempts to try and get away from him.""
Also she used the word attempt 3x in that short few second clip.
If you are remembering a memory/having a flashback, it is vivid. The image takes you there, almost like you relive the moment. And Amber? She doesn't look or sound like she is reliving something that was terrifying for her.

12:32
""Yes, as he was trying to get into the door, uh, into the room, I was trying to escape in. He, pushed the door into me, and I was trying to hit him (waves arms), by getting out, getting him out of the door, to stay in the room.""
There is a confession in this clip, I believe. Not 100% sure, but by her struggles to retell the story of what she just said a minute before, she sounded like she almost confessed to hitting Johnny, but then said it was because she was trying to close the door.
I also can see she is waving her arms in almost like a ""No! I mean, sh*t!"" type of way because she realized what she was saying then backtracked to the door. (Her story)

13:35
""I think in that recording I made it very clear that I was sorry that the door hit him while he was trying to get into the room, I was, escaping (closes eyes) or attempting to escape into. (Puts hand on arm casually and looks around in boredom)

20:12
Please note, I could be wrong about this, but when she talks about the incident with her sister, something tells me she was not referring to her sister but to herself.
She is telling the story how she saw it, getting defensive by how she saw it, saying she was gonna protect her sister no matter what, saying that Johnny was gonna get violent, but I think she was referring to herself, like in third person. That there was no sister there, just her, and she saw herself as the little girl.
(I.e. The story of her sister is made up, she is referring to herself as the little girl/in third person. I think it's made up)

22:24
Johnny is telling the truth/a memory, at least for the vodka bottle story because he is reliving the moment and is very open and expressive about it.

10485,UgwzWws33L9xG1sEteF4AaABAg,"A comment which you can take or leave, but comes from my perspective of being a litigation lawyer.  I think its important to keep in mind that court rooms are very stilted and artificial environments, very different to being interviewed or chatting casually. Someone's baseline in a court room situation I'd wager is different to their baseline in other places. I have seen clients/witnesses I know to be truthful/decent people give weird and illogical answers on the stand. There can be innocent explanations for this - being nervous, annoyed to be involved in the court process, making an honest mistake (its rare for people to have perfect recall), scared to say something 'wrong' so they end up confusing themselves. Some witnesses may try to run away with irrelevant facts, because what they see as important may differ from what is actually important (eg focus on something which is inconsequential but was irritating to them at the time). 

I didn't necessarily agree that Amber's disjointed stories were inherently an indicated she was lying. I generally understood the story she was trying to tell, even if she did not express herself well explaining them. Some witnesses really are like that on the stand, but if you ask them the same question back in the office they will answer much more cohesively. The way some of the questions were framed did not necessarily encourage a cohesive answer because they did not necessarily encourage a chronological recount of events. Her answers to some questions suggested that her lawyer either didn't prepare her well for the deposition or she ignored their advice. 

To me the strangest thing was that she ate through the deposition -  which I would basically ban a client from doing unless they were a diabetic or something. I agree there was some overacting around the eating, which felt a little like play acting.  I did generally think Johnny came across as the much better witness, but being a good witness does not necessarily mean someone is telling the truth, particularly when the someones are professional actors.",ikkylovesbass,14,2020-09-14T04:27:45Z
