This is learned behavior. Who knows what happened to her in life to end up this way.  Depp learned a valuable lesson about who to let into his circle. Maybe start dating women his own age. Stop dating models and actresses. Maybe find someone intelligent and self assured that doesn‚Äôt need to hang on to someone else to add to value themselves.,2020-04-17T05:15:17Z,2

Johnny Depp repeatedly tried to stop her from going to court, he never wanted to tarnish her reputation and why's that?
