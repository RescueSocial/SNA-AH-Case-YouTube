People with antisocial personality disorder tend to:

be irresponsible, fail to respect the law and repeatedly behave illegally
lie and deceive others
be impulsive and not plan ahead
be aggressive and antagonistic, causing conflict with others and within organisations
disregard their own or others' safety

29,UgyhsW4Om3RDSbu1g-14AaABAg,"In The physical realm they are workers in the entertainment industry, but in the metaphysical world they each have their own affinity toward the domain of the god forces which constitute the shadow of our dimension that transcends all. These beings much like their cousins (all of humanity) work through the day to supplement their lives and regardless of enjoyment remain committed to fulfilling the cyclical prophetic sense of content so long as their inner god is pleased. Johnny Depp is one whose god relates to expression, a natural performer, one who no matter what can play a character and retain his genuine aspect, something that makes him human and tethered to this realm, a true master of his vessel who doesnt need anything at all so long as he can pull his strings and inspire others. 
Amber is one of a much more sinister shadow affinity, a god who uses their vessel to impose on others, to destroy, provoke, and subvert each industry or structure they involve themselves in, there is no genuine aspect tethering the vessel to the physical realm, her vessel is one who will not be content unless it can own all and reign over others like a tyrant and even then the very nature of the god will be in a perpetual state of misery, only catching a glimpse of contention when an act of foreboding subversion of will is realized. 
We are all vessels of the energy that some call ""god"", we all spawned on this rock from the ether and shall return to it shortly, and our verry nature from the ether cannot be erased, there can only be interference patterns in the energy that transcend higher dimensions. 
What this show can teach us is that no one is above the nature of our universe, safety is an illusion, and our destiny cannot be known to us because our omnipresent omniscient status was sacrificed to experience the universe from a deeper perspective.

That does not preclude her being schizophrenic either. She has far too many red flags for NPD.b the way she tried to make her apartment to be furnished like and look like Johnny Depp's. the way she started dressing in a Bohemian fashion, which is Johnny Depp's way of dressing.she also got rid of all her paperback books and started collecting first edition card backs, also a Johnny Depp thing. she habitually rewrites history, she is a pathological liar, she engages in crazy-making and creating flying monkeys. she also work very hard at trying to make Johnny question his own memory and his own sanity. This woman is definitely malignant NPD! you are also correct about the borderline personality disorder it is another cluster b personality disorder. Which goes in line with malignant NPD. Sociopathy is another cluster b personality disorder, which I believe she has. But with the borderline, the self-harming comes into play. The cutting herself etc. I also believe she is bipolar you did well calling those two things out because I also noticed..but the narcissistic personality disorder really jumped out at me from the beginning.

Everyone lies according to her even the diagnosis of her trained shrink. And she said ""I'm not bipolar""...when that wasn't mentioned at all. I think she is bipolar and was off of her meds, drunk/high and johnny triggered her abandonment issues...she admitted her dad was a drunk who used to hit her. I think she is projecting some issues onto johnny. I think she did sleep with all these guys when Johnny was gone....abandonment issues. She attacked him when he wanted the postnub...it implies he will devorce her. And she attacked him when he was a no show on her birthday....those are HER triggers not Johnny. Sure johnny has a abuse background but he seems like a passive people pleaser to me...he got abused he isn't the one who does the abusing. Its why he started to selfmedicate at an early age.

In some interviews when Johnny is speaking of ‚Äúlove‚Äù, she doesn‚Äôt know how to respond. She is very calculated in what she says, and throwing ‚Äúlove‚Äù into it just throws her whole mindset off. Your comment about ‚Äúturning her brain off‚Äù is exactly that.

77,UgwcnazPfEtW1i0jqyp4AaABAg,"Honestly, I think she's on too many different kind on medications and drugs for us to understand her actual mental state. Every time I've seen her interviews/depositions I always thought she had psycho eyes (no micro expressions to match the rest of her facial expressions/what she was saying), but then again, alcohol, Adderall, antipsychotics, coke... Antisocial behavior, looking ""crazy"", not really making sense when you try say something, impulsive lying, manipulation, mania, disregard of the law, narcissism, are all characteristics of drug addicts. I think she could use some time in a mental institution under observation, and al lot of therapy. Still, drugs or not she is a shitty person for what she did and she deserves punishment for sure.",felicia s,9,2020-05-20T14:19:37Z

79,UgyY2g-O9BN5YMBIVb54AaABAg,It's possible for disorders to be comorbid and I definitely see borderline symptoms in her. The fact that she mimicked her husband's style and interests shortly after they got together... that is a classic behavior of theirs.

94,UgyfP1dHic5VpYiUbVd4AaABAg,"That was what I said ages ago.
My final reason for believing that is the amount of detail in her lies about Johnny Depp, and the fact she is so willing to continue this charade.
She knew what she was doing to him on every level, from destroying his career to destroying him emotionally.
The lack of conscience was glaring, which is a glaring tip-off for sociopathy.
The fact she continue to do it anyway, is a dead giveaway.
Her only regret became when this resulted in a public outcry, at which time she decided she wanted to withdraw her case, and she wasn‚Äôt able to.
In the depositions, when the paper is played where Johnny express his dismay that she hit him, she smiles.
Sociopaths get off on the negative emotions they cause others to feel.
Yes, Amber does seem to be trying to practice which emotions to show.
Her over-the-top crying on cue, when talking about Johnny supposedly abusing her, is just one example.
She knew how to manipulate Johnny, much to his detriment, and he was taken by her fake charm and her looks.",lisa richards,22,2020-05-14T20:35:00Z
