They're still using high volumes at bots at Internet Research Agency/BlackCube/Psy-Group specializations levels. It's really sad that we're the only ones helping her. They're trying to ruin numerous juries. I can only hope that we can get some credible scientific evidence. Many of these technology people have never heard of Amber's struggles online.
 Multiplatform analysis shows in Election Bots for 2016, French 2017, and numerous others that they'll astroturf Reddit and YouTube before Twitter's highs.

Please keep talking about this and supporting Amber Heard. It's suppressed and it's possible that it's in her own network suppressing her.

15,UgzosreGDuxTbNapKe14AaABAg,"The evidence against Amber and Johnny is similar. She‚Äôs on tape saying she was violent, but says this was in defence of herself or her sister. He‚Äôs on tape saying he head butted her, but says accidentally. They both have a lot of witnesses, but most are arguably biased. His are all friends or on his payroll. Hers are friends or family. They have both been accused of violence towards others, but never convicted. 

The reason I support the judges decision:

On 24th May on a private plan Amber says Johnny accused her of cheating (quite possibly correctly) with James Franco, pushed a chair at her, slapped her and kicked her.  Johnny said in his Witness Statement he remembered the flight clearly, he was sober and she was acting aggressively towards him. Stephen Deuters, his PA, said JD was quiet on the flight. Johnny sent Paul Bethany a text about that flight and referenced being on cocaine and described himself as ‚ÄúAn angry, aggro injun in a fuckin blackout, screaming obscenities and insulting any fuck who gets near‚Äù. Is that consistent with Ambers story or Johnny and Deuters? 

9 March 2015 - Amber and her sister both say that Johnny repeatedly hit Amber and was aggressive towards Whitney and that Amber hit Johnny to protect her sister. He denies violence towards either. Johnny‚Äôs Nurse Debbie Lloyd was in the flat and texted the next day ‚ÄúGood thing he called or they would have hurt each other. We had to physically restrain both of them.' Johnny‚Äôs on tape saying Travis (his bodyguard) pulled him off Amber. If only Amber was violent why would she and he have said that?

August 2015. The Eastern and Oriental Express in South East Asia. Amber says Johnny hit and pushed her against a wall by the throat causing her to fear for her life. Johnny did not recall either him or Amber being violent in his evidence. In an audio recording, Johnny said  ‚ÄúSince Australia we've been on our honeymoon other than the fact that we had a fight on the train, which was physical...‚Äù. Again who‚Äôs evidence is that more consistent with?

May 21 2016 Amber says JD threw the phone at her face hard. He denies this. JD‚Äôs witness Laura Divenere says in a recording that AH had a red and swollen face not long after. Officer Saenz observed reddening on Ms Heard's cheek but attributed this to crying. Photographs that day of Amber with an injury to her eye timed just after the security cameras show Johnny left so not enough time to put makeup on. IT expert testified that the Photos have not been altered for time or data, edited or otherwise manipulated. The photographs were taken in different lighting conditions and that is a good reason why what can be seen differs from one to another

While Johnny was detoxing on his Island he alleges Amber withheld medication he needed (which would amount to torture if true).

His Nurse Debbie Lloyd‚Äôs notes show that he got the medication he needed.  Sending as text describing his Detox Johnny write of Amber ‚ÄúIt was an exercise of monumental patience and instinct . . It was Amber and Amber only that got me through this‚Äù. So what does the evidence show?",Lilyanna,6,2021-02-25T16:00:53Z

""News Group [for the UK trial] is trying to compel the [live feed video] testimony of makeup artist M√©lanie Inglessis, who, in a 2019 declaration, said she witnessed Heard's bruised face and cut lip and helped to hide the injuries for an appearance on The Late Show With James Corden. She recalls, ""Amber repeatedly told me that she did not want to expose this part of her life to the public, and that she was considering canceling the appearance altogether."" Inglessis said she and Heard became close friends after she began working with her in 2015 and that she remembers ""numerous"" times Heard told her she had been abused.
On May 16, Inglessis filed a motion in California federal court asking Magistrate Judge Patrick J. Walsh to quash his order compelling her give live testimony via a video feed. She also informed the court that she's received ""death threats and faced online harassment"" despite not making any public comments on the matter. ""
