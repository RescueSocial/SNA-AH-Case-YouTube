0,UgyEgqK8yXENQaJx2ah4AaABAg,Evelyn Harber,"@Mosstone I hope you are correct. As we, fans, viewers, are only able to obtain what we are being fed. I do sincerely hope that my faith in Johnny Depp has not and never been misguided. His history is that of a gentleman which make me wonder why A.H. believes she can tarnish J.D. but there again his usage of alcohol and possibly drugs can affect a persons brain/mind. Like his other fans, I have followed this man's/actors career since I first saw him in 21 Jump Street so many years ago and have never until now heard a bad word against him. So sad that movie moguls are taking a females word against an actor, a well-reputed actor and basically ""Black-balling"" him and yet believing her to be as pure as the driven snow! Yes, I am aware not all older actors are good, many a reputation has been destroyed by very bad behaviour, but this one is, I believe, worthy of his good reputation and she definitely is not worthy of even cleaning his boots as it were!",2020-05-13T05:29:52Z,0
