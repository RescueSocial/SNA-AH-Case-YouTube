6,UgzKtpjwmOHmsiY8M6B4AaABAg,Heather Ross,"Yea, she is Australian",2021-04-28T07:05:10Z,1
7,UgzKtpjwmOHmsiY8M6B4AaABAg,Bill Aili,IMO watched another video of Johnny and that rat amber sia spoke up in another video and the they mention that she‚Äôs Australian,2021-04-28T02:59:24Z,1

9,UgyyAeuxjILw2Q_yret4AaABAg,Maree Keay,"Just to add I just watched a clip showing the Australian Government opening an investigation into AH about bringing her dogs into the Country without the correct paper work. In the court filings it came out that she lied repeatedly to their government..

Aquaman was mainly filmed in Australia on the Gold Coast so she may need to drop out of filming. This would mean they don't have to pay her millions if they sack her..
Australia may decide to not allow her entry or better yet not allow her to leave.
Karma works in mysterious ways but she's always a bitch!

BTW thanks for letting me know about the click bait appreciate it.. üíô",2021-05-01T10:34:11Z,0
10,UgyyAeuxjILw2Q_yret4AaABAg,Maree Keay,"@B Rabbit I agree, last I heard the judge in the UK was compromised via family knowing AH. Not sure how accurate it is though!

 Besides the paper Johnny was suing have deep pockets.. With all the information that came out though it showed AH being the  abusive one not Johnny Depp. (I mean seriously, he had to have his finger sewed back on) So how the judge ruled confused the hell out of me! 
I've looked at the statements and watched the footage and still can't work it out.. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",2021-05-01T10:29:08Z,0
11,UgyyAeuxjILw2Q_yret4AaABAg,B Rabbit,"I was waiting for the Emilie Clark view - this is all stuff everyone knows, AH married Johnny to get fame and money and tried to blackmail him - he said no way and then she made a whole lot of shit up - if everyone in the world can see this why can‚Äôt the judges??
