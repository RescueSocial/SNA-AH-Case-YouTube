42,UgwJawZcBRHJcAyAjOZ4AaABAg,"Intro was...interesting. Incoherent, but an interesting experiment. Id love to see where it is going.
Ooof, fair skin, red hair...yawza. I have no words, only emotions. üòçüòçüòç A bit too close tho.
_I get mad if i lose 5 dollar bill._
There is an easy solution to this problem - move to Europe. No dollars - no problems. üòé
And since im an old man, so i just use coin holder to keep the change. Very handy.
_Like, comment..._
...get an adblock.
_Money._
For me money is just means to an end. And i would not want millions and millions of dollars. Most people fail to understand how many problem come with that amount of dough. 
One of my old classmates owned a construction firm and he made good money - big house, expensive car, vacations, etc. But there were constant problems with everything in his life, from wife to government, from health to free time. After his business went under in 2010, about a year after, i met him, completely broke and happiest he was in years.
Would i like to earn more ? Sure. But i love my job and i earn enough to get by without much problems and even put a bit aside. But then again, i am extremely low upkeep. In my 20s i used to have months when my food budget was 20 euros. Today it is closer to 80, but i do try to eat healthier.
Sometimes less is more and nothing can buy you peace of mind.
_How does that happen ?_
Big money. It is far harder to audit and properly manage such amounts when it comes to big numbers and this way of earning. Regular peasant income is standardized and automated, but with someone who earns tens and hundreds of millions its *a process*, that can drag on for years and has million moving parts.
_You know about money !_
If you dont have to do any real management and if you want something, then there is ""a guy"" to make it happen, eventually it becomes something distant. Year after year all you have to do is snap your fingers and it will be delivered to you.
_A biggest possession you would buy ?_
Id buy a Death Star. In credit. And then extort everyone under threat of annihilation. üòé
_Maybe some bitcoin._
Bitcoin is a pyramid scam. It is still growing and will do that for a while. As dollar is collapsing people will look for alternatives. But generally speaking its a hype currency and for as long as people are hyped for it, it will grow and then it will collapse and 99.99% of coin holders will be left with nothing. There has been plenty of instances of people losing their money already. Thru scams, thru theft, thru market manipulation and there is nobody you can turn to if you have any problems with it.
It is pointless to dwell on the past, nothing can be changed now anyway.
And if you would invest in BC then and be a millionaire now, then i would not have the pleasure to enjoy those videos. So i am quite happy that it did not happen. üòò

I think the doll needs years of therapy!!  Lol!  I wonder if the doll has been offered services. Does she produce the correct funds to that little girl, or does the doll get beat up every night?

Days when I think I got $5 - hey change! And a $10 bill too - WOOOHOOO! So I'm sure Johnny's like that too. And like you say, how can ANYONE fathom $650 MILLION dollars! And $100 Million to the Feds waiting PATIENTLY for 17 years! So hopefully Johnny could sue those bastards and get at least half a BILLION back. Judging by his legal team in London, they look pretty savvy! And think they're wise to play it out like a chess game now. Let The Sun and entertainment journalists off the hook - okay.
