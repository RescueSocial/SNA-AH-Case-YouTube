74,Ugz1mYVZn3Qmubj1Uut4AaABAg,chrissie hardman,"@Mrs M I‚Äôm so sorry you went through that, didn‚Äôt you have any other family to turn to? I was a victim of DV, seriously enough so that I could never have a child. I had my Dad come get me from hospital, the nurses had warned me the guy was hanging around. Like most bullies, he was a coward, he wouldn‚Äôt take my Dad on. I lived for years with him inside my head. One day, I was with my Mum & we bumped into him. He looked cornered , couldn‚Äôt look either of us in the eye and in that moment, I said, ‚ÄúAlright Geoff?‚Äù Steered my incandescent, murderous Mum round him & as we walked away I turned back & said, ‚ÄúI forgive you.‚Äù He burst into tears, so did Mum, only hers were of outrage! She was spluttering, spitting, could hardly speak, ‚ÄúHow could you? How can you? After all he....?‚Äù But in that moment I‚Äôd realised that if I was always going to fear him, I‚Äôd never be free of him, he‚Äôd still be to some extent, running my life. I freed myself, by letting it go. I really think that if Amber‚Äôs sister was brave enough, in court, to say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm very sorry, I didn‚Äôt tell the truth in England, but I‚Äôll tell you the truth now.‚Äù she would free herself from Amber‚Äôs tyranny forever. I see her as an emotionally crippled victim, not a great thing for a young mother to be, is it? One terrible moment confessing to her part in Amber‚Äôs hoax could change her life so much for the better.",2020-12-18T22:24:58Z,1
75,Ugz1mYVZn3Qmubj1Uut4AaABAg,Mrs M,@chrissie hardman  100% agree! I was in a situation where my sister was pressuring me to take time off work to help her with something. My work declined as too many people were off. I was willing to be fired or leave my job than face the wrath from my sister.,2020-12-18T17:30:18Z,1
76,Ugz1mYVZn3Qmubj1Uut4AaABAg,chrissie hardman,"Her sister is a victim, she always has been, since they were children. You‚Äôre absolutely right to say she was wrong to lie in court, but she was what an abused person looks like. Imagine being so scared of retribution you would rather perjure yourself & risk your freedom, imagine the fear of your sister being greater than your fear of going to jail, when you have a baby & a husband at home, where you‚Äôd much rather be. I pity her, but it doesn‚Äôt stop me hoping that Johnny‚Äôs lawyers force her to tell the truth. Problem is, Johnny may not allow her to be bullied, he genuinely loves her like a sister & we know he can be an old softy. He‚Äôll need to be merciless if he‚Äôs to win, though. Just as AH has had no mercy for him.",2020-12-18T14:46:17Z,4
