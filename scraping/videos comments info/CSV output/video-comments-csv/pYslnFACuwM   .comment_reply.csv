1,UgwapBn22fcxp-TYoKx4AaABAg,nic ole,"Btw regarding Musky's karma- Did you see where the internet hacking vigilante group- 'Anonymous' made a vid for Musky calling him out??! Ohhhh boooyyy... I would of thought he was one of them, but if so, NOT ANYMORE & I know he's super tech minded, but they're on that same level too! If he was more intelligent than cocky, he'd be a little scared. ðŸ˜†ðŸ˜†ðŸ˜†",2021-06-08T17:08:52Z,1
2,UgwapBn22fcxp-TYoKx4AaABAg,nic ole,"Idk about that. I don't doubt he hit her but she's already claimed JD did that, not Musky. So if she tried to come out saying Musky AB'd her, especially now, it'd be like 'The Boy Who Cried Wolf' & no one's going to believe her, she knows that, Musky knows that, so he gets away with it while Johnny loses millions to vindicate his name. It's BS & I just have to keep believing Karma is real and it will kick her ass- HARD! Musky's too.",2021-06-08T17:07:35Z,2
