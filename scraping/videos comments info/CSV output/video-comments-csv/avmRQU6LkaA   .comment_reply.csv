Rick Smith is a troll, and I'm reading too deeply into it, lol -- Why do we even comment? Probably gives a false sense of engagement with the grand content at hand.

51,Ugzgq1Pf6ndVa6pGXH94AaABAg,Morbo Garnik,"I think Rick is highlighting a double standard. If it were a man (father or not) who said a little girl was cute, people would accuse him of pedophilia.  This is a good example of why double standards have some merit. Because male and female sexuality do differ, and so it's less creepy for a female to admire a child, than it is for a male to admire a child. It's kind of messed up, because most men aren't attracted to children. Yet we are more wary of their gaze because we are more afraid of the predominantly physical attraction the characterizes men,  than the predominantly emotional attraction that characterizes women.",2018-08-14T16:41:13Z,0
