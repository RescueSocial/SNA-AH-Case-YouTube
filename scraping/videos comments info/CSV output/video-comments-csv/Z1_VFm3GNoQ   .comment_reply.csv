1,UgwsKsZ0S91vysFCl7t4AaABAg,Freeda Aghakhaineyan,"@Helly shes just so vile. My heart so goes out for JD. I don't do the celebrity crap but from the very beginning of seeing her parade out of the court house with that bruise I knew it was fake. She really believed she'd be in demand after being with JD but she wasn't and she wasn't even trying. She just went wherever he went partying and living off him and when she took it too far and he had to go she couldn't handle it. I think she tried to work after the divorce and gave it a year but nothing so that's when she thought plan b needs to come out otherwise she's got nothing. And that recording saying I'm not asking for money or anything so why would anyone think I'm lying and its you that's the DA victim. Well 50k pm all the range rovers ,all 5 la penthouses plus a couple of other properties and a larger settlement then 7mil is not what I call nothing and then to say she supported herself during the relationship......wtf........she earned 235k in 2015 and after taxes fees bills (which JD paid) she was left with just under 38k for the whole year. So how does 38k pay for 5 penthouses private jets all over the world with friends, hotels dinner and of course drugs drugs and more drugs. Oh and of course she only drinks a certain type of red wine that's a minimum of 600 dollars per bottle. Hmmmm 2-3 bottles pn adds up to way more than 38k pa alone",2021-07-22T22:46:35Z,0
2,UgwsKsZ0S91vysFCl7t4AaABAg,Freeda Aghakhaineyan,"@Helly and is it wrong to hope AM2 flops so much that it does even worse than gully. How is she meant to be the highest paid actress in Hollywood. Doesn't make sense to me and shes definitely not significant or big enough for a percentage of box office sales although it would of been sensible for WB to do that for the contract and even a 'if it fails, you pay back your fee' clause. Hmmmmmm i wonder if that's how she might still be in it. Obviously not going to pay for production and cast/crew as shes not got that sort of money but maybe if it doesn't hit a certain amount in box office sales then she forfeits her fee. And her being her agrees cos as far as shes concerned everyone loves her still",2021-07-22T22:18:36Z,1
