0,UgzZuUPrdiSGZxBuhj94AaABAg,Ben Carter,"@Lorraine Griffith 150 women's deaths a year as opposed to 70 mens is a tiny statistical difference in a population of 65 million.. 10,000  Mexican women would have died over same period, 20 times the rate.. There is a 60% sentencing gap between men and women and I don't see the statistical differences making enough of a difference for a two tier justice system.. Stopping giving probation to women who have sex with minors would be a good start",2020-10-16T11:54:09Z,0
1,UgzZuUPrdiSGZxBuhj94AaABAg,Lorraine Griffith,"Ben Carter I can understand your comment, but I don‚Äôt think that society grapples with making women accountable from any crimes or wrong doing & it certainly does NOT try to protect women at all costs. I live in England & according to the Office for National Statistics (2019) covering just England & Wales alone, it reports that almost one in three women aged 16-59 will experience domestic abuse in her lifetime. Office for National Statistics, year ending March 2018 (average taken over 10 years) states that two to three women a week are KILLED by a current or former partner & that in the year ending March 2019, a staggering 1.6 million women experienced domestic abuse. That is not society protecting women at all costs. This are the statistics for just England & Wales. I dread to think what it would be world wide. The crime, as I see it, is that AH is a perpetrator of DV herself & by her actions negates the very real issue of DV against women.",2020-10-16T10:56:15Z,0

89,UgytAPxGBC9q1t1_vWx4AaABAg,Ozray McGreen - Curious Godless Guru,"I was also in the same situation for 10 years. It's been three years since the relationship ended. I too suffer from issues with being able to trust, also huge problems with confidence/self esteam. I have well and truly lost my mojoüòÖüòÖ but seriously, I don't believe I'll ever be quite right again. 
Although my daughter currently lives with my ex and her new partner, they were never particularly close. My ex wasn't a maternal woman, i was the primary care giver and raised her since she was a year old. As a resulst she was always a ""daddys girl"" if she was struggling or scared or hurt, it was me she would call for, and not her mother. she is now almost old enough to move out on her own, and we have remained in daily contact by phone, she plans to move close enough that she can visit as soon as she can. The strangest thing about it to me was that  I really didn't even realise that I was in an abusive relationship until VERY recently. My ex was so manipulative that over time she convinced me that I deserved the behaviour she exhibited towards me. In the end I didn't believe I deserved any better. I think part of the reason it took me so long to realise the truth is that (being a middle aged male), i didn't really want to think of myself as being a victim of abuse. Despite knowing the psychological and emotional damage that's been done to me (damage, which as I said, I'm still not sure will ever really heal). Things would get so bad and yet I would still (and, dispite myself, still sometimes do) make excuses for her erratic, explosive and often aggressive behaviour. But at least I AM finally beginning to accept I'm better off without her. I don't think there's a much greater humiliation, suffering or heart break someone can endure than to have deeply loved someone that's... abusive. üòÖüòÖ took me a couple of attempts to even write that! Initially wrote ""overly emotional"" then ""troubled"" before I caught myself making excuses for her again!üòÖüòÖ that's what abuse does though! That's what abuse is, It's breaking someone down so that they can't believe in themselves any more! I'm so happy this terrible tragedy is being taken seriously for Johnny. It means a lot to me knowing someone I have so much respect and admiration for has been through something similar. For some reason it makes me feel a little bit better about myself üòÖ",2020-04-22T10:38:28Z,9

91,UgytAPxGBC9q1t1_vWx4AaABAg,Sandi Hurd,"Thank you for sharing your experience.  I am glad you broke free and was granted custody.  I am also a domestic violence survivor and relate to your inability to trust someone enough for a relationship. I don't trust myself, my judgement of others.  I fear missing red flags. I fear being over sensitive and seeing red flags that don't really exist.  I cannot imagine giving myself so completely to anyone ever again.  It took years, years, to understand that I am even worthy of being loved.  I still struggle with low self-esteem but, at least,  I am now able to go to sleep at night without wishing I didn't wake in the morning.   I don't want to ever feel like that again.   I am sorry to highjack your comment.  I just wanted to let you know that I connected to your relationship avoidance.  I wish you the best and hope you and your daughter are well.  God bless üôè",2020-04-20T19:01:55Z,12
