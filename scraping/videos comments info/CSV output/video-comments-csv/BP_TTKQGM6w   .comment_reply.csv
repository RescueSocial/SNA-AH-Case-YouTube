0,UgxxqSSJARQq-rvHUSh4AaABAg,Ikit Claw,"@Casper Granklint For one, she ruined or was about to ruin Johnny's career with her lies, for the other she is a lair and abuser and those people shouldn't have a place in the world, especially when it includes your own fking children and for the last part, just take a moment and imagine if it would've been the other way around. Guy abuses wife, lies about it and kinda get's away with it for a while, imagine the internet then, imagine the petitions then, like even now the media is still trying to blame Johnny, it's messed up. Like let me ask you this, why shouldn't people? Why shouldn't she get her career ruined by others? She did it, no one forced her to, was her own choice and she suffers the consequences every famous person would!  This is a consequence which comes with fame, so people aren't really being assholes, they are just being people!",2020-04-26T23:49:51Z,0
1,UgxxqSSJARQq-rvHUSh4AaABAg,Casper Granklint,"@ugh I can't even im not defending her actions, its just weird to me why you dont see these sorts of petitions made for male rapists and sex offenders in the film industry. Why take joy in destroying someones carrier when she does the exact same? And it looks like she is already going to get som form of punishment and maybe she will change. Yeah she ruins her career by doing this but let her take this consequens let her have a hard time. I just say that we should not bring so much attention to criminals after they have gotten their punishment, just move on instead of being an asshole yourself",2020-04-26T17:22:15Z,0

Truly, I feel like both need help in their own ways. As for the studio, yeah. Of course they want this to blow over. Just like the Flash actor, Ezra Miller. Who apparently choked a female fan. But that video is odd too. 

Anyway, that's the best play a studio can do. Just wait it out. Disney didn't wait out with Johnny Depp. And they pretty much disowned him. But the tide is changing in his favor. And Disney suddenly looks bad for giving him the shaft. 

WB probably doesn't want to pull a Disney. So, they'll continue to wait it out. -OG",2020-04-23T17:07:16Z,0

If things like this didn't happen, the studio and amber would absolutely get what they want. It's on normal people to keep the pressure on. And just for the record, I think depp is a degenerate peice of shit too. He runs around with a guy who murdered three, 9 year olds, and flaunts his satanic bullshit. I hope all these people burn.

And it‚Äôs not like she couldn‚Äôt do it, it‚Äôs a universe where characters change their appearance all the time. Who knows, maybe she‚Äôs not an SJW, rather just thinks it‚Äôs the popular thing to be and wants to be kept updated, so she over corrected. I‚Äôm sure many of the people in the public eye don‚Äôt actually believe that horseshit, but still just say it thinking they have a moral superiority with it. Even in the Harry Potter books you can find evidence she is aware of certain things such as the extreme media corruption and how people speaking the truth are vilified if they don‚Äôt follow the mainstream narrative. Never the less, it‚Äôs still a move that should get her some respect, when back then, publicly supporting him meant you support abuse of women. He hadn‚Äôt said much about it (now we find out he was trying to give Amber a chance to walk away), and it wasn‚Äôt popular to support him. I‚Äôve been personally called names for saying I didn‚Äôt believe her (his situation hits close to home), and it‚Äôs funny now how the tables have turned.",2020-04-24T08:10:21Z,0

130,UgyvTqlkrEl7nL0dpe94AaABAg,Alexander Angelus,"Blorbo The Idiot A few years back, she accused Depp of domestic abuse. She claimed he beat her and abused her, even showed up with what would turn out to be make up to show bruises and marks. He lost the Pirates franchise, was blacklisted from many jobs, even his kids were involved in this because it went so public. JK Rowling was the only one who publicly supported him in the Fantastic Beasts franchise while the SJW mob demanded his head. Turns out, she made everything up for money and attention, and he was the real victim of abuse. His mother died, he took it very harshly and he turned to drinking, which also affected his professional performance. Most wives would support their husband through an ordeal like that, but she took advantage of it for this. Now there‚Äôs evidence she actually was trying to get him to hit her, starting violent physical confrontations, even cut his finger off in one of them, and then mocked him that nobody would believe him if he spoke out because he‚Äôs a man. That‚Äôs just a very brief summary, there‚Äôs details of her even cheating on him in his own house and shitting on his bed, the fact the guy wasn‚Äôt suicidal after all this is very admirable. There‚Äôs friends and even exes (Javier Bardem, Penelope Cruz and Winona Ryder) swearing that this sounds nothing like him, while she has a violent past and nobody thought to bring that up while they were out with pitchforks and torches, the mere fact he was born a man was enough.",2020-04-23T12:36:12Z,9
