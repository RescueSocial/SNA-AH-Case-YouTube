4,Ugw33dDQQOJAnSV3JiZ4AaABAg,Ezra and amber need to go .   If you use the reasons Mr. Depp was fired those two should be fired also.   Double standards!,Jeanne Cihla,2,2020-11-16T03:49:26Z
5,UgwlMBULFEJWUHjJOkt4AaABAg,"Depp was asked to step back from his role, what i read...

When I first heard that he beat his wife back in 2016 (I though he was still with Paradis, so I assumed it was her that he abused), I believed it.  But this year I found out about this case, and been following it since.",merdelune9,1,2020-11-13T16:55:15Z

Heard fucking admitted she was abusive in court. This is dumb af...

Got this chick is a fucking clown. J.K.R is bigoted? Really? No ma'am, you are just a crazy sjw who wants to force 6yr olds into sex changes...",Project Utopian,0,2020-11-13T14:56:49Z
9,UgyWsU_CinGCdrhH3MF4AaABAg,"A libel or defamation case is very difficult to win. Although you can be right overall, any small detail can make it as though you've lost. Not an attorney. However, if Depp hit Heard even in defense, that could basically be used as evidence that the statement is true.",Christopher Smith,1,2020-11-13T13:41:53Z
