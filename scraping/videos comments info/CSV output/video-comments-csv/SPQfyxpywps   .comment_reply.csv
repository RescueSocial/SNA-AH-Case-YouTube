2,UgySlTsJI-wYTGGqPYN4AaABAg,Kirsty Fairly,"Michael Davis-Exactly, and people don't just wake up one day after over 30 years of involvement in romantic relationships and start abusing their partners, nor as you pointed out, does consumption of drink necessarily turn someone abusive or make them a bad person. What so many people seem unwilling to acknowledge is that AH is the one with the history of abusing her former partners not Johnny. All of Johnny's partners have never had anything but wonderful things to say about how he treated them during their relationships with him, in fact I've heard everyone who knows him best or have worked closely with him describe Johnny over and over again as warm, gentle and incredibly kind. They even say that he's so overwhelmingly patient that even when they've seen him in situations were most people would get seriously angry he would try to avoid confrontation rather then get aggressive, and Vanessa Paradis said in all the time they were together he was very protective of her and their kids safety & she's never even heard him so much as raise his voice to their kids.",2021-01-01T16:31:23Z,0

66,Ugwg8Bv8OB_PpoCj2-B4AaABAg,cody blucher,"Hate the ruling class - Have you looked into Incredibly Average? I have never been a fan of Amber Heard even before all of this started and after watching his videos (he stays unbiased and looks at ALL of the evidence, not just Depps) it seems pretty clear who abused who. Amber literally admits to hitting him and throwing pots and pans at him. You know what she says Depp does when she start yelling at him? He does the gentlemanly thing to do and walks away. And that is what pisses her off. He says a man would want to walk away and settle himself down before he does actually ""pop the fuckin wife."" He tries to de-escalate the situation. In the recordings Amber is non-stop losing her mind and yelling at Depp while he remains calm and tries to rationally speak to her. She constantly doesn't let him speak. When he gets some words in and asks her even simple yes or no questions she can't give him a straight answer. She proclaims that he is such an abusive person, crazy, and that him walking away from fights is ""cowerdly"" she calls him a ""baby"" because he doesn't want to get into fights and wants to go cool down. In one of the recordings she can be heard taking out some xanax and giving it to him saying  that it seemed like the last one had worn off. Not really something she can know, and on top of that, too many of those in succession can be fatal. No matter what point Depp brings up she re-directs it to say something about her. She says she is only worried about her reputation after he brings up what is going on with his children. His son has to go to school and here ""so your dad is a wife beater?"" That's awful for a step-mother/ex step-mother to do. Seems really narcissistic to me. Now I don't know for sure because I wasn't there but I really feel like Depp is not the evil one here. Sure it could be a possibility that he isn't entirely innocent. Whatever. That doesn't change the fact that she admitted to throwing pots, pans, bottles hitting him with a closed fist, almost cutting off the tip of his finger, ect. The witnesses that Amber has are many times contradicting each other and the pictures that she has, Incredibly Average, shows that they are not from the places she claims they are. And going to do an interview show the day after taking pictures of her bruises and split lip? Watch the interview and tell me it wouldn't hurt like hell to make the faces she does in it. And there doesn't seem to be any bruising/split lip, and she does not have the make-up caked on either so that claim really doesn't hold up. Anyway, look up Incredibly Average, watch the videos in their entirety, then come back and try to support your claims. Seems to me that you have only looked at one side of the story. Almost forgot to mention that Depp has had zero history with DV and all of his ex's attest to that. On the flip side Amber has arrest charges for DV with her ex girlfriend so what is more likely, a man with no domestic violence charges suddenly starting to beat the crap out of his wife even though multiple of his ex's say that he is one of the most loving, caring, and gentle souls, or a woman who has had a history of DV in the past? Just putting that into prospective. 
Before you start saying ""you are a Depp supporter so your opinion is invalid,"" I am not idolizing him, I enjoy his POTC movies and Edward Scissor Hands, but those are the only films I have seen of his. I am just pointing out that there seems to be more to the case than you seem to know. Not attacking you, just trying to let you know that you may not know the whole truth and neither do I. We won't know until the court has reached a decision so before you tell people they are wrong, look into it more and follow the whole case from beginning to end. Cheers.",2020-02-13T22:35:52Z,1

Their body language wasn‚Äôt littered with signs of lying all of it showed signs of discomfort, stress, critical and, fear. Even one question James held back tears. If they are both lying than they have to be the best fucking actors I‚Äôve ever seen because when someone shows you fake emotions you feel nothing because the body knows it‚Äôs fake but, for them? Ya no I felt that fucking shit but, yet I can watch mj defend himself and feel nothing or just intimidation because he constantly has to move his hands around to show dominance over the reporters. Someone who spent a lot of time with him as a child and even said nothing happened to him can‚Äôt stand with him anymore. If you want to sit there and use old court documents as your excuse than go ahead but, in the same breath I guess you should believe amber because her shit went through court. The justice system fails and, fails even harder when you where and, continue to be seen as a untouchable, no wrong doing god. It‚Äôs weird that in a interview he can say ‚Äúno child stays in my bed.‚Äù Yet a next he‚Äôs like ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs wrong with that? They want to sleep with me.‚Äù Not to fucking mention if he didn‚Äôt do this and sees it as this horrible unthinkable shit like any normal person would why is it in his interview he gives himself a light sentence? Police will do this during interrogations to see what the criminal will give themselves and it‚Äôs ALWAYS this light sentence, if he didn‚Äôt do it and thought it was as bad as he wants you to believe why didn‚Äôt he say ‚Äúwell they should be handled by the fullest extent to the law.‚Äù Instead of ‚Äúwell I think they should be given help.‚Äù Ummm Michael the person you would be sending to jail touched children ruining their lives forever you know what abuse is like and how it effected you so why did you give them nothing? Oh yea I get it. Why is it when he talked about the FBI searching his shit that he does it in the 3rd person something people will do to take any blame away from theirselves. During that she mentions the pictures at first it‚Äôs ‚Äúnothing matched up.‚Äù Than his friend says ‚Äúit was something small the got blown up.‚Äù So which was it? A small mark that happened to line up or, nothing completely? Like literally this man could have killed rabbits, baby crocodiles and, had newborns for breakfast and, we could have proof of this and, you guys would say he did nothing wrong because god forbid you hear the overrated king of pop did some fucked up shit with his power. He hates birthdays so much from his abuse and couldn‚Äôt do the parties or Christmas yet he love Christmas. There‚Äôs shit that doesn‚Äôt line up and we will never know why fully.",2019-04-05T19:12:51Z,1
156,UgylTCJODojXsgkr_cJ4AaABAg,Amethyst Dawn,"Melanie Tarantino Sadly, that‚Äôs the ultimate truth. We‚Äôll never know for sure. I‚Äôve leaned hard for over 20 years, believing MJ molested boys, and LN was extremely powerful. Safechuck‚Äôs testimony about being abused in the train station years before it was built is the stumbling block *for me* in LN. But I don‚Äôt know. However, I agree with your assessment about his rabid fans and the vast majority of your comment.

I hate Joseph Jackson, though, and I hope he‚Äôs in hell. That man caused so much suffering. 

Since I‚Äôm saying that, I‚Äôll add that the parents of the boys- all of them, not just these two, and the parents of the few girls who ‚Äúshared Michael‚Äôs bed (Chantal Robson said she did),‚Äù are absolutely insane, irresponsible parents to the nth degree. You just don‚Äôt let your kids sleep entirely unsupervised (or at all, but, just to be precise) in a grown man‚Äôs bed, a virtual stranger because you *really don‚Äôt know a guy you‚Äôve only seen in videos,* just because he asks them to or somehow sets up the kids asking to. Because to say the kids always wanted to do that shows manipulation by MJ *no matter what he did there* because what little boy is like, ‚ÄúI wanna sleep in someone else‚Äôs bed/or with them in my bed at home?‚Äù ü§Ø I mean, slumber party my ass. I could even *see that,* if it were a group of kids and they all crashed out, like Wade‚Äôs mother said. But when it became just one boy, alone with one grown man, just NO!",2019-09-03T03:19:01Z,0

2) I see numbers are important to you. So how many witnesses who'd stated they'd seen the bruise had been deposed, exactly? Check that number and how that depo fits with the police report (since yes, 2 out of those unobservant people you've mentioned had been police officers sent there specifically to investigate if there had been any reason to believe Heard had been harmed). Don't come back until you do.
3) Not after the divorce. 3 days after the alleged incident. Facts are important. Such a funny joke to throw at someone who'd just experienced a scary domestic abuse situation, anyway, isn't it?
Finally, I see you don't understand why I use words like ""if', ""alleged"" etc. while you don't bother to extend the same courtesy while talking about Depp, so let me explain that to you: it's because this case is ongoing, with new evidence still popping up, and there is no ruling, yet, so pretending we have 100% info on what happened is unethical. In case that's confusing to you, presumption of innocence is one of the founding rules of the modern legal system and a human right. Do you know who exercised presumption of guilt?

230,UgyW2sg0LMbRJK3nl_F4AaABAg,Melanie Tarantino,"Greg Bond Because there‚Äôs no evidence besides pictures in ONE case saying he‚Äôs not guilty while his body language tells a completely different story. We will never know if he did or didn‚Äôt do this shit the only ones who will know for a fact are him and, the kids. You guys always use this same excuse with ‚Äúthe FBI tracked him for 10 years.‚Äù Completely untrue it was only twice over the time of 10 years apart from the first time they checked him. ‚ÄúWade is a liar.‚Äù The only proof you stans can provide is the court shit as if you completely forgot how abuse works in children. When we are abused we don‚Äôt grow up from that point to a extent and, we do not see it as abuse at the time when, we are told by the abuser that it‚Äôs okay and, ‚Äúloving‚Äù when they talk about their abuse they talk in the present time because that‚Äôs how we go back to it, we go back to that time and, you tell the story as such. Their body language wasn‚Äôt littered with signs of lying all of it showed signs of discomfort, stress, critical and, fear. Even one question James held back tears. If they are both lying than they have to be the best fucking actors I‚Äôve ever seen because when someone shows you fake emotions you feel nothing because the body knows it‚Äôs fake but, for them? Ya no I felt that fucking shit but, yet I can watch mj defend himself and feel nothing or just intimidation because he constantly has to move his hands around to show dominance over the reporters. Someone who spent a lot of time with him as a child and even said nothing happened to him can‚Äôt stand with him anymore. If you want to sit there and use old court documents as your excuse than go ahead but, in the same breath I guess you should believe amber because her shit went through court and, she wasn‚Äôt seen as the abuser then. The justice system fails and, fails even harder when you where and, continue to be seen as a untouchable, no wrong doing god. It‚Äôs weird that in a interview he can say ‚Äúno child stays in my bed.‚Äù Yet a next he‚Äôs like ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs wrong with that? They want to sleep with me.‚Äù Not to fucking mention if he didn‚Äôt do this and sees it as this horrible unthinkable shit like any normal person would why is it in his interview he gives himself a light sentence? Police will do this during interrogations to see what the criminal will give themselves and it‚Äôs ALWAYS this light sentence, if he didn‚Äôt do it and thought it was as bad as he wants you to believe why didn‚Äôt he say ‚Äúwell they should be handled by the fullest extent to the law.‚Äù Instead of ‚Äúwell I think they should be given help.‚Äù Ummm Michael the person you would be sending to jail touched children ruining their lives forever you know what abuse is like and how it effected you so why did you give them nothing? Oh yea I get it. Why is it when he talked about the FBI searching his shit that he does it in the 3rd person something people will do to take any blame away from theirselves. During that she mentions the pictures at first it‚Äôs ‚Äúnothing matched up.‚Äù Than his friend says ‚Äúit was something small the got blown up.‚Äù So which was it? A small mark that happened to line up or, nothing completely? Like literally this man could have killed rabbits, baby crocodiles and, had newborns for breakfast and, we could have proof of this and, you guys would say he did nothing wrong because god forbid you hear the overrated king of pop did some fucked up shit with his power.

241,Ugxu4vRiTWi1duI__md4AaABAg,commando552,"‚Äã@tra lala The problem I have with the Depp version of the story is that if you look at the uncensored picture it in no way looks like the sort of injury you could get from a thrown bottle as he described. How would a thrown bottle cut off the very tip only? It would have to break, which honestly it probably wouldn't against a soft hand, and then when it did the pieces would not be able to slice all the way through a finger, which they couldn't as glass has thickness so cannot generally actually chop through something like a knife can it can only slice the surface. Also, it it weird that there was only the one injury on his whole hand, surely if there was flying glass that could slice through a finger it would be a miracle that the rest of the hand is untouched. Just to address the ""break"" this is not necessarily indicative of an impact injury rather than a cut in this case, as with the tip being cut off it is very common to break the bone at the end of your finger.",2019-03-28T00:35:37Z,2
242,Ugxu4vRiTWi1duI__md4AaABAg,tra lala,"Tbh, the story about cutting off your own finger, dipping the severed (that would be seriously bleeding!) digit in paint (most likely toxic) and writing with it always seemed fishy to me. He would be lucky to get out of that without any serious consequences. And imagine the pain! Who would add pressure to that? And yes, I know she claimed he had been high, but note the drug she named: extasy. Is it really supposed to make you raging mad?
You say his claim is new, too, but his bodyguards had claimed they had witnessed her throwing bottles at him from the beginning. That story about the mirror sounds much less believable than getting your finger fractured by the thrown bottle (it sounds fairly plausible it would shatter at the contact with how many rigs Depp wears). The moment I read the story was exactly the moment when I started questioning Amber's story. Well, along with the fact that the police took Johnny's side.
All in all, I respect suspending judgement if you don't have enough info to go on, but his claims deserve the same consideration as anybody's and we should treat them seriously.",2019-03-27T22:06:37Z,3
