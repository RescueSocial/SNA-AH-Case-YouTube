     I recently seen Shiloh and her mother posing and apparently? She is very beautiful in her elegant black dress. Personally? ""I looked at her once, and? I  had to reply the scene: again and again. Because? I was captivated by the way she looked and how pretty she truly was. I see her dad and her mom in her, and noted: (That was why she was so beautiful; Because? She was a mixture of  Angelina and Brad and the beauty was twice as noticeable. Therefore? To me; She is very attractive, and cute.) I think? She is becoming more of herself: ""Lovely Shiloh!.""",Andy Munnings,0,2021-11-19T16:54:05Z

I didn‚Äôt keep my hair short simply because I had long curly hair that I don‚Äôt think my family would‚Äôve let me chop off, but I did chop it off years later after graduating college. The thing with me was, I grew up around boys, my cousins were boys, my friends (next door neighbors, etc) were boys and that‚Äôs who I hung out with. Like my first ever sleep over with friends from school was all boys and I was the only girl there. 

I used to get crap at school all the time. I remember getting called ‚Äútomboy.‚Äù I remember recesses, I‚Äôd always play on the boys team because they were my friends. One day the girls were like ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a girl, you‚Äôre supposed to be on the girls team.‚Äù I probably said something like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to be on the girls team.‚Äù But my BOY friends at the time stood up for me and said ‚Äú(Insert my name) is on our team or we don‚Äôt play.‚ÄùIt was weird because I don‚Äôt remember boys ever saying anything to me about it, but I‚Äôd get it from other girls all the time.  I think tbh the boys thought of me as one of them.

There is nothing wrong with it and don‚Äôt ever try to force a kid to be a certain way because of ‚Äúgender norms‚Äù. If a girl prefers boy things over girl things, there is nothing wrong with her and the same thing goes the other way around.

I've got a 16 year old son who has worn nothing but track pants for over a decade, doesn't matter the temperature either. 100 or -10 he's wearing track pants.
I have an absolutely beautiful 17 year old daughter that decided last year to cut 30"" of her hair off & start dying it. In the last 3 months it has been rainbow, yellow, purple & right now is blue. She handed me her proof for her senior pictures & she's in a tux top. Why? Because the school insisted on uniformity & it was the tux or an ugly vest top. My response? I wish you would have smiled.

There's not one way right way to be a girl or a boy. Sometimes people just are what they are. I used to be the biggest tomboy until I was 25, but that doesn't mean I denied the fact that I'm female. I just preferred boys clothes.

Letting kids express themselves is the best thing. If more parents where chill on this subject, we probably would have more well adjusted children. Maybe we could avoid having people detransition.

3.  make our own home made cleaning products and toileteries rather than using industrial chemical based products created by big corporate companies that we are allowing to destroy this world , 
4. stop consuming dairy and animal products as it has a devastating effect on the environment 
5.  buy from charity shops rather than big companies like primark , New look, or awful branded names , whom use sweat shops and slavery to make our things ,  
6. buy or rent cargo bikes rather than use cars 
7. Walk instead of drive when ever possible 
8 . organise car shares and days out together rather than using so many cars on the road 
9. instead of recycling , just don't buy drinks etc in plastic , use refillables 
10. Use a train or bus instead of cars etc 
11. Girls don't bother with make up , you beautiful as you are 
12. When you want to waste and burn your money on alcohol , cigarettes , or drugs , think of some one or a charity or organisation like a children's hospice or animal rescue that does good for the world and donate it to them instead sometimes ;D it makes you feel fantastic when you KNOW your making a difference .

197,UgxRMg_M3kHDuSe7_c94AaABAg,"There are a MYRIAD of reasons a child will be gender atypical and ‚Äúgender‚Äù in children is often flexible before puberty. 
Tomboyism is very prevalent amongst kids who are pre lesbian/bisexual, also in kids who are on the autism spectrum. However, not all tomboys grow up to be homosexual or are on the autism spectrum, many simply grow out of it as they hit puberty. 
How children  are raised plays a HUGE role in their understanding of the world they live in. 
Whilst you can‚Äôt make a masculine girl more feminine nor a feminine boys more masculine, you can teach your children it‚Äôs ok to not follow gender ‚Äúnorms‚Äù and that feminine boys and masculine girls are just as valid as those who are gender typical. 
The less fuss and attention the better. We should not be labelling kids, or their behaviour and allow their personality room to grow and develop. Children learn what they live. The brain is growing and developing in reaction to their environment. Biological predispositions do not equate to pre determinations. 
I was ‚Äúthat‚Äù child. I‚Äôm 49 and I‚Äôm still a ‚Äútomboy‚Äù‚Ä¶I never grew out of it. I‚Äôm butch, lesbian and proud to be a woman. I was taught by my adults that it was ok to be THIS kind of girl and I believed them. 
Most kids grow used to simply grow out it, until the ‚Äúaffirmation‚Äù approach came along. Now most  kids are having their delusion affirmed and they are getting sucked down a life long medical dependency road. 
It is perfectly possible to live life as a gender atypical person in a gender typical world free from drugs and surgeries. 
I‚Äôve also worked with children and families for 30 years. I‚Äôve seen kids like this a million times. It never has to be a big deal, so long as said child is given the tools to deal with being ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù, in a world that wants them to conform. 
These kids are  often very smart, imaginative and highly creative. Gender rebellion is a sign of creativity and thinking outside the box. 
We should not be labelling or medicalising them.",Jo Gower,5,2021-10-28T15:05:20Z

There‚Äôs a huge difference from a child going through a phase and dressing more masculine vs. wanting to only be called John and to be referred to as a boy. I even remember people talking about her starting to officially transition, starting hormone therapy, and even getting hip augmentations. I‚Äôve known people who were genuinely trans and experienced gender-dysphoria, but this is not it. People who are don‚Äôt do a complete 360 and identify as their original gender and name again. She was never a tomboy, non-binary, gender fluid, trans, etc. SHE WAS CONFUSED ABOUT HER IDENTITY. This can happen to people simply from peer-pressure, some form of trauma, abuse/neglect from a narcissistic parent and needing to assimilate to receive love/acceptance from them, etc. This happens to many people. There‚Äôs a huge difference from looking up to older brothers,  ‚Äúwanting to be one of the boys‚Äù, and being more masculine vs. wanting to BE A BOY and then suddenly doing a complete 360, dressing feminine, and wanting to identify as her original name. It‚Äôs funny because all of the people who were shouting from the rooftops that everyone should be more open-minded, accept her as a boy, and accept that kids know who they are at 3 years old are now these same people shouting that we should all mind our business and that we should not assign any labels (even the labels and pronouns we were told to) with anyone.

404,Ugyiw-xYAMSFgsqz4114AaABAg,"I grew up wearing hand me down clothes and most of them were boys clothing because the other families that gave us clothes had sons. I also had short hair for most of primary school years because I liked going out with friends after school and we played all sorts of sports and hung out in forests and abandoned places. It was easier to climb trees and jump fences when your hair couldn't get caught in stuff (I have super thick hair, so my hair ties tend to break.) Most of my childhood friends were boys because we shared many interests: comic books, anime, action movies, and video games.

I also worked in trades for a time and wore men's clothing handed down from my dad because I'd rather get worn jeans and steel toe boots dirty at the lumber yard and steel fabrication shop than my nicer clothing. 

However, I am a woman 100% and I would never want to be a man. I don't wear make-up unless it's for a wedding or an extra-special event, and I choose not to wear high heels because I find it uncomfortable if I wear it for long periods of time (however, I do know how to walk in them because I asked a model friend of mine to teach me how in high school; I'm pretty good at it, actually.) Wanting to wear comfortable clothing doesn't make me less of a woman. I think we have to stop labelling people because people constantly change and we all go through phases depending on what we're going through at the time.

416,UgxighmRcpHJraFisnF4AaABAg,"This is a control factor with Angelina, she tried to down play Shiloh beauty.  For a vain parent, can't have your child getting more attention for their look than you do.  I as a child like to wear jeans but would also be okay with wearing dresses.  I liked what would be considered at the time boys toys and had race tracks and cars and baseball gloves but also had Barbie's.  I climbed trees and jump off low hanging roofs with my male cousin.  I am 59 now so I can looked back and realized that a child brought into this world should not be label by what they find interest in and should be exposed to everything.  Girls during my time was called a tomboy but it just was a girl that did not just want to play with tea sets (all the time or at all) but wanted to be athletic and run and play with what she saw as her equal.  Parent are trying to categorize their children because of what they show interest in at 2 years old.  I said plenty of times that I wish I was a boy, 1 because of the fun toys and still got to play get scrap knees and on TV women were depicted as being less than and domestic servants and during the whole body change and the freaking Period (life did not look fair).  Parents that do this before a young adult get to find themselves, are being and doing this are self centered and rigid.  A child can only dress in what their parents dress them in (because they can't dress themselves in the beginning) and can only dress in the clothes a parent provides for them.  I had a boy first and my next child was a girl because of lack of funds I used some of her brothers items to cloth her but did doll baby her up when also.  So now she a grown woman that goes from dressing sexy to the far side of wearing oversize sweats/baseball caps/ and high top Nike (which now is all the style).  Angelina has some issues and you can see it in her life lived, eyes and reaction to control people around her.  She done some great works for humanity but raising kids is a serious business.  It hard getting older as a celebrity, and watching and seeing your daughter blossom into a great beauty and possible have a career as good or better than your own.  Shiloh really needs her dad at this time to because Brad is the more chill personality that will talk openly to her about humankind and let her make decision for herself (age appropriate) and not squash her spirit.  I was born in 1962 and now we in 2021, expose your children to different things and let them chose what they find interest in and don't label them because of it.  Short hair cuts on young girls and adult women were worn before I was born (Audrey Hepburn, etc.), because of the style and easy care.  Some shorter length were on young ones after a continuous lice episode or safety issue of possible hair getting caught and them it so easy for them during morning getting ready routines.   But does Brad not have the kids on his own at time?  Just asking because video only shows her out with mom.

Bigotry against any child based on there imagined privilege is your system of belief, equality is a lesson best leant when it is practiced, and the best way to lead in that intellectual reasoning is to LIVE it and have your children witness those atributes! Practicing bigotry leads to more bigotry! Meanwhile, Maschietta or Tomboy, thats what I was called as a child and it was for the fact that I preferred to be a Tomboy!!! I dressed in the clothing, I played the sports and even did some motorcross and enduro! Yet when it came to my sexual preference that came naturally and was no big deal! I was also a twin and a doctor told my mom at one point on that issue of my preferred dress, ""allow them to be individuals"" and she did! Until I left the upper levels of education and entered the work force I did not give much thought to my dress, fashion etc..., yet I again choose naturally and I dressed in professional clothing that reflected my choice and style, my grand used to say ""FASHION IS FLEETING, STYLE IS FOREVER!""So Female!

God even made animals to never be the same as us because God made us completely different from them, He breathed His breath in us and gave us life, He made us to have a relationship with Him He made us to glorify Him, animals can't have a relationship with God and they can't do what we can because they don't have the same DNA as us because God made us different, He made us in His image. God made us for Him, even when Mankind fell into sin because they disobeyed God, God planned salvation for us before it all happened. See Jesus is the only true God, He's Omniscient, Omnipotent, Omnipresent, Omnibenelovent, He is self sufficient and has self existed before He created everything. when Mankind fell they needed a Savior and that Savior is God, when Jesus came to earth He was not as we are, He was a man but not like mankind, He was God walking upon the earth that He made. when He said before Abraham was I Am (John 8:58) He was saying I Am the Great I Am, His claim was true and He proved it. if Jesus didn't go to the cross for us, we all would be in hell. only God could done what He done for us. He is God, His death was sufficient to pay the penalty for the sins of the world (1 John 2:2). A created being could not pay the infinite penalty required for sin against an infinite God. Only God could pay such an infinite penalty. Only God could take on the sins of the world (2 Corinthians 5:21), die, and be resurrected, proving His victory over sin and death and that true and only God is JESUS! no one nor anything can be God, only Jesus is God.
The bible says He is God, His followers believed He was God and even said He is God, His works, actions declare He is God and Jesus declared Himself to be God. Salvation and forgiveness of sin can only be by and through Jesus for Jesus is God incarnate, the eternal Alpha and Omega (Revelation 1:8; 22:13), and God our Savior (2 Peter 1:1). Jesus loves you and wants to save you, read John 3:16 in the bible it is about God's love and salvation for all! believe and have faith and the Holy Spirit will come in and lead you to repent of your sins and God will forgive you and cleanse you by Jesus precious Holy blood and the Holy Spirit will make you born again ( John 3:3-8).",Jesus Followers Women Ministries,0,2021-09-08T17:58:33Z

Maybe she was just such a daddy's girl and saw him as such a hero she wanted to be exactly like him, literally, in every way. 
Maybe she's just a tom boy. 
Maybe, since her parents knew they were thought of as a 'gorgeous couple', hence their kids would be gushed about as gorgeous they wanted to do everything in their power to make it so the media couldn't sexualize them as they often do with kids WAY too young. 
However, most definitely, especially as a minor who didn't choose to be media speculation, it's none of our frickin business and we should just let, kids especially, grow up and live in peace. 
If we're so wrapped up in other people's lives, we obviously don't have enough of our own life to keep us busy.

Everyone is trying to force these kids to choose rather then teaching them that u don‚Äôt pick on others rather than have an open conversation. I didn‚Äôt ask my 10 year old what she was or who she liked I just told her about the LGBTQ+ community n told her she had no right to make fun of insult or judge no one else that‚Äôs not just phobia that leads to discrimination that is also a form of prejudice u want people treating u nasty cuz your Hispanic? No ok than u don‚Äôt disrespect people for being gay or trans just like u don‚Äôt want no one to disrespect u for your culture. I don‚Äôt ask because if she if she is she will tell me. Stop assuming a girl is a transboy cuz she likes to play basketball n a boy a trans girl cuz he likes cooking.

Tell me it wasn't growing up because of the haircuts.  And looking in the mirror at someone short haired when she wanted long hair.  Kids think all kinds of things if they are made to come up with their own conclusions.  Now we have to make them decide, as children, what GENDER they want to be??  That would change week by week in a child's mind if they are made to decide something like THAT.  Yeah her mother was a jerk for making her get the haircuts, and the little girl was really depressed about the fact that she couldn't grow her hair long.  She was, I know this.

I think it's good that her parents let her dress how she liked and cut her hair and experiment with names, the fact that she seems to have gone back to her old name shows that it doesn't force agendas on your kid to let them experiment with what's comfortable.

Maybe she'll go on to come out as trans or non binary or maybe she's fine being cis after all, but just likes dressing like that.

867,UgytZtHwmR9Yz0hqHcJ4AaABAg,"Many people in the comments below who identify themselves as women (I wonder if they are just hetero cis-women),  are stating that just because the eldest biological kid of the actors, now that the kid is a teenager and is dressing now with stereotypical women's clothing  , that the former dressing style was just ""a phase"" , plus many of them argue that it's logical for girls to want to use boys' coding because it's nice, practical , comfortable and functional.  Would have they said the same thing if the kid would have had a male sex but chose from the age 2 to age 13 to be called with female pronouns and dress with sophisticated , uncomfortable and ""non-functional"" stereotypical girl/women's clothing (dresses, skirts, high heels, make up, etc...)?
The comments of those women only tell me that they are making statements from the perspective of ""confirmation bias"", by   using only what they see that validates their believes, but ignoring  other equally logical explanations that could explain what  they see. For instance, maybe the kid of Angelina and Brad, thanks to the wealth and emotional support of the parents, was able to develop his or her gender identity with total freedom (maybe they were home schooled, or were in a bubble of very progressive people chosen by  Angelina and Brad, and maybe the kids of the family did not have to face everyday life situations of  middle class people (such us : doing groceries, going to hairdressers, going to a crowded school and so on)  , but now that the kid is a teenager and that socialization is very important and almost unavoidable (middle school/high school, group activities such sports, music, theater,...), maybe the kid has realized how tough is not to conform to hetero-sexist gender expectations of the society and rathers to dress under the expectation of the society , so to avoid to have to fight or to be bullied. Many transgender teens do so, like many gay kids try to eradicate their former mannerisms or feminine behaviors to acquire very stereotypically masculine roles (until they are adults and feel free  to be themselves again). None of us , nor the media, will be able to know the truth just by looking the behaviors. The only way to know the real reason of the kids dressing style and to know about the kid's gender  is by  speaking with the kid , and it's none of our business to do so. If the kid is obligated to do things against the kid's will (which ever that might be) educated adults of the system (such teachers and so on) will identify the case, whom will be able to report to justice authorities . While that doesn't happen, is none of our business to judge how kids of other people do dress or behave, as long as their behavior doesn't interfere with our freedom to choose our personal choices and freedoms. For all these reasons,  its very important to have teachers educated in non conformative gender identities and bullying, and to have all kids amd teenagers exposed to all type of gender and role diversity, so that can have a  ""real phase"" of exploring options and discover their own identity, if needed. And I say if needed, because though there is fluidity, most straight or heterosexual people never experience a ""phase or exploration"" of homosexuality and have always been certain of their sexual identity no matter how many sexual, gender and role diversity models have been exposed to. Similarly many LGBT+ people have always known what their identity was with out needing to experiment a phase or trying heterosexual behaviors. The key is not exploring, but to have the free choice to explore with safety if needed or if wondering. The ""gay phases"" of straight kids/people are as common as the ""straight phase"" of LGTB+ kids/people. Let's not fell into ""confirmation bias"", and lets kid be themselves.",SabinJBB,1,2021-08-08T20:50:41Z

Sometimes yes, because then I didn't have to be afraid of men (I've been through stuff, otherwise children that young aren't afraid of men). But did I ever *feel* like I was a boy? No. Now that I am in uni my style doesn't even come close to a tomboy anymore, although I still prefer clothes that cover me plenty.

1050,UgzsanH7sfyZHW1vhuh4AaABAg,"OH. My god. This is so obnoxious. I was a ""tomboy"" as a kid. I liked playing with cars, wearing basketball shorts and plain loose tees, play in the mud, liked martial arts and sports and acted VERY ""boyish""...but never did I want to BE a boy. I just liked the things that people expect only boys to like. And then I grew up and started liking fashion and more ""girly"" things - things that are marketed more towards females. It was NEVER a gender identity thing - I just like the stuff I liked and dressed the way I felt was most like me. It's great that people are much more aware of trandgender children and all, but it becomes so damn problematic when people scream ""TRANSGENDER"" based on what a kid is wearing. It's like we're going backwards at the very same time as we are going forward. Decades back, people knew that some girls just liked things that boys usually did (of course it didn't go over very well for boys who liked female marketed things), and that was that...that it didn't make them a boy. But now a girl cuts her hair and wears baggy clothes or a tuxedo and SUDDENLY SHE'S A BOY. Wtf. Slow down. It's nobody's business. If the kid IS trans, THEY will be the one who speaks on it. Nobody else has the right to assume or push anything into children. There's a HUGE difference between ""tomboys"" and Trans boys.",Sofia,0,2021-07-19T03:58:28Z

At Shiloh's age i was the same. 
Relax, i became an amazing person. The benefits? I didnt get catcalls or the ladylike socializing gender trash other girls get forced with. I was shown the ladylike mannerisms but also i got a taste of fun ""guy"" stuff too. It actually let me be more creative and become a great actor today. Also, being a girl who walks other girls home at night was nice. Simply, they thought i was a real guy. I got a new gal pal.

My parents basically just say: let the kid be a kid. Better a very manly tomboy then a skimpy escort for a daughter. At least i wont need a man to walk me home at night.",S L,0,2021-07-12T08:47:08Z

It‚Äôs not healthy for us to obsess and gossip and pry into the lives of children, nor to project our political battles onto freaking children. 

 These rampant and widespread behaviors are such a violation to the dignity and rights of these kids. These human beings never asked to be famous nor consented to having their privacy violated and their every move torn apart. 

Whether this kid is cis or trans is none of anyone‚Äôs business until the kid decides otherwise. Many kids go through phases... and there‚Äôs all kinds of reasons why a child may explore androgynous or opposite-gender dress or personal style.

1684,UgxbkYMDpQCBcW0Uzbx4AaABAg,"Wow, a kid does what they want for a bit.  How f*cking dark.  I can't even see.  

Clearly, this was the result of their parents brainwashing them.  If they hadn't let the kid try to figure themself out, they would've turned out the exact same way.  Like damn.  

Also, the random kinda famous lady is clearly a doctor.  When this nosey lady called the kid a boy, she was medically diagnosing them.  When she posted the kid with those kinds of tags, she clearly was just following the parents' example.  Like, I know the parents kept referring to the kid as ""she"" and ""her,"" but that was just a cover-up.  

Thank goodness for the misleading video title, because now random people get to send hate to an actual child and their well-meaning parents.  Well-meaning or not, letting a kid do harmless things (like wear jeans and a t-shirt) could lead the kid to actually think they are their own person with feelings and emotions of their own. 

I'm grateful that this random-*ss company is bringing this child into the limelight, so I can call the f*cking FBI and CIA.  Because letting a kid figure themself out in harmless ways is f*cking disgusting.",Jack The Demiboy,1,2021-06-01T20:48:32Z

When my son was around 4 years old, he had phases where he‚Äôd blindly stare outside our backyard window & would mope & cry for at least an hour!  Every time,  I would ask him what was wrong & he‚Äôd would give me stories about his dad not taking him hunting or fishing or to town for provisions like he‚Äôd promised him so many times... 

In those times he didn‚Äôt see our home for what it was...He‚Äôd describe it as he remembered it in his mind...a colonial home!  He remembered himself as being 13 years old & old enough to take on responsible duties...

Brought him to our doc who referred a child psychiatrist...  He was obviously a believer in reincarnation because he said that my son was perfectly normal...  He also said that if parents really listened to their kids they would probably understand that kids often reminisce about a most recent lifetimes....  

The memory usually fades as they grow to puberty....Mine desperately wanted to prove himself to his then dad.... Others can see in other dimensions... And there are others who want to pursue a passion they developed in some other lifetime which also fades with time as they start identifying with their present social trends....

As Angelina was going through the trials of media misinformation... I often wrote comments that Shiloh was just going through a temporary phase of identity confusion & that we should all mind our business & let the child figure it out without interference & the weight of guilt added to the mix!

We should all remember that mothers who truly care for their children have an empathetic sense for what their kids are going through!

If your moms didn‚Äôt have that tingling sense for you doesn‚Äôt mean that all moms are the same!!

Body and brain are interconnected; scientists have found no separate innate ‚Äògender‚Äô area of the brain which is fixed at birth. Children‚Äôs brains are very plastic; they develop through interaction with people and the environment and they are constantly absorbing information and influences which shape them. We are our bodies.

Children aren‚Äôt born hating their sexed bodies. Children and teens are extremely malleable. Children and teens are being encouraged to freeze their sense of self in a moment in time, during the period of life when everything is in flux. And even though key researchers have said over and over again that most gender dysphoric kids ‚Äúdesist‚Äù and grow up to be gay or lesbian and most grow to accept their biology; even though the latest research denies any such thing as a ‚Äúmale‚Äù or ‚Äúfemale‚Äù brain, parents are encouraged to socially transition their kids, put them on ‚Äúpuberty blockers,‚Äù and refer to them by ‚Äúpreferred pronouns and eventually guide them to mutilate their genitals.",Jeremy Lee,0,2021-05-17T05:53:03Z

1972,Ugxa_6ZbJcOSC9-DK4J4AaABAg,"I don't understand why some people still assign genders on clothes or haircuts. A girl can be a tomboy without having to want to be a man/boy. When I was younger, I had a tomboy phase where I would reject the girly dresses my mom would buy me because I feel more comfortable in boy clothes. I think this was because I was very active and sporty and I like clothes that can make me move better. The fact that I also have 2 older brothers made me like to wear boy clothes and play with toys that are usually given to boys. I hated playing with a Barbie and would only play with whatever my brothers were playing. This was me until high school and even until the earlier part of my university life. However, despite this, I still liked boys more and still identify myself as a girl. Then after I graduated, I transitioned into more girly clothes and loved dressing up whenever I travel. I don't wear pants as much anymore but my style still varies from tomboy to sexy dresses. Depends on my mood tbh.

She didn't like men and didn't find out her sexual prefernces until she was in her late 20s. But then one day she met a man with a larger than life personality who stole her heart and helped her figure her sexuality out and that complete tomboy turned into a loving wife and eventually into a mother of 5. Nowadays you label them in a specific way but back in the late 60s early 70s being different meant you were a tomboy just a tomboy. It was ignored as a phase and there was no real stigma involved at that time. People just accepted it. It certainly wasn't commented on in magazines or on the television. It was just accepted as part of growing up back then.

How shocking.

 I was the ultra tom boy for many years and didn't embrace my feminity until I was in my early twenties. She should have never been referred to as a boy because she never was a boy. 

Having respect for adults who are fully self aware and understand that they want to live life as the opposite sex is one thing. I fully respect trans adults. 

But I don't support this nonsense coming out of ultra progressive camps saying that if a 10 year old girl insists she's a boy then she's a boy. That's complete and utter bullshit.

Technology is advancing massively year on year and with it the level of transition one can make if they do decide to make that change later I think 18 + should be standard for such a decision and if they come to regret it later at least that is there decision and not because the parent made there childhood something it wasn‚Äôt and influenced the kid. 

I mean 2 year old is so young to be indulging a kid in such a life altering decision i have nieces who cant even tell the reality about some of  what is on YouTube being fake and are a good bit older then that.

If kid is in there teens and are mature/ smart then of course support them to wear whatever they want but leave it to them just give them some pocket money to buy there own cloths and find there own style don‚Äôt buy them the cloths  as some girls are tomboyish / rockers/ indie etc doesn‚Äôt mean they are trans.

Same with boys some wear flamboyant cloths but are not necessarily gay or wanting to be trans everybody is different and needs to be allowed to develop themselves  her daughter is only daughter in family so of course she will look up to her big brothers and copy them as a baby etc only they can decide what they are and how they identify.",James,0,2021-04-14T10:35:32Z

At the end of the day, what she wears and who she dates is basically irrelivant to who she is as a person. Good for Brad and Angelina for letting her just be herself and loving her for it. My  parents loved me too, but I always sensed that they wanted me to conform to gender norms far more than I actually did, especially my dad, and I'm sure it did lasting damage to my sense of self, even though that would never have been their intention.

2422,UgzTOs-JWRJwZTQcUO14AaABAg,"I completely understand why Angelina was upset with the grandma and agree with her on this one, let kids be who they want to be, not who you want them to be. 

People like to think this means parents must leave all the decision-making to the child. No. Asking a child who has developed a sense of comprehension ‚Äúwhat do you want‚Äù is actually very respectful imo. I also feel like it builds a certain level of trust between a child and their parent. Kids aren‚Äôt stupid. And unlike most adults, they always know what they want. As a parent, you just need to be there to help identify your child‚Äôs interests and help facilitate and guide the decision making process. Especially with things that help build their identity as a person like clothes and preferences in hairstyles, activities and so on. 

Also labels are a problem. If it weren‚Äôt for labels we would probably accept that people evolve and they have a freedom of choice. They evolve into who they really are or into their potential. Problem is we wanna put a label for every stage of a persons evolution and whatever choices they make, instead of just accepting people for who they are.

If Shiloh wanted to dress like a boy, later changed her mind to dress like a girl and maybe wanted to dress like a boy again.. it shouldn‚Äôt matter. Shiloh is still Shiloh. The fact that we wanna classify Shiloh for every choice she makes, makes us undermine her evolution as a person and her journey of coming into Shiloh‚Äôs true self.

Whether you have said so or not.

THAT said, it sounds like Shiloh was going through the usual mini ""phase"" of whatever she was going through and she will decide what she wants to be when she finally grows up.

If she wants to?And who cares what other people think..?there are different aspects to people's personality... It's unbelievable that in today's age that people are tripping over dumb shit like rather a person's attire matches the gender of said person .. Doesn't matter if she does and/ or wants to dress like a boy or not.. Why does that matter to people .. so damn stupid and irrelevant.. Leave the girl alone.. so what if it was or wasn't a phase? People grow.. and change .. that's what happens.. doesn't make Angelina a bad parent cause she lets her child wear male attire .. in my opinion , it's better than letting her walk around with all her goodies exposed.. like some young women do...and even if she did that wouldn't make  her bad...just cause cause a woman dresses sexy doesn't mean she is a bad woman.. there are so many reasons why people dress the way they do .. and alot of times it has not a damn thing to do with what most  People assume .. other times it does.. who cares ... These people who talk shit.. aren't raising her .. bottom line.... Is that is all people got to do these days ..look 4 something ..anything ..negative ..to say about others ..and rather it's wrong or right..especially something so dumb and juvenile as this..what it shows me about Angelina as a mother ..is that she loves her daughter as an individual  ..and cares more about what her daughter thinks and feels than about the image of other dumbass ..bored ..jealous people ...who aren't busy enough with thier own lives ..focused enough on their own shit...so they gotta pick apart ..the ..stupidest of shit in other's lives ..cause ..they are shallow and superficial..and their own lives are uninteresting..give me a dn break...why not focus instead on the other 99 percent reasons that make her a good mother instead of the 1 percent reason why they THINK she isn't???? Unbelievable.. Like She ..clothes her..feeds her...loves her ..doesn't make her repress her Phases and feelings or growth..or likes ..ect.Whats so bad about dressing like a boy anyway..? I mean if these people are losing sleep over it ..I'd say it's a sure fine sign that they in need of some serious counseling ..and .. therapy .. these people don't have a clue what a bad mother is ... If they think letting her daughter dress like a boy makes them a bad mother... Wow. The ignorance of some people..wtf?By letting her dress like a boy... Just shows me that Angelina is less concerned with keeping up appearances when it comes to her daughter .. than .. she is about the petty social standards of people who who don't have the balls to judge themselves and fix there own shit first... I mean what's wrong people .. she isn't showing enough skin so that you could then ..then put her down for that?? Maybe she is avoiding another Jon Bennet Ramsey story...There are other far more serious matters concerning Children ... That would be more deserving of these people's attention and and focus.. when addressing .. BAD ..

2733,UgxwitMmdHtMf6avA-V4AaABAg,"The daughter of Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt, Shiloh Jolie Pitt, has been struggling with gender for several years. The girl had previously stated that she was a boy and even started taking hormonal pills to become more masculine even before she was allowed to undergo gender reassignment surgery.

Shilo did everything to look like a guy: she wore short haircuts, picked up masculine looks, and adhered to dark tones in accessories and shoes, however, recently, the foreign public began to notice that Shiloh had grown her hair and began to look more feminine. The other day, the paparazzi managed to catch 45-year-old Angelina with her three daughters in a supermarket, where her extraordinary daughter was cutting her in a mini-skirt.

Shiloh Pitt

Fans of the star family believe that gender-selective therapy helped the teenager and now the girl will refuse to change sex, but American rumors say something completely different. One of the users of the foreign portal JACOBCalebSmith said that he possesses insider information.

‚ÄúMy friend is one of the journalists in a famous magazine. They were informed in the editorial office that Shilo had given her mother an ultimatum: she would remain a girl if she made peace with her father and they got back together. Now Jolie is busy with Pitt returning, wants her daughter to remain a daughter‚Äù, said the insider.

Is it really? Time will show ‚Ä¶ In the meantime, let‚Äôs be glad for Shiloh and for her small steps towards certainty.

The baby Shiloh got so much attention when she was born because of her parents and beauty and I think Angie didn‚Äôt want her daughter to outshine her so she would dress her as a boy and showcase the adopted kids more.

2840,UgwSwxwrhJavP1rZK5J4AaABAg,"Unfortunately we live in a society where people feel the need to label others based on societies expectations on how a girl or boy should act and it‚Äôs honestly very sad. People have questioned me and tried to shove me in a stereotypical box since I was born because I come from a family with 3 older brothers who all act like a stereotypical boy should. My sister and I are 11 months apart and since I was about 2 I always gravitated to the things she liked instead of what my brothers liked. My brothers played with trucks and cars. I played with dolls and stuffed animals. I am very artistic and love music and making art. I loved to sing and dance with my sister as a kid and I got made fun of a lot for it. Everyone in my family was quick to make assumptions about me and let me know how weird and wrong it was for me to express myself in a feminine way. School made things even worse. I learned from a very early age that I was different and that most of the people around me didn‚Äôt accept me for me. I had CONSTANT pressure to act a certain way. Talk a certain way. Dress a certain way. I pretty much had to be aware of everything I was doing and saying and anytime I slipped up something would happened that reminded me I was different in a ‚Äúbad‚Äù way. I developed pretty severe anxiety at an early age and had depression by around 4th/5th grade. My parents don‚Äôt really believe in anxiety/depression being a mental illness so I never have been treated for either. Their advice was ‚Äúknock the hell outta them‚Äù or ‚Äújust learn not to care what others think‚Äù Teachers judged me,students judged me, my family judged me, and strangers judged me. Everyone always said I was one of the nicest sweetest kids you could meet yet I was ostracized quite often. Girls were always more accepting of me so by 1st grade I would tend to gravitate towards having mainly girls as friends. Girls always had a crush on me and I dated a lot. It didn‚Äôt matter though cause the guys would just get jealous and treat me even worse. Middle school was the worse years of my schooling. I had a great relationship with most of my teachers in school and would get recognized for academic achievements a good bit which made my peers gossip even more about me. If I didn‚Äôt have a close group of friends I wouldn‚Äôt have made it out of middle school. People need to wake up and realize that kids should be able to express themselves in anyway that feels natural for them. They shouldn‚Äôt be shamed and forced to be someone they are not. My kids/nephews/nieces will know nothing but unconditional love from me no matter what. Provide a safe space for your child parents. Don‚Äôt let ignorant people influence you to change your child. All your kid wants is love and acceptance. I commend Angelina on how she raised her daughter. It‚Äôs clear she loves each one of her kids. Lead with love people ‚úåüèª",anime tsunami,0,2021-03-04T08:07:36Z

2873,UgzZrcO2EBW-t1Kpjrl4AaABAg,"I have two daughters and two sons.  My oldest daughter was nicknamed Beautiful Julie in high school, spotted for potential runway modeling and commercials by the time she was 15.  She takes after me as far as loving fashion trends when I was in my twenties, enjoying the art of makeup, hair styling and coloring and super feminine clothes.  

My youngest daughter, refused to wear any hand-me-downs from her older sister, fom the time she was 2 years old.  She insisted on wearing her brother's clothes.  He was the next oldest to her.  She wouldn't wear a girl's bathing suit.  She would only wear shorts like her brother.  She would get his t-shirts out and then button down his plaid shirts over it.  Should very very long blonde straight hair until she turned 14.  She's been wearing a boy cut ever since.  I used to have to take her shopping, versus her older sister.  Because I could help her identify her own style.  Blazers... T's.  She's never worn makeup.  Maybe mascara wants for a Halloween dress up thing.  And she was uncomfortable with makeup and jewelry.  She recently at the age of 25 let me give her a beautiful opal ring.  When they were growing up her older sister would say she wanted to be a nurse, My younger daughter's response would be she wanted to be the doctor.  The older daughter would say she wanted to be a flight attendant, younger daughter would say she wanted to be the pilot.  I let her be who she is... After all, there was no way I was going to be able to force her into wearing skirts with flowers and butterflies.  

So I completely understand that Jolie Pitt parenting style for Shiloh.

being called Julie when she was 2 years old, that's not her birth name.  It finally stuck.  I decided to just go with it.  So I understand that Julie put parents going along with calling Shiloh John when she insisted on it.  I think it's better to go with the flow, than by force.  

I also understand guidance.  I got divorced when I was pregnant with my third child.  So my son was in a household with three females.  So is confusing for him and I had to role model things for him... He's lucky because I grew up one of three girls from a Tennessee farm boy turned US Naval Commander pilot... So my sisters and I grew up shooting rifles chopping wood driving go carts, fishing etc, and are European mother taught us how to make an entrance in a elite party... Dressed in fashion.  I inherited my mother's beauty, So people enjoyed putting me in formal fashion and photographing me.  I feel very fortunate to have been exposed to both the things that boys typically enjoyed at that time when I was growing up, and the things that some girls never got to experience because of my parents' money for fashion.  

So my son was lucky,  that I would camp and take him fishing and backpacking, catch frogs and swim in the river, I had my own tools, I fixed our own stuff.  I put our stereos together, and built the furniture etc.  I taught all my kids to ski and play tennis, and traveled with them To cities and famous beaches in and out of country.",genie michelle,0,2021-03-03T04:19:51Z

And now I am 19 and I still don't wear dresses and I buy male clothes or neutral clothes more often than I buy female outfits. This does not make me transgender. This does not make me gender confused. I am a female and even if mentally I am in most ways very male-like it still really doesn't affect me. Stop forcing kids (and even adults) into believing they're trans just because they sway towards a particular style or preference. You don't have to be Liberal to know that gender doesn't control your preference in style and appearance. My parents are Conservative(ish) Christians and they've never forced me to be anything other than who I am.

There is nothing wrong with a vibrant, masculine girl, embracing the young woman she's growing into, and discovering what that's all about. In fact it's wonderful.

3190,Ugw9OMgdf_d0Rz_-K6p4AaABAg,"I agree about identity and children...both of my children went in very sort of different but yet the same direction. Hair color was a big thing for both of them. Then they got very creative with their clothes. They would put together styles and redesign their clothes. The hard part for me was cost. I would buy school appropriate clothing and sometimes stuff would be transformed into comment-attention-getting changes...sometimes at the loss of a very lucky find at a really amazing price. We were poor so it was only cost that caused any prohibitions.

I do think that it is easier parenting if you are comfortable with a non-confrontational style of parenthood. I think there has to be some guidance that somehow helps children make appropriate choices for all the right reasons. Making mistakes in fashion choices isn't necessarily life threatening. Explaining boundaries, norms, and code switching is very important. Shiloh was never inappropriately dressed, just not traditionally clothed.

I think Shiloh could have been experiencing some identification issues...seeing herself more like her brothers, poses the question, ""why do you identify more with your brothers than your sisters?"" There in lies the key. Shiloh very intelligently picked up on a certain disparity in gender types and preferred what she identified as better for her. As she grows up, things change. Influences change. People and places change and children change...and may I say, that is all to be expected, thank God! Being an individual is the tough side of growing up. ""Who am I?"", is a hard question for some people...not for Shiloh! She stayed true to who she felt she was...and she still does, obviously.",Juanita Skelton,0,2021-02-17T00:39:33Z

So seeing parents that keep complaining that they were expecting a boy and had a girl instead and seeing them being happier taking care of boys will certainly put in a young girl's mind the idea that maybe she should act and think like a boy to get more appreciation from her parents. I have seen this way too many times and the parents will totally deny the fact that they triggered what made a little girl want to be a boy to fulfill her parents' dream so they can be proud instead of just being grateful for the priceless gift of parenthood....considering that so many couples just can't have children on their own!",Jeffray Crownwell,3,2021-02-11T05:29:16Z

Have you ever lied, stolen, hated, used God's name as a curse word (O-M-G)? According to God's law, you're guilty, your headed for hell, ignorance will not be an excuse... But wait, God loves you, he made a way out for you, God's son Jesus died paying for your sin.  God so loved the world that he gave his only son that whoever believes in him will not die but have everlasting life. John 3:16 
 
God is warning the world. End Time prophesies are jumping off the pages of the Bible, satan is ruling with his plagues, violence, idol worship, scoffers, and government control...
The earth is experiencing birth pains like never before, earthquakes, fires, floods. People now are lovers of themselves, money, lovers of pleasure rather than God, we see sexual immorality running rampant like adultery, fornication, homosexuality, sexual abuse rape... the ultimate in child abuse mommies killing their babies in selfish child sacrifice (abortion), and religious persecution against Christians only (they will hate you because of me, Jesus (Matthew 10:22). 
The world leaders are prepping for a,""One-World order,"" a ""Great Reset,"" (please don‚Äôt take a number on your forehead or right hand, read Revelation a number means no heaven, and there's only one alternative, eternity in darkness, suffering in a lake of fire) 
Soon the believers in Christ/Christians will be taken up, away with God, the world will be in turmoil, then the antichrist will come and fix everything, everyone will love him, he will deceive many with his worldwide lies... then the tribulation will start, you will be forced to worship the beast and take his number. Life on earth will be horrific. 
Today if you hear God whispering to your heart please respond before it's too late. Say a humble prayer, pour your heart out to God, receive Jesus as your savior, believe God raised Jesus from the dead (Romans 10:9), and repent of your sins, you are now saved by grace!
