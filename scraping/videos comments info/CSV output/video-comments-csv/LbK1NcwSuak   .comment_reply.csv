And if a man express that it hurt he's mocked and called many deragative terms so he has to hold in all the mental pain. Like u know of the infamous ""don't drop the soap"" joke it belittle and mocks male rape but we're expected to view rape on a women as this monsterous act. Why is one mocked and the other condemned because society teaches that men are incapable of being weak and therefore a weak man whether physical or mental is not a real man. Which then add to the men not express there feelings which leads to violent outburst which can be minor to a hole in the wall to something major like killing.",2020-02-04T01:36:49Z,0

I've been a victim of domestic abuse myself (not at his hands, of course).

How much harder they make it for real victims - already struggling to be taken seriously in many cases for various reasons - to be heard and acknowledged!


I think Depp's had some real problems with addiction and troubled behaviour, but there is no reason other than Heard's claims to believe violence against any partner is one of them. He's no monster.

290,Ugx8PzhUMXE4DacVXX94AaABAg,Mia Rosenbloom,"@Shacour Brissett  The person I replied to said this.... ""I think the reason people are hesitate to say Johnny Depp is an (alleged) abuse victim is because a) Depp is a man and b) Depp is much older than Amber.""


In my comment, I was basically saying that it doesn't matter that Johnny Depp is a man, nor does it matter that he's much older than Amber Heard.  Amber's the one in control, she's the one who has power over Depp, because she loves him the least, if at all.  Did you not hear how Johnny beg & pleaded with Amber to stop abusing him?  


I'm tired of people infantilizing young women like Amber Heard.  She's a controlling, manipulative bitch, who's been abusing Johnny Depp.  She knows EXACTLY what she's doing.",2020-02-06T09:58:11Z,2
