3,UgxZdh6Tw6QNZGw-eDF4AaABAg,Dani,"@voodooprincess11 I don't think making judgment is very fair, you are not either of these people, you have no idea what goes on behind the these videos. I know you have experience and can perhaps detect it however wouldn't his allegedly abusive behavior show up before he even got with Amber Heard? His exes even say he was a gentle man and never abused them in any way. Amber on the other hand has had a history of domestic violence or so i have heard in multiple videos. There are multiple accounts of Johnny being physically abused by Amber, there are also a multitude of pictures supporting the fact he was hit. Hell he even had the tip of his finger severed because amber through some kind of wine bottle at his hand. Anyway it has been proven time and time again that Amber was the aggressor most of time. I am in no way dismissing the possibility that Johnny could have also hit her but was it in self defense? or something else? Its unclear. He has had a history of, when drunk or on drugs, assaulting someone however I don't think that really always translate into relationship behavior. We also need to remember that Johnny was abused by his mother, apparently this is what ive heard, so he is no stranger to abusive behaviors and it seems he decided to break that cause he is not violent towards anyone he loves such as previous significant others and his children. But Amber has manipulated a lot of situations and has been caught lying multiple times about being supposedly hit by Johnny. Everyone's anger is different along with their behaviors you cant expect every person who has an aggressive side is an automatic abuser. It seems he threw stuff around and banged some stuff along with throwing her phone. There is a story for his anger allegedly he found out he had lost money that day and that's understandable. Now I'm not saying Johnny is this angel but Amber has done many things that have really driven Johnny to this point... He seems like a broken man.  Anyway rant over, if you delve further into this case you can see that there are many inconsistencies in Amber's story and has led many to believe that she was the sole aggressor in the relationship.",2021-07-18T02:47:39Z,1

And, ( not judging), but the Manny girlfriends. ?! If he was so perfect, would you not think he would be it an ongoing secure relationship, like for instance Paul Newman, or some other. The film business, and all the public adoration, cultism, is toxin for a normal life. Same with politicians. Or , Artist, sometimes. It's hard to be talented, sometimes around a man; as a woman. There is a natrual need for masculinity to be in charge and the dominant sex. Difficult balance. And, some women too can't be sisters to each other. Too much competition. Sometimes, if not strong, either way , spur each other on. Not easy balance. Why I personally like to stay very private. But, somehow , guess tend to lean toward the female in trouble.

Every video I‚Äôve made analysing her behaviour is looking at the specific behaviour in the specific context we could hear/read. I haven‚Äôt seen all of the evidence that was presented in court and so haven‚Äôt given my opinion on the verdict. We can hear in the different recordings that Amber Heard was emotionally and physically abusive towards JD. I don‚Äôt know if they had solid evidence that JD ever hit Amber Heard or not. In this example, JD isn‚Äôt being abusive towards Amber, he is angry about something else and I think she appears to be setting him up.",2021-01-01T09:42:29Z,1

357,Ugx8F4zvLckVlvXSf294AaABAg,Candyman,"At the end of the day Heard should not be abusing him. Him being older than her has nothing to do with it
She is the abuser in this. 
Put is this way...why should their age difference make her abuse anymore acceptable?",2020-09-07T19:56:31Z,5
358,Ugx8F4zvLckVlvXSf294AaABAg,Anne Donnellan,I think she us plain without ten layers of make up. Nasty being doesn't know if she us s woman or s man,2020-08-15T01:10:56Z,2
359,Ugx8F4zvLckVlvXSf294AaABAg,Mellon Lord,"Also his longest relationship was with Vanessa Paradis who was 5 years younger...so. He does go for women too young, Kate Moss was and so was Winona Ryder. That's not my point. I'm his junior by almost 2 decades so it's fine with me if he goes younger wink wink.",2020-08-15T00:07:51Z,0
360,Ugx8F4zvLckVlvXSf294AaABAg,Mellon Lord,"@Tammi Chenard Did I say they weren't? You all are putting words in my mouth. I didn't say they weren't and I didn't say he shouldn't be dating women closer to his own age. I think all those things are true I'm just pointing out the way it's said about him is victim blaming. Men aren't even allowed to be victims. If he were the abuser and you saw someone say, 'The things women will do for money. That's what a gross gold digger gets.' You'd all be calling it out as the sexist comment, and victim blaming it is.",2020-08-15T00:06:15Z,1
361,Ugx8F4zvLckVlvXSf294AaABAg,Floral & Fire,"If you're trying to say that women who are battered, are typically psychotic and trying to set up their husbands... you're sadly mistaken.

The vast majority of partners, men or women, who say they are battered are actually battered. The very slim percentage who lie about it? Are like Amber. 

It's good to shine a light on cases like this, however don't mistake it for being every woman or man who's battered is lying like a psychotic asshole. They're not.",2020-08-14T21:32:08Z,0

363,Ugzzl0q234sSga3PkVZ4AaABAg,Amy Feinstein,@Lovely sosweet also he was acting this was she She walked into the room to record it. Otherwise he would have been in there alone not intimidating anybody. At the end of the video you can hear her laugh as he leaves the room.,2020-08-22T22:15:53Z,2
364,Ugzzl0q234sSga3PkVZ4AaABAg,Amy Feinstein,"@Lovely sosweet amber admitted on the recordings that she has hit him, thrown objects at him, sliced his finger off by throwing a bottle at him. There are multiple witnesses to attest to this. Johnny depps mother had just died and he had discovered people had stolen millions of his money. When my mother died you can bet that I was angry and upset, that i punched the wall. Does that make me an abuser as well as a crazy narcissist?",2020-08-22T22:13:59Z,2
