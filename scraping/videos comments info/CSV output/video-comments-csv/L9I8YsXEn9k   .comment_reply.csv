""I don't understand your point here. What do you mean ""when most watching are not professionals""? Professionals at what?""
- In the legal profession.

""I fail to understand how you don't see a problem with a video all about the conflict of interest in a particular trial giving out very misleading and confusing information.""
- Again you are drawing information from other parts of the video which I have stated many times are not relevant to my point. I have agreed that they may give out misleading information in the rest of the video (3.5 mins onwards), I take your word for it and I'm not surprised. I have also even agreed with you that it's misleading to say ""best friends"" without proof and also agreed that it's stupid to do that. 

""Right here, you are even suggesting that there is no big difference between claiming two people are 'best friends' and claiming that they are 'probably friends'. That is insane.""
- That's not what I'm saying, pretty dumb to take my point out of context when I have been crystal clear with what I mean by that. I'm saying that it's not a big difference in this context because it doesn't make any difference to how they are connected because they have worked closely together.


""I don't know why you are comparing these two things anyway, because no one is claiming these two people are 'probably friends'; we already know that they are friends. The issue is whether it is okay for these guys in this video to claim these two people are 'best friends' when they are actually only friends. ""
- I use the word 'probably' because I personally don't know about any statements either of them have made to declare their friendship or any other party saying/demonstrating so. If they are already friends then the error they made is even smaller. They should have said 'friends' instead of ""best friends"" in that case. 
How do you know they are friends by the way?

""I fail to see how anyone can think this not a very false and moronic thing to claim.""
- Are you insane? I have said several times now that it was stupid and false of them to say that. I'm just making the point that it doesn't change anything about how who is connected to who because we have already established Jen was mentored by Geoffrey and they worked together. FFS please don't make me repeat this point again.


""You are clearly claiming exactly what I said you were claiming. You are taking part of my sentence out of context and pretending that I am claiming that if other people besides Dan and Andy were making this claim that Geoffrey and Jen are best friends, then that would prove that they are. Here is my original statement that you are misrepresenting: ""They are obviously not best friends. If they were best friends, then people other than just Dan and Andy would be saying so, and there would be some evidence of it."" Please note the word ""and"" before ""there would be some evidence of it."" It's important. Then in response to your misrepresenting what I said, I replied, ""I was not claiming this to be proof by itself. I was clearly claiming this to be part of the reason we can safely assume that their claim is incorrect."" Please note the words ""part of"". They are important. Please learn to read.""
- I can read just fine and I didn't take anything out of context. It was very clear what you were saying. You are putting emphasis on the word ""and"" in your response here to try and mask the fact that you said ""If they were best friends, then people other than just Dan and Andy would be saying so"". You think just because you said ""AND there would be some evidence of it."" it excuses the stupidity demonstrated in the first part of your sentence. 
Why not just say: 'They are obviously not best friends. If they were best friends, then there would be some evidence of it.'? - Obviously you don't have a rational answer to this question.


""You wrote: ""- Your explanation doesn't relate to my 'Fourthly' point.""

So what? Why on earth should it? What it does relate to is the question you asked me. It was an answer to a specific question you asked me. I was not in this specific part of my post addressing your 'Fourthly' point, you lunatic.""
- I thought you might have the brain to relate your points back to the core of this argument but you like to go on tangents and make points we both agree on for some odd reason.


""You are determined not to see any problem in these guys making moronic statements and false claims, and you are still refusing to even read my original post in which I pointed out other moronic statements made in this video. I wonder what it will take before you start seeing a problem. Does it take Dan claiming that Amber is the judge's daughter?""


- Again I have said that their ""best friends"" statement was stupid and false, how am I refusing that? 
- I have explained why it's irrelevant to read the rest of your original post several times you spaz. It's completely irrelevant to the points I have been making. 
- Remember we are specifically discussing what they are saying in the first 3.5 mins of the video. I have agreed that it was false and stupid to 1. Say ""best friends"" and 2. Mispronounce Lette. Anything beyond 3.5 mins is irrelevant to the points I have been making no matter how wrong it is.

- Did I say you didn't know this? - No, I'm just putting it in there as part of an example statement to explain the connection, that's all. Also put the reference there just in case you didn't know to make it easier for you to fact check. Obviously you have a massive issue between ""best friends"" and 'probably friends' so that reference supports the idea they could be very good friends which makes the ""best friends"" statement more plausible but still wrong for them to say of course. Point is it's such a minor mistake that it doesn't at all invalidate how they explain the connection.

- The connection is not presented ""really"" badly, they make a small mistake with the ""best friends"" bit but as I explained that doesn't change the most important part of the connection which is the mentor and working together connection. Robinson and Robertson sound very similar and are easy to mix up, this was a live conversation they had where they didn't edit so much, mistakes like that are easy to make.

12,UgwqI3XitOVZNDGGfWR4AaABAg,Fred Maestro,"@D for Diligence You're unbelievable.

""You are a moron. The description in this video of the connection between Amber's lawyer and the judge is not at all accurate. Your 'Fourthly' statement was therefore something any intelligent, rational person would disagree with.""
- I'm not talking about the whole video, in our last two responses to each other, I have only been referring to the first 3.5 mins of the video, and the only error there is saying ""best friends"". You seem to be massively held up over this point when it's a red herring. Everything else they say about the connection is correct, they get the important bits right and it's enough for people interested in the subject to have a good grasp of the connection. You seem to think they need to present this video with the upmost professionalism but I disagree, what do you think is going to happen? That Depp's lawyer is going to watch this video and craft his appeal around what they are saying in this video? Obviously not, so it's not an problem for most people, the point of these videos are to get people talking about the connections and give people a general sense of what is going on, if they get a few things wrong here and there I don't think that's a big issue.
My 'Fourthly' statement is something any petty, moronic, irrational and dim-witted person would disagree with. I can't believe you still can't admit that my statement is technically and factually correct. It's just ridiculous.

""You wrote: ""So I imagine they'd be pretty close doing that together.""

The issue is not whether they are pretty close, it is whether they are best friends, you lunkhead. ""
-  I'm saying whether they are best friends or friends is a minor point you spaz so you shouldn't be so caught up over the fact they said ""best friends"" instead of 'probably friends'.

""You wrote: ""Either way, whether they were best friends or not can't be proven anyway,...""

They are obviously not best friends. If they were best friends, then people other than just Dan and Andy would be saying so, and there would be some evidence of it.""

- It's very hard to prove who is best friends with you without carrying out a proper investigation, I'm talking text messages, phones calls, testimonies etc. That's obviously something that hasn't been looked at, so to categorically say ""they are not best friends"" is an assumption which could be false. I'd say it's more likely than not that they aren't best friends, but it's still a possibility. The fact that you said ""then people other than just Dan and Andy would be saying so"" is just heard mentality and if you think like that obviously you must struggle to look at things objectively and critically.

You wrote: ""...I wouldn't say I overlooked that statement if it is indeed false, rather I don't see it that important to Depp's appeal whether it is true or not, the more important evidence and more concrete evidence is the connection I described.""

""The issue is not how important it is to Depp's appeal, the issue is how accurate and correct this video is at presenting the connection between the judge and Amber's lawyer, you oaf.""
- I'm just bewildered as to why you get so upset because these guys made a small mistake (in the first 3.5 mins) and I'm trying to think of reasons why so. Most people watching this aren't going to care about whether they said ""best friends"" instead of 'probably friends'. My point is they explain the connection between the judge and Amber Heard very well (in the first 3.5 mins), except they say ""best friends"" instead of 'probably friends'. You are now having to find fuel for your argument, probably because you have realised it's a bit moronic to call them stupid on the basis of them getting the connection wrong in the rest of the video when they have already explained the connection to the audience in more detail. That is obviously excusable and it's ridiculous to call them out for that with such ferocity. Regardless of these points, all of this is a tangent to our original argument which is whether what I said was correct, you wanted to use the video to support your argument that my 'Fourthly' point is wrong because they made mistakes and therefore you thought my comment was possibly a misunderstanding of the connection. 

""You wrote: ""Again you seem to be bringing up irrelevant points about pronunciation, why the fu*k do you care so much? And what has that got to do with my 'Fourthly' point?""

Please engage your brain. They are giving the colleague of the judge the same surname as Amber's lawyer. ""
- Yet another irrelevant point but I'll address it anyway. The names sound very similar and I'd say it's easy to  make that mistake, so what are you suggesting? That they don't even realise they have different surnames? That the audience are going to be seriously misled despite the fact that they put the names on the screen? Maybe it's problematic for a blind person, but I'm sure even they could work out their mistake easily and quickly. 

""Furthermore, I am clearly not confining my comment to addressing the issues with your 'Fourthly' statement.""
- Well you should do lol. Because you're wrong about it and you need to up your game explaining the 'issues' with my statement because you've done a terrible job so far. 
- Instead you want to highlight other mistakes they have made which is again irrelevant to what I have said in 'Fourthly' point.

""My original comment to you was not just concerning the problem with your 'Fourthly' statement, it was also concerning your failure to acknowledge any of the idiocy in the video. You were now failing to acknowledge any of the idiocy in the first three-and-a-half minutes. I was pointing out some idiocy there. ""
- I acknowledge it's stupid to say ""best friends"" without evidence, I'm not failing to acknowledge that, I couldn't care less if they are stupid or not, fact is though in the first 3.5 mins everything they say is factually correct except the ""best friends' part and it is sufficient for the audience to have a general understanding which I believe is more the purpose of this video than to present arguments to the court which I imagine you seem to be thinking.

""Spelling and pronunciation of names are important if you are going to try and present yourself as someone who has done research on a subject. Kathy Lette is famous. It is extremely easy to find out how her name is pronounced, and I don't know why anyone would think it would be pronounced ""Letty"" anyway, yet both the guys in this video pronounce it that way.""
- I agree, it's poor they can't pronounce that properly, but again it's not relevant to my point. 

""I am constantly having arguments with people who claim that the late Sir Jimmy Savile was a child molester, and they nearly all spell his name 'Saville', which shows that they have done no reading on the subject anywhere except perhaps on internet forums and comment sections where people discuss him who have done no reading up on his case at all. It shows they haven't even read the crap written about him in the mainstream media.""
- Why do I need to know this?

""Here is another example of where someone getting someone's name wrong is worth commenting on. The following is something I wrote yesterday in my comment on the video I spoke about in my last post:""
- I've already explained to you I respect people wanting to point each others mistakes out and so I don't disagree that it's sometimes worth commenting on. However, there was nothing factually wrong with my 'Fourthly' statement which you are disagreeing with. 
Only a very tiny fraction of people would have interpreted  Jen Robison as Robertson or Geoffrey Robertson as Robinson (whatever way round they did it) because they put the names on the screen, plus they explained the connection anyway so even if they had thought they had the same surname they would have been more likely to assume that's just a coincidence and not that they are related or something because again they explained the connection and didn't mention they were related, so who would think that? The fact that Robertson and Robinson sound very similar as well is another reason why this mistake is forgivable and not an issue. If their names had been Jen Robinson and Geoffrey Frankenstein for example, then calling Geoffrey Frankenstein: Geoffrey Robinson would obviously be more confusing but I'd argue they wouldn't have made that mistake if their surnames were very different like that, and again even if they still made a mistake like that at least the viewer still understands they aren't related and that they realise Geoffrey was Jen's mentor which is the important part. Personally I'm not too concerned about surnames unless they are related, I mostly care about how they are connected. As long as people in the chain of connections don't share first names and I know what each person does and how they are connected I don't see an issue. E.g. Amber Heard's lawyer Jen used to be protégé to Geoffrey who she now works with* and he who wrote a book with the judge of this case.
- My point is the connection is what's important for the viewer to understand so you shouldn't get caught up over them saying Robinson over Robertson for the points I already mentioned.

Please I don't want to hear anything more about how stupid they are in what they say in the rest of the video that is irrelevant to my 'Fourthly' point. You need to explain why my 'Fourthly' point is factually and technically wrong.

20,UgzogI1V_h9IUiGk0XN4AaABAg,Char Mc,"@ANDERSON & SJOQUIST i think you may be oversimplifying things. The SUN had to prove that Johnny was a 'wifebeater'. Definition as such is: A man who regularly or habitually hits his wife or female partner. The sun did not prove that at all. Her story is so implausible, she claimed 14 incidences but didn't produce a single medical record to back up those claims, no criminal charges were ever filed, no calls for help to police, nothing.  Johnny produced several witnesses willing to testify that they never saw any injuries on Scamber. The  evidence was completely ignored.  Just us nicol was compromised & should not have been presiding over that hearing.

Here is Kathy's tweet stating that it is not true that Kylie and Cate were there:

Something that Kathy should also have corrected was the false claim that this was a dinner party ""for"" Amber and the guests were all Amber supporters who were there to support her. This was wrong. It was just an ordinary dinner party and Amber was only invited at the last minute after Jen Robinson asked if she could bring Amber along. Source:

Here are some good websites on this subject:


THE CASE AGAINST HIV
October 2013
(Last updated December 2017)
Collated by Henry Bauer
https://thecaseagainsthiv.net/

_That HIV causes AIDS has been the officially sanctioned view for about 3 decades, believed almost universally but questioned openly by thousands of people, some of whom are expert in relevant sciences. These dissidents point out that a comprehensive reading of the mainstream literature together with analysis of mainstream data demonstrates conclusively that HIV is neither a necessary nor a sufficient cause of AIDS._



AIDS Dissident
Explaining AIDS as of multi-factorial origin
by M. Aziz
https://aidsdissident.wordpress.com/



And here are some good documentaries on this subject:



HIV=AIDS: Fact or Fraud? (1996)
1h 56m 34s
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTxvmKHYajQ

_One of the most powerful video documentaries of our time boldly reveals the modern medical-industrial complex’s dire descent into utter corruption. HIV/AID$ - A deadly and dangerous DECEPTION!_

_This feature-length expose explains exactly how the 300-Billion-dollar AID$ fraud began, why HIV can NOT be the cause of AIDS, what the real causes could be, and who manipulates the public’s good intentions while poisoning hundreds of thousands with toxic drugs that cause the very disease they are supposed to prevent._

_This is a systematic dissection of the HIV/AID$ machine and how they hijacked a program designed to fight a worldwide plight of human suffering and drove it down the road to hell. Yet this program offers hope, inspired by the courage and articulate arguments of a group of growing voices internationally challenging the HIV=AIDS=DEATH hysteria. A MUST SEE for anyone interested in truly understanding the facts about HIV/AID$._

_You will meet a number of highly reputable scientists who all agree that HIV doesn't cause AIDS, including Dr. Peter Duesberg, who was the first scientist to map the genetic structure of retroviruses. He is joined by Dr Charles Thomas, Nobel Prize winner Dr. Kary Mullis along with Dr. David Rasnick, an expert in the field of protease inhibitors._

_Is HIV/AIDS the golden idol of junk science? Judge for yourself. Professionally produced, written and researched, acclaimed by physicians, scientists, journalists and humanitarians internationally, this is the video encyclopedia of HIV/AIDS dissident movement! THE defining documentary on the HIV/AIDS fraud._

Deconstructing The Myth Of AIDS (2003)
2h 09m 49s
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRCyk0zdBxw

_In 1984 we were told that HIV was the cause of AIDS. In his provocative documentary film, ""Deconstructing the Myth of AIDS,"" Gary Null, Ph.D., challenges virtually every statement ever made by the American medical industrial complex on the virus - including those of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Institute for Health (NIH) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)._

_While presenting the findings of Nobel Prize-winning scientists and leading virologists, the film exposes the political maneuvering, conspiracies and cover-ups that have provided obstacles to the study of this human catastrophe from the start._

_For example, there are experts who believe that AIDS is the result of multiple factors, including drug use, stress and nutritional deficiency, but that government agencies made a politically strategic decision to de-emphasize these hypotheses and thus discourage certain researchers and their funding. Meanwhile, AZT, an infamously failed treatment for cancer, and now the primary FDA-approved approach to treating AIDS, is highly toxic and can produce the very symptoms of the illness it is prescribed to treat. ""Deconstructing the Myth of AIDS"" goes beyond medicine and science to question the very foundation of our reliance on government bureaucracies where it concerns matters of life and death._



The Other Side of AIDS (2004)
1h 26m 58s
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dVYJp5dHf8

_The Other Side of AIDS takes us behind the hype and headlines and into the heart of a brewing controversy over the cause and treatment of AIDS. Through candid interviews with doctors and scientists representing both sides of the issue and HIV positives on and off the drugs, the film opens minds and much-needed dialogue. Informative without being instructive, it raises fundamental questions about what we think we know. Its surprising and sometimes shocking revelations inspire us to take a closer look at HIV and AIDS and the systems that support our current views._



AIDS Inc. (2007)
1h 54m 09s
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQVFA38j598

_AIDS, Inc. is a film about the multi-billion dollar AIDS industry, and how it profits from continuing fears and misconceptions about the disease. While AIDS grabs the headlines and raises billions of dollars with celebrity endorsements and billionaire endowments, we are no closer to finding a cure than when the scourge first appeared 30 years ago._

_Could it be that after so many years of research, and so much money being spent, that the entire orthodox medical establishment has been wrong about AIDS, or even worse, has sought to profit on a system that it knew was flawed from the beginning? Doctor Robert Gallo who discovered the HIV virus said that there is no legitimate dissent when it comes to AIDS._

_But there are more than 5,000 physicians, microbiologists, journalists and activists who disagree and say that we have been misled about the real causes of AIDS and the nature of its treatment. The mainstream media has chosen not to provide an outlet for their opinions._

_In this important film, documentary filmmaker and health expert Gary Null, traveled to more than 30 countries over an eight year period to seek them out and get their interviews. This is the first film on AIDS that brings the most compelling of their arguments together in one place. Dr. Null blows the lid off the wealthy AIDS industry and shows how greed and corruption have prevented any real progress in fighting the epidemic or its underlying causes._

_The film challenges the entrenched notion that AIDS or HIV is an African monkey virus that is spread sexually and can be ""treated"" with harmful drugs. Instead, the film considers the common underlying conditions of the epidemic, such as malnutrition, unclean water, poverty, illness, and poor lifestyle choices. The evidence is damning, and a clarion call to the public that the AIDS Industrial Complex is on the wrong track and has become a spending juggernaut completely out of control._

_In House of Numbers: Anatomy of an Epidemic, an AIDS film like no other, the HIV/AIDS story is being rewritten. This is the first film to present the uncensored POVs of virtually all the major players; in their own settings, in their own words. It rocks the foundation upon which all conventional wisdom regarding HIV/AIDS is based. House of Numbers could well be the opening volley in a battle to bring sanity and clarity to an epidemic gone awry._



Positively False: Birth of a Heresy (2011)

_Have we been hoodwinked by the biggest blunder in modern medical history?_

_Positively False - Birth of a Heresy traces the challenge over the past 25 years to the scientific orthodoxy which maintains that HIV is the cause of AIDS. Joan Shenton reaches back to 1987 through her extensive archive of broadcast and non-broadcast video material and combines it with current footage. She shows how dissident scientists, journalists and activists have voiced their concerns about the way the infectious hypothesis for AIDS took over from the toxic one and highlights the impact the dogma surrounding a viral cause for AIDS has had on people's lives._

_The film travels through Africa, Europe and the United States revealing the way plague terror, financial objectives and scientific skullduggery have led to tragic examples of toxicity and death from antiviral drugs, social stigma, broken families, fear of sex, homophobia and imprisonment. Positively False - Birth of a Heresy is produced by Meditel Productions Ltd and The Immunity Resource Foundation in association with Yellow Productions._",2020-11-12T09:44:21Z,0
63,UgxhjJR5q_CNNmcG9gd4AaABAg,Queen Babylonia,@D for Diligence it is a sexually transmitted disease and is caught from bodily fluids. Also blood transfusions. So to say you caught or contracted this disease that way is quite a normal expression. To say heterosexual people cannot catch this is not true. If one has it they can spread it sexually. A woman can pass it onto her unborn child.,2020-11-12T08:13:06Z,0

81,UgyJWu5_RFpJGbvmZOV4AaABAg,gwangi64,@Simon Wakefield The sixth edition of Judge Nicol's Media Law book co-written with Geoffrey Robertson is apparently due for publication in 2021 with updates on legal changes in areas such as online and offline. But they haven't had any contact since 1982? https://www.wildy.com/isbn/9780414047976/robertson-nicol-on-media-law-6th-ed-hardback-sweet-maxwell-ltd,2020-11-11T11:16:44Z,1
82,UgyJWu5_RFpJGbvmZOV4AaABAg,Mic Vaughan,"@Simon Wakefield Regarding drink/drugs problems you choose to ignore Amber Heard's excessive drinking, her mixing prescription drugs against medical advise and topping these up with recreational drugs. One of her prescription drugs was to control her psychotic behaviour, she demonstrated her temper during her deposition. (She demonstrated her dishonesty in the changing of her accounts of incidents). Violence against inanimate objests, something  Depp has never denied, is an outlet to avoid violence against people and could even be seen as an admirable alternative. You don't address the question WHY would his exes make any kind of statement if the believed Depp to be guilty? they are separated from him, have no fear of him and nothing to gain from supporting him.
Why in your earlier reply to Jenn K did you infer that Nicol and Robertson would barely know each other, I say they shared a work place, you say they shared a ""co-working space"", either way you know they are more than just passing acquaintances.
I have read the guidelines and agree that he was not legally obliged to recuse himself but he was clearly morally obliged to do so.",2020-11-10T17:57:22Z,1
83,UgyJWu5_RFpJGbvmZOV4AaABAg,Simon Wakefield,"@Mic Vaughan Lets start with the second part first. There is a difference between writing a statement saying 'He never hit me' and saying 'he never got violent when he was drunk/high'. He has had a drug problem in his own words since he was 11 and he has been arrested in the past for trashing hotel rooms while under the influence. All VP and WR could confirm that he hadn't hit them BUT it calling them would have opened up a cross-examination to what they experienced of him when he was intoxicated which could help build a picture of someone who when intoxicated which his team wouldn't want to open up that chance. I don't think there is any doubt that when Sober he is a calm and mellow person that's easy to get on with but the question is what is he like when he is not sober and could that in the right circumstances turn from hitting inanimate objects to hitting people. His legal team would want to keep anything that suggests that from ever being sworn in and the Suns legal team would have been happy to have crossed them to dive into what he was like. After all its highly unlikely that even if they were better at dealing with him than it seems both Kate Moss and Amber heard were that he didn't get violent towards objects when intoxicated. 

As for the first point. You do realise that Doughty Street Chambers is not a workplace right? It's basically a co-working space where legal professionals, usually full on judges but also barristers (because in the UK Barristers can take the role of a judge in smaller cases). That's not really working together. Even if they had though having worked with someone in the past is not grounds to recuse yourself, it expressly states that in the guidebook when its talking about refusing. Not to mention Depps legal team would have been aware of any connections no matter how small and could have requested it but they clearly didn't see a problem",2020-11-10T17:11:58Z,0
84,UgyJWu5_RFpJGbvmZOV4AaABAg,Mic Vaughan,"@Simon Wakefield You write ""Writing a book with someone especially books about an area of a specific profession isn't proof of them being friends"" maybe not friends but that seems strange considering an article dated  December 17, 2008:-    Victoria Sharp QC and Andrew Nicol QC appointed to the bench.......(1 Brick Court’s Victoria Sharp QC and) Andrew Nicol QC of Doughty Street Chambers have been appointed to the High Court bench. So Andrew Nicol and Geoffrey Robertson worked togehher - a lot closer relationship than you are trying to infer.
You write ""I suspect both would under oath admit he was violent......"", this is proof of your absolute bias on the matter, why should his ex-partners make an statement at all i they didn't believe in his innocence.",2020-11-10T16:24:05Z,1
85,UgyJWu5_RFpJGbvmZOV4AaABAg,Simon Wakefield,"@Jenn K I didn't say she was acting as the Barrister for NGN. I said she was part of NGN's legal team. It's hardly uncommon especially in large big money trials like this for both sides to have people on their team who are there to look after the witness as making sure they are comfortable and prepared is an important part of witness management, you, after all, aren't going to call a witness who isn't going to mentally stand up to certain cross-examination. It's most likely why not only did Depps team not call VP and WR as they most likely were worried about certain questions they may be asked in cross (I suspect both would under oath admit he was violent when drunk/high just never at them but that shows a pattern and isn't a big leap that it could go from objects to people) BUT even more so why he didn't even look to get a statement from Kate Moss (Who BTW has never denied that Depp pushed her down the stairs and who was present on multiple occasions when the police were called due to Depp going on a drunken/high rampage in hotels rooms. At the very least if he didn't physically abuse her they were clearly scared that on cross they would get his violent behaviour when intoxicated on record). 

All you are seeing in those pictures is exactly what you see all the time with pictures of people entering court and that's the member of the team assigned to look after them doing what is needed to both reassure them but also to present the right image of solidarity (which in a high profile case is important)

Anyway AH though never had a need for any actual legal representation, she was never fighting or bringing a UK case. If she was to have legal representation it would have most likely been someone from her US team to make sure their case wasn't undermined by something she said not by someone who isn't even qualified to practice law in the US.",2020-11-10T11:12:06Z,0
