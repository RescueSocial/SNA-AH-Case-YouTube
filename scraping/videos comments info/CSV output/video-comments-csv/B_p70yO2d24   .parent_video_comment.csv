0,Ugx5bOjpFg4D79VfNzR4AaABAg,His biggest mistake was working with a certain actress who shall we say will remain nameless as she is currently in an ongoing investigation into purgery . Breaking laws in Australia and being an abuser who named her ex husband as a violent abuser with absolutely no proof to wreck his career . That was probably Mamoa's biggest mistake to be fair.,ian forde,0,2021-11-06T20:02:54Z

39,UgzUlyZP_kYW2nbZC254AaABAg,"Btw, I'm also getting pretty tired of this whole baseless ""MORE WAMAN""-argument.
Look, I have no problem with adding as many female characters as you want, but if the reason is political or ideological, then please... just fuck off. Why is that always the nr 1 thing they want to see? ""More women"". Okay, why? Why does it matter? It's a political statement. It's not actually necessary for film, nor does it in any way improve quality.

And while we're at it, there is a very good reason (well, two reasons actually) as to why comics are mostly dominated by men. First of all, all the major creators are men so it's only logical they would write mostly male characters. So if you so desperately want female characters for no other reason than having more women, why don't YOU write comics? Why don't YOU produce the change you so desperately advocate for? Why is it always men who have to obey YOUR wishes? Why should they?
Again, I'm NOT saying I don't want more women. I'm saying, I don't care either way so long as the character/ comic/ movie is good. But whenever this is political, then I do care... because it's insanely hypocritical.

The second reason is purely biological. Women are always the first to complain that most criminals are men.... but they gladly ignore (and even deny to a certain extent) that most ""heroes"" (people whose job require selfless and brave behavior) are also, mostly, if not exclusively men!
Soldiers, first aiders, cops, firefighters, security, bodyguards, etc etc. ALL MEN (99% so, at least). Is it any surprise then, that most heroes in comics are also men? In fact, comics portray this quite realistically. I never hear women complain that there aren't enough female criminals in film... not enough female rapists in literature... not enough female villains in comics. Why? ""Because most criminals are men"". TRUE. But why do they complain about ""not enough female heroes"" then? By their very logic, most heroes are men as well. You see, they want their cake and eat it too. It's a double standard. As always, women only want ""representation"" in the ""cool"" things, without actually having to do the hard work.

Want more women? Fine. Go and write comics and make movies YOURSELF and stop blaming reality because it doesn't align with your feminist, and thus biologically incompatible worldview. 
The fact is, men are physically much stronger than women. They are more inclined to take risks. They are also more inclined to be selfless and sacrifice themselves for others (""Women and children first"" anyone???).
Just stop with judging comics and its history already, because it's abundantly clear that NONE of you actually know a damn thing about it.",MG,0,2018-12-08T18:13:09Z
40,UgwcPvCDgDt23PLc_614AaABAg,"Amber is drop dead gorgeous, if not unnecessarily attractive, and while she may have been a mediocre actress in the past, she has been stepping up her game and giving good performances as of late and I'm looking forward to her role in Aquaman (hell, my favorite shot in all the trailers is her doing some awesome shit).

That all being said, I find her motivation for taking this role extremely superficial and frankly, annoying. Her view of how women in comics are portrayed is hilariously inaccurate, not to mention hypocritical. Why is it that whenever female characters are drawn as beautiful women, that is ""objectification"" and ""needless sexualization"", but whenever the male characters are drawn as Greek freaking Gods with perfect physiques, then that's completely fine? Just goes to show how ideological this is to her, and Hollywood in general.
Also, most women in comics are not portrayed as ""damsels in distress"", and even if SOME are (and there really aren't any), why is that such a problem? What's wrong with a man saving a woman? Is that somehow ""sexist""? Is that ""anti-women""? What are men supposed to do? *_Not_* save physically less capable women? But then said men would be blamed for sexism all the same. We can never win.

Furthermore, it's damn near depressing to see how entitled and frankly, bitchy behavior is admired, even praised among modern women. The way Mera acted in that comic she referred to was cringy to say the least. It's not something men could get away with without being called ""jerks"", ""rude"", etc. In fact, there is a scene in the movie where Arthur is being condescendingly referred to as ""waterboy"" (or fishboy, I don't remember), to which he jokingly responds ""It's waterman"". It's the perfect response: he both mocks the other guys and doesn't sound like a self-righteous, entitled dick while doing so.
There is no reason for Mera to react to innocent bystanders the way she did. She could have reacted with humor or kindly, but didn't. And that bitchy behavior is now looked up to... Hhhhh.... For years women didn't want anything to do with comics ""because it's for nerds"". Fine, they can think that. But now that they are making billions, suddenly it's ""time for female representation"" in the very comics and films you have looked down upon for DECADES. The very media said women know fuck all about, yet judge with their horseshit feminist rhetoric without shame or self-awareness. 

The right answer to ""why take on this role"", is because Mera is a GOOD characters, regardless of being female and physically capable (why do female characters ALWAYS have to be physically strong for Hollywood to consider them worthy???). Not because she reacted in a typically feminist way and ""put men in their place"" or some shit like that. That's just political... and pathetic.",MG,4,2018-12-08T17:56:01Z
