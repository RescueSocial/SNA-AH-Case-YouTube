22,UgyIinAnffn44wqny0R4AaABAg,chatchi,"You're pretty much right on point. What people fail to realize is that it takes two sometimes. It's easy to call Amber a crazy bitch because she's a one yelling and being furious in this recording. Their relationship has issues and both are doing shit to each other, really. Seems like the underlying issue here is that Johnny CANNOT handle rough times. It seems like he just leaves whenever she has a problem, like he's never there for her. And she states that he has done it every time and her anger and frustration has built up overtime because of it. Amber basically wants someone to be there for her, guaranteed, and not just flake out whenever, which is why she was complaining about not feeling secure or stable in the relationship. Because she doesn't know when he'll just leave again. That is a huge issue that Johnny has. He seems like the type who doesn't want conflict. It's kind of understandable how Amber got to this point. She doesn't feel that he respects her or even cares about the relationship with her because he literally doesn't do anything and just walks away at any given time. ""You can't keep poking an animal and keep expecting it to be friendly."" Of course, this doesn't excuse her behavior though. The two should've went to counseling to get this sorted out.",2020-03-19T10:59:49Z,0

65,Ugx07on1pX4Et3svt_V4AaABAg,Evelyn Waugh,"I believe that male brains (from a neuroscience standpoint) do not thrive on verbal arguments.  Women generally have more verbal skills and often don't perceive that the male partner needs to distance himself so he doesn't get uncontrollably angry,  either by terminating the discussion or by getting some air.  So he feels nagged at and picked on and she feels abandoned.  Amber seems to be very frustrated, but has clearly exceeded Depp's patience. Depp  does seem very under the influence in several of the videos and is likely abusing alcohol and adding xanax.  Amber seems to think that endlessly expressing her frustration is productive,  but it isn't.  Maybe they didn't learn any communication skills/fair fighting techniques in therapy, or maybe they just refuse to apply what they learned.  Endlessly berating your partner doesn't improve a relationship.   The age difference would complicate things.  So would substance abuse, not to mention physical violence.  One wonders if Amber grew up in an alcoholic, violent home, because she seems to be provoking him at times,  and she may confuse violence and love.",2020-02-08T02:48:52Z,0

I suffered just over a decade of this and I just couldn‚Äôt be rid of her. Looking back now it seems so bizarre, but at the time I just felt completely trapped. I even moved from the UK to the US to get away from her (just moving cities did no good - she‚Äôd find my address and be at the house at 4am hammering on the door and screaming... I was ‚Äúasked to leave‚Äù more than one house by my flat mates) but she quit her job and followed me. She found me in a lovely little city called Lawrence in Douglas County, Kansas. Had to get the police involved in the end and get a restraining order (back in the UK). I just couldn‚Äôt understand how I couldn‚Äôt be rid of her, but eventually she was all I knew; she‚Äôd driven away all my friends and I felt completely useless and worthless. I ‚Äúlost‚Äù a good chunk of my life, from 17 to 30. (Quite a few other girls showed an interest in me at the time, but of course, stupid me never acted on it because that would be ‚Äúwrong‚Äù). It was such a waste. And she was my first steady (!) relationship. 

After that I never wanted to be in a relationship ever again. I found out I was suffering from PTSD which I had to get a second and third opinion on because as far as I knew that was what soldiers suffer from when they return from a war zone ; it sounded ludicrous.",2020-02-08T02:06:59Z,0

He kept his promise to Amber's parents that he would not make any of this stuff public unless backed into a corner and needing to out of necessity; he stayed true to his word for YEARS while being tormented personally AND publicly, being called a wife-beater while losing millions of dollars.


So while he may have plenty evidence, he may also have hardly any at all because he's not a malicious person.  He doesn't get off on causing turmoil in people's lives like Amber does, so maybe he actually didn't gather damning evidence against his wife, no telling with how much of a sweetheart Johnny Depp has been through this hell of a marriage.


Johnny Depp appears to be exactly who you want to go through a divorce with lol


He pays for you to stay in his penthouse while he's also paying for his and your attorneys to work through the divorce.


It's a WIN-WIN for a woman; not only does she get a life scholarship, where all her needs and desires are met + above and beyond, but she also gets to be the dominant one.  She gets to wear the pants and bully Johnny around while essentially holding his checkbook AND his heart hostage.",2020-02-05T17:11:33Z,3

But it should never ever hurt the significant other. Or anyone else for that matter. Never. Every mentally healthy person is a bit narcissistic at times. But she's an evil one. Shes out to get him and isnt confident at all. That's all an act. And the hard part is.. She actually truly believes her own lies I'm sure. It turned into a disorder with her. For sure. Her evil patterns show. Cause she lies and hurts him so bad and can still live with herself. A healthy person would walk away from the relationship if fights are the norm. Empaths are proun to these diseased human beings. This is very unhealthy and she does a lot of damage. I wouldn't be surprised if Johnny has PTSD now. Hope he gets some help. He needs therapy to heal I'm sure. So sorry yo hear lot of ppl went trough similar events. It stays under the radar too much. 

I've been trough this as well. Well.. Kind of. This person was a high functioning drug addict and I didn't know. But became just as narcissistic as amber. Exactly the same with the same patterns. Gives me shivers listening to her. I was always apologising for nothing. Balling my eyes out. Being so depressed when he shouted at me the way amber does. The moment I cut things off he realised something. It took me 8 years to get to that point of cutting it off. The last year of the rs I started seeing that he was on drugs. I felt so dumb for not knowing. But he was functioning and has ADHD. So I thought it was normal. How ignorant of me. But nobody knew. 

But the moment I left he fell apart. But.. He quit the drugs after 20 years of using (but functioning. It's crazy but he was able to do so. And he used daily so thats still mind-blowing to me) and now I see his true colors and he's the sweetest person there is. He actually cares all of a sudden. And works his ass off to stay clean. Unbelievable. But he was sweeping me off my feet when we fell in love with the same things. The highs are very high and great but the lows are hell. Blaming gaslighting manipulating lying, threathening.. Ppl thought I was the crazy one. He was so convincing. Although it was drugs who did this to him.. I know the feeling. And I feel for Johnny. Poor poor man. I hope he finds real love again. 

Ppl say that they don't get it that he says ""I love you"" so much in all these recordings. But she brainwashed him. And it's one sided love. Empaths who don't know their boundaries give love so freely and think it will solve everything and fix the other. Until you lose yourself. And in all her evil lies she says she loves him so much.. Just enough to keep him hoping. Sick woman.",2020-02-08T08:12:39Z,0

332,UgwP0WkQcIY6wBGt2nR4AaABAg,Carlos Nieves,"I honestly feel like this is a situation of a younger, beautiful woman, taking advantage of a older man in Depp who may have wanted something real in regards to a relationship with a woman that see value in him other than his celebrity status. A woman that also makes him feel like a man as well. In the beginning Heard was probably enamored with Depp and head over heels, seeing him as an Alpha and on a pedestal in her mind. But something happened down the road where she realized certain vulnerabilities with Depp and whenever she would challenge him, he didn't put up much of a fight or stood his ground with her. Innately women challenge their man in ways that could ultimately lead to a massive downslide in the relationship if it becomes abusive. My gut feeling is that Depp is not really the Alpha type; and when push came to shove, he didn't ""check "" Heard when she imposed her will on him in various ways mentally, emotionally and even physically. This is the type of thing that slowly Escalates over time. Probably with an attitude about something or a remark under her breath as a starting point, and getting worse for there. To me this just feels like her power over him escalating to a point of abuse. On a side note, Depps calmness and Heards frustration is stemming from her desire for an emotional response within the argument. Once you go to their level, as a man you lose because they can use that against you and divert from the topic at hand. Without the emotion, they can't function.. especially if you bring facts and logic to the equation.",2020-08-28T19:21:12Z,1
