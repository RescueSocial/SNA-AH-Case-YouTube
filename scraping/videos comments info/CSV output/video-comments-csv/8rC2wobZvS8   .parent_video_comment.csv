48,UgyFVHvj_cpkmY0z73x4AaABAg,"Warner Brothers isn't going to rush to any decision with Amber. Aquaman doesn't start filming until around April, and the verdict for the Virginia trial will likely be given some time in March. So they will probably wait until then to make a decision and announcement. They might even have two scripts ready to go, one with Mera and one without. As annoying as it is, we will most likely have to wait until spring to get an answer. 
One thing to note: Amber did not film/record anything new for the Snyder Cut, nor is it clear if her original scenes will be in. Even though Snyder was the one who got her the role of Mera in the first place. It's possible that that decision is waiting on the Virginia verdict as well.",Rebecca Vaughn,6,2020-08-18T23:16:39Z
