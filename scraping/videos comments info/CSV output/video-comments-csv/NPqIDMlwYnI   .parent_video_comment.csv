297,UgxRptsTZ5uLC07SuiB4AaABAg,"Johnny Depp is not the problem with FBAWTFT,  it's Warner Bros. itself.  The WB is going down (and not so slowly) and they are cutting loose and throwing under the bus everyone (a list actors, The Producers Guild of America. Theater Owners everywhere and most of all the General Public) that could help them and get them back on their feet. These distribution companies are looking out for Number One AT EVERYBODY'S EXPENSE. 

But they can't go forward without us the CONSUMER and Consumers need to remember that going forward. We love our A list actors and they can't just ram anybody down are throats for $30 and $40 a pop.  Theaters were there when They needed to get their movies SEEN BY THE MASSES.  I think it's sad that they should just throw them under the bus.

Those should always be separated from each other.  Also both movie franchises have a different feel, which I really like and keeps me entertained.
Harry Potter movies are great, but they do not affect me as much as Fantastic beast movies, which has a unique charismatic personality. Fantastic beast movies are showcasing few of the main points what modern world society nowadays struggles with. Excepting that those who do not seek fame our recognition and gives them respect they deserve, because of their unique way to approach conflicts and problems. Making awareness about how to act with animals, instead of killing them only because of odd nature, but saving and nurturing them.
 It is my own opinion, but no matter, who will play the Grindelwald role as long as they will keep that unique feel I will be happy to watch.

He should never have taken on the case but rather recused himself and stepped away, as any decent judge worth his salt would've done. 
In remaining on the bench and continuing, he left what should have been clear, strong & solid court ethics stomped on & in tatters.
As for his eventual judgment it was so far off the mark there are clanging alarm bells ringing and huge questions surrounding the role the Judge  played in this travesty of justice.
So Johnny was not only used, abused & lied about to the courts, by Amanda Heard and her cronie (Narcissist Supply) friends as well as the main stream media.
The Judge did this a second time by abusing an innocent, non violent Johnny with his seriously flawed & shocking verdict.
Let's see what happens at the appeal when he'll have 3 judges going over the course of events and evidence. I'm certain Judge Nicol's verdict will be thrown out & viewed with distaste and disbelief.

The Judge in the trial has some incredibly damning evidence against him proving collusion. Johnny Depp never had a chance at a fair trial. If you had any question about Johnny Depp's innocence not only does that and the fact AH paid off a witness tells you everything you need to know.
