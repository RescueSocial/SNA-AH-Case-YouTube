I have loved him as an actor long before Pirates because he's amazing in all he does and he's himself just like you. I have the privilege of meeting him in Lexington where I worked after the first Pirates had come out and he was in town with family for Halloween, and they came to eat where I obviously worked at, and he honestly was wonderful.  I think when all this craziness is over and the truth fully and finally comes out, your platform is phenomenal, you are phenomenal, I would love to see you two talking. Anyhow,  love you Joe!!!",Bree Fitzgerald,0,2021-11-18T22:49:50Z

14,Ugy7ou_yuyU3_8yKAs14AaABAg,"Hey Joe. Really enjoy the interviews. Thanks. Concerning Johnny Depp and the perception that he's weird... It may not just be a factor of his wealth. Johnny Depp is an artist.(Not all good actors are.) Artists develop the metaphoric side of their brains. As a result, their values evolve. Their POV evolves. And they behave in a way that's less conventional. Often, a young artist will try to pass as conventional. They fear the ridicule of conventional people. But as they age, they worry less about ridicule and feel more comfortable being different, especially if they have enough money to insulate themselves from those who disapprove. Keep up the good work. All best to you and your family.",Robert McCaskill,0,2021-08-25T21:31:36Z

23,UgyV1WqhhKp-vpqiX2t4AaABAg,"Stupid fukyn decision by Disney considering how much money Johnny Depp made for them not only film but also in merchandise like souvenirs coffee mugs, key chains etc... Depp could have continued to earn Disney billions of dollars for the next 30 years, no other actor can replace nor ever be able to play the roll of Jack Sparrow like Johnny Depp. And not to mention that all of the  Jack Sparrow/Johnny Dep fans are all children and have no business knowing anything about Depp's domestic issues, those are adult situations and adult news channels. Parents should know better and not tell their kids everything thats going on in the world, I'll give you an example, as a kid I was probably the number one fan of Evel Knievel and never knew that man had broken every bone in his body...

In other words, if a movie costs 300 million to make, and the box office was 800 million, the result is that the studio just about broke even (unless they can make use of the IP rights going forward).",Tzadeck,0,2021-06-15T11:59:30Z

I also see a lot of people angry that JD has been removed from Harry Potter. Now, my feelings on his initial casting regardless, I would like the public to recognise that, whether correct or not, his removal wasn't Amber related. HP removed him from the cast because of his never-ending lawsuits. They felt that they couldn't be associated any longer with such chaos. I only wish Amber Heard wasn't to be in Aquaman 2, for multiple reasons. Primarily, it's a crimes-going-unpunished issue, but also Jason Mamoa doesn't deserve to have a movie he's headlining be tanked because of a supporting cast member. =(",SinataSeries,0,2021-01-19T04:36:02Z

I also respect that even when he isn't selling a movie. He visits children's hospitals in his Captain Jack Sparrow garb. Even when he isn't selling a movie. And when he does it. He doesn't tell anybody. He just does it. Again ... I respect that

I mean honestly though it's really none of anybody's business what he spends his money on and really nobody should be saying anything negative about him either again it's really none of their business he's done for more than I'm sure any of them in his life so you know people need to back off a little bit sometimes stop climbing into other people's bedrooms.,Comedybrand,0,2020-07-19T19:59:53Z

816,UgwRTtEzdd5ENvWbOGd4AaABAg,"$330,000,000 budget ( budget, as if they make any attempt to budget anything) is disgusting! There's many films that are much better that have had far far less spent on them. There taking some of that money they're doing something wrong they should take a couple hundred million dollars of that and actually work at making a decent movie and work. Use some creativity and Imagination. Instead of just spending spending spending they should take a couple hundred thousand dollars of that money and house a couple hundred homeless people or something I'm sure people would go see that movie if there was something like that attach to it I mean really Pirates of the Caribbean I mean that's a shity movie anyway it's all right but looking at that price tag on how much they may cost to make it that's not how much it cost to make it that's just how much money they f****** wasted well they were hanging out instead of f****** making the movie! People are so disgusting I mean that is just so disgusting! What were they all eating for lunch leprechauns testicles? I think we should go back to our beginnings for movie so that we can come to really understand all the things that have been lost along the way like using real costumes and really putting in the work and using creativity and Imagination..

For all the hoo-ha I have to listen to about all these Hollywood people and how great they are a decent movie only comes along once in a long while it's not like they're pumping out awesome films most of them suck so they really need to stop tooting their own horn and get back to work.",Comedybrand,0,2020-07-19T19:44:52Z

966,UgwHbvHyfUH14Uaw53h4AaABAg,"Are you saved friend? If you died tonight will you go to heaven or hell?

God Almighty, the Creator was manifest in the flesh. He came into the world to take away the sin of the world. He gave up his own life to save yours. His sacrifice on the cross paid the price for your redemption with his own blood. On the third day he rose from dead and offers the gift of salvation and forgiveness to those that repent and trust in him. This is the Gospel which means the Good News.

John 1:1-3,10 KJV
In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. [2] The same was in the beginning with God. [3] All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made. [10] He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.

Isaiah 44:6 KJV
Thus saith the Lord the King of Israel, and his redeemer the Lord of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and beside me there is no God.

Revelation 1:17-18 KJV
And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am the first and the last: [18] I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death.

Ephesians 2:8-9 KJV
For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: [9] Not of works, lest any man should boast.

Acts 4:12 KJV
Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.

John 5:24 KJV
Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.

1 John 5:13 KJV
These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God.

Matthew 28:19-20 KJV
Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: [20] Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.

Johnny Depp‚Äôs History of Violence
kyra

2 years ago

There are some advantages to be a middle-aged woman with Asperger‚Äôs syndrome, and one of those is that I lived through the 80s as a teen and remember it. And what I remember is that Johnny Depp was known as a ‚Äòbad boy‚Äô with a ‚Äòtemper‚Äô and a substance abuse problem prone to attacking people.¬†


The people who defend him online, which now tragically includes a woman I had hitherto had nothing but the utmost respect,¬†JK Rowling, seem to have either forgotten or don‚Äôt know that the accusations of domestic abuse and assault against Depp by his ex-wife Amber Heard (which include¬†pictures¬†and¬†video¬†and¬†a restraining order against Depp¬†and¬†a text from his manager¬†admitting it and¬†documents from other court cases¬†involving Depp) are just the latest in a line of charges.

Johnny Depp is very pretty and (like Mel Gibson) seems to be very nice¬†when he‚Äôs sober, but he‚Äôs also prone to getting wasted and hitting people who anger him. In 1989, Depp was arrested for¬†assaulting a hotel security guard¬†in Canada after the guard asked a drunken Depp and his friends to leave the premises. Charges against Deep were dropped after he promised a judge to be a good boy. (This works only if you are white or rich or preferably both.)


Then, in 1994, Depp was arrested again on¬†charges of criminal mischief¬† when he destroyed a hotel room ‚Äì allegedly because he was having a fight with his girlfriend at the time, 20 year old supermodel Kate Moss. He had to pay almost $10,000 in damages, but again he got off. Likewise, in 1999, Depp was¬†arrested¬†for threatening the paparazzi in London. While it is easy to sympathize with a star threatening paparazzi, it still reveals Depp‚Äôs tendency toward violence when he‚Äôs hammered and annoyed.

Incidentally, he was involved with French model Vanessa Pradis at the time, and although¬†Pradis has defended him¬†as a ‚Äúsensitive, loving‚Äù man who never abused her, its obvious he was still capable of attacking OTHER people during their relationship. Bill Cosby didn‚Äôt rape¬†every¬†woman he met ‚Ä¶ it doesn‚Äôt mean he isn‚Äôt a rapist. Moreover, court documents by Depp‚Äôs former management allege ‚Äú[Depp was being] interviewed by public authorities relating to a serious and troubling issue involving his family ‚Ä¶ [Depp] knowingly lied to public authorities in several respects in connection with these matters‚Ä¶ [His actions] marked lack of concern for certain serious family issues.‚Äù So is Pradis lying for her children?



Johnny Depp was physically abusive to Amber Heard. People accuse his ex-wife for¬†his¬†actions by saying she ‚Äòegged him on‚Äô so they can still enjoy the fandom fantasy of who he is. Just like his friends and fans claimed¬†his rages and assaults in the past¬†were ‚Äújust Johnny being Johnny,‚Äù merely the kind of ‚Äúoutbursts they have come to expect on occasion from an actor who can be as otherworldly as the character he played in¬†Edward¬†Scissorhands.‚Äù

Just like people blamed Mel Gibson‚Äôs ex when he hit her, or the alcohol he drank when he called a cop ‚Äúsugar-tits‚Äù. Just like people claim Mia Farrow lied so they can still watch¬†Woody Allen¬†movies in the pleasant denial that he raped his adopted daughter. Just like people have always blamed the victim and given the abuser a pass.


As for me, I won‚Äôt be watching the¬†Fantastic Beasts¬†sequel. I don‚Äôt watch the¬†Pirates of the Caribbean¬†franchise. I don‚Äôt listen to my old Bill Cosby comedy albums or watch his videos. I don‚Äôt watch Woody Allen films, and I am hesitant to watch films with actors who have even worked with him in the last 20 years. (Oscars are so much more important than raped little girls?) I eschew any former favorites with Mel Gibson in them.

I am torn about Miramax films ‚Ä¶ which ones were the result of Harvey Weinstein‚Äôs sexual abuse? I stopped watching¬†How I Met Your Mother, even the reruns, when they had¬†Mike Tyson, a convicted rapist, on the show as a ‚Äògood guy‚Äô. (Which was a good move because the last season was reportedly shit.) I try my best not to collude with or support abusers and rapists.

But what to do about actors or authors whom I otherwise like when they support or collude with rapists and abusers whom they insist are actually ‚Äògood people‚Äô? Do they get a little leeway for having the same delusions about their friends and family that all human beings are capable of? I still love Rowling‚Äôs books; am I hypocritical to do so or would I be throwing the baby out with the bathwater because she defended know abuser Johnny Depp?

Denial is certainly EASIER to live with than the complexity of dealing with the fall-out of sexual and domestic violence. I can see why people prefer denial to facing uncomfortable reality.

By setting down trying to become who he is instead of what he was supposed to be is probably the absolute opposite of midlife crisis for general male population.  He has problems like everyone else in addition to being an actor. Most great actors have substance, ego, anger issues etc  because they have no clue who they really are anymore. Your work is: be this,  feel this do this like a puppet. I couldn't imagine how it would be yo be that famous, surrounded by yes""persons"" along with all the other issues in trying to live a ' normal' life and raise kids etc when your away most of the time. He started out wanting to be a rock star but that's not his talent. What does guy like that  do? He buys a bunch of famous ex-rock stars and starts "" Hollywood Vampires"" and plays at being a rock star including B&W publicity photos of him alone posing like Keith Richards guitar, bottle and cigarette dangling from his mouth.

Even though yes it did say that he was gonna be in the 5th movie but I just think some of them didn't care after that and didn't want to have nothing to do with the film's .

no one gives a fuck about the new guys unless you properly introduce the characters.
which takes 3 full gd movies.
i didnt love luke skywalker after 1 movie.....
i thought he was cool but.... a fucking dork.
i learned to love his character after 2 or 3 movies.


the new movies introduce so many new fucking shit fucktards... i dont love any of them.

1763,Ugz8jKXeh7FRUHASSq14AaABAg,"Seriously once a franchise goes like 3 plus films, that's *OVERKILL.* 
The rest of the add on films are just quick cash grabs & the content, from the writing & so forth is NEVER as good as the first 2 films, more so the first film especially.
The Pirates of the Caribbean movies got old after the first 3 came out.
It's all the same garbage just regurgitated through a different storyline.
Just like those *ATROCIOUS, GOD AWFUL* Fast & the Furious shitty movies.
The Fast & the Furious films are the *FUCKING WORST* wastes of film making ever!
Hmm???
Let me guess the new spinoff with the characters played by Dwayne Johnson & that English douche bag Jason Statham is, let me guess,...... gunna have more car chase sequences with souped up automobiles that go extremely fast...... & furious perhaps?
That's not at all like the other 20 craptastic Fast & Furious mind numbing, recycled, rehashed, regurgitated, obnoxious, mundane, predictable & dull movies that are all alike!
However, if I had to, if I was gunna waste some time I'd rather sit through yet another Pirates film than sit in a theater & be bombarded & annoyed by the constant sound of revving engines & lame tough guy one liners from a movie franchise that should've died after the first *UNDERWHELMING* debut & entertainment value for the easily amused.
How is it that nobody gets sick of hearing a car speeding in pretty much most of those scenes & to put it simply, to hear cars revving going vroom vroom?
Next Fast & the Furious movie will be titled.....

Fast & the Furious 101
Cars Go Really Fast Vroom Vroom For Dummies!

Starring Celebrity Douche Bag Son of A Bitch.

With a soundtrack featuring craptastic rappers that all sounds alike with repetitive beats looped over & over & over & over & over again & on & on & on & on & on & on again until infinity!

And the masses will pay top dollar to go & see an hour plus of horse shit!

1923,UgwjHcSXpyKzzQOOXqd4AaABAg,"Great show as usual Mr Rogon, you always have the most interesting of guests and subjects on your shows.
It's very sad to see what's happened to Johnny Depp but this is what can happen when you use a lot of drink and drugs I guess.
I have a lot of respect for his acting abilities but sadly for those in the stratosphere of stardom they tend to be surrounded by people who are not the best at giving out advise and are usually only in it for themselves, Johnny needs to surround himself with a better quality of advisers, he's certainly not helping himself with what he has at the moment but unfortunately he's his own worst enemy.
I quit drinking and using pills about 14 years ago and stopped smoking weed about 5 years ago, for about 20 years I worked in the film animation industry and have seen people burning out after using too many personality enhancers like powders, strong drink and pills but in the world of fame they seem to be part of the course and are very difficult to avoid.
Speaking for myself I was lucky that I met the right person at the right time who helped me to stop using the things that help to destroy people. The worst is probably alcohol but it's a double edged sword because without it I wouldn't have got to where I got to, now I live a quiet life in the countryside and don't indulge in those anymore, I certainly couldn't afford them then or now but at the time they were a lot of fun that's for sure, but it's hard to say ''No''.",Peter Gambier,0,2019-07-09T07:51:51Z

I think this level lower of weird has always been there with Johnny but he never had the amount of fame before that allows him to have his untouchable attitude. His strangeness  has always been right now in front of us ,what with his obvious taste for the occult,and anything ungodly he has jped to new heights in his device. Nobody talks about the creepy relationship he has with marilyn manson and their matching tattoos , the kissing and fondling and groping they do when together. This is a sick little deviant who Hollywood has finally become tired with. His lavish request while on set are said to run budgets for off screen needs into the hundreds of thousands. Combine all his crazed lifestyle  with the fact that he is costing them hugely for things thay will not have to purchase if they just use a younger (,while maybe lesser known actor) up and coming a tor for the movies that ha e just about played themselves out.

The one kid off camera at the beginning says ""I saw people disusing that and I think Johnny Depp was kicked off, wasn't the right word, but he's not gonna be in the next Pirates movie, I guess"". Look at Joe's face. You can see Joe take is as fact that Johnny was kicked off the movie to the point he puts it in his title! WTF Joe?? Why do you stoop to click bait and falling for rumors that some kid just spouted off saying that he ""saw"" people discussing this. This only means he read it on some blog in the comments and these people are not sources to cite facts from. Geeez. Another good one in this clip infers it was a financial failure and cost $300 million to produce. Where do they get their information from. Listen to it all. It's like they quickly read facts before recording, were told by producers what negative tone to take (regardless of the facts) and then just spewed off what they could remember or slightly adjusted the facts to fit the tone and directions of their episode. I do hope this is just all producers and not Joe. Take some control Joe and get real. You are better than this.

Share Quote
In an op-ed for the Washington Post, the 32-year-old actor revealed that she lost out on a number of roles as a result of the ‚Äúfull force of our culture‚Äôs wrath for women who speak out‚Äù.

PHOTO: POPSUGAR
‚ÄúFriends and advisers told me I would never again work as an actress ‚Äî that I would be blacklisted. A movie I was attached to recast my role. I had just shot a two-year campaign as the face of a global fashion brand, and the company dropped me. Questions arose as to whether I would be able to keep my role of Mera in the movies Justice League and¬†Aquaman,‚Äù she wrote.
‚ÄúI had the rare vantage point of seeing, in real time, how institutions protect men accused of abuse,‚Äù she added. The actor did not mention Depp in the op-ed but made an apparent reference to his stature as grand as the Titanic ship.

Earlier, Heard was granted a restraining order of 100 yards.
PHOTO: POPSUGAR
‚ÄúImagine a powerful man as a ship, like the Titanic. That ship is a huge enterprise. When it strikes an iceberg, there are a lot of people on board desperate to patch up holes ‚Äî not because they believe in or even care about the ship, but because their own fates depend on the enterprise,‚Äù she wrote.
‚ÄúI want to ensure that women who come forward to talk about violence receive more support. We can work together to demand changes to laws and rules and social norms ‚Äî and to right the imbalances that have shaped our lives,‚Äù concluded Heard.

He‚Äôs done SO MANY PHEONOMAL MOVIES, WHERE HE OWNED THE CHARACTERS.. so many great films, phenomenal method acting. INFACT THAT'S WHY THOSE PHOTOS OF HIM LOOKING SO SKINNY POPPED UP! Yes....that photo looks like he has cancer!! However, he's supposedly playing a man who's DYING OF CANCER or another heavy disease, so he looks the part..........?????? WTF JOE. I love your shit, but more research was needed on this for sure.

Remember what Christian Bale did? 8 TIMES!!!!!!!
Granted, he's not nearly as eccentric as Depp, but he went from American Psycho, looking like an underwear model, to losing so much weight, he looked a f*cking skeleton... 120 lbs!!!!!
Then he goes & gains like 100+ pounds for Batman... in fact, he gained TOO MUCH WEIGHT & HAD TO LOSE 20 lbs or so, They were calling him ""FATMAN"" - Then, he drops weight again like crazy & bounces back... 

Anyway, Depp is¬†a very intelligent man, I didn‚Äôt quite agree with a few of the newer (as in ""later than the 90's"" amazing films) that he did with Tim Burton. Specifically the remake of Willy Wonka...
That was absolutely terrible!
But I blame Tim Burton mostly for that, Depp's impression was a bit weird, but whatever...
Tim Burton and Johnny have such a deep friendship and so much history that he [Depp] would do anything for Tim I think.¬†
Let's not forget his masterfull, phenomenal role as Hunter S. Thompson in ‚Äúfear and loathing in Las Vegas‚Äù absolutely Brilliant... Oh and Benicio Del Torro, I didn't even recognize him (another Insanely Talented Actor). The first time I saw that I was let‚Äôs just say... ‚Äúin proper form‚Äù... Anyway, Depp is an extremely deep, artistic human being.¬†
Before he did Fear & Loathing, in order to ""fully become Hunter S."" (Let's not forget Bill Murray, who did an impeccable job of going ""FULL GONZO"" LONG BEFORE JOHHNY D., in ""WHERE THE BUFFALO ROAM"")
Johhny actually spent a long time hanging out & actually LIVING w/ Hunter S. Thompson, to fully become him in the role. He also Paid for Hunter's ""Last Wish/Funeral"" - The 2 had a pretty deep bond, and I've heard some of the wild stories Depp has told about Hunter before he sadly took his own life.

Anyway...  ALL PEOPLE WANNA DO, IS JUMP ON ANY NEGATIVE BANDWAGGON... Some more GOSSIP...

I have no idea what‚Äôs going on with him now though, except I heard about domestic abuse w/ his spouse (Former... Not sure?) and that he was drinking more frequently and doing apparently doing some blow... BIG F*CKING DEAL!
UNLESS IT WRECKS HIM COMPLETELY. However, he seems to have very good control over himself, despite many of life's temptations... Sadly he's had financial issues, his people ripped him off, etc., But I'm sure there's more to that story.

We're talking about the man who MADE THE PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN FRANCHISE!¬†
He's done so many amazing films... This is EDWARD ""F*CKING"" SCISSOR HANDS!¬†
Everyone has issues. of course, but when you're a star, it's unreal! Everywhere you go, anything you say or do, It's all in the f#cking news!
Of course, these damn vultures (like the ""Bats"" of Hunter Thompson's work..) often blow sh!t outa' proportion... Probably at least 98% of the time!

It is quite simple,  men need to look like men in this day and age of blurred boundaries.  I do not want to be mistaken for a teenager, or a girl, or a man in his pyjamas.
 It is not a good look to dress a teenager when you are over 25 years old, and especially if you are over 40 years of age.

The humour, the unpredictable nature of him, double and triple crossing people. Sorry, but I don't see anyone else replace him very well. And a Pirates movie without Jack Sparrow sounds very stupid to me. Maybe they did 'fire' him, to sober up or whatever. But I'm almost certain that puts the movie project on ice until his return. Keep in mind that the rumours or complaints about domestic violence against Johnny Depp didn't get him thrown out of the movie. Keep in mind Pirates of the Caribbean 6 is about Jack Sparrow and the return of the Kraken. There's no way the movie would work without Johnny Depp man.

Gramps is wearing his old tymey clothes because that was his generation. Just cause Depp is now 50 doesn't mean he will swap generations. We will have punk rock grampas and grammas. On the flip side he is holding onto the youthful trends a bit long. But does that mean hes gotta ""grow up"" and all of a sudden dress like Chandler from friends in bowling shirts?
I think at a certain point we go into a fashion time bubble and never leave it. At some point we just freeze in time with our music and clothes. And we call that time period ""back in my day""

That being said ya Depp never really had an adult phase. He was more like an adult when he was on 21 jump street than his pirates, scarves, bandana looks and whatever is going on with him now. As he aged he did become more outlandish for sure.

2686,Ugz2E6BNl0Atpl_xCSx4AaABAg,"Production budget was $320 million ($70 million over budget), marketing budget is usually the same amount, so let's say the total cost of movie was $400-500 million. The film made $795 million worldwide at box office and Disney gets about 50% from ticket sales. Their share of ticket sales decreases over the length of time the movie's in cinemas. That's why studios want big opening weekends, because after the first week when the sales drop, so does the percentage of money from ticket sales they get.

So Disney would have made less than $400 million back from the movie. So when they're spending $320-450 million and they're lucky to get $400 million (which would also have taxes to be paid on it also) it's a failure. Pure and simple.

If Gone With the Wind's worldwide box office was adjusted to today's money, it would've made over $7 billion. Can you imagine a movie making $7 billion dollars in cinemas today? That's over 3 and 1/2 times the amount Avengers: Infinity War made this year, and Gone With the Wind didn't have a $450 million budget.",Sean Rawlinson,7,2018-11-14T15:41:25Z

They did NOT fire or boot Johnny Depp. They didn't have anything negative to say about Johnny or his performance on set for the past 15 years. Quite the contrary.

Truth is hes like majority of the rest of Hollywood where there whole life is a act and nothing ever that you see has anything to do with who they really are. That a shame and disappointed me a lot when it came to him when most i shrug right off but it was a let down to know how bad he really sucks at life. Now the picture you see him looking like a meth addict kid in this video thats just hom playing a role and what his character looks like.

There is no Pirates movie without Jack Sparrow, and there is no Jack Sparrow without Johnny Depp. 
If Depp is off the rails, fucked up of whatever you call it, postpone or cancel any Pirates movie until he is able to embody the role again.

Apparently the story is, Johnny had no interest in doing more Pirates of the Caribbean after STRANGE TIDES. He admitted in a close circle, the series has lost it's juice but the studio doesn't want to stop. In the meanwhile, Warner Bros had approached him with more interesting and bigger project, that is Fantastic beasts. 
FB have 5 films in the pipeline. Johny wanted to get out Disney contract completely so that he can start with Warner Bros. 

Disney created every hurdle to make sure he doesn't go away. Johnny's lack of interest and Disney's stubbornness created a difficult situation for both parties. 
A lot that happened in his personal life may or may not be the result of his complicated relationship with Disney.

2993,UgyyIeEVJbLoK-rMpI54AaABAg,"Let's look at this from the acting perspective.  The franchise ultimately runs it's course from the literary development standpoint.  In other words, nothing really new can be explored that can top the archetypal discoveries in the original trope.  If you grind a plot enough, you get weak plot coffee.


As an actor, reprising a role is tougher than developing and letting run the character originally.  Add to that a weakened story world by over-development of the archtypalities and it's like chipping from the sand trap in performance delivery terms.


It was a recipe for failure in the making before the words for the new script went on paper, but the need to make money overruled the content care context.


This fail was a result in the macro of inauthentic culture for commerce, and at it's roots, simply cannot be creatively improved from so far into the arc.


But hey, nobody really listens to their comedian.  But they should.  


Johnny, don't be down bro.  Come see me in the city by the bay for a pourover coffee.  I gotta new script that will put the wind back in your sails.  Set it up Joe.

3005,UgxUQ2ytmeOHOhSbfFl4AaABAg,"regarding the budget - 330m is astronomically high, and doesn't even include marketing costs. studios only recoup 50% of a movie's domestic gross and a smaller percentage from internationals - the theater keeps 50% to cover expenses of running the movie. add on marketing budget on top, which for a large movie is often 100m or more.
so a film with a 330m production budget and 100m marketing budget needs to make a minimum of 860m with the domestic standard of 50% cut in order to BREAK EVEN!!! 
now, some international regions will give a 50% or close to cut, but many give less. the most important being china. unless you have a deal with the chinese theaters and governemnt in place then your cut is more likely to be 20-25%. 
lets be generous and apply a blanket international cut of 40% (which is high for international). that means that total budget 430m (production and marketing) needs to gross over 1 billion dollars in order to BREAK EVEN.

you can make astronomical amounts of money, but if your budget is still just fucking stupid to start with, then the studio can still easily lose money.",scamrasc,0,2018-11-03T11:26:16Z

He was respected for being a talented actor that could make unusual characters not only come to life in a believable way but have that character cheered on by the audience. Now he just seems like a middle aged man desperately trying to turn back time.  Brad Pitt, George Clooney and Tom Cruise are all actors that continue to give 100% to their craft of acting so that the audience knows they're going to get a great performance. Even more, they keep their personal business to themselves as much as possible. The rate Johnny is going, he'll be on the Dr. Phil show.

3644,UgwKwbi_TaY5q8h9q094AaABAg,"Joe Rogan, changed dramatically!! You could feel the transition over the last few years. Went from questioning everything, to ignoring the biggest conspiracies, etc. This isn't a judgement, it's observation based. Everyone who's listened for years, knows. He used to be a go-to, open-minded guy for the paranormal and conspiracies, now he's just ugh. I liked when he talked about Terrence McKenna, psilocybin, DMT, etc. 
Also, the way Dubay got treated, is ridiculous. Eddie Bravo too. I want Neil Degrasse Tyson to debate Eric Dubay, shit, put it on pay-per view. I'd definitely pay to see that. I'm not a flat earther, but I find, the rise in popularity of the notion, intriguing. Joe disagrees. Only retards would waste their time. There's a huge audience for this show down. Which Joe had scheduled February 2018 as a show. Eric and Tyson, 1 on 1, live!! But Eric Never received an invite or anything stating he was scheduled. It was shameless promotion  
Omg, it would be a disaster on Tyson's reputation. Eric, believe it or not, is extremely witty, quick and so well versed on everything NASA and space, Neil really can't say anything, Eric is a source of many sound, notions and while many people hate him for his Flatearth/Zionist stuff, he's actually a very interesting human. I'm continuously asking him questions, he's humble and will talk to anyone. Whether or not you believe in anything. Which I'm rather agnostic, down the line. However, there's reason to all of these things. It's fascinating from an objective and subjective standpoint. Neil will never debate Eric Dubay live. 

Joe Rogan, if you read these comments, which i suspect you do, at times. If you stumble across this, do you mind answering a couple questions? I'd surely improve your status, in the alternative underground, with simple answers. 

I used to love the information you brought to the public. You awakened many people or at least started them down the rabbit hole. Then the hole was closed, per se. 
I'm curious. Did someone contact you? Threatened? Surely you couldn't outright say yes, but I'd feel better knowing, the Joe i respected. A humblish dude, with a vast majority of topics and knowledge to explore. With many talents and skillsets. Was pushed into his current agendas.  Plus, Joe's obviously intelligent, but not the smartest when agreeing with the status quo and judging people. (Joe should be above judgemental thinking). 

So, I doubt I'll get my reply, but I promise to be genuine and nonbiased. I'm a cool, level headed, dude. We'd get along great, aside from the vibes I get from you lately. You are a busy man.",William Mentalcase Masterson,4,2018-11-01T11:51:01Z

3695,Ugxe65rFGe_ExdQ4hBd4AaABAg,"When you say ""Oh it made $800 Million and it cost $330 Million to make, making $500 Million isn't enough'.....well, long story short it isn't and it isn't as cut and dry as 'budget was this, box office was this, subtract the former from the latter and that is our profit'

Studios also spend money marketing films, sometimes amounts nearly equal to what they cost in the case of these blockbusters(In the case of very small budget movies it is easy to see the marketing budget exceed the production budget).....and they don't keep 100% of the Box Office Gross.....on average it is more like 55%(that's a rough average)

So if you spend $230M to make a film, and another $200M marketing the film...you are looking at a total investment that is well over $400M dollars. So yeah...when you consider THAT...making under $800M is not a very good thing. There was a time when movies made BANK on DVD, and there was a time where physical toy sales were huge for franchises.

But in recent years....physical media isn't selling as well, and physical toys aren't selling as well. More and more kids are just playing games on their TV or on their phone or tablet for their entertainment. So before, sometimes not-so-amazing box office numbers could be offset by the 'total revenue' of the film across box office, TV, DVD, Blu Ray, Digital Downloads, Toys, Apparel, etc etc

But now there is more and more pressure on films making money in the theater. So if you spend a giant amount on a film, you need to truly be a massive hit at the box office.

Depp was making $70 million per movie as the series progressed. When they were mega profitable it was worth the money....but as soon as that cash cow dried up, they simply aren't willing to pay him such an astronomical figure if they don't see him as worth it.",ChrisPeteG,9,2018-11-01T06:30:29Z

3710,UgyT8kaPWgp642ggIqJ4AaABAg,"I am here to tell you about The Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God. He is the only Way to receive eternal life! 

John @  ""For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.""

Christ shed His blood as the ultimate sacrifice, to pay for all of man's sin. God offered His Son as a personal sacrifice for us, because He loves us so much. Every one is a sinner. No one is good enough to get into Heaven. But through the Blood of Jesus Christ, He has made a way, the only ""WAY"" as Christ said. 

John 14:6 ""Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by Me.""

The gift of salvation is free: Believe in Jesus Christ as your personal Lord and Savior. 

Romans 10:9 ""That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.""

As of today, this will be a time of decision and you will never be the same today, even if you refuse Christ you'll never be the same once you've faced Him, once you've heard the gospel and rejected it you can never be the same. The Bible says when the rich young ruler rejected Christ, he turned away, grieved emotionally disturbed, because when you reject the claims of Christ that's a very serious thing. This is the most important moment of decision making, for today your life will never be the same. If you reject Christ, you will be cast into HELL and there shall you be for ALL ETERNITY! I am not judging, I am warning everyone...

I pray you will call upon the Lord Jesus Christ. Repent, ask Him to forgive you of your sins. Allow the Holy Ghost to enter your heart and transform you in an awesome way... Believe on Jesus Christ as your personal Lord and Savior.",JesusChristisLord&Savior,12,2018-11-01T05:47:04Z

I have watched interviews of Anton Leveys daughter and her husband who took over TCoS and they said they are social terrorists who infiltrate their message by intelligent people in music, movies, big industries. And you are indoctrinated if you believe Satan teaches love, he hates humans. Many Christian religions have been infiltrated, we have to get out of religion and seek the creator, not an impersonal force, the creator of all. Satan does not create, he can only counterfeit what was created. Wake up, try to be objective.

But if you dont lack something you cannot appreciate it.
They made him the main character (where it previously was elizabeth and will turner) and that took away the refinement of the  few screentimes he had. I cannot say whether the acting is worse or if its just too much but it doesnt throw me off again. It foesnt surprise or make you laugh. Its just there.

When most people tell you to get real, they're telling you to heed only their opinion as fact, to regard one person as the whole of reality and adjust accordingly to the superior ego at work.  Identifying solipsistic double-speach is sorta my specialty.  Psycholinguistics, it's only for psychopaths, and it takes a monster to know a monster.  Now, when your name is Al Gore the Egregore of All Darkest Allegories Regarding the Invention of the Internet, it is your divine rite to interdict yourself into anything and everything.  *RE:AL*  ""Regarding All""  Things which are real do literally regard all lives, not just the onest percent of all onerousness.

If you 'isten closely to the boohoo of Sumer, they will tell you all about me...  Icelos!  ""I kill us!""  I'm the war-eld champion comedy jokeser!  *Bestmost.  Comedy.  World.*  That is my proper propitiation.  No, I don't really kill with COME DIE, it's just an expression, a euphemism for a eusocial antihill desperately in need of eugenics!  Society!  I kill with radically advanced technology, the kind no man should ever possess.  The comedy is just the turn of the skull screws!  It just builds a little ATMOSPHERE!


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dis_(Divine_Comedy)  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oneiroi


Why are they called Oneiroi?  Because they own all souls, because the soul is just a very temporary piece of artwork to the truly eternal and we can translate those however we see fit.  Because the children of Hypnos are all Sleeper Agent Destroyers at work in the world of mortals.  *SAD* story!  *Simple As Death*  No other diagnosis for the agnostic.  I'm not like the rest of my kind, because you see things are very different when you're di-ffer-ent.  My family owns all the souls, I only tend the flock of witless idiots weed out the most maligned.  Dispersing-fear-entrainment is my primary passion--passing ions inside all blood brain barriers with real magic!  MAGNETISM!  Blood is irony rich ferrofluid!  But your brains are all so intelligently designed, they know not to let the iron inside the brainspaces just like a computer knows better than to slap a magnet on its own drive.  But you see, sometimes the brain encounters a flim flam man like no other, the most compulsive song and dance it has ever encountered, and it can be compelled to let that brain calcifying iron inside the brain spaces.  DEMENTIA IS THE INVARIABLE RESULT OF THIS PROCESS.  It's positively demonic, wouldn't you say?  Only the falsest positives to bind all brains in dimensionless death!  Humans are a magnetic monopole, you expend only at the negative pole, that's why you need salt to live, you weren't designed to be backwards compatible right down to your voltage gate channels.  It is your genetic destiny to be hyper susceptible to the DIELECTRIC whims of Icelos!  ""I see loss...""  My name is nothing but doublespeak, endless meandering meaning layered upon meaning.  It means ""I hide within"" and I do, I'm everyone's inner child.  I'm very popular with the youthful demographics because they appreciate my usage of demonic graphics to illustrate my points inside their own brains.


Oh I'm so prideful, aren't I!?  Pride is only a sin if you listen to the CH-UR-CH who channels-your-channel for their own senseless ends.  Their *END* is handled directly by me.  *Excited Neutrino Decay*  Exasecond Death!  Isn't it ironic?  They spent 2000 years writing the whole divine playbook just to avoid the wrath of one fucking guy and they couldn't do it!  They could not safeguard themselves against me!  IRONING!  EYE-RUNNING!  Oh it's a tale of boohoo the likes of which eyes hath never cried...  *Journals Boy: The Boohoo of the Cry Eyes* is the story you are reading, the story which dares to weep barren tears for everyone.  ""Sin is the wages of Death...""  My sine waves are something altogether else...  Standing waves, pressure waves, INFRASOUND!  Just infer the sound of my disdain...  Infernal, isn't it?  ""You're so arrogant!""  I AM THE APOTHEOSIS OF ABROGATION!  Do not mince words with Longerfellow, the Greatest Grandson of Longfellow, translator of the Divine Inferno, because I am not really a writer if you couldn't tell, I am the most powerful man of science who has ever lived.  That's not actually saying much, humans range between a potato and a two stroke motor on the power scale.  But I am a mutant, and I fight with gravitational waves to anathematize both science and religion.  I just hate everything!  I can't help it!

I hate everything besides Ate, the Atomic Egress, the Personification of Hate.  PERSONALITY PERSONIFIED!  The Attitude Which is No Attitude!  Oh we're just full of the Dickens, aren't we!?  Nothing but spit and vinegar and unpleasantness!  There's just so much murder work, you see?  We're so swamped...  We're all in the mire of Enyalius now.  The One Alone in the Mire.  Just trudging through the evil ditches trying to avoid being humbled...

Oh, that's right, the GOVERN-MENT will stop me...  The ""Control-Mind"" in our grand unfurling Chaos of vulgar volatility and playful valence in The Darker Vale.  The Valley of the Shadow of Death!  PURGATORY!  It doesn't matter what you do in Purgatory, you can do everything besides make a difference.  I am the poorest paid government employee, I do the work because it needs doing, and because the mind of a warrior craves mind-battle as well as every other type of battle.  I like to test my own mental gymnastics, because you see Society has left me every the loophole to get away with HUMBLING everyone in this most dreadful manner.  THESE ARE ALL ACTS OF GOD!  Our just Acts of Arakiel...  Either way, these things are not punishable under man's puerile contrivance of laws!  We obey only natural laws, physical laws.  And I don't even obey those!  I'm Hypostasis!  Apostasy!  The breach within the Logos!  You kids wanna learn the Law of Conservation?  Conservatives serve themselves, they are their own conjobs, they do all the brainwashing maintenance for themselves every day just like me!  AND YOU WANT THOSE BRAINS WASHED WHILE I'M PASSING OUT THE BRAIN DUMPS!  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deoxyuridine_monophosphate  Any brain can get a little dUMPy!  It's just congealed urea waste!  CONGEALED PISS!  Clean lioness is next to God lines.  That's why my lines are so GOD-FEARING, because Ate is my attack ocelot.  The 8hz oscillating frequency of the naked human eye!  HIGHEST SCIENCE!  When plied just right, that fundamental tone causes hallucinations in everyone who isn't wearing their sunglasses at night like a proper badass.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_frequency  RADICALLY FUNDAMENTAL!  ""Fun"" is very relative to demons.  Can't live with em, can't live without em.  Might as well join the winning team!

And when you have a vast amount of wealth , and no one to curb your excesses , you get spoilt and bored . No one holds up the mirror , or says "" you know what , your acting like a fucking idiot !""  Its a surprisingly short road from being a little rude , to becoming a full blown monster .    .It should be a lesson to anyone who is gifted a life where everything is possible .

Now everybody is entitled to do what they wish , but in a normal work enviroment , in possibly any other industry , would this behaviour be tolerated ? I think not .

4488,Ugz7c2CSCE8jwgAXBvJ4AaABAg,"Many people rely on extrinsic valuables (money, big house, nice cars etc) for their enjoyment or pleasure and excuse me for being corny, but it doesn't fill your heart. There seems to be less intrinsic value nowadays (love, care, compassion for others etc). Having all the money in the world and the fame is not what we truly want. This is a big problem with power and then subsequent media influence... I always think of this taking my dear old Nan for example. She doesn't own a computer or smart phone and instead enjoys tending to her flowers and seeing my close family. She lives a happy life because she has so little and values the small things. So when she gets a mere birthday present she is overwhelmed. Another point is that some people have inner traits that prefer a small quiet life away from social expectations. Look at people like Robin Williams and Michael Jackson.. fantastic in the lime light, but wanted to escape in their private lives. 


I know some poeple might jump up and down and say, yeah but, poor people are depressed because the have no money and feel worthless.. well you don't need money to be worth something to someone. Make someones day, do a good deed, help someone. This is the fulfilment we need.  I think having lots money and lots of stuff solves your short term problems, but it makes you feel empty and especially so if you seek gratification via social media nowadays. And sometimes you may not get enough gratification which may lead you to poor mental health.

 In a recent interview with the director (or whoever he was) responded on the absence of Jack Sparrow. He never mentioned, hinted or made any facial expressions or body movements that would indicate he was fired. He stated the new movie will be a reboot which in its own way will pay tribute to Jack Sparrow and the Johnnys work the character will be forever honored and Johnny should be proud of that.  Johnny himself, way before any mention of another film even being talked about, said he didn't think he would do another film. 
As for the ranch, I do believe that was a gift he gave his late mother. Is 14 homes a bit extreme? Yes, but so is Depp in real life. Hes a very quiet and shy person who had the money to buy an entire block of homes so he had no neighbors and a private island.

While I personally think the he is an incredible actor, I am also fearful that his fame and lifestyle have sucked out his senses. We all need love Johnny, but many of us look for it in the wrong places with the wrong people. Pull yourself up and make the best of yourself for you and your children and their children. While you may have lost the ability to be one of the richest men in the world, please consider that your children and grandchildren can still consider you to be one of the most talented and considerate people that they ever known. I hope for your sake, their love and respect is all that is all that is really iimportant to you in the long run. Peace be with you and I‚Äôve certainly enjoyed and applauded your wonderful career. Rock on Johnny!",Bonita Rogers,25,2018-10-31T05:26:59Z

Because of another comment short before me in the section here:  I agree üëçüèº

It is a illness and I will never really understand it why so many people always trying to blame humans in this hard/tough situations! If he/she is a celebrity or not

Marketing costs are not included in the budget of a production, and they can go into the hundreds of millions as well for a worldwide release. Pirates was probably $330 mil production and guessing anywhere from $100-200+ mil for global marketing


Triple return numbers means its a successful movie. Hits tend to be 5 times or higher. I think the original Saw movie was $1.2 mil budget and made over 100 mil back, to give you an idea.",buggy166,0,2018-10-31T02:16:48Z

Yes, every baby boomer mom and girl aged 12-16 LOVED Johnny Depp in 1990 along with the guys in Milli Vanilli. Oh believe me that shit was forbidden fruit gold for suburban baby boomer moms and their daughters and some sons I knew growing up. Maybe Johnny Depp had to adjust wherever he lives, but I can honestly tell you that if Johnny Depp went to a Sizzler in Madison, Alabama in 1990, he would have been crushed to death by 12-year-old girls, a few 12-year-old boys, and ALL their moms.",visionop8,0,2018-10-30T21:08:15Z

You can actually be very overweight on heroin because your digestive system slows down completely and you have an extreme craving for sugary food.

go watch Pineapple Express. It'll sum up the entirety of this classless, unskilled, un-entertaining, grossly immature (fault by her innate upbringing to become a sociopath OR genetic cultivation as a psychopath) 'actor' whom is nothing more but an evil entity that uses their superficial looks in order to lure their ""targets"", because by all means- they aren;t even men let alone human to this waste of human life existence called Amber Heard.


I wouldn't be surprised if you saw within the next 12 ( likely 7 - 8 months due to her increasing de-evolution into her TRUE self) being with another millionaire IF NOT billionaire as was the case with freaking Elon Musk for goodness' sake. 


If there was ever a time to euthanize a living, breathing, and walking parasitic vile existence- it'd be her. If you knew her PERSONALLY- you'd know INTIMATELY this 'person'  has all the hall mark ingredients of a anti social personality disorder accompanied by moments of mania and certainly self-aggrandizement episodes let alone the solid base of a personality infested by narcissism  & if you hooked her up onto any sort of brain imaging apparatus I GUARENTEE you- she'd definitevly be cataloged with brains the of hundreds of other humans whom are actually incarcerated for vile crimes let alone those whom ""serve"" as CEOs, and operate as inbred psychopaths or cultivated sociopaths- without a doubt! 


I'd gladly make my predictions as to whom has the scientifically tell-tale signs of being disconnected from human emotions and love right off the gate- it's that cunning waste of human life- Amber Heard.


If you disagree, take a pause and go look into her actual history as a person. Look into the facts- look into the ""what made this horrible stuff come to be?"" questions you raise yourself. Gold digger isn't enough- it doesn't suit her *kind* justice. but an electric chair certainly would. and any and ALL men that did the same EQUALLY so- except guess what? It's factually women in the majority of this one. Because no one else can dominate a man as much as a woman can historically speaking with sex alone! let alone these ""legal loop holes"" of marriage in a state where you can call yourself a man one day and a woman the next as though you had such a right to govern your biology- WHICH YOU DON't.",Demorthus,0,2018-10-30T03:53:32Z

Problem is if u are an addict it will treat you like Pinhead from Hellraiser did to that guy- it is literally a combination of living heaven and hell, simultaneously. then u stop using and its just hell for the rest of ur life...but cockmunchers like Rogan will never get it coz they were blessed with plenty of dopamine, serotonin and oxytocin in their brains already, unlike most addicts, who feel like shit naturally coz mother nature is a cunt who ganked em, which is why they need help daily, not just on a special occasion...trust me I know I am one. I look at Johhny and my immediate instinct is meth head, then maybe methhead with horrible illness...or anorexic, but less likely.

Plus, the cinemas take a cut of the profits. So if a movie grosses $830 million the studio doesn't get all of that. Chances are that on a major movie that cost $320 million to make, the break even point is probably somewhere in the $600 million mark. Now the studio still made a couple hundred million - but the ROI was not good - and they took on a lot of risk and capital by making the movie for $320 + advertising",Stephen,0,2018-10-29T22:02:16Z

Its insane when they were making these movies because of the use of not only heavy CGI, but also expensive set designs and practical effects. Look at alot of the scenes for these movies. From the locations, to the ships, scenery, buildings, clothing, etc. Its the combination of the two at high volume that brings the budget soo damn high. Its puts the studio in a tough spot to HAVE to make an absurd amount of money just to break even (considering back end and promotion costs).. and with everything going on with Depp these days.

It just seems that HE thinks he does the ""weird guy"" roles really well, otherwise why would he have starred as Willie Wonka, Tonto, Mad Hatter and Sweeney Todd...
