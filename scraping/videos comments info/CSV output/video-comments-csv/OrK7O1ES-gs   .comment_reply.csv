Why cant she simply be ejected from here?. I guess there are some more important people she already contaminated, who don't wish that to be known.

Movie would have been better with a smaller scale like Eddie Redmane and Dan Fogler running around the U.S investigating magical animals while Katherine Waterston tries to hold them somewhat in line and Alison Sudol just being cool.
As for the English movie remake, it will do well enough to earn Mads Mikkelsen and Thomas Winterberg a fortune and a lifelong paycheck from the rights, and Another round has a unique chance of succeding if Dicaprio involves his old ""Pu**y Posse"" as i suspect he might want to.
I for one would love for Leonardo Dicaprio, Tobey Macguire, David Blaine, Kevin Connely and Lukas Haas in a movie that is a love letter to alcohol, where they all play burned out highschool teachers flirting with alcoholism.
I enjoyed the Witcher, but Lars Mikkelsens best american work in my eyes, is his voice acting on Star Wars Rebels, he is amazing as Thrawn. As for Mads his Hannibal is amazing.",2021-07-29T20:27:57Z,1

If she'd had the best interests of her (then future) child at heart, she'd have waited the extra year to ensure she wasn't brought into the middle of so much stress and controversy.

135,UgxGZyReiJHKnUfoJQh4AaABAg,Darklyn Stormember,"@Nightcore Newbie I blame WB. The tapes of AH admitting to (and attempting to excuse and dismiss) her physical violence against JD, had already been released when WB made that judgement call. 

Whatever they may or may not have believed about JD, did not negate AH's own crimes. And, as people have been saying from the start... If you're going to fire JD for just being accused of abusing AH, then you definitely need to fire AH for being on tape admitting to actually abusing JD. ""What's good for the goose is good for the gander"" or in this case ""What's good for the gander, is good for or the goose"". 

And that's precisely how JD's support basically tripled, literally.  At the time the judgement can't down and JD posted his letter about being asked to resign, that petition to remove AH was still hovering just under 500k. It skyrocketed 1.4 mil within a couple of days and kept coming thereafter. But that initial bump, and the corresponding increase to his IG follower numbers, made it abundantly clear that the was nothing ambiguous about WB's actions being, at best misguided or (more likely imo)  completely discriminatory.

Even the people who were like, ""It's not our business"", or ""Their problem lives shouldn't impact their persons all lives"", or ""We just don't care"", etc; could see the injutice of that double standard.
