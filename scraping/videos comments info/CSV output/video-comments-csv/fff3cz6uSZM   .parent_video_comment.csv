Now not only will I not be seeing his movie ""aquaman "" but will no longer see any movie he is featured in again. He lost my respect and admiration. He also showed his true colors with these statements. He always gave off the appearance that he was a respectable person with good old fashioned morals and a sincere heart, but now all in getting is arrogance and narcissism. I was hoping he would stand on the side of right and understand the impact and the weight that the fans would have on his numbers at the box office  but he is downplaying the role the Dan's have in its success or failure. He is acting like just because he is in it, it we I'll bring in the money. Well I hope it doesn't and I hope he is humbled buy its black of turn out.

How can you endorse and encourage the riots made by blm and antifa last summer, but be against what happened at the capitol? And then cry about how not more people got killed in the capitol ""because they would have been if they were black!"". Jeezus, people. I don't follow Momoa, but I honestly thought that he was better than this. How can you be so passionate about pushing away Trump-supporters for ""supporting a monster"", but he doesn't say a word about what his dear co-star has done? Hypocrite much?
And as far as censorship not happening to you unless you're an asshole; who is going to decide who is the asshole? Who is going to decide who's got the ""right"" opinion? Sure, it's all fine and dandy right now, but this will come back and bite everyone that's cheering right now right in the ass. If you've ever dreamt about living in China or North Korea, you're in for a real treat, because that's where we're headed with this censorship.
I'm not a Trump-supporter (although I have had a lot of people calling me that lately for daring to have an opinion on things), neither am I a liberal anymore. I admit that a couple of years ago, I would have been on Momoa's team here, the reason I'm not is because I instead of censoring people decided to listen to them and learn why they are thinking the way that they do. What did I learn? That we actually have a lot of things in common and that much of their reasoning for supporting Trump were very much the same as my reasoning for supporting the other side. You will never change anyone's opinions by silencing them, talking over them, calling them names or insulting them. If anything, it will only make them dig their heels in more deeply. 
I have said it before and I'll say it again; the left has gone off the rails (which is why I decided to walk away from them altogether) and what is happening now isn't helping anyone. I'm not the least bit surprised that they're cheering about Trump and many others being booted off the internet, but it saddens me that they are so happy to eliminate freedom of speech just to make sure that their voices are the only ones being heard. That is not democracy. That is restriction and it is doomed to bring us back into a dark age where nobody is allowed to speak their minds without risking being put in a gulag or getting executed. These people are playing an incredibly dangerous game right now and it will without a doubt come back and bite them at some point. Look at China or North Korea. That's where we're headed if this continues.
As for Trump, I still don't like the man and I wouldn't have voted for him if I was American. However I do admit that I misjudged him 4 years ago. And I definitely misjudged those that voted for him and for that I'm sorry.",Niko,0,2021-01-23T12:08:17Z

444,UgxpDFWcPLONDnm2X7N4AaABAg,"I find it odd how Johnny can dress up as Trump and act as him in a comedy sketch making fun of him, then saying that doing so made him realize Trump was just a big, spoiled brat, and that he wondered why no one had assassinated him, but when Jason Momoa tells Trump fans, the majority of whom openly support a murderous coup attempt that came within inches of killing half of congress, to unfollow him on instagram... that's suddenly so horrible of him?? Bad for business, sure, but I can't fathom how you people (I'm talking about these commenters only btw, thanks for another great video, Tug) find such moral fault with telling people who cheered on a mob of Neo-Nazis intending to hold mass executions and make Trump a fascist dictator, that their money is worthless. 

Is this what we've come to? Pandering to anyone and everyone, even the people who believe wholeheartedly that democrats torture kids to death for an elixir of immortality, for the sake of MONEY??? You advocate for Heard's career to be ruined because of her constant lies and domestic abuse, then DARE to turn around and find it OFFENSIVE to denounce the rabid supporters of a man whose lies caused 400,000 people their LIVES, and who BRAGS about sexually assaulting women?! If you think for one minute that Johnny, who has LONG SINCE made his opinion of Trump and his supporters clear, wouldn't BALK to see the people who claim to be on his side defending catering to a homicidal cult just for the sake of getting their money, you don't know anything about him. He spent his career telling hollywood to fuck off as they kept trying to get him to sell out, to stop ""wasting his talent"" on the smaller movies, the experimental, fringe ones that MEANT something, but were written off before production even started because they were about LGBT+, or the plight of Native Americans in a bloodthirsty, capitalist society, or were simply passion projects refusing to be watered down for mass-consumption. SHAME on you all.

Jason Momoa teased and pranked Turd on set because he couldn't stand what a stuck-up bitch she was, and got himself labelled a bully by her during cast interviews for his trouble. And you can be sure he noticed how she made a point of actually hitting the stunt men during fight scenes, but he kept quiet about it because there was money to lose. Funny how you hate him for not speaking out about her, and ALSO hate him for speaking out about the racist traitors who were so eager to tear a Black cop apart that they forgot they were there to kill congressmen. I thought for sure you people would be delighted he dared to take a stand against sedition, while also making Aquaman 2 less likely to succeed in the process.

I don't wish any ill on him, or WB, or DC, or whatever - I'm moving on from them. Which isn't to say I'll never see anything he's in, just that I'm not going to make an effort for it on a regular basis. If the theatres nearby are still in business when the movies come out... I'm not going to go hire a babysitter so I can go see a movie. If the theatres are closed down, I'm not going to get HBO Max to see Dune or Aquaman 2. I might put Dune and Aquaman on Christmas lists as something for my family to get me a Xmas, but that's only if I happen to remember about them in December. If someone I know buys them on BluRay, I might borrow them, or if I'm staying with someone in the future who has access to it, I might watch. Or I might not, depends what the other options are.

So I'm not boycotting, or protesting. I'm just moving on.

Ironically, I think Endgame may have made it even easier to move away from Blockbuster movies in general, not just the MCU. I can leave blockbusters on a high note, and I am. I'm satiated. I'm full. I'm satisfied. I'm going to let the next generation have their own Blockbuster movies, and I'll probably be pretty quiet about them.

I do get that they‚Äôre trying to create a stigma where anyone supporting Depp is now seen as being a trump supporter. Pretty sad. Sad that this is what we have come to. Reminds me of the communist hysteria back in the 30‚Äôs. They even had Lucille Ball blacklisted as a communist at one point and they used the threat of accusing you of supporting communism as a means of keeping you in line. Now we‚Äôve replaced communism with trump. Just the accusations will destroy you. 
But unlike trump, there are very real people with very real platforms on very real social media networks that have covered this entire shitfest and have slowly found Depp to be the victim and assbutt to be the villain as they continued to follow and cover the situation. These are real people. People who originally tip toed and went out of their way to show support to amber until they couldn‚Äôt deny it anymore- she was a liar. 
There‚Äôs been prof of her lies. 
There‚Äôs been legit reason that people changed their minds or supported Depp. 
There is real evidence. Real proof. Real supporters and character references supporting Depp. 
And real channels, people and voices supporting Depp. 
You can‚Äôt claim bots and throw trumps name around just to scare and threaten all of us into obedience. 
I‚Äôll be damned if I‚Äôm going to be associated with that man simply because I choose to believe evidence and facts.

plz correct me if im wrong, but there is no direct connection to heard/depp whatsoever.

its not like momoa picked sides with ah and went against depp or something like that. he just made a statement about
us politics. although a very harsh one that might offend alot of people its still his right to do so.

i think you have to be careful when you report about stuff like that, and draw the lines perfectly clear, not blurr them.
not every depp supporter is a trump supporter. it might fit a black and white narrative, to put ah and momoa into the same corner,
but its not that easy.
i mean hey, why not call it the blue corner. and throw them all in: ah, momoa, hillary, biden, harris, katleen kennedy, the communists, antifa, feminists, sjws, china, russian hackers, etc...

I have previously said that the AH misery would reflect bad on him as well becasue when Aquaman 2 flunks at the box office it reflects bad on the leading actor as well. But if he had just remained silent he could have always claimed it was out of his hands, by actively taking a stand he chose his camp and he'll eventually drown with the sinking of the ship. (Pun intended, I know he can breaths under water). I'll always like Jason Momoa for playing Ronon Dex in Stargate: Atlantis, but this takes him down from that pedestal and just punts him in: _""Once great actors that are now shifty characters in RL""_ .",Johan Buelens,213,2021-01-22T18:34:10Z
