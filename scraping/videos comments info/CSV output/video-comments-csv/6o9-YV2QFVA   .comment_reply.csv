16,Ugyx1RfneCunp9Y0Hi14AaABAg,Amanda Negret√®,"Entertainment & Star Wars thanks so much for your response.
Absolutely you have helped me. Usually I avoid content of abuse/DV, but I overheard mainstream media regarding JD. Clearly an injustice was occurring. 
Your channel is the best I‚Äôve seen (out of many) in respectfully detailing facts of his travesty. I also appreciate you‚Äôre very relatable. 
It is obvious why people sub to your channel. 
I am thankful to finally recognize suppressing trauma is not effective. Now I can work on a solution(s). 
I have tremendous empathy and respect for JD. I can‚Äôt imagine how difficult, but he‚Äôs doing the right thing  in exposing an abuser. 
TY for sharing you‚Äôre a survivor too. I‚Äôve seen many comments and it‚Äôs far too prevalent. 
IMO many survivors need support and help AFTER the abuse/trauma as well. 
I feel good I have identified a problem, now I can work toward a solution(s). 
Again, great channel, you have a gift, am glad to have found you. 
I‚Äôm not the only person you have helped. 
Justice for Johnny Depp indeed! 
I look forward to hearing you detail Johnny‚Äôs recovery. I hope he has wonderful support and professional help. 
JD is the type that may continue to advocate for survivors. He‚Äôs shining a light on a crime not often discussed, men being victims of abuse/DV. 
Thanks for sharing his story and spreading the message.",2020-09-05T18:26:34Z,1

I am very sorry you went through a bad time, but you did the right thing. You are stronger than you give yourself credit for and I am happy and proud of you. I myself had a similar experience so I understand. Be safe, be well. Justice for Johnny. He deserves it and thank you üôè so much for your support.

You don‚Äôt chase your abuser if you are being abused. You would avoid the situation and that is the case here. He is trying to avoid it.

84,UgwKyO-odLboEJjd48h4AaABAg,Families Supporting Trauma Recovery,He violently slams the door in her face and injures her and makes it all about her reaction. She apologizes a million times. This is coercive control. He spars with word salad in that audio. He is way beyond her with the lies. That is how he controls. He does not avoid physical fights. He rages and storms off to go get drunk all the time and refuses to say why. He‚Äôs a drunk drug addict. When his lips are moving he‚Äôs lying. It is impossible to have functional relational intimacy with an alcoholic. Spouses do a lot of crazy things. His behavior is crazy making. She is 25 years younger. We saw the kitchen. He‚Äôs out to get her. Fair game. He talks smack.,2020-08-31T06:14:55Z,1

118,Ugzueb7zmAT8_3fzLxt4AaABAg,Julie Lea,"@Mimi B The audio starts with him saying "" I wish you knew how sick you make me....OF MYSELF"".
 JD has unresolved CPTSD from childhood where he endured painful abuse...and things being thrown at him. That's why she was drawn to him, why he protected her,  & why he didn't leave. 
 He's extremely intelligent, but these neural pathways formed in childhood are very hard to overcome with intense help specifically for Complex-PTSD. 
 Sherilyn Fenn (former fiancee) said "" he's not capable of hurting ANYONE, well, maybe himself, as we all do from time to time"" ....we DON'T all hurt ourselves from time to time, I think she slipped & covered.
 Self-harm would be a normal response in this situation, with what he said. How he felt. He wasn't just dealing with the trauma of his ""wife"" cutting his finger off & the horrific betrayal of her actions, but also the betrayal of his primary & ONLY caregiver that incident bought up.
 I'm not saying he did it, even if he DID it's still her fault...I believe SHE DID IT!!! 
 Just in that situation, it is possible he would self-harm, & it would be understandable if he did. He's been in movies for 30 yrs but won't watch his own movies & won't look in the mirror? He's definitely not thinking about that at that moment in time....he wasn't thinking at all...he waa just feeling...sick of himself. 
 Don't forget to vote for him for the People's Choice Awards in 7 days voting starts...let's remind him how loved he is! Much love‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏èüåéüåé",2020-09-25T01:52:13Z,3
119,Ugzueb7zmAT8_3fzLxt4AaABAg,Julie Lea,@Kim Whitehead They were allowed to spend 5 days discussing JD's drug use SINCE THE 80's & JD's team didn't have time for a lot of things!! Much love‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏èüåéüåé,2020-09-25T01:28:58Z,2
120,Ugzueb7zmAT8_3fzLxt4AaABAg,Julie Lea,"It's hard for a ""normal"" person to comprehend how her mind works. After the cigarette & finger she didn't call for help, she took a nap.
 She started crying on the audio because Jerry Judge ( who she tried, but couldn't manipulate), told her she had to leave & go back to LA. "" People will talk about me, I hate when people talk about me""...THAT'S what she was worried about!!
 She was partying in the UK until people started booing her when she gave her speech outside the Courthouse to distract  from JD's closing arguments ( dirty ploy backfired) ....THEN she realized ""people don't like me?"" & first real tears...that's what she CARES about!! 
 #wedontlikeyouamber
 Is the WORST thing to happen to her...she decided JD hired Russian bots because it's unthinkable it could be true & actually put it in the Court Document!!!
 We have proof of her abusing Kate James, her sister Whitney all her life ( Jennifer Howell's deposition), her Mom ( on video & Jennifer Howell), Kevin Murphy, ( documentation), & JD...and Tasia Van Ree ( spent the night in jail). 
 You can bet that's not everyone!! 
 Don't forget to vote for JD for People's Choice Awards in 7 days & ask others to as well!! 
 We need to send the message this abusive behavior is unacceptable & AH won't be rewarded for her behavior! Whatever L'oreal or WB or the UN, ACLU decide to do! They are huge corrupt organizations! Much love‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏èüåéüåé",2020-09-25T01:24:45Z,3
121,Ugzueb7zmAT8_3fzLxt4AaABAg,Julie Lea,"Probably drug induced psychosis! She was on SIX drugs by her own admission. Ecstasy, Adderall, hallucinogens,  Xanex, Cocaine ( she lied about the ""empty baggies"" by Jerry Judge said the cocaine was messing with her 6th drug SEROQUEL Anti-psychotic. ( If they are empty baggies that JD hid from her...how did she know it was "" crushed cocaine""????) 
 Plus she has at least 3 Cluster B personality disorders NPD ( Narcissism), BPD ( Borderline), with Sociopathic tendencies...my guess but JD said she was diagnosed with exactly that while on the stand!!!
 That's 1) lack of empathy/incapable of love & 2) exploitative of other people, among others, but those are the main 2 markers of Cluster B disorders. 
 And her Dad was incarcerated for psychopathy ( killing domesticated animals) so she has the genes.
 She also was planning to KILL JD Josh Drew's testimony & text messages photos he sent AH of a huge knife collection...he realizes she's not kidding & says "" You don't use them Amber, you show them to him"" & AH replied "" I guess I could put it off"". 
 Like she was considering killing him after dinner, while "" He's getting my tattoo""...the tattoo artist was there putting her face on him.
 She's a very sick, physically, emotionally, & mentally abusive  woman. Much love ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏èüåéüåé",2020-09-25T00:56:37Z,4
