Planes and islands and mansions are nice, but they're just possessions. Imagine having the ability to change people's lives by sending them to a college of their choice or a summer vacation to a country they want to explore! Most people don't get the opportunity to leave their state much less the country and experience the world.

i mean for almost every human here this is of course extremly much money. BUT i think we have to see this a bit more in kind of a comparison or whatever thats called. Like when i get 20 dollar per month i mean i would probably spend all of that. and he just haves more money so he also spends more. Thats just logical in some way. also i think that everybody would do that. i mean lets be honest, if you had soooo much money, wouldnt you enjoy it? Wouldnt you buy yourself more than one house?

Who are we to question how he spends his earnings?  Who are we to pass judgement on his lifestyle?  I believe a number of us would have some lavish expenses if we achieved the same success.  Our society criticizes what we don't agree with or condone; however, where is the praise for all of the countless efforts individuals like him do for those in need or for the wonderful entertainment he has provided.  We should be saying to him congratulations for the success you have achieved, thank you for all you have done, and more so; we appreciate the dedication you have made to the film industry.

I would consider these to be orphans, and people without land base of any type.......than I would talk to the President of each country and work to create conservation and preservation sites around their country to give the people homes, lands and jobs to protect their traditions, wild lands and wild life.   I would talk to the lawyers for some big conservation and environmental groups, and especially the ones that have been successful in creating positive legislation for forever preservation and clean up as well as restoration of wild life and wild lands.    The African preservation national parks, which are patrolled by the ""Black Mambas"" a group of military and police trained mostly single mothers is inspiring because under many Native cultures to harm a mother, especially a single mother is so against tradition it has helped reduce poaching and inspired many in these areas to support the efforts to honor and restore the lands and wild life, to create sustainable water and feed bases since human mining, development and factory farming has reduced the ability of the animals to migrate properly for survival, and reduced the water available on preservation lands.   I would then make sure I had all of my property and assets in trusts that guarded them as well as reduced the monthly upkeep out of personal income.

123,UgwZmijg7I2mvtTCz9N4AaABAg,"CORRECTION ~ His management 'claimed' the extravagant spending that wasn't the real problem, they were bleeding him dry, they just settled the lawsuit Johnny had against them with an undisclosed amount of'*8 figures*'

The person who 'claimed' Johnny hit him during production had no injuries, he was trying to use mental anguish or something.. too bad for him that  Johnny had time stamped pictures AND witnesses that said Johnny was coming to the defense of an extra playing a homeless woman the guy was berating, he told him that's not how you speak to people, they finished the shoot, Johnnys assistant brought in a bottle of wine, everyone had some, they said no hard feelings, & he asked for a picture with Johnny.. He must've started having 'mental anguish' quite a bit later, almost around the time Johnny started his $50,000,000 defamation case against heard.. The case has recently been closed.. I'm not sure if details yet, the man did not score a victory..

$50 million defamation case against amber heard.. so far Johnny has over 80 security videos, dozens of witnesses, affidavits, including 2 policemen called to his penthouse, ((he was already gone by then)) & another 2 policemen came again later in the night.. all 4 saying the same thing, there was NO damage to heard or the penthouse..

Most all Johnny's witnesses are deposed and ready, evidence filed with the courts..

3 of heards hoax crew are not so ready & did not show up for their scheduled depositions.. Guess iO, Elon Musk & Raquel prefer not to  perjure themselves in a real court of law.. James Franco has also been subpoenaed, as he was on the security camera with heard either the same night or the next night when she claimed to be so severely beaten by Johnny, she has no injuries that can be seen in the security footage, so we'll see if he has the guts to show up for his deposition..??  

Heard has filed no evidence with the courts, after telling anyone and everyone for 3 years she has all this evidence but she was being silenced, now with the chance to prove it she has tried 3 times to have the case dismissed, they have all been denied..

Her new council has defended a wide range of stellar clients like Harvey Weinstein..

If you would like more info go to @thatbrianfella on Twitter, you can read more, get the link to the Court case online, and he has a YouTube channel with 6 videos he's made explaining court papers, showing inconsistencies in her stories, and points out how some things are actually impossible to be done by her description..
Here is the first video he did, and it takes you to his channel for the others..

He also has a vineyard in France  and more houses that you failed to mention and whatever he does with his money is his business. Nothing wrong with him enjoying the fruits of his labor like everyone else does with theirs.

Spending  2million or 5million in one time are nothing for those rich people they spend that on partying one time and inviting their friends not obliged to be their birthdays. Him spending 3millions on his friends funeral then is nothing they would spend the same on parties. Besides he knows where he stands and his loyal fan in admiration of his work and talent, he can do movies till he's very very old and no intentions on retrieving, seems he keeps working and spending truly he loves what he's doing in the end not just for work and the money but passion is there too...His commitment to play and imerse with one character each time and deliver a spectacular job to the audience, that proves not only his talent but his passion for cinema. I only see here a man who loves his family, rich and gives for charity, helping others, and live his life. He had  difficult life but he worked hard to be where he is, getting better and better till he has reached his position in movie industries.He is a lengend now and still passionate with cinematography playing roles doing fantastic job. He earned it and He intend to live well and beautifully, appreciate his achievement. I only see a man who knows exactly how he intended to live and dictated his life the way he wants it to be, and no one's business. And we only live ones, one life so learn to live and appreciate. Everyone makes mistakes, maybe some of his was leaving his ex wife/partner for another one, shouting out loud he is in love and can't helped and after heart broken and in deppression.

171,Ugz8ZaY8cOff88E334N4AaABAg,"Johnny Depp would be close to become a billionaire if he has known how to spend and use his money properly. Over the years, he has encountered financial problems & lawsuits. He has a very lavish lifestyle where he has 14 homes, multiple properties around the world, 45 cars, probably a private jet, a yacht, etc. His monthly expense used to be more than $1M. He’s no doubt a very cool and talented man. I’m definitely not judging him for his lifestyle & how he spends his money.

214,UgwSs7x92s0G286FdvV4AaABAg,"Ok babies, here I am to mention some of the inaccuracies and omissions in this video:
1- you're relying on the words of TMG, his ex financial managers sued by Depp for money mismanagement (including making him lose thousands in penalties for unpaid taxes and diverting his money to 3rd parties accounts without his consent). They reached a settlement in Depp's favor and that lawsuit led to an FBI investigation for fraud.
2- when you're a wine collector, one bottle can cost you 10k so 30k a month in wine isn't that much.
3- about the bodyguards lawsuit, putting the photo of mr. Jerry Judge, a close friend of his and his bodyguard for years who died recently and wasn't one of the complainants is incredibly insulting.
4- Depp sold his yacht to an intermediary who then sold it to JK Rowling.
5- he sold the Downtown LA apartments, and they weren't 3 but 5.
So considering all this, his 400M net worth went to aprox. 200M after his financial managers stole millions from him and his ex-wife and abuser spent millions of his money in clothes and vacations for her and her friends.
Btw, are you really going to ignore that Depp will go to trial on 2020 against his ex-wife and abuser Amber Heard for 50M in a libel lawsuit for an op-ed she wrote implying that she is a domestic abuse survivor, that she already confirmed was referring to Johnny and the false allegations she made against him?",Celines Gonzalez,182,2019-06-30T01:37:26Z

Plus its nice to hear how he cares about family and close friends. I have major respect for people who are there for the ones they love. Keep up the great work Johnny Depp.

Instead of buying so many houses he hardly ever uses, just rent a luxurious place when travelling. Its not necessary to have so many places which high maintenance costs.
Doesn't need 3 penthouses in L.A nor an island.
It was a good idea to sell the boat.
I can't give my opinion on his collections as Im not an expert.

With a more simple life he won't need so many staff.

If I had his life, I would help friends and family in emergencies, enjoy my passions ( whithin reason ), do charitable donations but try to have a simple life like Keanu Reaves.
