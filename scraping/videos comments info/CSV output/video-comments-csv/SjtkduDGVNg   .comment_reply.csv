15,UgyGotIikC0ALGUpbfF4AaABAg,Simon Wakefield,"@LaraCroftEyes1 It doesn't mater if she abused her sister and other people. I haven't argued anywhere she is innocent. But despite what you crazy Depp Stans keep trying to imply, being an abuser does not mean you can't also be the abused. You can. Sharon Osbourne for example freely admits she abused Ozzy yet its common knowledge that they both admit that when he was drugged up he was physically abusive to her to a point he even tried to kill her. Johnny and Amber actually tracks almost perfectly outside the attempted murder with Sharon and Ozzy until the point where the Osbourne's finally both admitted their problems and sought professional help where Depp won't truly admit what hopeless addict he actually is and neither will admit they have issues that push them to be abusive that need dealt with. They acted like grown ups while Johnny and Amber acted like little children in the playground accusing each other and then going 'they did it first'",2021-04-01T10:20:23Z,0

43,Ugy1uZSHt36kSt-F_394AaABAg,Simon Wakefield,"@LaraCroftEyes1 I like how you accuser me in another reply of Not knowing the facts and then show yourself to be a blinkered idiot believing anything any idiot on the Internet tells you. The Judge's only link is his Son like tens of thousands of others in the UK works for one of  the companies owned by the same parent company as The Sun. That's not a conflict especially with UK employment law where his sons job couldn't be threatened if the Judge ruled against The Sun. In fact this Judge has ruled against the Sun and other outlets belonging to the same parent company several times. So imply corruption is not just wrong but its massively irresponsible. And appeals judges DO rule against Judges decisions, in this case though the evidence that Depp was bringing (aka mudslinging against her) didn't do anything to undermine the key evidence in the case, those being his OWN private recordings and correspondents. Even if he could prove Amber lied in some cases he is still being found to have abused her in at least 2 incidents when only 1 incident is needed to be proved for the Sun to win the case. What Depp was trying to do was waste UK resources knowing he couldn't win but hoping to use the UK court to backdoor some evidence into the US case",2021-04-01T11:41:43Z,1
44,Ugy1uZSHt36kSt-F_394AaABAg,Simon Wakefield,"@LaraCroftEyes1 And Johnny has a string of assault cases against him and situations where he only didn't get arrested as the other party refused to press charges despite there being evidence of abuse.  And Johnny and people who he called as witness to lie for him also ADMITTED to assaulting Amber. Stop being so blinkered and defending an abuser. People,like you should be so ashamed of delving to the depths of being sub human by excusing an abusers actions just because you fancy him and because he may also have been abused.  ABUSE is NOT ALWAYS a 1 way street so stop trying to make out like it is. 

Simple fact he is an abuser, he admitted it in communications he clearly hoped didn't come out (but which his brain is clearly so drug addled that he ok'd them being handed over to the other side)",2021-04-01T09:56:34Z,1

I've had my sons come home fed up and pissed off as they've been in clubs and had women think nothing of grabbing their groins or butts but if the reverse happened, all hell would break loose. I also have my youngest son who had 4 girls touching him in school, I had to threaten that I'd send his sister in and the police if they didn't deal with it... so, yeah, I'm pissed off at the double standards and yes, I also have female friends who've been abused by men...

84,UgwmIzmuZ-QxqiFfLRx4AaABAg,firedragon,"@Simon Wakefield Why didn't NGN call Kate Moss? Surely, if this rumour were true she would've benefitted their case more than Depp's.  Heard didn't mention Moss's name until she was giving evidence and suddenly 'remembered' a rumour she'd heard.  She never mentioned her before the case at all. The best NGN could do was Ellen Barkin (and her evidence went no-where). In terms of 'rumours' regarding ex girlfriends, there were probably more stories about WR than KM back in the day. With regard to not calling VP and WR to the stand, time may be a poor excuse but it was the one given in court. The trial was set for 3 weeks and Depp was supposed to be on the stand for 3 days (I believe) but it ended up being more than 4. Besides VP and WR, the only witnesses that didn't give evidence were David Killacky (legal reason) and Tyler Hadden, the second police officer (NGN's dubious decision).  Crushing injury.  I shut my finger in a door many years ago, I still have the scar from the stitches where the top of my finger was sewn back on (although no bone broken).  You keep mentioning evidence but all I can find is rumour. The PI hired by AH's team went back 30 years and couldn't find anything so if you can point me towards actual evidence, I will look at it.  

As far as I can tell, a lot people have a problem with believing women are capable of abusing men without it being a 'toxic' relationship with both parties to blame.  If this case was the other way round, there wouldn't even be a discussion, there would be outrage.  I don't believe Depp is an 'angel' but I also don't believe he is an abuser.  I think what he is guilty of is having a mid-life crisis and being taken in by an extremely manipulative, ambitious younger woman.  There is no fool like an old fool but being a fool is not an offence.",2021-04-02T11:23:38Z,0
85,UgwmIzmuZ-QxqiFfLRx4AaABAg,Simon Wakefield,"@firedragon 1. Why would he not get a statement off her? The main relationship he had that was most like the one he was in with Amber, the one where there were plenty of reports at the time of it getting physical and where we had the incident where the police were called. Not to mention Amber had prior to the case mentioned a story about him pushing her down the stairs (it may have even been in the Suns article if I remember rightly). It's the statement that would have done the most to help him, not two women who are known to be more meek and as such most likely to just remove themselves from the situation when he is intoxicated.
2. The time excuse is a poor one. Cases aren't limited by a length of time. If they helped his case and it meant taking an extra few days it would have been worth it. And it wasn't just his ex's he didn't call, almost everyone he relied on statements from he didn't call. Statements alone are worth very little as an important part legal system is the ability to question those who give evidence. 
3. You seem to be getting mistaken for the difference between a crushing injury and a crushing cut. A bottle hitting a finger might cause a crushing injury but not a crushing cut it wouldn't, it would have to break and then that would be a slice. A crushing cut happens when you clamp down on either something that's already broken or which breaks under the pressure and the act of clamping causes it to cut
4. I'm not assuming being a hopeless addict equals a violent personality BUT in his case, there is evidence even from before Amber that thats where he goes. He has a history of smashing things up when intoxicated, he has a number of settled cases for an assault that happened when intoxicated etc. You have to remember that often the thing that stops people from being aggressive when sober isn't because they don't have that raw anger in them but it's the conditioning they have that allows them keep it in check. When intoxicated your conscious thinking is impaired, you are controlled more by subconscious and instincts. So an angry side can come out. He admits himself in texts to the likes of paul Bettany he gets aggressive and angry when intoxicated
5. Most bodyguards have de-escalation training so they usually wouldn't need to lay a hand on her. Even if they did they also have training on how to get physical to stop a threat in the correct way. Their job is to protect their client so the idea they would be wary of doing so for the threat of being accused of assault doesn't really fit
6. I didn't say any mental health issue does excuse her. I've said over and over again I feel they are both guilty, they both need to stop acting like little kids in the playground going 'she hit me first' 'no he hit me first'. They need to be adults and admit to whatever problems they have that makes them abusive and get the right help but they won't",2021-04-01T15:30:37Z,0
86,UgwmIzmuZ-QxqiFfLRx4AaABAg,firedragon,"@Simon Wakefield 

Re 1: Kate Moss. It may not have been confirmed but you're going to say it, without evidence, anyway.  Media reports or police reports?

Re 2: Exes weren't called to the stand because of time constraints. JD evidence took longer than predicted so decision was made to not call them as they'd already given written statements anyway.  
 

Re 3: You're are correct, it was a crushing injury.  A full bottle slamming into a marble countertop with a finger between the two would cause a crushing injury, not slicing as bottle would be intact until it hit counter. Slicing could possibly only occur if a broken bottle was thrown.

Re 4: No amount of make up covers the swelling that occurs with black eyes and a broken nose. I know this.  There are more pictures of JD with black eyes and swelling on the internet than of AH.  He obviously can't do his make up as well as she can apparently.

Re 5: Hopeless addict = violent personality?  Making the same assumption as J. Nicol.

Rest of it: My experience of people that intoxicated is that they tend to just pass out. That said, they are not violent personalities. I agree that intoxication of any kind can make some people violent but usually they have to be an aggressive personality to start with.  There is little evidence to suggest JD is an aggressive person and plenty to suggest he isn't.  Bodyguards, of course are not physically intimidated by a 'fairly small woman' but they are not paid to 'take her down' if she gets violent. Being restricted in how you can appropriately respond to an aggressive and violent person of any kind, I'd imagine, can be intimidating when you know your hands are tied and claims of assault could be levelled at you if you physically intervene.

Having any mental issue (BPD/NPD etc) does not excuse bad or violent behaviour.  It can explain it but it doesn't excuse it. Anyone that has been on the receiving end of it can tell you that.",2021-04-01T14:08:58Z,0
