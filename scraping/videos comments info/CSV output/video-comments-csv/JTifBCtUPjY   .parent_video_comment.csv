46,UgwqhOSOJJhpgREyNSB4AaABAg,"She shouldn't have started the lawsuits with that very first arbitration claim that the Judge denied!  It is illegal to allow ""anonymous donors"" (Elon Musk) to attempt to fulfill Ms. Heard's donation contract.  Ms. Heard was granted a *TEMPORARY restraining order* which requires no evidence or notification.  The hearing was to be held in two weeks--but when the evidence for Mr. Depp was presented against Ms. Heard's evidence, *she dropped her allegations* and Superior Court Judge Carl H. Moor *DISMISSED Ms. Heard's case WITH PREJUDICE* which means that he found her case to be ""egregiously flawed and without merit"" and she can NEVER bring those charges against Mr. Depp in the future.

When Ms. Heard made her public statement and issued press releases that she was donating her entire settlement to charity, as quoted from ""Inside Philanthropy: When Donors Back Out"" ""A pledge to donate is not a promise, it is a contract.  It's enforceability is governed by Contract Law and California State Law.  Once pledged in a public statement or press release, it can be held as binding.""  As to the Court Documents, Ms. Heard has donated $0.00 herself to the Los Angeles Children's Hospital, Mr. Depp donated her first installment of $100,000 directly to the Hospital, which she has subsequently attempted to have them return to her, and the ACLU refuses to release how much she paid them for her ambassadorship... I mean donated (but you would *think* that they would be broadcasting it from the rooftops...unless , of course, she hasn't donated to them.) Ms. Heard *committed perjury* in the U.K. Trial, when she testified that she had given all of her divorce settlement to charity -- but apparently in the U.K. you can commit multiple perjury and it doesn't affect your credibility... but it affects your credibility in the U.S., and *definitely* in Virginia!",NIBS,3,2021-05-21T20:39:36Z

126,UgwocMg4qrAiTGtvss94AaABAg,Heyyyy Access Hollywood why dont you review the court docs and then do your reporting. Honestly this woman has lied so much that I honestly do not know how anyone takes her word at face value.. she got the complete settlement two years before Johnny sued her using the money to cover legal fees is complete BS anddddddd the ACLU 10 year agreement was made after it was proven that she never donated the money to CHLA if you review the court docs and paperwork from the ACLU the agreement is on a document with a stamp celebrating ACLU 100 years which was in 2020 and not signed by her. she made this agreement after coming to the conclusion or being made aware that her not donating was going to be made public and she needed to cover her ass oh also when reviewing the docs please read the emails showing that yes over 900k was donated but on the behalf of amber heard not by amber heard there is an email from executive asking amber if the money that elon musk sent was to go towards to her pledge which she replied yes too. Amber Heard is an ambassador for ACLU Elon Musk is one if not ACLU biggest donor of course they want to cover themselves...Honestly do some solid reporting the facts are there in the court docs.

135,UgxG8-mLB3KVjc5gzuN4AaABAg,"I find it pathetic that ppl defend him just bc he is their favorite actor. I see this lawsuit as an attempt (as well as the other failed attempts to prove her wrong) as terrorism against a woman who is trying to get out of a toxic/narcissistic marriage and ppl are applauding him for his continuous harassment üòí 

Lets break this up: they settle their court case and agreed that she will donate the money. He then started to suit here and there and is not allowing the case to be put to rest, trying to relitigate the very same things that we‚Äôre supposed to be resolved in the case that were settled. And btw, he lost every attempt but he still continues to harass her through different lawsuits to destroy her career and gain sympathy for himself through the media, that‚Äôs how narcissistic he is. 

Johny is trying to destroy her in any way possible, even when most of his lawsuit against her has been proven wrong in a legitimate court of law. Since he have fail all attempts, he is now using this argument to somewhat look good in the public eye. Miss amber already told that she was not able to donate all the money bc his continuos lawsuit affected her ability to work and thus she is using the money to defend herself, which is something fair. He knows this is the only allegation he can prove in court and since pp only want to hear about that case where he wins, he is using this excuse as a way to have a case against her in which he can win.
