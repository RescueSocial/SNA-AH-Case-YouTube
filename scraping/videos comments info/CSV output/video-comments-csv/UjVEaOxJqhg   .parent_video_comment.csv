These cases are in no way related and while this narrative may go over with the main stream media, expecting it to fly in an actual American court of law is delusional! Especially with all the evidence that's come out against her. Not only should she have to held accountable for all the lies she's told, but the countless lives she's ruined! It's not just JD that's suffering from all shed done! Several people have lost there jobs and have had to be dragged into court in a different country! All her friends that purjored themselves are all now going to be ran threw the ringer, her sister and father will never be trusted or taken seriously again, the horror her former assistant that she stole her rape story from, imagine the emotional toll this has taken on her! I could go on but hopefully you get the idea, she is running threw these peoples lives like a bull in a china shop and I hope they each sue her in sperate cases and the time she spends in court is her only reprieve from solitary confinement!!

First the London case is between JD and the newspaper writer not AH & JD. So, dont make the London case as a basis for your defense in the defamation filed against your client. 2ndly, people knew that the London Royal Court decision about JD was very unjust since Judge Nicols did not based his decision on facts. His decision was based on his being star struck with AH. The 2nd London hearing is obviously favorable also to the latter. So, AH lawyers, why use the London court decision as basis for your defense in the defamation case filed in Virginia. 3rdly, a lot of lies from AH was revealed like the audio conversation between JD & AH, the LAPD story and a lot more. You know it is really hard to defend a client who has no evidence to show. If I were her lawyers, value your reputation",Cecille Tecson,0,2021-05-30T15:11:33Z

Do they really think that they are fooling anyone? You can scream a wrong thing to the heaven's, louder than anyone else, but that still doesn't make it correct, right, true or even valid. It just makes it loud. It's simple ElaineB, NGN ""believed"" the accusations about JD and printed them, ""won"" a case brought by JD and retain the ability to say what they want. Of course, they'll have to reap the consequences of those articles. That's a separate issue. But Ms. Turd, well, she absolutely signed away her ability to say, write, talk of, sign, sing, pantomime or in any way, shape or form, communicate about her relationship with JD. Just as he did. And then she broke it. And that's why we have this lawsuit taking place in Virginia. Or maybe ElaineB has convinced AH to legally change her name to NGN, because they think that will retroactively make what the Turd did with the ACLU okay. Yeah, I think they'd have a better chance achieving that pipe dream than what they are trying now. Love the coverage TUG, thank you so much for the work you've been putting in on this.

US courts generally don't consider British findings definitive because we don't have any sort of precedential reciprocity with a foreign justice system.  More importantly, the British thresholds of proof for defamation suits against media outlets are not exactly the same as they are here.  Besides, this Va suit is against Amber, not against the media outlet that was previously tried in England.  This is why an argument like this is WASTING THE COURT'S TIME for a third time.

They don't have to honor any rulings from the UK courts, and they really don't care about the reputation of the UK court system. If the UK court system gets throughly embarrassed by the discovery of the American court system the American judges won't care. 

There's major issue with the UK court ruling that would make it illegal in the US, and that is the over reliance of hearsay from Team Amber. Hearsay is not valid evidence in the US and it is understood by the US judges that evidence can be forged. 

What's likely adding to the frustration of the American judges is Amber's lack of evidence, and the fact that what little evidence she had was discredited.",Bright Light,0,2021-05-29T20:18:08Z

It was painful to say the least, but I’m a sucker for these kinds of stories and kept going. She is one of the worst actresses I have ever had to tolerate. Sadly, the acting in the whole season was very difficult to endure. I guess whoever was in charge of casting was as tasteless and ignorant as everyone who has “taken her side”. The fact that she has not been removed from Aquaman speaks to Hollywood’s ugliness, tackiness and sycophantry (I know it’s not really a word). In a way, I think watching The Stand was a good thing though. It confirmed to me that the industry that placates this shitter, isn’t worth my attention at all.

329,Ugz2EElyHYkGEl3KMad4AaABAg,"This is the conclusion from the INTELLIGENCE UK INTERNATIONAL which has investigate the UK case! The last paragraph is very iteresting! 💝

Conclusion
We conclude that there is no evidence of any injury to AH and our conclusion is consistent with that of the LAPD officer’s report at the scene as well as the testimony from Mr Baruch. Likewise, the fresh evidence in the bodycam footage provides incontrovertible evidence that the statements and eyewitness testimony by AH witnesses is far from credible, aligning also with the LAPD testimony that there was no evidence of either domestic violence or damage to the property.

It appears to us that in fact the photographs of the injuries may well have been fabricated. Our next article will examine the photographic evidence in detail.

There was no review whatsoever by the Court of the fresh evidence and to be afforded the right of a fair trial, the fact finding tribunal must fairly and diligently review both side’s evidence. From our own non-exhaustive review in this case so far, it’s clear that has never happened.

There is prima facie evidence from our investigation that AH and her witnesses have made knowingly false statements of truth and statements under oath that on the balance of probabilities they knew to be false. The Court has a duty, in the public interest, to further investigate this matter where such issues would amount to a contempt of court, punishable by up to two-years imprisonment.

Under 3.1(7) of the Civil Procedure Rules the Court has the power to vary, revoke or set aside an order if it is in the interests of justice to do so. In this case, it is our view that JD was ill-afforded the right to a fair trial on two grounds. Firstly, that fresh evidence is worthy of trial that completely undermines the case being advanced by the opposition but secondly, because there is a violation of both principles of natural justice. As alluded to in our first article, the decision is void, no matter how fair it may seem at first instance if any decision is made by any known bias that may have affected judicial impartiality. In this case, that perceived bias is most certainly too close for comfort.

In the multitude of cases we investigated, we have found that judicial impropriety in the UK is widespread. Political interference is a major issue and that the judges have been working to support the corporations, politicians and their affiliates. Is Johnny Depp another victim of the controlled, third party influenced judiciary? We have reason to believe so.

We will lobby and encourage the Attorney General to perform on his duty to investigate a possible contempt of court in making of false statements based on our findings. Next week we shall provide a detailed submission to the Attorney General’s Office asking them to intervene.’",bodil høegsberg,1,2021-05-29T19:40:49Z

And his declaration, was that he knows what they are doing, and he won't tolerate it. And if they proceed to keep this course, he will punish them for wasting his and his courts time.

She's messing about with all of them and making them all look stupid. It has to stop. As much as I think the judges in VA and CA are doing a great job, they're giving her too much leeway and she's abusing it. If this was me or u, we would have had the book thrown at us and our 🍑s thrown in jail for wasting the courts time/contempt. Makes me so mad that this is still ongoing without consequence.
