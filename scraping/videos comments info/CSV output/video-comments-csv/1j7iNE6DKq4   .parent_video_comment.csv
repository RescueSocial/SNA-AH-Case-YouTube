1,Ugxlnh3Jwy61OgjF7AB4AaABAg,"the thing that truly disgusts me is that jonny lost a LOT of things over amber heards claims, with 0 evidence. it completely shows an obvious double-standard with WB. its disgusting because now that theres proof that she's the abuser WB shouldnt have any excuse/reason to keep heard in the movie, and yet some how they find it ok to reward Abusers, as long as its a woman & her victim is a man.",LordAnkhUchiha,0,2020-03-19T21:01:55Z

7,UgwPr7wo8vw9vSJ74Jp4AaABAg,"I used to think ScreenGeek was a reputable source. Obviously they are not. A SINGLE SOURCE gives a statement from Warner Brothers, in the next line gives a statement from L'Oreal Paris, and in the next line says what Amber Heard's lawyers are going to do. This must be the Warner Brothers L'Oreal Paris Lawyer Publicist. How about ""there's much more to these allegations than what's been revealed so far. This is why Amber Heard hasn't settled with Johnny Depp."" Excuse me? Amber Heard CAN'T settle with Johnny Depp--because HE is the PLAINTIFF in this case. Lies, lies and more lies. ScreenGeek should be ASHAMED! ""Amber still has incredibly damaging evidence against Johnny Depp."" Then why did she DROP her allegations of Domestic Abuse rather than turn her evidence over to the Court? The Judge in Amber Heard's Domestic Abuse case dismissed the case WITH PREJUDICE. That means Amber Heard's case was so flawed that she is barred from bringing any action on the Domestic Abuse claim against Johnny Depp permanently. But she still has incredibly damaging evidence that she hid from the Court for WHAT reason. ScreenGeek just published an article that's ""SOURCE"" was AMBER HEARD. Sure Ms. Heard, who sold her pictures and other questionable evidence to ""People Magazine"" and ""TMZ"" for cold, hard cash, is NOW stating ""Amber Heard and her legal team have chosen to do everything involving their case in the court rather than rely on social media."" EVERYTHING EXCEPT THIS ARTICLE.",NIBS,0,2020-03-01T08:24:58Z

11,UgziYE0PKnKI2BYA-kd4AaABAg,"This is wrong. At the very least I think Disney should give Depp his Pirates role back. Cause Depp was that franchise. Or they can make a new movie like, Who's Beating Gilbert Grape. Or Amber Heard in the Bedroom Turd. Idk just spit ballin here. But Disney's Pirates ain't nadda wth out Depp anyway
Also it's sad that The star of Aqua Man will be hurt by this as well. But after the last numbers of the 1st one I think Mamoa will be aite",Scott Bryan,0,2020-02-29T15:01:22Z
