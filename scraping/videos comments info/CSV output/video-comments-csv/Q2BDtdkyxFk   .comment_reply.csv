Thats incorrect. Arabs wipe their ass with their hands.
They dont have/use toilet paper.

But we are going on here on a tangent. Australians should deport themselves and take visas from the natives in australia.

Just because somebody is born in australia, doesnt make them Australian.

Practice what you preach your own doctrine.
Europeans and all otehrs are invader species in Australia and of course America.

I am only talking in parrallels here. Since the rule of birth right is not enforced, there can be many changes.

Particularly, the Americas and Australia.
Of course the same goes for the various immigrant groups in europe.

Perhaps for once the Slavs, Arabs, Negroes can fck off back to their accursed home lands.
