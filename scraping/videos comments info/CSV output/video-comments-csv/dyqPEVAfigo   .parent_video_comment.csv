1,UgwkA00OCXriEaXPvZV4AaABAg,It really depends on how they use her. If she is written out quick probly not very much. But if she's in most of the movie she will destroy the movie's ratings,Dustin Rosner,0,2021-07-03T01:25:58Z

I don't use Twitter or anything and I know a lot of stuff. I got upset with some evidences of their case and I can't support a monster. Sorry, but no thanks.",Alex Brandon,2,2021-06-30T18:47:54Z
5,UgwIA_xE7enNBAZZivx4AaABAg,but yeah if the people who hates amber heard or just dc but atleast there would be lless negative people because they will not be watching it,Kylie Vercide,1,2021-06-30T06:14:01Z
6,Ugy7CrDEuA2AKGDqhPt4AaABAg,is it really hard to recast amber herd like there a lot of beautiful actors,Kylie Vercide,2,2021-06-30T06:11:12Z
7,Ugw-MlYtuOrrNahcQVx4AaABAg,"I just watch DC films because I'm a huge fan of DC Comics. I don't even know why there's so much hate against the DC Extended Universe. Actors, actresses, and even directors within the Marvel Cinematic Universe don't get much hate, yet the haters don't talk about their problems. Come on, all franchises have different situations. I believe that it's time to see that we're ALL human, and not perfect. Also, I will see Marvel movies too. Besides, it's time to drop this pathetic filming bias and show equal respect to others.",Niko Panther,3,2021-06-30T02:34:09Z
8,UgxhgXzXun_G2P1QAAF4AaABAg,I hope Aquaman 2 is gonna be Huge Flop Because for Amber Heard.,Orhan Amin,2,2021-06-29T18:15:57Z
9,UgxoN9Qh5keDSG5O_nB4AaABAg,"I think these people fail to see that a court recognized Depp's abusive behavior and WB took action because of it, whereas Amber Heard has not been legally recognized for anything. They point to the voice recordings as their proof, but it hasn't been legally recognized. Frankly, I think they both had problems with their marriage and probably treated each other badly. Not my problem and I think she has done a good job as Mera, so I'm watching the Aquaman sequel.",Robert Directo,5,2021-06-29T17:46:58Z

11,Ugy8WD-npV-DpBQ3DR94AaABAg,I love Aquaman but will not pay to see Aquaman 2 if Heard is part of the cast,danny S,2,2021-06-29T17:08:11Z
12,Ugyd08nb5P5TPN0RgJt4AaABAg,"I think the problem will be the marketing as she might be asked about her relationship with Depp. Honestly, Aquaman is the only good thing she has in her career I would say Mera is her breakthrough role. I wouldn't like Mera to disappear or be written out because of a problematic actress. When you compare her to Larson they do seem similar they support feminism and talk about it but one is an Oscar winner the other D list actress. As much as I don't like Larson she is far better than Heard.",alexpiperhalliwell,1,2021-06-29T17:06:36Z
13,Ugx3l4VamblzZobbAAp4AaABAg,"I'm going to watch it. I supported BvS and the Snyder Cut.  The battle scars from those are deep, we are used to Twitter haters and media scorn. This is nothing.",JDT SB,1,2021-06-29T17:06:20Z
