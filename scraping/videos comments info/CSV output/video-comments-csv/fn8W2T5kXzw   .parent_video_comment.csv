3,UgwZvyM4n1jOj9t-fWB4AaABAg,"In 2016, Amber Heard asked the court for a restraining order citing domestic violence. She SOLD her story and ""evidence"" to the tabloid media, for them to publish and destroy Mr. Depp's reputation. She gave her deposition, but instead of turning her ""evidence"" over to the Court, she dropped the case--depriving Mr. Depp of his chance to submit his evidence and clear his name. The Judge had Ms. Heard's deposition, and an evidence list of what she was ""going"" to submit, and Mr. Depp's actual evidence. The Judge then DISMISSED this case WITH PREJUDICE, meaning Ms. Heard LOST the Domestic Violence case, the Judge deemed the case that she presented was ""egregiously flawed and without merit"", and Ms. Heard can NEVER bring the charge of domestic violence against Mr. Depp again.

 After waiting four years, Ms. Heard has presented Mr. Depp with a LEGAL avenue to force her into Court with her ""evidence"" to be weighed against his evidence.

 What is ""surreal"" is that Mr. Depp was CANCELED by the Media, when NO VERIFIED EVIDENCE was provided. Ms. Heard repeatedly elevated her status as Domestic Abuse Advocate, when she had proven nothing, and had a prior arrest for the domestic assault of her ex-partner, Tasya van Ree.

Now that the Courts are going to step in, and JUSTICE will finally be done, how will the Media erase what they have done to Mr. Depp for the last four years. Mr. Depp has never been arrested for domestic violence. Mr. Depp has never been charged with domestic violence. Mr. Depp has evidence that he is the victim of domestic violence. ""We're sorry"" is not going to be enough. 

They have NOT covered this story, because they were making money from it, and they didn't want the truth to come out and spoil their profitable misrepresentation of the truth. What is to stop the Media from doing this exact thing again?",NIBS,4,2020-03-20T06:26:16Z
