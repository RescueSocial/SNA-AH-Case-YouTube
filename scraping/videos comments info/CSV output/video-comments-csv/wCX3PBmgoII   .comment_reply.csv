7,UgxaohzXlsPz53W7SOV4AaABAg,Kim Orris,"@TammyTalksAbout OF COURSE!!! I am truly sorry if my comment implied otherwise. I LOVE your channel.... I just mentioned IA and TUG because their older vids are probably the fastest way to catch up... I love your channel, as well as Stevies, and Jon's, and Doctor Soup. SEC. Tiffany.... there are honestly too many to list. Colonerl Kurtz is another.... I could go on and on..... I subscribed to your channel BECAUSE I can count on you for ACCURATE and UP TO DATE info. I sincerely appreciate all the hard work you and others put into your content. BIG LOVE to you. xoxo",2021-06-09T13:29:30Z,0
8,UgxaohzXlsPz53W7SOV4AaABAg,TammyTalksAbout,"Thanks Kim,  I can definitely get behind you in your suggestions.  I haven't seen everything by TUG and Brian but what I have had always been completely on point and true.  ‚ù§",2021-06-08T13:40:50Z,2
9,UgxaohzXlsPz53W7SOV4AaABAg,Kim Orris,"Then you should start with videos put out by ""Incredibly Average"". I was oblivious, too, right up until around January of this year. Once you've seen IA's videos, you will probably do the same thing I did, devour every video you can find on the subject. SO MANY great people out there putting up tons of ACCURATE info, seeking and sharing TRUTH. Also check out That Umbrella Guy.... there are many other great channels, but these two will probably bring you up to speed the quickest. Then you can branch out to others.... I would encourage  you to catch up, because there is a LOT.",2021-06-08T08:47:00Z,1
10,Ugxs0rMwNuN-wLTIGLx4AaABAg,Kirsty Fairly,"@Emily Morton -I'm so sorry that happened to you, I can only imagine how frightening that must have been.",2021-06-08T13:11:50Z,1
11,Ugxs0rMwNuN-wLTIGLx4AaABAg,Emily Morton,"@Kirsty Fairly precisely. As if it's not as difficult for survivors (including myself, family members and friends) already. I reported my ex to the police & all they did was take the information. That's it. Nothing was done. When my boyfriend attacked me the police had another DV reported a few doors down on my street the exact same time, and couldn't deal with my situation. Instead of asking him to leave MY HOUSE, they asked ME to leave (you know, to remove myself from the situation ü§î) because they didn't know who was telling the truth. He put his hand on my throat, after he climbed on me while I was led down in bed & was close to strangling me (over him not having any cigarettes or money to buy some!). I told him to get off me, called the police and locked myself in the kitchen with my 3 large dog's while I waited for the police. Yet they didn't know who to believe because he said he doesn't know what I'm talking about! ü§¨ His excuse: ""but you wouldn't listen to me"". Ambie üí© reminds me of him a lot. The same bs, lies and it wasn't me/it's their fault for not doing what I wanted mentality.",2021-06-08T13:02:40Z,2
12,Ugxs0rMwNuN-wLTIGLx4AaABAg,Kirsty Fairly,"@Emily Morton-Exactly, and the amount of damage that these organisations have done by supporting false allegations from the likes of AH is unbelievable. It's set back the progress made in dealing with real abuse cases by years, & there'll be so many men & women who are actually suffering from abuse who now won't feel able to come forward and seek help for fear of not being believed because of all this.",2021-06-08T12:41:47Z,2
13,Ugxs0rMwNuN-wLTIGLx4AaABAg,Emily Morton,What they're also doing is not only ignoring basic legal process (checking the facts in the abuse claims by Ambie üí©) but also ignoring men who are victims. These fake organisations who are deeply sexist don't care about ABUSE whatsoever. They have broken federal laws (fraudulent activity) if this is true. All involved have including the legal 'professionals'. Corruption to all its core,2021-06-08T10:20:17Z,2
14,Ugxd_xkO0cKw3bWtJsZ4AaABAg,TammyTalksAbout,"Exactly!  They just got caught, it's not like they were saints before or were never greedy until now.",2021-06-15T11:07:30Z,0
