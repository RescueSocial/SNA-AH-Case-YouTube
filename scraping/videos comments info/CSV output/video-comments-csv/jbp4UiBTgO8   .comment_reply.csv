That's a stupid argument. You can't just justify turning the whole world against someone based on loose grounds and say ""It's okay though, you can just prove you're innocent and you're all good!"". First of all, that's not how the legal system works, and as such, neither should people's judgements. It's ""innocent until proven guilty"", not ""guilty until proven innocent"". Second, you and I both know that after having completely ruined a person based on an accusation that hasn't even been proven, proving one's innocence isn't enough to undo the damage. It isn't even enough to remove the ""guilty"" stamp, so how on earth do you think it would take back several years of being falsely labeled as a scum and thus treated as such? No, you cannot in any way justify treating someone who's not proven to be guilty as if they were. You know it ruins lives and you know it's wrong, so why is it so hard to agree that unless you KNOW they are guilty you have justification enough to treat them as such?",2021-03-22T21:14:49Z,1

No, the correct, rational behaviour would be not to judge someone or treat them differently because of a mere accusation until you can actually verify the truth behind the accusation. Otherwise you justify punishing innocent people over nothing but a rumor that may, or may not have justification to it. Like I said, I could accuse you of a crime, anyone could. Would you agree that my accusation alone would be reason enough to label you as a monster, have you fired from your job, turn your friends against you and attempt to completely destroy your life?",2021-03-22T20:05:56Z,1

That said, I think it is important not to spread misinformation. I searched today on incognito mode, and the few articles that claim Heard was fired lack credible sources, with the primary source being a single Forbes article from December 2020 that says Clarke ""signed on"" to replace Heard. Most likely this was said in reference to the ongoing petition, rather than any knowledge regarding a contract. In contrast, there are a dozen articles debunking this exact rumor.

And even if they were that accurate, there is still a small chance of a false positive, thus it would be immoral to prosecute someone on the outcome of the test. This is the reason polygraph test data isn't considered valid evidence in courts.

There is an easy way to cheat on a polygraph test. At the beginning of the test they will ask you questions like, what is your name, what is your age. Questions they know you would answer truthfully to establish a baseline, because they already know the correct answers to these questions. However, if, when asked these questions you clench your anal sphincter, like you do when you try to hold in a dump, your heart rate will spike, blood pressure will go up, and your skin resistance will change, causing the polygraph to register your answer as a lie. Therefore they are unable to establish a baseline, and the whole test will be meaningless.",2021-03-30T05:55:05Z,0

I used to live in an household with verbal  violence. This should not be underestimated. I only speak for my self but this verbal abuse was harder than the physical violence for me at some point.

I don't know Johnny and I don't know Amber. None of us was there in any of their situations. Therefore we must be careful with our judgements. That's why I tried to be at least a little objective. Even if I can't stand Amber, I'm sure that she wasn't the only one who made mistakes. Thats all I wanted to point out with ""Johnny may not be an angel""

I respect Johnny. He is a great artist. Down to earth, intelligent and with the heart in the right place.
