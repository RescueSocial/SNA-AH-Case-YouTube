His original Justice League was very different from what we saw in theaters. It was 2h50mn long, didn't have all that cringy humor, didn't have that awful Superman mustache CGI, had more scenes about Steppenwolf on his home planet and what he wants, had more scenes with Aquaman in Atlantis talking to important characters like Vulko and Mera, had more scenes of Flash's life, had more scenes of Cyborg figuring out himself and his powers, had more Green Lantern cameos, had a better score with Junkie XL, and a bunch of other things. Zack left the movie in March. WB hired Joss Whedon to finish the movie, and Joss butchered the film. He changed the guy that was making the score and hired some old outdated washed up composer, he reshot a bunch of scenes and added all that cringy humor, he removed a bunch of scenes Snyder shot, he brought in Henry Cavil for reshoots and Henry had mustache at the time so they had to use CGI to remove it for the film etc etc.
