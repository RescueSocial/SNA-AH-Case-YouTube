20,UgztkHbPFEBWU1a5YYd4AaABAg,"Every actress would do a better Mera. Her performance was cringe worthy as hell. She has no talent. Zero chemistry Arthur seemed repulsed even sometimes, not even being able to looking into her eyes. Maybe she harassed Jason als well? She cannot convincingly portray emotions, since she literally has no clue how to be a human being. Of not for her pretty face and Johnny Depp she would not even have a career. I will not watch or buy anything with Amber Turd in it. She stands for everything I am against. She is not a victim, not a feminist and not honest. She deserves jail time and Johnny Depp deserves justice and a major apology from Hollywood, Disney and the media. The truth is out there, but still she lives her petty life playing the victim. Horrible horrible excuse for a human being. But hey, she‚Äôs pretty right? #boycotamberheard #justiceforjohnnydepp #karmaisabitch #amberisthedevil",Alegna LaVieenRose,1,2020-10-20T13:09:18Z

Also, that would really get under Ryan Reynolds‚Äô skin who originally played the Green Lantern in the film alongside her as his love interest. The internet memes would be fantastic!
