9,Ugxq0Dd7G_OktZXhgwp4AaABAg,Edmond Leonard,"people won't forget this . The reason she should be removed is very simple . she is just awful ! she faked abuse and used a platform for people which have actually been abused that alone should be enough , but she said it herself all she cares about is her image . when you listen and watch the tapes it's like watching a documentary of someone who has done unspeakable things to people for years and that's exactly what she did . even her parents tried to use J.D for his money . they are all liars from what i saw .  i truly believe she needs to be BLACKLISTED  !! plus so much of our youth watch these comic book movies , how many young minds out there are going to watch her on the big screen and then find out what she has done and grow up thinking what she did must not be that bad of a thing ? !        Don't forget how quickly so many people wanted to Fire Johnny Depp without ANY  proof ! i could go all day with this . plus the people making the movies will lose respect from Millions of fans if she is kept in the movies . she needs to be in Prison ! give her a orange jump suit and that can be her costume for hopefully a Long time. they really should release her from her contract (s) and be sent to prison , not rewarded with a movie roll . how could anyone ever trust her again ?  who would really want to employ someone like her ? it wouldn't be just Aqua man that people would stop watching , it would be any movie she is in . I know a lot of people would say that they won't see Aqua Man 2 if she is in it and then end up watching it anyways because of the love for the other actors and actresses in the movie . but no i will not be spending any money to watch her in anything that has her in it again . i'M hoping the movie company's do the right thing and Blacklist her . Johnny Depp should be awarded a judgement for the money he is suing her for and collect it from her royalty checks and she should go to jail and when she gets out she can find a new line of work . just looking at a thumbnail picture of her to the right of this video makes me want to puke . do the right thing and get rid of this CRIMINAL !",2020-02-28T16:06:11Z,0

I do pray Amber gets the psychological help she so obviously needs. 
I have nothing but respect for Johnny, the only thing we have in this life is our name and our word yet through it all after everything she's put him through he has faithfully remained true to himself and his values never retaliating. Johnny truly loved amber, so much so, that he didn't even defend his own name or word and has never set out to destroy her name, word or career. Amber kept up and kept up until finally destroying herself.  As much as I'd like to think I would; I can't honestly say that I would've kept quiet for so long while enduring all the criticism and bashing of his sweet compassionate character and not leaked any evidence to clear my name.
