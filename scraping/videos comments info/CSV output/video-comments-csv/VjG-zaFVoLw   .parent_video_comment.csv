Their lies will sink them. The amazing, innocent Mr Depp may finally see the truth made public. That he was a victim, not a perpetrator. That the support he is receiving is because he is a good man whose vicious ex is trying to destroy. She is being exposed. Woo hoo.

30,UgzeEmSnqHLiVEznY5B4AaABAg,"It's just off that a domestic violence victim is trying to win a case and public justice without evidences but only forceful narratives with certain side cultural movement and a few ""witnesses "" who has not ""witnessed"" incidents of the violences but being very close to the couple physically (living in the same building with the ""alleged abuser's"" money). Seriously though, the police body cam showed nobody's upset about AH being abused at the alleged abuse scene aftermath. They were pretty chill sitting on the couch and the male companion of AH clearly didn't want the cops to enter the room (he tried to close the door on them to grab business card but police proceeded to enter the door)... I get it if the room was messy, I wouldn't want anybody to get inside either if It's messy. I don't want them to ""look"" what I have there. It does make sense if they called cops to just obtain some history in the record.
Pictures AH provided as evidences make it even harder to believe what she's saying. She is taking evidential pictures of the abuse but not going to see doctors, then says it's because she didn't want to trouble JD, she says she tried to protect him... but took pictures as evidences for... what? It's not like she's gonna just take these pictures and put them in picture frames. They were supposed to be evidences of abuse caused by JD. But wanted to protect him because she loved him? I hear this a lot from DV survivors but they normally have more firm evidences cuz the signs of physical violences  that were happened can not be disappeared within hours so there are normally more witnesses than ""friends"". Bruises that are having several inner bleeding that seems like moving purple marks under the skin normally swells up. Purple marks don't move but can appear in different spot in lower area of the bruise when the trauma was hard enough (the damaged tissues swells up in order to heal and push the bleeding downward and they normally show up around joint). AH's bruise seems like a makeup. They can not cover with makeups because of swelling.
Broken nose and ribs that she claimed happened was even outrageously stupid. Like, how the hell did she know they were broken? No medical professional examined her injuries yet she claims she had bone fractures caused by JD's attack. You know they hurt like hell if the frqctures were recognizable. Yet her friends won't take her to doctors, don't intervene or confront JD. Out of fear? Then at least take an injured good friend who provided free apartment to a hospital. 
Shouldn't she trying harder to obtain physical evidences than keep gaslighting every other hard evidences with only forceful narratives? Like, try to get x-ray, MRI, or/and CT to get some signs of healed fructures? This case seriously needs a justice.",Magnum1 T,0,2021-05-03T22:31:30Z

 about sex, and seeing the sweet man Johnny Depp as a sex machine, 
because he is a sensitive, kind and respectful man. He smokes marijuana 
and it makes him more aware! I don't like fans who have for Johnny Depp 
this obsession without limits .... These people have serious emotional 
problems and frustrations, which is why they are linked to something 
like the savior of the world! honestly, all of these fans should go to 
the psychiatrist and do a thorough psychic analysis, and get used to 
seeing Johnny Depp as a human being as we all are.",Rokza Habsburg,2,2021-05-02T01:44:00Z

Amber donation situation is absurd. She changes her narrative as the wind blows. One thing today, completely different tomorrow.
Lawyers are supposed to do what is in best interest of their client. Within confines of the law. While playing mind games with a judge is not something unheard off or even considered to be bad, it is a dangerous path to take. As if judge will catch you, it can make lawyers life really really difficult, far past this case.
_Where is the proof that donation was made ?_
