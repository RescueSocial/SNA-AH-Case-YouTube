I could name you tons of movies with Johnny Depp, but barely any movie with Amber Heard. Just by facts Johnny Depp is the far better actor and will ever be.",2021-04-06T09:31:48Z,5

5,Ugx4VeGshoMc9_7BGwd4AaABAg,Rock Candy,@YouYou She is an adult not 12 years old...so i don't think the age excuse is valid.  She drinks heavily and takes multiple drugs and was the one directly responsible for him breaking his sobriety.  He is suing her for defamation not abuse. the fact she twisted around what she did and said he did it but she also made up crazy stuff (3 day hostage situation) and he lost his career and reputation. so why is there no footage of him hitting her and only of her setting him up.  is he not able to slam his own cabinets when he loses millions - he left the room while she smirked (unedited version).  That's it from me right now...,2021-03-22T12:50:52Z,4
6,Ugx4VeGshoMc9_7BGwd4AaABAg,YouYou,"@Rock Candy Bro, Johnny drink alcool and use drugs. We already saw him get mad and going crazy.
I know they were both toxic for each other but HE IS THE OLDER PERSON that should know better.
An oldman that should act his age and take responsability of his sh**t ...he can't even do that. It's not like he was poor and financially dependant on her (like some women in an abusive relationship). 
They didn't have kids.",2021-03-22T12:07:09Z,0
7,Ugx4VeGshoMc9_7BGwd4AaABAg,Rock Candy,"@YouYou As he said in the audio, it was never a fair fight.  He chose to never hit her and let her beat in on him.  Abuse is not about physical size but intent.  If you throw a full (or empty) alcohol bottle at someone's head and hand - you will do damage, life threatening.  Also I don't think you should call women weak.",2021-03-22T11:41:53Z,3

17,Ugzv1IIYnXFLXcw-vKd4AaABAg,E C,"I kinda reckon she did that awkward sudden kiss and so publicly, as a sort of power move.  Sort of like a dominance/ownership thing over Johnny.  

Maybe my judgement is clouded by what I now know.  Either way I hope he gets justice against this vile snake of a woman.",2020-07-26T12:39:52Z,20
