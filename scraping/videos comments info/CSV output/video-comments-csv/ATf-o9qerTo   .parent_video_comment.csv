5,UgxcJ7VVMDmv51smC1R4AaABAg,"Nothing has been settled in court against Heard and made official. Yes, it all looks bad but through the court itself there is no official ruling yet. 
What really hurt Depp was losing his court case again some UK tabloid; through official court channels he was a unable to clear his name from the spousal abuse allegations. That‚Äôs what got him left go of his film. 
By extension, that ruling also made Amber Heard a survivor of spousal abuse in the eyes of the court. Firing a survivor of spousal abuse would have created a PR nightmare for WB.",Adrian Sandoval,0,2021-08-04T17:31:17Z

Throwing a billion at a movie isn‚Äôt going to hurt him any. She has been protected by so many people, like the judge in Australia who just retired, probably because he could afford to, we all know he had to have been bought off because that was the craziest outcome I have ever seen or heard. That woman is the most vicious violent lying poor excuse of a human. And I don‚Äôt think we have to worry about the child too much because child will not be raised by her, I bet you she has not even changed a dirty diaper.

18,Ugzjg8wrVvZnxFQbZW14AaABAg,"1 note people miss . Disney canned him for pirates not because of amber heard directly, as part of the case Johnny and Amber admitted they drank and verbally fought , we all know this part . But he drank while working at Pirates sets. When info came out Disney had to can him as its very bad optics to tell your cast and crew no drinking on set while letting one slide, off set was fine. Disney is a business but part of their worldwide image is family kid friendly , especially when movie or show is aimed at Kroger ds more. Setting aside all the abuse claims you still have ""Drunk couple drama"".They filmed in Crescent City CA for few scenes , surprised scanner traffic never made it to TMZ , livened town up alot and made a local liquor store very happy as they had some wine he liked .

29,UgzlejO8ZEogRSUwn754AaABAg,"It's a bullshit comic book movie. They absolutely can replace anyone without jeapordising artistic 'integrity'.
Warner Bros set a precedent for cancelling a victim of domestic violence, while promoting his abuser, further exacerbating his trauma.
Warner Bros is therefore choosing to reward evil and psychotic behaviour, glamourising perpetrators to the world, publicly humiliating their victims.
If ever a moral case could be made to organise against a company it would be this.
Everyone with a conscience should remove all support for Warner Bros, and anyone associated with this sickening behaviour.",Major Van Bloodnok,1,2021-07-31T10:58:31Z

57,UgxmssrT1oqYB566Zup4AaABAg,"I think this is probally an accurate assement the loss in jd's case against the sun probally allowed them to access a set cost for removal but his pay was always set in stone, fo them to have a simular thing with amber they probally need her case to fail and then they will have a simular clause they can inact.

But to just dismiss the fans campaign means they either belivie they will not be that level of follow through or they are gambling on the amounts involved that it would be cheaper to keep her on than renove her because it is just unkown numbers to them.

I would love for there to be the follow through of the campign because it would be another nail in the coffin of dissmissing fan opions which has been going on so much and while i agree there is some need for it there are still clear warning signs when a fan base is not happy with a choice and it will have repercussions.",var kesh,0,2021-07-30T20:44:10Z

Not to mention that the trial in england deliberately ignored evidence that would have proved Depp's innocence. He never laid a finger on Heard, she and her friends set him up (there's even police body cam footage that wasn't shown to the UK trial that proves it).

Either way, i don't care about Fish-Monger 2, didn't see the first film. Loved Jason Momoa in Stargate Atlantis, he's a great actor, just a shame he had to get saddled with Amber.
