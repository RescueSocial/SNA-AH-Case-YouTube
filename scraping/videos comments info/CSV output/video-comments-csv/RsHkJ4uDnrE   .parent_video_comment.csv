Happy that  AH was fired from Aquaman 2, but they are just replacing her with another actress for a ""kids"" movie who in which, has been nude in the other television series called, ""game of thrones"".  Once again, just my opinion...that we do not cast ppl who has that past like that for a kids movie.  I think if it's a kids movie in which it is,  than keep the trash out of these kids movies.  Trash=certain ppl who do MA and R rated TV shows and movies.  Can't change the world until we change ourselves. Our kids are our future and I am sorry if I upset any fans of th Game of thrones queens, but I strongly believe that when you get naked in front of the camera for a movie it is selling sex.  Just like a stripper, they are given money to get naked.  There is no difference here.  No matter which way you look at it, it is selling sex.  It just is.

C'mon you guys. Her name is Emilia Clarke, not Amelia Clarke. Everyone should know that by now. Before you start talking about AH's miss fortune you should really do your homework properly!!
I mean it's not that you actually made one typo with the first letter but also the third. One of you guys actually believes her name is Amelia. Who is Amelia Clarke? :)

And also btw, She's not Aqua Girl. What the heck? :D



So.. Amelia Clarke? (wow)
Eh...Aqua Girl? (Aqua who now?)
And... The Zack Snyder film not a new movie?


The Zack Snyder Cut is almost a whole new film, not just a remaster version. Zack had to leave the project due to personal reasons and the people that took over the move had a whole different idea of what to present, which was not the vision tha Mrt Snyder had. It's almost 60-70% new material in this new version as it's the vision of Zack Snyder and how it was meant to be from start. So I would say: ""Yes, it's probably a whole new movie""
