23,UgwWXOe5MJ9gYeEDOtN4AaABAg,Pedrita Araújo,"""if Tasya was a man and she was now denying beating her up"" omg, you are so stupid. Tasya is not the agressor, she's the alleged victim, so you argument has no point.
Amber and Johnny released a a joint statement saying that ""neither party has made false accusations for financial gain"" (source: http://www.eonline.com/news/822138/johnny-depp-and-amber-heard-s-divorce-finalized), what else do people need to realize that this man actually ADMITED beating her up?!
Johnny Depp's not the same he used to be. For the last few years, in every public appearance the man was at least drunk, not to say on drugs. And still people think is an absurd the possibility to believe in the victim's word. You are all so fucking blind.
Also, I'm giving zero fucks to your offenses, cause while you're telling me sexist shit to go back to the kitchen I'm doing very well on my professional career, doing something useful with my time, unfortunally we can't say the same thing about YOU, going on in every single comment in this video to talk your bullshit.",2017-12-01T19:39:37Z,1
24,UgwWXOe5MJ9gYeEDOtN4AaABAg,roswellance,"Amber is a gold digger and you're way too close-minded to realize otherwise. It's awesome you completely ignore Angelina Jolie's and Winona Ryder's argument, but that's ok, just ignore everything that doesn's suit you. Ignore the fact that JK blocked a person that was shit talkin Johnny Depp on her twitter, pretty much defending him by doing that. Also ignore that no matter what Tasya herself said, the police actually arrested Amber Heard for beating her up, if Tasya was a man and she was now denying beating her up, you'd be all over that lmao, you're doing that to Depp.  Go back to tumblr to hide, that's where you belong you feminazi shit. Actually nevermind, go back to the kitchen, that's where you actually belong. Fat, feminazi and a lying piece of trash lmao smh

PS: Also, successfull? LMAO, Amber Heard is considered a shit actress whilst Johnny Depp is considered one of the best actors of our time, nevermind his recent movies which let's be honest were pretty bad. She's eye candy for men and women, that's why she was cast for Aquaman.",2017-12-01T17:56:56Z,4
25,UgwWXOe5MJ9gYeEDOtN4AaABAg,Pedrita Araújo,"You certainly didn't read what I sent. It's not the press saying, it's Tasya HERSELF denying that Amber beated her. If you'd know ANYTHING about Amber you'd know that 1) she and Tasya remain close friends until today, they had been seen together + with friends various times, and 2) when A was 16 she went to L.A to live all by herself and work her ass off to be successful. A woman who starred in Danish Girl, Justice League and just finished Aquaman DOESN'T need the money of an actor who's movies had been a failure for the last few years, and also, Johnny Depp is the one who's BROKEN and the company who used to manage his financials CONFIRMED.
JK Rowling and Emma Watson NEVER said a word about what happened between Amber and Depp. JK only spoke about him as an actor and Emma didn't say ANYTHING.
But please, if you answer this, come with valid arguments and not with ridiculous and vacuous offenses cause I have better things to do with my time than reading bullshit.",2017-12-01T16:26:52Z,1
