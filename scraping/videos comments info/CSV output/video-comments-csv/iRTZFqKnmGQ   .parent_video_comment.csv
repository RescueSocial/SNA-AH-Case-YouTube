If Depp had done everything she had accused him of, or if he had done half of what the court has shown she to be guilty of he wouldn't have a job. It goes to show for all the Woke equality feminist c@nts out there that the courts are seldom in favor of the male, regardless of turnout. She's a Piece of shit that should be doing jail time, but instead the Commifornia courts are going to do an extension to allow filming and for her to make money, and regardless by the time it picks up again I'm sure it will be lost on the system and she will do no time at all.

If they were to cancel Johnny Depp because of the allegations and it turns out that the courts find him as the victim the entire time then WB would have a major back blow from fans (worse than what is going on now) and vice versa if they keep Depp and ditch Heard. Not too mention, if WB was to back the wrong person, the other could possibly sue for defamation, ruined career opportunities, etc. From that perspective, WB has 1 of 2 choices, keep both on for their respective projects or ditch both actors. It would be easier for WB to keep both, let them work and then when the trials are done, they can do reshoots for the actor that would be problematic to keep in their movie.",BeazleyZtudios,0,2020-09-03T16:26:47Z

""believe all women""? do people have any idea how unbelievably stupid that sounds? as if no woman could possibly ever have malicious intent? its kindergarten logic. its a mindless irrational thought to presume we're not all individuals capable of anything, regardless of whats between your legs. and so complete monsters like this cunt can do no wrong and therefore face zero real-world consequences. and what makes it worse, she knows it.

Don't get me wrong, in some cases where serious crimes have been committed I can see why immediate action might be called for, like suspending someone when child abuse or something like that has happened, but with a case like this that is basically a domestic argument with a lot of he said/she said, for the life of me I can't see the reason to cancel either Depp or Heard before their guilt has been proven before a judge.",TJ Roelsma,0,2020-09-03T00:51:00Z
