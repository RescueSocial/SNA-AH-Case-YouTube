It seems that they (and you) have few standards when it comes to casting.",2021-02-07T13:58:01Z,0
2,Ugx9gXR9RowB_sI_2t94AaABAg,Eriona Pillow,@Ragitsu apparently not ig they don't care. If it was reverse it would be different. But it's not. They don't care or still have the contract. She is still in the movie and the raised her salary. Johnny will obviously get more acting jobs he is a great actor and just because this happened doesn't mean the end of his career. But the movie should still have her in the movie for the characters.  Bye,2021-02-07T13:21:37Z,0
3,Ugx9gXR9RowB_sI_2t94AaABAg,Ragitsu,"@Eriona Pillow"" no but the movie is for entertainment and shouldn't have anything to do with real life situations.""

 Is there no act short of murder or rape that would make an actor radioactive?",2021-02-07T00:16:15Z,0
4,Ugx9gXR9RowB_sI_2t94AaABAg,Eriona Pillow,@Ragitsu he will be fine. This isn't the end of his career. She will obviously most likely still get roles regardless of what she did. I'm just saying for the movies she doesn't need to be charged.,2021-02-06T04:19:20Z,0
