1,Ugx4TB9pRFtqIoOdUqx4AaABAg,Families Supporting Trauma Recovery,Wondering if she was raised like a boy. If women seem completely powerless to her.,2020-07-26T07:55:25Z,1
2,Ugx4TB9pRFtqIoOdUqx4AaABAg,Families Supporting Trauma Recovery,"This thing you have to do it with your mind and your heart is awfully general. Nonsense.  But I think a lot of men just need some peace in the evening and feel like the woman understands that and is on his side. But I think she waits and waits to resolve
Some issues and really does not understand the games going on. His smearing her to everyone is a real betrayal. If he has a problem with her he should talk to her about it.  I honestly think she apologizes way too much. She is really falling on her sword. She wants to get to the bottom of things. The one time he said he wants to get to the bottom of things was when he decided their problems were about her cheating on him.  This issue is invisible here. There is another side to him that does not appear at all here. He has publically accused her of cheating with three different men. I think her behavior in the full context cannot be judged that harshly. I do not believe this is evidence of a preoccupied or dependent attachment issue. I think it is common sense to be preoccupied with this nightmare. It is a very bad situation she is in and very dangerous and destructive and confusing.  There are a lot of lies in her environment.  It is very destructive to her reputation and mental health. Far too many lies. i think  she has the potential to learn and grow and this relationship is bad news.",2020-07-26T07:51:00Z,2
3,Ugx4TB9pRFtqIoOdUqx4AaABAg,Families Supporting Trauma Recovery,This was a much kinder and fairer discussion of this than some of the other therapists on YouTube who call her terrible labels. I do wonder if she does not carry her fathers feelings who was a violent addict and mirror his disease. Also she is wrapped up in the feminist dogma. And claims to be an atheist.,2020-07-26T05:58:38Z,1
4,Ugx4TB9pRFtqIoOdUqx4AaABAg,李竹從,"Amber Heard is feeling the full force of American culture’s wrath for women after making allegations of abuse. Judging from youtube alone, many people, especially thirsty women and ignorant women accused Amber Heard of horrid things merely after listening to Johnny Depp's side of the testimonies. So many new youtube channels sprung up suddenly talking about how guilty Amber Heard is and how Johnny Depp proves this and that on the first week of the trial. They don't even have enough brain cells to know that one have to weight BOTH sides of the evidence. And what got released are titbits of information or misinformation from tabloids. I am sure Johnny Depp and his team are spinning public opinions, may even employ keyboard warriors to spin his tale. This whole mess is about the power of money and how much good press rich people can generate and how sad that women are the first to drag down other women. Even if Amber Heard is a psychopath/liar/gold-digger, she is still protected by the law. Victim blaming to the nth power whenever the victim is marginalized. Sad case for women's rights. Dragging any women down is hurting future women and their domestic violence case.",2020-07-26T05:39:30Z,5

She repeatedly, repeatedly asked this woman, ""so, you never heard me yell at him or saw me hit him, right, right?"" Or ""you did see with red marks, right, right?"" It was very clear she was trying to lock this woman into a story. The video released to tmz was also altered as well. She is not innocent.

People on the outside of abuse will always sit and personally reflect while placing themselves in their current stable state however when you are being abused there is no choice. There is nothing. The part of you that would be strong enough to leave is gone and replaced with a shrill shadow of your former self. You loose all ability to think for the better of yourself. Trust me when I say this, You get replaced and created to be a second version of that person.

My ex in this type of form managed to hide a lot of her issues while we were dating in one country and then they immediately emerged when I left my home country to move to hers - I got imprisoned by her and let out only to attend my work at a psych/disability ward (very violent) where all my money was going into her account because she had destroyed the documents I needed to set up my own accounts in that country. 

There were frequent attacks and she paid for assistance to get into my extended families email accounts as well as taking over mine, she monitored the phone into her house and cut me off if my family said anything particularly nice to me OR if I said anything that count hint something was up. 

She cut up my clothes and shoes including the stuff from my grandfather who had died just before I emigrated. She bought new gear for me to mess with my head (my entire wardrobe being her choice, by mail) 
She would sleep deprive me even if I'd hopped between different units at work to do a TRIPLE shift to avoid her (cause the dangerous ward was a solace away from her craziness) 
During the sleep deprivation she tried various kinds of sexual assaults and honestly, it was hard to remember too much cause I was so delirious. Plates,glasses,knives etc were broken or bent by her attempts to harm me and she never got so much as a scratch, I would just warn her that she was going to look silly because I would drop her onto a mattress or bean bag unceremoniously. 

I accepted so much because her mother revealed the awful details of the sexual abuse exacted (on my ex) on her as a child and I wanted to give her the time to find help with her stuff. 

Eventually I decided to escape there with help from work colleagues because the Ex was not ever remorseful in her good moments .. I told her I had prepared everything and that people knew to phone police if I didn't safely emerge etc and it appeared to be a success..

My boss made a temp arrangement to pay me one month directly instead of into an account and that was it.. the ex had been planning with a friend who worked where I did. They stole documents and then rang and read the contents to the managers claiming I had breached confidentiality and got me suspended for a time , I proved myself innocent.. then she came to my workplace and refused to leave and eventually attacked me pretty viciously , the four ward managers all came down (to the front office) and saw I had no shirt on (ripped up) with scratches and red marks , blood running etc and they escorted her off premises and phoned the police. 
My co-workers loaded me into a minibus and told me to lay on the floor and we headed out in the guise of a social outting for a patient and we managed to dodge my Ex who tried to jump out on the road. We actually did take that patient somewhere but then I got dropped to my new sharehouse area, walked round the corner into my road and BAM , she ripped some groceries out of my hands and the bags smashed open on the road and she started hitting me again but this time she had her best friend with her and that woman's HUGE bouncer BF who had become convinced I had actually stolen some funds from her (I had just actually received my first real money since moving to that country) so I had to endure another beating without hitting back until they realised SHE was crazy and abusive and pulled her into their car and drove off. 

I went to the police and they visited her house to warn her about allegations and that future incidents (plus the phone call they got from my work) would be bad for her and she text me one last time on my phone to say this had spooked her and she was done. 

The gaslighting was very similar to what I hear from Amber and the unsubstantiated abandonment issues were there as well.",2020-04-10T07:21:47Z,1

62,Ugxem0oi6fysVkT53X14AaABAg,Munkyzz B,@Yez Kex yeah my family was like that. That's why I'm with someone who doesn't do that because I can't handle that yelling and drama.,2020-02-04T06:47:10Z,7
63,Ugxem0oi6fysVkT53X14AaABAg,Yez Kex,it feels like he tried to reason with her but he couldnt because of her attacks,2020-02-03T21:15:08Z,12
64,UgxJOjeMIbi9fH6PXbx4AaABAg,Stinker,"I don't think it's the case, when every time somebody tries to address their emotional needs by using violence and physical abuse, then it's natural for the other party to avoid that in anyways possible, especially when those needs are not explained properly by that person.

If you listen to the full audio, Johnny tells her by the end that he's willing to validate her emotional needs if she's willing to stop using physical and verbal attacks,  in which she replies ""I can't promise you that"".

Also, if he was never willing to admit to his mistakes or keep avoiding them, he wouldn't have agreed to take part into this recording in the place.",2020-02-04T14:18:26Z,12
65,UgxJOjeMIbi9fH6PXbx4AaABAg,Vicky S,"""If you're in a relationship with anyone,  personal, professional or romantic, and every time, you try to speak to them about your feelings, regarding their behavior, and they repeatedly default to running away,  and ignoring you, for so many days, weeks, months, because they KNOW, you need resolution, growth, ECT....and they are completely aware that if they allow enough time pass, that you will be forced to default to either, acting as though it never happened or accepting full responsibility for the whole thing - isn't this emotional neglect/abuse???""
WOW!!!!! Well said....I totally agree with you.",2020-02-04T13:36:41Z,5
66,UgxJOjeMIbi9fH6PXbx4AaABAg,Rares Andrei,Can't apply that when the other peer is a person that dominates the conversation and you (his wife for example). Because if after failed attempts of you to listen to them and be reasonable they go nuts on you or abusive and the only way to disarm them is to leave else they are like a bomb waiting even more to explode while you try cope with it,2020-02-04T04:41:22Z,4

69,UgybnwNTU8kPXF62GYN4AaABAg,Lisa Malin,This is exactly why amber wanted an order of protection on everything that was going to go in to this case.  This is why Roberta Kaplan stood in front of a judge and all but threatened Johnny with putting out in to the public about Johnny's drug use.,2020-02-10T18:58:51Z,6
