Coming from a ""crazy one"", so sayeth most men who know me; I do understand that, by definition, abuse cannot be mutual. I also understand through experience, that it can.

She seemed fake, like she was putting on a show, as well as conceited. (Hence why i was curious of what you guys thought )  If im being honest i dont think shes a good actor.  I immediately saw through her and didnt buy anything she was selling.  I dislike her so much for ruining Johnny Depps name.  And I'm not even a huge fan of his,  it just disgusts me when women lie about these types of things (for their own personal gain) and put a rumor out there that can never be fully taken back. (This case of course is actually worse because SHE was physically abusing him. )  There will ALWAYS be people that actually believe hes an abuser.  His reputation forever tarnished.  Because no one wants to believe a woman would make something like that up, and may not have heard the recordings.  Unfortunately women this heinous do exist, as we see here with Amber.",E.

They used Depp for his fame and his money.
Narcissists are dangerous manipulative people who love using gaslighting as a tool to continue to hurt their victim. 
She‚Äôs a very bad actress, Depp has audio recordings of the time she is talking about. It was Depp who was attempting to escape the abuse she even called him a coward for walking away.

45,UgztuFakN5WJUOcw9W54AaABAg,"I think you guys are right about when all of the chaos is going on in the courtroom and Amber is just still and quiet. But I also think it‚Äôs because she came from a tumultuous upbringing and continues to be in those types of relationships. I grew up in an alcoholic family, and then as a young adult was in an abusive relationship. When the chaos is going around me, I freeze my outer shell, quietly observe, and protect myself.

And the eating she is doing  I think too is to cover it up.   They literally can't stop moving their jaw.  She looks like she is concentrating on not moving it so much and that's why she is not answering correctly. Pretending to be listerning, while they are arguing, and why she said no instead of yes to one of the questions,  I think is because all her effort is going into not fidgeting.  There could be another reason but I don't think so.    Dilated eyes, jaw moving clenching, tongue thing,  chewing gum and fidgeting all classic signs of coke.    The jaw is the biggest giveaway, and usually why you see them eating or chewing gum to cover it up.  

She said, it looked like he was going to push her down the stairs.  Why didn't they ask,  what exactly did that look like then?   She was trying to escape a room,  but does not describe how his head got in the way of the door.  Just diverted the question to the going out the room etc.   If she was trying to get out of the room I would imagine usually you open the door and run so how did his head get in the way of the door.   Then went into amateur dramatics, anything, ANYTHING, cat in the hat speech that's what she reminds me of, the fun that's not funny.  Going on about her  sister emphasizing baby and child, as if she was a midget or a minor.  NO,  her sister 1.7m.  My thinking watching.

101,UgyupipQYxHXLEPhBHR4AaABAg,"New subscriber, that is such interesting work in general, no matter whom you are analyzing! It is very interesting how as a person who did not know about this case at all and is not a specific fan of one or the other, I immediately got the feeling that she is somehow a predator. Thanks for confirming what I clearly feel, but wouldn't be able to break down rationally. The most sickening part that I recognize from other abuse stories is that she is trying to say ""it is the other person who made *me* behave that way"" or ""who forced me to do that"". That might indicate that her condition runs very deep and is not going to go away, because the insight that something might be wrong *with her* is entirely lacking. It is actually pretty sad. Almost reminds me of gone girl or something, I exaggerate, but you get it. Those people are not really fixable. What annoys me most is that all the cases we have had in recent years where men or women were accused of abuse (sometimes wrongly), have been turned into such public mudslinging that it makes all men fear women and the other way around. many completely innocent people's interactions get tinted by that degree of distrust between men and women, it is almost encouraged. I know men who do not dare to introduce themselves to a woman in the old-fashioned way and ask for her number, because they are afrraid she might feel molested, even though she really showed her interest and was sad they wallked away. I heard of men who, when alone in an elevator, will get off if a woman gets on, even if they haven't reached their floor yet. it is a sick world we live in and it is thanks to people like these that it is not going to get better any time soon.",Miss Sophie,2,2021-08-30T20:21:50Z

Question: Is Mr. Bowden of the impression that Johnny Depp is also chaotic? 
Those ""with"" Mr. Depp prortray an mild mannered character. You're display suggests otherwise.  
There's a video on YouTube named something like "" 10 times Johnny Depp cried for help""
Within that video is a press conference.
The woman seated next to Depp is said to be asking about his cut finger. He replies draws in his hand, she looks at him, and he smiles, a crooked smile, like dupers delight. It's weird!
And kinda creepy! 

Same video (not sure if it's the same event) the two standing side by side.
Herd putters something (she wants to go??). Cuts to Depp being interviewed, after question he says something like ""I'm terrified And I want to go home"".  If it's the same event and Herd had said she wants to go home. Far from it being a video in Depp's favour, it seems more like he's mimicking her and publicly mocking her. 

That some bloke narrates it as Johnny asking for help showing not Herd's but Depp's odd behaviour is also weird!

219,Ugzv_K-u4LHeVDsQzGZ4AaABAg,"What I see from the top is her attempting to affect this baby doll persona that she is just a girl in the big bad boy's world. But because this is an affectation and inherently untrue and because she is a narcissist, she vacillates wildly between her real self and this baby girl she is trying to act like. What I don't understand is whether she is aware of her erratic behavior (or not because she is a narcissist) or she is aware that she will be seen as acting if her performance is too consistent. 

 I must add, that this person was raised in my culture. Each state has different cultures, and she is from my state. No woman is a baby doll here. But she must know that men in other states are more likely to expect women to be baby dolls, and for that reason, she may be struggling to show what needs to be seen for her case to be heard legitimately. On the other hand, because she is from my culture, I believe she is faking.  I do think she is having an internal dialogue about how she is perceived. I do agree that her eating is giving her a chance to lie, but I more think  she brought the food, totally rude, to use as a distraction from her behavior because she knows that she cannot hide her body language during this line of questioning if she tells her story just sitting there. She needs something for her body to be doing while she relays these ""lines"" in order to distract the audience, as they are going to be looking at what she is eating, how she is eating it, all of the body movements around eating, because the brain is often triggered by seeing food to want to eat food. Now, as a narcissist, she will definitely know that. And as an actor, she should also know that.

I first saw it and was shocked !

The one exception being when he was upset about his mother dying and being screwed over by his agent or whoever and it was the cupboards that received his frustrations then. If he has only ever reacted defensively, wouldn‚Äôt it be almost impossible for him to prove something he DIDN‚ÄôT do i.e. how do you prove you‚Äôve never beaten someone up? How do you prove the absence of something? ü§î",Trudi M,12,2021-06-23T09:05:53Z

Yet both are public figures and instead of both admitting that BOTH have expressed violent behavior towards each other, be it on drugs and/or alcohol, they started a catfight. It would have been very negative for their careers. Deciding to ""destroy"" the other party became the goal. I'd say that admitting that there WAS substance abuse and violence in this unhealthy relationship would have been SO MUCH MORE educative for the whole public. See ""celebrities"" be ""normal"" people with ""normal"" issues, educate how to identify toxic and destructive behavioral traits in a partner and in ourselves, seek out support from third parties or build the courage to separate from a lover that does harm. We all have people in our lives that bring the WORST out in us. Let's be freakin' real.

From what I have seen of her I believe she is comfortable with fighting and that's the only way she knows to have a relationship. It seems to me that she is the instigator of fights, loves to get physical, and when the other party won't engage (like JD wont) she berates them (like She did to JD) and gets even more worked up and violent because they won't give her what she needs. She is someone who will always keep pushing to the extreme till she gets the response she is looking for. It's what she needs. Also, after listening to tapes of her, she believes that even though she physically attacks someone, if they are bigger than her or stronger, that it's not Dom. Absue because she physically can't knock them down. She, very seriously, needs help. Lots and lots of mental health help.

465,UgxzzO5GI5WiPLBjnu94AaABAg,"Also, I think some of the reason she might come across as defensive is that she does secretly feels responsible.  Victims often do.  ""Why didn't I get away sooner?

So she's trying to convince the audience, and even herself, that she really was the victim.",Hartman Loop Family,1,2021-04-19T18:38:51Z
466,UgwaV2FnJeRB1m-ZYlp4AaABAg,"Amber is acting, but she's also (mostly) telling the truth.  So if she's telling the truth, why act?  I think it's because she, like many actors, frequently doesn't have access to her own feelings.  As a defense, her brain has learned to ""turn off"" feelings long ago.  That's why she's a good actor, she's had to pretend much of her life bc she just can't get to her real feelings.  In a deposition or whatever this is, you're a lot more sympathetic and believable if you present your case with feeling.  She can't do that, so she has to ""imagine"" what she would or could or even is feeling, if only she could drill down into it.  Also, good lord, she IS an actress.  Under a high stress situation, why not revert to a safe zone (acting) that gives you some distance from the threat and allows you to keep your true vulnerability hidden?  Finally, good glory, nobody is completely innocent!  Conflict is complicated and messy and both the abuser and abused often behave in erratic, angry, and volatile ways.  While this makes compelling TV, it doesn't play well to a jury or judge.  So we simplify.  We don't mention the time we did purposely slam the door on his head when he was chasing us.  Instead we just pretend that it was an unfortunate consequence of a mere defense maneuver.  But again, that doesn't really make her guilty.",Hartman Loop Family,1,2021-04-19T18:25:18Z

468,UgwWL5lde51cW2G-Kqh4AaABAg,"I think one of the most informative pieces about Johnny Depp is the one published in Rolling Stone by Stephen Rodrick. Johnny is a live wire and I would say the observation that Amber is comfortable/ at home with conflict or chaotic situations is insightful. That calmness might have played a role in his attraction to her. His drinking, hours and job would certainly create chaos for her to feel at home in, and participate in, but I do feel Johnny is the more relatable human, as odd as he is.

The news stations who took this on and bashed Johny should be ashamed, especially for the fact she has prior charges for domestic violence, and they failed to mention that. Johny is lucky he had recordings of her being insane and admitting what she did, and the fact she was the aggressor.

Notice she never mentioned anything about the baby, but her ""baby"" sister evading the question, scenery has now also changed and her ""baby"" sister is a grown woman. This is called ""salad talk"" confusing the listener as to what really happened by emphasizing ""I`m the protector in all this""...

635,UgwvGz4g3zQGXhTciUh4AaABAg,"Very interesting, thank you. 
I'm not an expert but it seems to me that initially she was trying to 'act like a child',  to create the image of 'vulnerability' to her viewers/audience. Her shoulders are hunched over, to make herself appear smaller, possibly even weaker, than she actually is. It contradicts her behaviour when she's more relaxed, like flicking her hair, which is a sign of confidence, anger etc. I agree that she uses the food, to stop herself from talking (allow for thinking time), it takes time to work out how to tell the lie. Absolutely agree with Chase, I noticed how she scanned those in the room to see 'their reaction' (are they believing her lies? Any sympathy etc). She's used violence and control in the past and gotten away with it, it might be a case that she (arrogantly) believes she'll get away with it again.

670,UgxA6TmVuuCXPh_ILFd4AaABAg,"The story that she punched Johnny only to protect her sister from being thrown down the stairs was a LIE. 

It‚Äôs been proven to be total FABRICATION. Johnny never attacked Amber‚Äôs sister, or even Amber, because Johnny is not violent. AMBER was the abusive in that relationship. Johnny was the victim. 

There‚Äôs video proving she had even been abusive to the same sister she claims to have been protecting. 

All of the couple‚Äôs privately (and some secretly) recorded audios have been released, and I‚Äôve heard them all. Including ones with third parties like security guards, etc. 

And it‚Äôs clear that Amber punched Johnny for only one reason: she‚Äôs violent and lost control. She even admits to her abusiveness on tape. 

In fact, she goes as far as MOCKING Johnny for *always* being an ‚Äúhonorable man‚Äù (sarcastically) for walking AWAY during a fight, because HE doesn‚Äôt want any violence. She complained (on tape) that he avoids fights EVERY SINGLE TIME, and even calls him a wimp for not staying and fighting with her.

She‚Äôs a narcissist, and once Johnny finally had the courage to file for divorce and she realized she had lost control of him, that‚Äôs when the gloves came off and she started making up wild stories about Johnny being the abuser. 

Third party testimony and concrete evidence proves it was Amber who was the physically and verbally abusive one. She literally beat him and threw objects, glass bottles, vases, and heavy pots & pans at him (hitting him) on a regular basis. Even slicing part of his finger off in Australia.

She also glaslighted and lovebombed him to manipulate him. She messed him up so bad he ended up falling off the wagon after of being clean for over a year.",Valerie,9,2021-02-23T07:18:22Z

But instead of Johnny trying to come IN through that SAME door (if going out is moving left, then coming in would be going right), instead she uses her OTHER (left) hand and illustrates him coming into the room from what looks like a door on the opposite side of the room, and moving in the same direction she was going in order to get out of the room.

My point isn‚Äôt whether the directions were accurate or not. It‚Äôs that they were incongruous. If you remember the incident, you‚Äôd remember where the door was and your relationship to it.

I‚Äôm no expert so I won‚Äôt claim this to be the absolute but these behaviors are so similar to what I understand of narcissistic abusers.  1) I could be reading this wrong but she appears ‚Äúdoe-eyed‚Äù to me.  The minimizing posture seems to be an acting technique to play the victim.  Narcissistic abusers love to employ this as it gives them a platform for justification.  2). The word ‚Äúindignant‚Äù was spot on.  It was as if she was saying, ‚ÄúHow dare anyone question me? I am a person of justice.  You should be honored to be around someone as chivalrous as me as I‚Äôm ridding the world of bad people who do bad things!! I was protecting my baby sister!‚Äù  As you said, not just ‚Äúsister‚Äù, ‚ÄúBABY sister‚Äù.  This is akin to a sexual predator grooming a child by telling the child ‚ÄúI‚Äôm teaching you about love because your parents haven‚Äôt done a good job of that.  See what a loving person I am?‚Äù  It‚Äôs gaslighting.  3) the calm....  You nailed this one.  If indeed she is an abuser, one thing I know about abusers is they love chaos manufacture.  They rage and get others around them all upset as it actually is calming for them.  Others are left upset and take a long time to regroup.  Her display of calm seems to be indicative of someone who actually finds drama and chaos calming.

Well feeling like a doormat is a feeling. It's not an action. I'm basically hearing, 1, I didn't want to get hurt. 2, I don't want to be a doormat, I refuse to be one and I'll do what it takes not to be one. That to me feels more like she's saying -- I felt like a doormat, I didn't want to, so I did what I had to. 
She says she had to escape him... Yet on the recordings shes calling him a baby and whatnot for always ""running away"" -tryong to shame him into staying in arguments.

Winona Ryder and I think his ex wife came forward to say that he didn't have an abusive bone in his body.  I suspect this is the truth and that Johnny's issue is with alcohol and substance abuse but not physical abuse.  Amber is a strange bird.  Her eyes are unexpressive, almost bored looking.

Within a year-ish, the gas lighting would only light up my own protective and defensive anger and self respect-but I felt sick and guilty. Left. 
Imagining the toxicity and the fury of two narcissistic (and, perhaps, one person‚Äôs sociopathic narcissistic tendencies in this relationship -the smarter one), she was ‚Äúoutplayed‚Äù.  I‚Äôm not going to judge either one of them. I do believe it‚Äôs better for both of them that they‚Äôre done. 
Their ongoing legal battle turns my stomach. The hunger for justification, blame, and a ‚Äúwinner‚Äù seems to perpetuate their illness and involvement, imho. I do empathize with her potential feelings of loss of self worth, or importance, she attached to their coupling. I‚Äôd advise her to get some good therapy and retrain her unhealthy addictions.

Next up for Amber will be getting charged criminally for committing perjury.  Even though I don't care for Johnny Depp, I do sympathize for him and relate to the position this girl has put him in.

  I knew a girl just like Amber.  Had no respect for authority, was a sociopath and narcissistic.  She thought she could fool any and everyone and she did for many years.  She was physically abusive and also had many affairs.  At the same time she would say she was being abused and it was her who was getting cheated on.  Self projection was what she did every minute of every day.  She committed perjury in court without hesitation.  Eventually it all caught up to her in the end.  She even fled this country as she was facing prison time.


 

  Some girls can be physically and verbally abusive towards men and are capable of terrible things.  Even if they are small and petite.

858,UgyMCOIST-WW1vRTl0Z4AaABAg,"Interesting analysis. I've worked with victims of domestic abuse for 30 years and I'm an NLP practitioner and trauma counsellor. I've seen every type of response under the sun and a large number of liars too. My personal opinion is that Depp is an abusive and narcissistic dickhead who pulled her into a tumultuous and toxic relationship. I'd stake my life savings on him being an aggressive, controlling and belittling partner. I have no idea if he was actually physically abusive, maybe not, but he probably wouldn't remember anyway, as he was off his face most of the time. What I'm getting from her is complete fury and indignation that he dared to mistreat her and an underlying disappointment in him. She is so angry with him it's essentially hatred. My guess is that her response to him was terrible, and in order to ""stand up for herself"" she may have become more abusive than him, and possibly violent. But I'm not convinced she is a domestic abuser in any other context. She's lost her reputation and her career here and has little public sympathy or support, but my personal assessment, for what it's worth, is that together, they were a toxic mess, and should never be within a mile of each other again. I feel sorry she got dragged into it, but she has a lesson to learn about walking away and not sinking to a toxic person's level.",Lottie Caldwell,9,2020-12-29T18:16:35Z

904,Ugx1QvMIn0BmvbnkOwN4AaABAg,"She comes across very nervous, the amount she seems to be looking around is almost because she is nervous and doesn't want to look at the person, when I'm uncomfortable or nervous the more I tend to look around the room, almost like trying to find the exit because I just want to leave. It seems very similar in her. I also agree with Chase about the food thing. Whenever I'm nervous I think about anything apart from what is making me nervous, so if there is food around my mind goes to the food, and the only way I calm myself down is by having something to eat or something to drink. I think it's because it's a way of hiding how I feel. I don't agree with domestic violence, however I can't help but think that sometimes it's a mixture of both parties, I don't know for sure and maybe I'm wrong but sometimes both parties make the situation worse. I think this a case of that. She looks like she can get very angry, and when she gets angry she can't control her actions, if Jonny Depp is the same, they end up egging each other on. Instead of saying, you clearly aren't right at the moment, I'm just going to pull myself away, so that you can calm yourself down. I guess it's easier said then done. But I have seen a few arguements, and they confront and by confronting and showing anger, it makes both more angry, and they keep going until, they end up fighting each other. Instead of just leaving it and moving away and letting them calm down. I don't know but I get the feeling she isn't genuine, and lying. I don't know much about her but it also depends on the situation. I know that with celebrities situations can be totally different. There are people trying to use them for money or to improve their career. When that is achieved they try and get out of the situation. Johnny is a very famous actor, so there could be an element of that. Maybe she has been hurt in the past and wants to hurt people in some sort of revenge. Sometimes that happens. But either way looking at her interviews, it comes across like things aren't quite as they seem. But I could be wrong, that's just my opinion. She comes across very calm, if you had been involved with domestic abuse I wouldn't have thought you would be that calm. It was only when she was talking about her sister that she got angry, to me that doesn't add up, and it's like she is acting or story telling. Because if she had been abused yes you might be protective over your sister but why was she there in the first place, but also surely she would be more protective over herself, and worrying about both parties instead of just her sister. He could just be kicking her out for all we know, he might not have had any intention of hurting the sister. I think there was more too it.",Jennifer Bloomfield,1,2020-12-12T23:57:41Z

paedophiles or people with severe personality disorders create personas very commonly and work on perfecting them for decades based on their observations of common, normal behavior.
she seems to not know how a healthy person would act or react, this is stressing her.
also, very important: whenever shes outright lying, she doesnt speak fluently, she only does so if shes talking about something that really happened but shes reversing the roles.
she made a mistake concerning her stairs story, too focussed on appearing angry, she misspoke . there are statements of people who got the story told by her sister and she appears to having put her sister in danger in a blind rage, not protecting her.
shes not very convincing for someone like me

939,UgxIYKer13aCziecnwN4AaABAg,"WOW!! She is a piece of work. First I want to comment on her eye rolling in the first clip. When I saw that it looked to me like she was thinking, ""I'm bored I hope this ends quick."" and/or ""This is so stupid I shouldn't have to be here."" Or something of that sort but she definitely looked bored to me. Secondly she did have Botox in her forehead because there are before and after pictures of the work she has had done to her face on the internet. Thirdly, she is only famous due to the fact that she was married to Johnny and became more famous after the story of abuse came out. By herself, she is not famous at all. Fourthly, they way you see her acting here, no emotion behind her words, is exactly how she acts in movies. She gets the facial features down packed but is void of emotion which makes her a lousy actress but because she is in the media she is in demand after all it's all about the mighty dollar. think in 2021, as more evidence is seen by the mass public, her ""famousness"" will disappear. Not saying I am absolutely right in my opinions, except for the Botox, but this is the way I see it.

With all that said, I love this video and the different perspectives!!! I love the format, show video, discussion, then show video again. This really is helpful when you were talking about something I missed the first time around. I  thought I would only watch some of it but I couldn't turn it off, I was glued to everything that was said. I want to see more for sure. Especially your thoughts on the rest of her deposition and of Johnny's too. In two parts of her deposition when asked about hitting Johnny she actually smiled. Anyway, that's my rant. Great job and I look forward to seeing and hearing more!! In fact I am going to check out your channel so I can do so right now. Thank you for the video!!",Cindy Briden,13,2020-12-02T23:58:27Z

She doesn't need to tell a novella when the questions only require yes or no answers.
But she really had to over exaggerate everything to make herself sound more believable.
Problem with that is, she got over confident, over cocky, that it quashed the whole thing.
Not to mention she changed her story 118 times to fit the narritive of whatever was happening that day.

Great video!

972,Ugy8bBW7pCRcr8adyj54AaABAg,"Johnny Depp would leave or try to get away every time Amber would get violent. On the tapes that was her ONLY grievance with JD, that he would ""split"" She called him ""a baby""  for complaining that he got violent with him, on the tapes. She admitted she ""loses it"" and that she assaults him. Also he never ever retaliated no matter how hard to she tried, in my opinion, to make him do it. AH really scrounged to get any evidence, meaning she fabricated. It seems to me AH planned to take him for everything, bolster her career by painting JD as an abuser. And there is evidence showing on the dates she said she had these bruises, of her being seen naked by hair and makeup people that said there was NOTHING. There are also press photos showing there was nothing. There are 36 neutral witnesses who have eyewitness testimony, including police, that refuting her claims. The only people  saying they believe Amber are her 5 closest friends, including her sister, which none have any actual eyewitness testimony to her claims JD was abusive, they are just saying they believe her not that they saw him ever do anything to her. Amber Heard is a stone cold Narcissist. There was also some scandal in her relationship with Elon Musk. That is a whole other mess. There are photos of him with her and you can clearly see bruises on his face. There was also a court case where they fought over their frozen embryos. She wanted to keep them and he didn't. Lucky for him he won. AH is an old fashioned golddigger. She's getting up there in age by Hollywood standards and most of her appeal is her looks. Not her acting ability. There is also a video where her sister is confronted about AH ""kicking her ass"" and her sister, in the video, is sporting the bruises to prove it. When confronted her sister just says she doesn't want to talk about it. There is also the case where she spent a night in jail for assaulting an ex girlfriend  Two police officers witnessed it and arrested her. It shows her lack of impulse control that she would assault someone in public. Imagine what she does in private. She also later lied and said the police arrested her because they were homophobic EVEN THOUGH one of the policewomen is gay and a gay activist. That is indicative of how little AH cares for speaking the truth and how easily she will try and smear someone's character regardless of the insurmountable evidence against her. Amber Heard is a menace and should not be held up on any pedestal. In fact she needs to made an example. She discredits the MeToo movement. She proves how hard it is for men to come forward when they have been victims of domestic violence. I hope justice will be served. I feel for Johnny Depp. He has a lifetime of being a good man with EVERYONE else who knows him has said he is kind, compassionate and would never hit anyone, and hasn't. AH team hired a private investigator to find dirt on JD and all he found were every person he interviewed, all over the world I might add for almost a year, saying what a wonderful person JD is. Nobody had ever seen or experienced any form of ugliness or abuse. They all praised his character and his nature. So sad that the Me Too movement was used as a Segway to damage a person who has never abused anyone in their life.

HOWEVER I think this particular clip, regardless of whether or not she is showing signs of deception (but PARTICULARLY because she is), is totally tone deaf in this climate. Three women per week are murdered in the UK by their partners, and that was before the lockdowns Millions more suffer from domestic violence which has skyrocketed in the past year. Many if not most women are too afraid to leave, let alone come forward publicly. The Sun in the UK has just won a case against Johnny Depp (who sued the for libel) asserting he was guilty on 12 of 14 counts of  being a 'wife beater'.
 Amber Heard was vilified AS SOON as she came forward, long before any of the details of the case came out. Johnny Depp was automatically either innocent or just being 'rock'n'roll' (so that's cool if he beats her up right?), and she was automatically a 'lying psycho just after his money'. Which was the expected reaction from society.
Women don't come forward because society's default position is 'hysterical woman'. She was painted as this regardless (but now she's a narcissist as well? Not helpful). I had hoped this video might be to encourage people to have a different perspective than the narrative society gives us, but rather what it insinuates is  'another woman who deserved it'. Kinda like airing a clip interviewing George Floyd on whether or not he did actually used a forged $20 that day, or choosing one where Epstein wasn't lying on that particular occasion. Bad idea,  because what matters is the bigger truth.
 I KNOW you are not apportioning blame or saying 'guilty or not guilty'... but you what messages are you sending out to your followers? 
If you guys care about finding the truth, think about the bigger truth and what your message is saying (or confirming)?¬†

Also, imo you should invite at least one female expert whenever dealing with cases of men's abuse against women (as you did with Tara Reade) to counter potential bias/loss of some nuances. And probably to increase your trustworthiness: four men indicating that the allegedly abused woman is a liar might be interpreted as male solidarity or sth.

My opinion is with what's put out there all the evidence proves Johnny Depp's innocence, go look at his Baseline he's a very calm, giving and modest person, it's sad to see him be dragged through the mud and his name being tarnished, after 30 years of everything he gave us. sure it's a possibility that he had to defend himself like we hope anybody would against being abused, or he was egged on and pushed over the edge too many times. But doesn't that mean self-defense? So it's okay for a man to be hit and punched in the face bottles thrown at a him, but they're not allowed to defend themselves? and the media isn't speaking about that, I'm just wondering why this is what we're showing to be okay.

1041,Ugz-IOKMMuvWNDsSq3Z4AaABAg,"My analysis: amber heard instigated this specific incident to attempt to get ammunition on depp. She had a previous history of one sided abuse towards depp and perhaps had been perpetually attempting to provoke a reaction out of depp to justify this victim stance she has painted herself in. But in the instance where her abuse finally pushed him too far and her sister got caught in the crossfire, she regretted her own selfishness as she didn't give a fuck about depp but genuinely cared for her sister and knew it was her fault. 

This is something especially women will do when they know they have 0 genuine ammunition in an argument; attempt to provoke a man to violence as ammunition look up the video ""get out of my car"" if you want the most obvious and transparent use of this tactic. This was amber heards strategy and she was definitely more skilled at this than other women might be, but completely unable to control the situation she was trying to spin to her advantage. She knows that as a woman she can assault any man and get away with it but if they react, she has them trapped, and that was she was trying to do but she didn't anticipate her sister getting caught in the crossfire (or simply assumed having the majority in an argument would be to her advantage, women seek safety and social dominance in numbers and would generally be caught off guard when this doesn't work for them)",Ben Hinman,2,2020-11-19T15:59:04Z

1076,Ugzv1w2xDlC-ndyot-J4AaABAg,"I'd loooove to see you react to Incredibly Average videos, cause he has many MAAAAAAAANY evidences of her lies, be it audio, visual, pictures, tales that don't match with the people allegedly involved, but unfortunately his best things are the audios that she and Johnny both recorded (he wanted to record it all cause they were talking about doing therapy and she ws fighting it so they decided to do those recordings. And in her case, shed has several recording, illegal recordings, where the people didn't know they were being recorded). She is a compulsive liar with a narcissistic and violent personality and little to no empathy, cause it's already proven that the ""baby sister"" she wants to protect so much; one of her victims of abuse. Yup, there is video and audio and testimonial proof that Whitney was AND still is abused by Amber. Her father was abusuve towards the whole family, especially his wife, but since Amber and him shared ""common interests"" she went from victim to abuser. She was arrested for dc on her ex girlfriend before Depp, she was accused of hurting other people, and of course she abused Depp from the moment they got together. Unfortunately, he was targeted by her because he had been a victim of abuse since childhood. His mother was extremely abusive towards him and her other children, and by the end of her life she started getting treatment and he forgave her, in the way a child would forgive his mommy cause they need that love. So Amber knew he would be easy to victimize cause that's the kind of deep relationship he was used to, and he fell hard for her. It took him years of abuse to finally walk away for good, but it's what research says, an abused person will leave their abuser multiple times and come back, till they finally leave for good. SHE was the abuser during the entire relationship. He would literally leave the room when she started getting too angry cause he knew she'd hit him next. She'd throw things at him, pates, vases, cans of thinner. And there are testimonies to that, cause she'd do that in fron of friends and the ""help"" cause she thought Johnny would NEVER leave her. She had afars with multiple people, including Elon Musk, Cara Delavigne and James Franco (just the tip of the iceberg). Would drink and do drugs (more than JD even, and he was trying to stop drinking, and she'd drink in front of him like the insensitive bitch that she is). She faked pictures, faked things when JD wasn't even in the city! cause she is so narcissistic that she thinks people wil believe her no matter what. She is a horrible horrible horrible person. She entered movements and organizations against abuse and dv, and that's simply disgusting. She didn't just hurt JD, she hurt the cause fr domestic violence and abuse against any gender with her lies and manipulation. We're going back 10 years after all her lies are revealed. This atest trial against The Sun, they had NOTHING, NOTHING! And JD team had pictures, audios, videos, legal documents, medical documents, testimonies from all over the place, and he lost. Wanna know why? Judge Nicol is a corrut Judge who didn't discose his attachment to Murdoch, who is the owner of The Sun. Nicol's sun worked for Murdoch and was planning on continuing there. And there are many other links between Nicol and the side of The Sun. AH and even Elon Musk. This trial was bought and paid for before it even began. Let's hope the appeal goes better. But the more AH speaks, the more her ""accomplices"" tel their tales, the worse it gets for her, cause each person is telling a different story. The stair story? Has at least 3-4 version (2 of the from Amber hersef, who is so dumb that she discredited herself). Meanwhile, the story never happened. Amber was trying to fight with Johnny and once he refused, she puched him. Whitney testified to that prior. The bathroom story? HE was running from HER. And she admits to it in a very lenghty recrding (that can be seen on Incredibly Average channel). There are so many lies and nonsensical stories that I don't think even pros like you have seen such elaborate - and yet very messy - scheme, just to become famous (cause she was nothing before Depp. I lie, she was a stripper before him) and then lose it al and become the chick who shat on Johnny Depp's bed (yyyuuuup. She literally shat. On. His. Bed.)",Mayara T.,10,2020-11-18T05:25:03Z

They're the ones who feed off conflict and are right at home in it. Amber almost seems amused when the lawyers start going off at each other. Kind of like she enjoys that people are arguing over her.

1145,UgzmYUJlqRx48JZ_LrF4AaABAg,"Thank you for doing this! Maybe let's see and compare the opposite side and do Johnny Depp's interview. This was brilliant.
Also, why was she eating in the court? It seemed really rude and disrespectful tbh and I'm surprised it was even allowed?! 
It seems clear she is comfortable in an argumentative, possibly even violent household, which maybe hints at where she came from in her childhood.
Having come out of an abusive marriage, I watched her attempts at meekness with skepticism having seen my ex behave the exact same way in front of friends and family.
If you're a man getting hit by a woman, and you're raised to respect and not hit a woman, your options Re to grab hands and stop her, push her away or remove yourself from the situation. To me it sounds like he did this latter option, repeatedly, which shows me where the violence was coming from.
My opinion anyway.

1153,UgyE932hCiPCcuhhIJN4AaABAg,"@The Behavior Panel: re 'mouth grooming' in first video, I saw this and thought immediately that she was angry. As a woman, maybe I am more aware of this gesture. I think this is in reaction to being corrected, and forcing the self to hold back anger or words. I think women need to have strategies for being interrupted, talked over, verbally abused or insulted, etc., and this is one of them. So is jaw clenching. These stop us from saying something that we want to say, by channelling that emotional energy into a small action. Right away, she comes across as someone who is pretty thin-skinned and doesn't take criticism, but likes attention of any sort. Her other segments just look like acting to me, very rehearsed. She appears to enjoy the chaos and attention. This is very much her show, and when it deviates, she is not happy. She throws up all the flags that to me indicate a toxic sort of person that my sort of personality type would avoid. 

However, I think when evaluating women, it would be nice first that you always refer to them as 'women', not 'girls', and maybe at least try to get the voice of a female behaviour interpreter to respond. I understand that you guys are a panel, but it does feel a bit.... well, like men evaluating a woman. I think you did a great job, but I would be curious to know if a female expert could add any other points to consider.

This was an interesting analysis, though. Thank you for posting this!",tammy d.,8,2020-11-15T10:35:29Z

JD tried to hide in the bathroom,  and she could've left on her own at that time.  But she didn't.  In the process of her trying to get at him she shoved the bathroom door open and he pushed it back.  The door scraped her toes,  he bent down to check them,  she then slammed the door into his head,  and then punched him in the face.  And as far as the ""pushing the sister down the stairs"",  that literally NEVER happened,   At all.  This is all in her own words,  I can't understand HOW she can sit there and just lie.  Period.  She just reversed what really happened,  back at him.  I'm sorry this is so long,  and if it's poorly written. It's very frustrating to watch someone just lie with no conscience.

Frankly I saw her performance as a standard audition for a movie part.  It was all about emotion not substance.

He's quiet about that part of his life.  He's also in a video with Rock God, Tom Petty. I also don't like following the gossip on this stuff, it's like watching a car wreck.   Hearing the tapes that were recorded during their marriage are horrible.  I was married to someone who was a narcissistic sociopath and ""triggered"" is a great description.  The arguments of how they are never wrong, it just wears you down till you believe you can't do anything right and you have no value.  Even that isn't enough. My ex would get in a mood to just be cruel. When I saw that look on his face I knew what was coming. It's like pulling wings off a fly, and he wouldn't let up till I was in tears. Once I cried, the look on his face was almost euphoric, and the mood would break. Break. Instant. Then it was, don't cry, let's do this.  In ten years I think he apologized once.  She is a horrible person. I bet she treats the people who do her hair and wardrobe like trash. Her need to destroy Depp's career makes her a horrible person. Even trying to portray herself as a victim, she undermines herself over and over with this, "" I won't be a doormat, aren't I a tragic heroine"" bullshit. In those tapes she goaded Depp, hitting and throwing things, then becoming enraged he would walk away.  My ex is 6'4 and 280, so I couldn't leave if he didn't want me to. He never touched me but that wasn't how he enjoyed inflicting pain.",Esme W Vimes,13,2020-11-14T02:18:35Z

1283,UgxsLIAlbdCiFsdlugp4AaABAg,"Ugh. It's difficult for me to be objective here, as I'm a huge Depp fan :/. But I can say, as a woman ( and one who has been in an abusive relationship) I immediately smell a rat. 

Maybe it's purely because EVERY one of JD's ex partners has spoken in his defence ( I mean- how realistic is it that a person would suddenly become an abuser without ANY prior history of abusive behaviour? there are generally at least a FEW red flags and hints)...but I instinctively do not trust her. I'm not a body language expert, so I can't pinpoint why exactly. But it's the little things, eg: who fkn EATS at a time like this?! ( EDIT. Ok, so it seems that can calm someone down/ make them appear calm...ok. But to me it just makes her look emotionally indifferent/detached)  ;  the weird language: "" ..to be a doormat to whom this happens to all the time"" Umm..eh? A doormat to whom is abused all the time??ü§î . Okaaaaayyy...? Maybe that's a bit nitpicky; maybe I'm looking for reasons to hate her..I can't be sure. But there's a... I don't know what to call it... a coldness...that just doesn't fit for me. Of course, every individual is different, but I do NOT get victim vibes from her AT ALL. 

I'll add that I by no means assume Johnny to be a saint. He's human and flawed, just like every other human. Perhaps he's made the mistake of thinking with his dick instead of his brain and getting into a relationship with a physically attractive ( and YOUNG) woman just because he can; just because he's Johnny Depp...maybe he's one of those unrealistic romantics who's more in love with the idea of being in love than the actual human they're supposedly ""in love"" with?  And maybe this has had some truly awful repercussions in this particular case? I dunno. But even if that's the case, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't on his side still. Women who play the victim when they aren't do every genuine victim of domestic abuse a gross disservice. 

It looks to me that their relationship was toxic. Period. Neither party wants to claim any accountability for that, so now this shitfight has kicked off. And Johnny has drawn the brown end of the stick ? üòï Maybe?

Anyway, I'm still only halfway through this vid, and these are merely my thoughts and personal ( biased AF) hypotheses ..so apologies for what might be a premature essay in tryhard Sherlock mode üßê..but I'm feeling pretty ""GRRR"" thus far.

It's interesting how her hands & shoulders are so stiff and mounted to the table when she goes off explaining her case.

However, being that this lawsuit, although it wasn't between Heard and Depp, legally, it really turned into a much larger story re: #metoo, and #timesup movement, which is why she was interviewed by the paper in the first place, so given that, I think it would've been more interesting if you had invited a female behaviourist on the panel, I am a woman, and don't necessarily think a woman behaviourist would've disagreed substantially with your observations and conclusions, just might've added another dimension.

NOTHING about her recounting of these instances is authentic.

I've seen more convincing performances on CSI: Miami, honestly. To me, it appears that the only one she is genuinely pissed off at is the woman asking the questions, because how dare someone question her victimhood.

1353,UgxOyC9Pc-yF8mKjFc14AaABAg,Many people who have been abused will have a shame and guilt conscience. The abused person has to deal with their own feelings of guilt. Because most relationship abuse their true feelings of love for their abuser. Especially when a abused person has to try to explain to someone whose never been through the abuse. Then they begin to feel like they are having to step back into that episode all over again. They have to relive what they‚Äôve been through and it can feel like a person is trapped in what seems like recurring nightmare a person will never be able to escape from. The abused person will go over and over in their minds about how could they love a person such as this. Then they ask themselves if they deserve the things that have been done to them.

1366,UgwHEn2kLsPLJf0EfWF4AaABAg,"Now I know you guys are the experts, but I have gone through domestic violence starting as a child and two long-term relationships and I get very defensive as well if I feel someone coming at me or calling me a liar over it. I do the same thing, so, no, I don't know whether she's lying or not, but I disagree with you guys saying that she was trying to put on a show for the two attorney's.  I think that was real emotions for her sister, because that's how I felt when I was in the domestic violence with my father, I didn't care what he did to me, I wanted him to leave my mother and my little brother alone.  The same with my two other relationships, I didn't care as long as it was just me being abused at that point, so I think that part was genuine. And again, I know you guys are the experts, but if you haven't lived through it then you can't fully say.  I think she was frustrated because they started getting angry and she was thinking in her head like really they're not believing me, like he was going to hurt my sister.  THAT part I just don't think there's any denying it from what I've been through in my life and again I'm still that way even though I am not in an abusive relationship anymore I get defensive.  If I feel people are not believing me that always has been something that brings out my huge defensive side. I don't know why people think that if you get defensive then you must be lying.  But what I find people who have been through trauma, that's not true, we are the opposite. And, she considers her adult younger sister like her baby, probably because they are extremely close, and she STILL looks at her like her little baby sister, and probably always will.

Then her version of events from 28:00 is completely at odds with how they would all have been positioned within that space and with other statements relating to that event; I'm not surprised she says, 'I don't know what I did' and 'I don't know what part of my body I put in between him and her,' because she was manufacturing a story that wasn't true! Another witness - who has no interest in supporting either party and only gave evidence to the American court under subpoena - has said the sister told her that she had to get between AH and JD because she thought AH was going to kill him, and AH nearly pushed her down the stairs!",Nel Shrestha,51,2020-11-12T18:48:45Z
1377,UgzHNhpggCzYrs2OB4N4AaABAg,"You guys are so great! I really enjoy watching your analysis. It is so accurate and professional. I followed this case. At first I just read the headlines, about Depp being abusive. Was automatically thinking that's bad, I like him as an actor (but not to the point to defend him if he'd been abusive. He is just a good actor) Then I stumbled over this video of Heard. And she just seemed so ... not genuine at all. Like a REALLY bad actress. I had not heard of her before she married Depp. Appearently she have had a big part in just one box office marvel movie, during the time she was married to Depp. I don't really watch those films, but my sons had seen it ""Aquaman"". I just had to watch some clips when she was acting, and I guess she seemed to be, well not above average. But certainly alot better than she was in this video. In some intervjuws and speeches she hold, I also found her at least with some more credibility. Appearently she was very  reluctant to appear to the court for this deposition. Wittnesses claimed she had been crying and almost refused to go. Just speculating but maybe, she did not feel ""rehearsed"" enough? I got caught up in the case because it is so crazy. Recordings and alot of insane behaviors. But she do appear to me as very narcissistic. I've had some encounters with a few ... Another thing I thought about, You were speaking about when she mentioned ""her babysister"" (who by the way during the time was something around 30 years old)That she seemed genuine, Chase mentioned she expressed grief,  It seems as if her father used to drink alot and was abusive during her upbringing. I am not sure if it was to her mother, her and her sister or all three of them  (most likely). I've seen it before how narcissists sometimes ""mix"" truths from different episodes of their lifes. How they can, almost justify an incident that happened during another time, with different people and circumstances,  to fit in to a completely different narrative. Just because it happened to THEM some times in the passed. As if it didn't matter that they were speaking about a different person in a different situation. One woman, a witness, who used to work for Heard, also claimed in a later court hearing that Heard had stolen her story about a severe assault that had happened to her, that she told Heard about, and that Heard then used it as her own,  as a part of her accusations towards Depp. Another thing, that is not in this video but as I've  noticed, actually as a difference between Heard and Depp when they have given some public speeches or statements. Heard always, it's been several times, is using the words ""my truth"" about what happened, and how she wants my (her) truth to come out, meanwhile Depp has used the words ""the truth"". I am speculating again. Maybe, it means nothing. But personally I would have react to that, even if Depp hadn't used the words ""the truth"" in any statement. She has done it alot, and I found it a bit strange to reffer to ""my truth"" in a situation like this. If I had been abused and had to defend the truth of it before a court and the whole world as well, I would certainly have proclaimed THE truth to come out, no other truth, not mine not yours but THE truth. But that's me. Anyway, it is so interresting to listen to you. How you see the details no one ever think about, and how you put words to a sense one can feel about somebody, that something is just ""off"" with this person, without being able to pinpoint exactly what it is. Thank You. I am really waiting for your next video.",Viktoria Regis,5,2020-11-12T18:45:04Z

None of that is true here, she could have left at any time, which begs the question, why didn't she?

1457,UgxG5iyqMIQZzzZIRxJ4AaABAg,"Started off good - everyone in their correct box - Scott's hair is awesome... then Chase had to qualify his opening statement saying she was all over w/her eyes indicating deception - Greg was right she was having internal conversation (At that point)
Momma bear defense - as if that is an end all. It works for men too - a lot! Even historically Mark - Absalom defending the rape of his sister becomes hero using it as an attempt to overthrow a King. 
In this case it takes two to tango (3 even) they are both involved in domestic violence and as is often (rationally) the case each will have some point in the conflict to say; I was just defending myself. (Action/reaction ad nauseum)
Chase don't fall for the all or nothing a really good book has both show and tell, unless it is relevant to the story I don't really care if the lamp had a soft glow or blinding light - too much fluff means I'm over setting the scene because I have nothing substantial here.

As men we have a blind spot when it comes to attractive women - our id can make it more difficult to pick up on certain things, and we subconsciously ignore a lot of red flags when an attractive woman is working her charms. It's the oldest story in the world. Watching her from a distance, without any emotional to connection to her at all, it's quite evident that she is full of it. Easy to see when you're not caught up in the emotion of it, and that emotional confusion is what someone like her is counting on. There is a moment in the Depp/Heard recordings (one of their last conversations) where Johnny Depp finally realizes who she really is - it's as if he has finally come out of a long slumber and the veil has been lifted.

1527,UgzpzsW3Ahqfy1A1WjR4AaABAg,"Greg, you're absolutely right when you said that some people get accustomed to violence that when violence does happen they are calm, it's fine. 
I'm 60 but I'm also an ex little girl at times. I noted lately that I say it more and not realizing everything that I'm doing such that my doctor is concerned about suicidal ideation and needs to see me more often. 
I explained to my lawyer and doctor that what I was ACCUSTOMED TO in my childhood is warfare, and actually got pretty skilled at adapting to it in order to survive.  Briefly telling,  for over 15yrs I was being raped by my biological father on average 3X per week throughout those years.   My biological mother knew about it and did nothing to stop it,  instead she would viciously beat me up to a point of breaking my right femur at 2.5yrs old.  I used to wear sweaters or long-sleeved blouses to cover the bruises from the both the beatings and my father biting me. I remember all from the age of 6yrs old onward.

She's faking a lot, and she may have lived in a rough childhood if she's constantly (egging) starting the fights or (narcissistic) may be the issue, and (bad) acting/coaching. 
You're right about the blood.  I jump right in to help someone no matter how much blood to help. But after looking at the scene I'm sickened at the same of it that I'll vomit - weird.
When violence starts though, I'll crumpled (not the 2 f's but the third and freeze then dissociate. 
I find her exceedingly arrogant and she's perfect and would NEVER do anything wrong or horribly violent unless provoked (showing an external locus of control), so it's everybody else's fault that I behaved that way, and if you're not understanding about my situation then you're just simply ignorant and I'll dismiss you as relevant.",Diane Lalonde,8,2020-11-12T04:39:44Z

Mark called it on her being ready for her big scene when she looked back and forth at the lawyers.  I saw a huge flash of her using her lawyers as a gang backing her up.  That protective diatribe she gave was like a high school girl.  Drama queen ... isn‚Äôt she the big hero (a blank check to go postal). Her eyelids did a distinct flutter as she leaned forward, usually a sign of nervousness, not resolve, right?
She‚Äôs not very educated either, constantly using poor grammar, ‚Äúat the top of a stairs‚Äù and incorrect use of reflective pronoun ‚Äúme‚Äù when she should use the pronoun ‚ÄúI‚Äù both things happened twice.  To me, poor language is an indication of impulsivity.  Swearing comes under that same umbrella of indications.  It makes me wonder about what her impulsive actions really were in the midst of that awful scene.  English is her first language so no excuse there.

Johnny had locked himself in the bathroom. She admitted it on their tape. So she was trying to get in, and then punched him in the face soon as she got in, after hitting him on the head with the door, cuz she was TRYING TO GET AWAY? Ha right.

Another fun fact: her sister's boss spoke out and urged her sister to tell the truth. Said the sister had told her that night she jumped in between them because it looked like Amber was going to kill Depp, push him down the stairs. She also said there were many instances where the sister stayed at her place because Amber was abusing her. Theres an old video where she has a bruised face and apparently she told ppl Amber did it.

Amber was also charged with beating up an ex-girlfriend. She's disgusting. A full package of cluster B personality disorders lol.  

I feel so bad for Johnny Depp. Everyone that's ever met him said he is the gentlest, sweetest guy but because of all this ppl think he's a wild drunkard, like Mark assumed. That one video where he's slamming cupboards - when i saw that I assumed too, but turns out that was the day after his mom died he found out he was robbed of all his money by his managers, and it seemed Amber had done something to him the night prior. (She did admit she attacked him on her birthday bc he was 10 minutes late, and he said it was because he was on a call about losing his money). The vodka bottle thing was all Amber lashing out. After the fact after she was gone and his finger was severed and had his face burned by a cigarette he trashed the place, threw beer bottles and wrote the name of her lovers in blood on the walls lol. That's the only instance I heard of where he was in any way a 'violent drunkard.' Poor guy his kids see these stories.
