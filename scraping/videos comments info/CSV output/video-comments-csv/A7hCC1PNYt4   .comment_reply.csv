It's sad!",2020-08-08T01:20:54Z,1
12,UgxiKBd5vkNoEua_yVZ4AaABAg,Doctor Soup,That is a really good point. I didn't even consider that. I think I've mentioned in it my videos before but I do feel sorry for people who are mentally ill like this. It makes you wonder if something traumatic happened to her that made her snap. I do recall reading an article about how her friend passed away when she was 16... that can definitely do a number on you. I don't condone or approve of her actions by any means(obvious from my videos) but I do feel sorry for people who suffer from mental illness as they didn't choose to be this way.,2020-08-08T01:13:58Z,0

I wish you a very safe and lovely rest of your week and as I stated I would ask Johnny's lawyer for such sensitive info. Take care.,2020-05-27T19:42:20Z,3
