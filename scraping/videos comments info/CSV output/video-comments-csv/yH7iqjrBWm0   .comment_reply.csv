It's that she embarrassed a politician who allowed her to make that apology contrary to the norm.  Not smart. (Blaming her Aussie P/A was even dumber).  He made noises in parliament (and in public) and that's probably why this came up in a Senate Committee thing. The guy concerned ruined his own rep by getting caught in an affair with his assistant and leaving his marriage and 4 kids.

155,UgwUHE8u-2NNwp8hysF4AaABAg,Darklyn Stormember,"@Sami Mudget I'm just speculating; because I don't know anything about law, but sadly, I don't think she'll go to jail for the Australia crimes either. 

Not because Australia wouldn't happily lock her up for at least a little bit but because even if they follow through and legally conclude that she did indeed commit perjury, it's probably not something they'd go through the political minefield of trying to extradite her for, nor something the US would consider grave enough to extradite for even if Australia initiated such a request. 

Since they are seeing it as the slap in the face that it is though, they probably will follow through on never allowing her back in, nor either will they likely allow to eventually buy her way through the process of obtaining to a pardon. So there's that hope at least. 

100% agree that it's ridiculous that smuggling dogs across a border, and not the repeated violent, physical assaults on her domestic partner(s), is the crime bring taken the most seriously by authorities. And, though the two crimes are being addressed by two different countries, from what people have been saying about how family/domestic violence is treated across the board, it doesn't sound like she'd have really been held to account for her assaults in Australia either.

She cut of his finger left him huge black eyes, verbally accosted him regularly and lied under oath multiple multiple times oh yeah and created this entire case of fraud almost ruining his career?!?!

157,UgwUHE8u-2NNwp8hysF4AaABAg,Darklyn Stormember,"@NoobHere Trying Maybe, but Australia really does seem to have taken it as a personal affront, so maybe not. 

Apparently a lot of movies are filmed there, though, which would mean that it would at least limit her options job-wise (so not calling it a 'career' because anything more substantive than projects like Mandy Lane and Pineapple Express, she's gotten by riding on JD's coattails). 

And if people stop looking the other way and acting like her actions are okay; if there's real consequence, however small, for each thing she's done by whomever or from wherever she's done it; then maybe those consequences will jointly add up to something more tangible. (One can only hope!)
