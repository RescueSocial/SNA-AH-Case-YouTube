0,Ugzj0SN3yYkp7Xao4W14AaABAg,Funny how this isn't what Amber said it is. Not one tiny bit. She was trying to get him to do something to her. He had her number. She was working a narrative from the beginning.,Ada Lavin,2,2021-10-29T02:17:00Z

2,UgzSp6GXw5HtcZAZYS14AaABAg,Amber is disgusting. Always secretly recording people....even friends,Char Troyer,3,2020-09-22T18:22:51Z
3,UgyQ7zmzwctDOjy6xeN4AaABAg,Funny how TMZ turned off their comments section. Would really like to know why they edited out the last 30 seconds when AH was in such fear that she laughed about it.,Shijusanify,9,2020-08-16T12:27:38Z

She went to where he was and strategically and secretly filmed him. Then when he walked away, she continues to film, and follow him whilst giving a slight laugh to herself and a little smirk in the end. Fucking sociopathic psycho, Amber Turd. Oh I am mean Heard. We have all listened to the audio by now, of her clear abuse towards Johnny!",Taryn Ashley,0,2020-08-16T05:08:11Z
5,UgyitWJz9BS-XUiLuoN4AaABAg,"In the TMZ version, it's a low-quality video that ends when Johnny snatches up the phone and the screen goes blank. Amber Heard supporters claim that that's when he started to smack her around.
But this version extends beyond that, both at the beginning and the end. In the beginning, it shows Amber Heard turning on the phone to record, and setting it up where he couldn't see it.
The interesting stuff happens at the end, though. After Johnny snatches up the phone and throws it in the trash, he says ""Bye."" and leaves the room. No slapping her around, nothing of the sort. He leaves.
From there, the video shows Amber fishing the phone out of the trash, gigging and smirking, like she knows she just got one over on him. She then follows Johnny before turning the phone off. Hardly the picture of the poor, embattled victim she wanted the world to think she was.
What I love is that the defense showed the TMZ version of the video repeatedly in London, to try to prove what a monster he is. Then, on the closing day, BOOM! David Sherborne showed the whole video, blowing that pretext clean out of the water. Just like a rock and roll pirate. I only wish I could have seen the look on Heard's face.Â
