63,UgxPw0-iw4D2NNBcBkp4AaABAg,Kt.H-talks to holograms,"@Sreehari Sreekumar Johnny's libel case against the SUN newspaper just finished last week. It will take the Judge a couple of months to go over the evidence of the case before he will make his decision whether the SUN committed libel against JD. ScAmber Turd was only a witness in these proceedings and so 'No' she won't be going to jail. This was a civil case not a criminal one. The Judge may label her an untruthful and unreliable witness, but I doubt much more than that. However, Johnny's defamation trial against Amber for $50 mil, begins in America in January. Even though, this is also a civil trial, if Amber lies in the Virginia court like she did in London court she could be charged with perjury. Virginia has very serious perjury laws, so we will just have to wait and see what happens.",2020-08-02T02:57:46Z,0

69,UgyTtj-_nMKixuGuV1d4AaABAg,RenFace,"@Sreehari Sreekumar 
I very much doubt that.
First: the trial that took place was in the UK, against The Sun paper. So this was not against her, but she was a witness. 
The trial against her has not happened yet. From what I understand, neither are criminal cases in the sense that jail time would be the outcome. They are being sued, as in punitive damages perhaps are at the end if ruled in Depp's favor (I am not sure what else)- and these are not trials with juries. 
Both sides are holding strong in that they both claim to have evidence against the other. While the court of public opinion have certainly chosen their sides on who they feel the evidence is stronger for.... we have yet to see how the judges will decide.",2020-08-01T15:11:18Z,0

153,UgwEtEyM0Gn_HIFeBN54AaABAg,Katarzyna L,"@M S Agreed. It was the same case with my father. Pretty much anything, even the dumbest stuff could trigger him. He was such a manipulator that my mother's family actually believed him and not my mother and us (my sister and me). I don't know if that could be a case with Johnny and I am not going to form an opinion but the evidence out there speaks pretty much against it and clearly portrays Amber as a manipulative, narcissistic and seemingly mentally unstable person.

*What I'm trying to say is that ""Oh but he/she's so polite and kind to everyone"" is no evidence that someone doesn't turn into a monster at home. From my experience, it's a really shitty argument.*

From what my mother told me, my father was really nice and all until we moved into his apartment (we lived for the first 3.5 years of my life in my mom's apartment but then she was pregnant with my sister so we moved into his, bigger apartment and that's when it all started, and lasted for years. Just like you, Michaela, I also suffer emotional consequences of his actions and the way he treated us up to this day, being 23 and having moved out from his place at 19. I am actually starting a new, better paid job and I'm seriously considering going to a therapist to sort this mess in my head.

I hope you're doing better, Michaela. Be strong and don't let bastards out there destroy you and your life :).",2020-07-19T18:04:05Z,7

179,UgwqrGUnRPFuQbSpqJV4AaABAg,Imogen Booth,Yeah I believe iO is merely a more stubborn Amanda- only witnessed the slightest of details and felt compelled to take Amber's allegations seriously because of course you do when your friend comes to you crying. The problem is he really threw himself into it with writing the article hence when evidence came to light throwing doubt upon the true nature of the realtionship he had to double down on the claims to try and retain his image. In reality he should have said what he knew and stood back but we're way past that.,2020-09-01T12:08:49Z,1

181,Ugw6VkjvKl6q-t_BbV14AaABAg,Schoolgirl325,"@Alex W I mean, I’m not saying that it excuses any of the murders she committed, or the fact that she framed him at all. Full stop, Amy from Gone Girl was a narcissistic psychopath, and what she did to Nick by framing him for murders she committed behind his back was completely wrong, no matter what. At the very least, Amy DID have legitimate reasons to be dissatisfied in her marriage to Nick and dislike him. He was a conceited and lazy jackass who cheated on her. He had some substance abuse issues, which, granted, sometimes are valid grounds for a divorce or separation in a marriage, if the addict keeps relapsing, keeps stealing and splurging money for their addiction, and/or keeps putting themselves, their partner, other family members, and/or friends at risk of harm’s way with their addiction. However, it doesn’t really sound like Johnny Depp was a dangerous addict to anyone but himself, especially since he had enough money to supply it. It doesn’t seem like he did Amber any sort of great injustice or mistreated her in their marriage either, so it makes her besmirching his reputation in the media by falsely accusing him of being a wife beater and a rapist even worse.",2021-08-26T17:34:00Z,0

How journalists covered colleagues' harassment scandals 01:26

Story highlights



		Roxanne Jones: Behind every sexual harasser likely stands a woman willing to excuse, cover up or feel sorry for him

		It's hard to deny the reward for silence, but it ensures continued inequality of women, she writes






“Roxanne Jones, a founding editor of ESPN Magazine and former vice president at ESPN, has worked as a producer, reporter and editor at the New York Daily News and The Philadelphia Inquirer. Jones is co-author of ""Say it Loud: An Illustrated History of the Black Athlete."" She talks politics, sports and culture weekly on Philadelphia's Praise 107.9FM. The views expressed here are solely hers.

”

(CNN)Admit it.

Behind every sexual harasser, be he Matt Lauer or the man next door, likely stands a woman willing to excuse, cover up or feel ""heartbroken"" for the abuser once his lewd behavior is exposed. I've seen this time and time again and I know I'm not the only one.

You know these women. Maybe you are even one of them.



In some cases, these women are the personal assistants, executives and co-workers who have benefited from the harasser's success. They've gotten promotions, recognition and raises.

They may commiserate with other women in the ladies' room about the awful boys' club culture. But if you ever accuse a co-worker of sexual harassment or abuse, the last thing they will do is support you. If they have the power, these women may even fire you for causing a stir.



This week, NBC star Matt Lauer became the most recent man to fall amid sexual harassment allegations, which ranged from castigating a woman for not having sex with him after he dropped his pants in the office to sending women sex toys. On Thursday, Lauer apologized: ""... there is enough truth in these stories to make me feel embarrassed and ashamed,"" he wrote. ""I regret that my shame is now shared by the people I cherish dearly,"" his statement said.

When his ""Today"" show co-host Savannah Guthrie broke the news of Lauer's firing on air, she was clearly devastated.



""... I'm heartbroken for Matt. He is my dear, dear friend and my partner,"" Guthrie said on the show. ""He is beloved by many, many people here."" Guthrie added she also was heartbroken for the woman who came forward to tell her story and for those who might still come forward. Her fill-in co-host Hoda Kotb joined the Lauer lovefest.

Why would Guthrie and Kotb immediately rush in to praise Lauer before they even had details of the story? This type of selfish, blind loyalty is what enables these predators to reign with terror over working women in the first place. Must we always show this automatic sympathy for men we know who've shown such cruelty to women?

It's infuriating.

Rumors of their dear friend's womanizing ways were no secret in the media industry, according to Variety. Ann Curry was infamously ousted from the show as Lauer's co-host in 2012, in part allegedly because of her frosty relationship with Lauer, as noted by CNN's Brian Stelter and others. Curry always cited the boys' club environment at the Today's show, as Stelter noted.

The accusations against Lauer are increasing, and they are disturbing. In addition to the stories detailed in Variety, a different woman, who didn't want to be named, told the New York Times on Wednesday that Lauer had called her to his office back in 2001 to discuss a story. He locked the door, she said, bent her over a chair, pulled down her pants and had sex with her. She said she passed out and was taken to a nurse. She told The Times that she didn't report the assault at the time because she felt she didn't do enough to stop Lauer and was afraid she'd lose her job. She quit a year later.

Matt Lauer, Harvey Weinstein, Charlie Rose, Congressman John Conyers, Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore, even our ""grab 'em by the p***y"" President Trump -- all have had women eager to defend their honor, no matter how obscene the accusations of sexual harassment and abuse. Lauer, Rose, and Weinstein have apologized for at least some of the alleged behavior, with Weinstein denying anything non-consensual took place. One of Conyers' accusers is still asking for an apology. Moore has denied the allegations, as has President Trump -- who it was reported this week suggested the infamous Access Hollywood tape may have been a fake or altered, though he had apologized in the aftermath of its release to the press last fall.



Yvette Vega, an executive producer with Charlie Rose since 1991, knew for decades about her boss' crude behavior -- which, according to allegations, include his walking around naked in front of young women who worked with him, and late night sexual fantasy calls. Rose has been accused of sexual harassment by eight women. Still, Vega did nothing for women who asked her for help.

""I explained (to Vega) how he inappropriately spoke to me during those times,"" Kyle Godfrey-Ryan, a 21-year-old Rose assistant in the mid-2000s told The Washington Post. ""She would just shrug and just say, 'That's just Charlie being Charlie.'"" Vega doesn't deny she covered for the predator. ""I should have stood up for them. I failed,"" she said in a statement. ""It is crushing. I deeply regret not helping them.""

Yes, Yvette. You did fail.

Another recent fail for women involves a not-as-famous but still powerful man, Mike Oreskes, who was recently forced to resign from his post as NPR's senior vice president of news after two women accused him of unwanted sexual contact. Oreskes admitted wrongdoing and apologized in an internal memo obtained by CNN. The alleged assaults happened when Oreskes was a Washington bureau chief for The New York Times. He also worked at the Associated Press. Decades later, women at NPR also complained about his alleged behavior.

Said Jill Abramson, who was Oreskes' deputy at The Times and eventually became the first female executive editor at paper: ""Maybe confronting him would have somehow stopped him from doing it to another woman. ... I don't really feel it was in a gray area in retrospect. I should have stopped him,"" she told the Washington Post. Abramson, who left the paper in 2014, is now a lecturer at Harvard.



It's hard to deny the reward for silence, for not supporting women who report harassment. Sadly, Vega and Abramson are examples of this. But silence like theirs ensures continued inequality of women in the workplace and puts women in danger.

It ruins the careers of countless talented, ambitious women. And that should be unacceptable. It's not enough to want full equality, or equal pay, or respect in the workplace if you are not willing to stand up and fight for it when it counts.

According to the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, ""anywhere from 25% to 85% of women report having experienced sexual harassment in the workplace."" That's a huge range, but even looking at 25% means 1 in 4 working women experience harassment. And the EEOC study also said that 75% of sexual harassment cases are never even reported.

I understand that these situations are complicated. Working relationships do sometimes grow into deep friendships, if you're lucky. And it's disheartening to find out that a male colleague you admire and respect, or even call a friend, may also be a sexist pig, or worse.



Firing the harasser is not always warranted -- although if reports are true, Lauer had to go. There have been times when I've reported sexual harassment for myself, or other women and men, but I didn't demand the harasser be terminated. I didn't hire a lawyer and try to sue for big bucks. However, I did call for accountability -- a demotion, a record of the harassment in his personnel file, a canceled bonus, mandatory counseling -- some sign that the company didn't condone this behavior. This was not always achievable. Sometimes it was impossible and the abusers were protected.

That's why it's crucial that we continue to speak up and out these sexual harassers. But we must also confront the women in the room who continue to fail us all.",2020-05-13T22:31:27Z,1

Frankly, your ""midlife crisis"" bs is offensive. My fiance is younger than me, am I having a midlife crisis, too? No. You can't help who you fall in love with, and to state that he shouldn't have been with someone younger is ridiculous. Domestic abusers are very manipulative. They study you like you're the last test they take to be able to graduate high school. Alot of them mimic your behavior, likes, the way you dress, etc. It's called love bombing. After that comes unhealthy doses of gaslighting, coercion, and physical abuse. From the outside looking in, it seems like a victim should notice it,  but we don't. It's horrific enough living it, so I'm not gonna blame an abuse victim for being  abused by saying it was because he was allegedly thinking with the wrong head, nor do I blame myself for having a vagina and marrying a manipulative abuser over 20 years ago. He's at the end stages of healing, so he needs all of the support that he can get, not shaming. My advice to you would be to educate yourself about domestic abuse.

He actually fits the profile of a domestic violence survivor to a T, where he was trying to protect her, trying to keep her out of trouble, trying to prevent her career from being ruined, etc bc he at one time genuinely loved her, and that one time probably still had a little bit of love for her. That’s what a lot of domestic violence victims do, it’s why they don’t end up pressing charges when the police get called, they try to protect their abusers, they think they can fix their abuser, they don’t want to be third abuser and keep sticking it out for as long as possible, even when their life is in grave danger.

401,UgyPe04ITDtaO1z9HrV4AaABAg,Simen,"@detchie  All Brian is digging for is the truth and the evidence he is using is very carefully selected and explained. This is not assuming someone did something and is not based on emotional conflict about the case. Now we al have the freedom to decide if that truth is right or wrong. I really dont think Io should do anything because it would make him look bad. If the case was not public, well yes fine he should sue. But when all the evidence is public, well then Io has no case against Brian. 
Io said Johnny was a woman beater (without evidence), Brian is using the information out there to decide if he is right or wrong and that is a freedom of expression in a case that is highly public. Io is defamed, publicly humiliated because of the court evidence and the court videos of Amber and Raquel. IO SHOULD BE SUING HIS FRIENDS NOT BRIAN. Anyhow Io is scared (if he wasn't he would trust that the truth would come out anyhow) and suing Brian would be a waste of time when what she should be doing is telling the truth,.

Also:  couldn't Brian make up a case against Io`s text messages stating "" Io threatened my freedom of expression"", that would just add to the PILE OF DIRT ALLREADY PLACED on Io`s reputation. I mean that game can be played both ways. JUST SAYING....

So yes, abusive individuals are mentally ill and that mental illness probably exacerbates their abusive behavior. My father is abusive and very mentally ill. Any and all the people in my life who have abused me have had major mental health problems. The massive difference between people with mental illness that abuse others and people with mental illness that don't abuse others is the ones who don't abuse others take responsibility for the shit they do and they learn and grow as individuals. The other ones who are abusive are narcissistic pos that blame everyone else for their problems. Cluster B's are a perfect example of this. So I'm giving everyone permission here to call it out for what it is: Yes abusive people are mentally ill! You cannot be a mentally healthy person and also be an abusive and toxic pos because that doesn't make any fucking sense whatsoever! This is how I like to explain it so people can understand... every single person with ASD (autism spectrum disorder) has SPD (sensory processing disorder) but not every person with SPD has ASD. So now let's apply the same logic to this... every abusive person is mentally ill but not every mentally ill person is abusive. That simple. Call it out like it is.

They will ask many questions but you can see the person did not want to give any information. Because it was a lie and this person couldn't think of false information on hand.
