She is a liar and if not proven in court, definitely true by evidence. She is skilled at lying.",Linda Douglass,0,2021-08-15T17:48:42Z

3,UgzO1rHpgFMMgu69ZxB4AaABAg,She is trash.  She has no credibility.  She is a disgrace to women who have gone through domestic violence.  Her lies do a lot of damage to women living with and fighting against violence.,Paul Yao,0,2021-07-13T02:22:57Z
4,UgyXa7y6cnqObiVx3wR4AaABAg,"Hey Celebrity Craze. Love your thumbnails but I think they would be better if they were made using the ""Bevan"" font (easily searched for on Google or free font sites). There's something about that font that makes thumbnails so much more appealing to the eye and grabbing of someone's attention. Try it out.

All the best.",Mister Dongs,1,2021-07-10T04:59:36Z

8,UgwFsnhrnKEWZhSzHR54AaABAg,Your reporting of facts is flawed and clearly shows bias against Mr. Depp. You report news like FOX News fake stories. If you want to keep followers start by reporting the truth and cut out the bait and switch from headlines that never make it to the story. Truth in blogs and stories keep readers coming back not half truths or bias stories.,t m,0,2021-07-07T23:18:35Z

10,UgyN438_bhMEkX65fol4AaABAg,"This is another fake headline from this channel. No one apologized, and they are just making a buck off Johnny Deppâ€™s misery.
Most of itâ€™s so-called news is just repeating old stories and old gossip.",lisa richards,4,2021-07-07T16:52:42Z
11,UgzA_d3-BqOHQNFz5Kl4AaABAg,"This channel is awful, always repeating old news, and getting details wrong.",lisa richards,1,2021-07-07T16:51:34Z
12,UgxgS3XdDjSJuFpFWUh4AaABAg,"How much old news is this channel going to repeat every day?
It is too lazy to research anything new, and just want to fast back.",lisa richards,1,2021-07-07T16:51:04Z
13,Ugx4x72s0TJyVovv7fh4AaABAg,Click bait I missed the part where Elon musk and Jason apologise for defendant AH not to mention everything you said AH said is twisted in her favour as it's been proven she was the one hitting JD and not after suffering any think either and her SDV claim she stole of someone else and used there real life survival story either look up the real facts or stop being biased,Simon Coveney,7,2021-07-07T16:41:59Z

She has not 'felt the full force of our culture's wrath' yet, that is coming in Fairfax.",British Scorpion,0,2021-07-07T15:07:44Z
15,UgzpoBKKF2pMYRf4upB4AaABAg,"I knew this was going to be good when you said ""and et cetera.""  

You might want to look up the meaning of ""et"" before next time.",J T M,1,2021-07-07T13:46:35Z
