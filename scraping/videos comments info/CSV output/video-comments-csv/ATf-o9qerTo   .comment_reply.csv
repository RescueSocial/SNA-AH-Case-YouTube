But the hollywood fame concept is fragmented. its like the end of the Roman empire, but a much more condensed version. I guess it will end when movie mogals move out, and other people not in that business move in - in greater numbers. Rich people still, but youtubers or crypto millionaires, or tech heads. It slowly breaks up the clique. Or if the economy tanks, and the hills become a ghost town.
