27,Ugx6Qpt9IWaXD4f3nPl4AaABAg,Meme Clip Archives,"@TheHighGround The Snyder Cut was already completely shot by 2017. All that was needed was finished VFX and Junkie XL's score. However when Snyder left the project, WB had the idiotic idea to spend ANOTHER 150 million dollars just to bring Joss Whedon in for reshoots. The post credits scene with Joker was the only one Snyder shot extra footage of and even then he was kinda force to because WB's greedy ego can't admit they were wrong. If HBO Max was in charge of everything, the Snyderverse would have been restored the day the Snyder Cut was released. Actually more than that, they won't even interfere or butcher Zack's work because they are not the scumbags they are.

Plus, it was officially confirmed that Wan did seek subtle consultation with Snyder for Aquaman. There's a reason the ""you defeated Steppenwolf"" line made so much sense now after watching the Snyder Cut. There is even a more legit reason why Vulko, Mera and Arthur hid in a sunken ship that is completely bubbled and everything when they discussed finding Atlan's trident in secret before they were interrupted by Orm's forces.",2021-10-05T08:43:52Z,0

*BLOG QUOTE* - Most of this is likely due to the fact that *she beat the crap out of me . She pulled her punches with Christa, but she did not cut the boys any slack.* I snapped a picture at the end of the day.

*BLOG QUOTE* - *And she beat the crap out of me.* By the way. There are men and more than a few ladies who would pay top dollar *to be beat up by Amber Heard. Oh. And she spit on me. Over and over and over.* And you KNOW there are folks who‚Äôd pay for that.
