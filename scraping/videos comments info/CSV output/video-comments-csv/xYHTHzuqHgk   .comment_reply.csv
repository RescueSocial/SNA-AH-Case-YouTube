I personally know and have worked with some construction workers and people who work in landscaping, who are undocumented..... simply because those jobs don't always require background checks and SSN numbers. Do I care if they are undocumented? No. It's just an observation.

I was a nanny for years and my family has been here since 1620. do undocumented immigrants do those kinds of jobs? of course. but that doesn't mean the majority of people with those jobs are undocumented. natural born citizens, legal immigrants, and people with visas also do those jobs",2018-07-06T02:09:20Z,1

Bc, in that instance, he would be the voice of black people since you can't get everyone's opinion. You see, when Kelly Osbourne said an almost similar comment Rosie Perez (Latina) went off on her.

My point is that many Americans (even desperate ones who are strapped for cash) feel they are entitled to well paying jobs. Americans aren‚Äôt fighting each other to be trash collectors.
