She has to be a certain size and shape to fit the Mera role, and she also has to pass a health and fitness test to get insured.
If she put on weight or was unfit, say because of too much red wine, and too many pills, she would fail her insurance fitness test, and that is breaking her contractual obligations. 
Which means WB could fire her without paying her.
If anything its probably AHs PR team that's ""leaking"" the fired for being overweight story, so she can latch onto the outrage generated.

Ben Affleck left the role cause let's face it, aside from his alcoholism and divorce issues, he just pussed out of the project. He was gonna co-write, produce, direct, and star in The Batman, but when he realized how big of a job it was he slowly pussed out of the role. First he left writing and directing positions, and then he totally left the film altogether. Matt Reeves actually is really into the Batman mythos, enough to actually work at the film like it was his passion project. Those fucking BvS fanboys will say that the film got ruined when Affleck left the project, but I'd say the opposite. 
I think a part of my view on Ben Affleck leaving the role has to do with the fact that Affleck is just another rich liberal extreme elite who's actually a horrible person. Look it up.",2021-03-02T00:21:29Z,3

Australia will not bother to extradite someone for those crimes - but Aquaman is filmed at the studios in Gold Coast, Australia. Which means Mera needs to travel to Australia to be filmed. If Amber Heard does that, then not only might she be denied entry to Australia but she might be allowed in and charged with those offenses. Now sometimes border security are lenient in such cases. However, rather than being humble when caught, Amber Heard insulted the Cabinet Minister over it all. The border security officers are independent from politics, but they may be reluctant to be too lenient in such a high profile case where the offender even managed to annoy the Minister. If Australian border security deny her entry to Australia to film Aquaman, then you would think the studio would drop her. 
Before you get too excited, border security try to use an educational approach to bio security rather than be too heavy handed with people. So they would still be reluctant to permanently refuse her entry, I expect.",2021-03-04T21:30:58Z,1
