3,UgxV0DhIKejD8jXhKnN4AaABAg,Nippy 112,@Amanda Ball exactly and they started giving out gabapetin few yrs ago now. This is ment for nerve damage and help with certain issues but they have gave them and the pre gablin out for everything and anything. A cold a spot on your butt its all about money not the patients health. Lining their pockets more like cause its well out of control the damage prescription drugs are doing.,2021-06-02T11:26:35Z,1
4,UgxV0DhIKejD8jXhKnN4AaABAg,Amanda Ball,"@Nippy 112 takes two to three months before you really know if a medication is working for you, but after 2 weeks if the side effects are bad , then it's worth trying something else. I know it isn't easy for people to understand it's not a quick fix magic pill, it takes time for their bodies to accept the medication and hope that it works or back to the drawing board and start over. Just some medication can be lethal and should be taken off the market and others you have to hope your doctor has your health and not his wallet in mind. I have been mostly lucky with that but still been on some crazy stuff for pain. And wouldn't recommend some of it no matter how bad you are. It made me worse. But off those now. It's trail and error because our bodies are all slightly different and don't always react the same to medications.",2021-05-31T13:54:14Z,1

127,UgzRoYdc9CkRAyU4z-F4AaABAg,Natasha Powell,"@Wendy Marcum dude you literally said I'm wrong because you so clued up about all the symptoms of ADHD. Because you have 3 kids with it. 

So what are you even on about 

And when I said you are not an expert it's because you clearly didn't study this at a tertiary institution so you have no right to insinuate your experience is the only experience that's right, that's literally what you were trying to say.

And now I gave you en example with my disease now you all defensive

You confusing the Dr you need to see vs me needing to continue seeing my endocrinologist you need to see the therapist 

you need help, a expert wanna be without anything to back it up, defensive and delusional.

Fyi I'm not in whatever country celebrates that thing.",2021-05-31T16:34:46Z,1
128,UgzRoYdc9CkRAyU4z-F4AaABAg,Wendy Marcum,@Natasha Powell Don't put words in my mouth... Please take your issues up with a therapist. Happy Memorial Day!😊,2021-05-31T15:54:40Z,1
129,UgzRoYdc9CkRAyU4z-F4AaABAg,Natasha Powell,"@Wendy Marcum so now u saying everyone with that disease has to be like your 3 children. 


I had a friend in primary school with this and he was taken to the special classes because he was disruptive because of he's fidgeting the kid was never still and thats what he's diagnosis was 

So I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes in feb this year the only reason how it came out was because I was rushed to hospital with diabetic acid ketosis. So now you going to call me a Liar because I didn't have any symptoms like the other diabetics, I been living with the for 2 to 3 years without knowing because of the damage done according to my Endocrinologist, Because I'm not like the 100 000 or others that had sever or sudden complications I'm lying then.????

Because I'm not dead of covid I'm lying?????? 

You just on another lever of ignorant. 

You are not a specialist because your kids have that disease 

I'm not an expert because I have T1 diabetes",2021-05-31T13:59:36Z,0

Let’s not kid around. Her Born This Way cheek implants? I mean come on.
