Amber Heard sent him to the hospital, framed him of crimes he did not commit, lied about being a victim to join the me-too movement and received positive publicity and support for being a criminal in disguise.

27,Ugy7xTIOuubDBjZuDjR4AaABAg,Jim Coleman,"@cole Bruett 
That can be very easily to be explain to you. You see the word that you use and other people sometimes use is also called a run off.
When a person see a run off sometimes from another person is showing signs of reading and seeing backwards all the time,even in the person mind. For example taken the image of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp together okay.
You see the picture as normal to you. When I see a picture then Johnny Depp is on the Left side of the picture,while Amber Heard is on the Right side of the picture.
In another words that I am like the mirror that shows the opposite of normal view,even in words.

30,UgwrF33ia_eXCsjwIKl4AaABAg,sixtoewolf2,"@Lindsey Depp there is a difference between acting sexist and living in a sexist society

Men are objects valued by their material wealth. Emotions only matter if they're famous like Keanu Reeves.

Women are spoiled children who are loved unconditionally. They want equal pay rights and credit but don't want to put in equal work responsibilities or accountability. 

There are few exceptions of course but so far this is the gold standard",2021-09-17T23:38:08Z,0
