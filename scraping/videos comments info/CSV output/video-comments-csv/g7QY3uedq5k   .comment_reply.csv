I don't consider myself an nationalist but a patriot just like I don't consider myself a feminist but an egalitarian. I personally think that America is the greatest country but I accept that I Canadian might think Canada is the greatest country or a French person might believe France is. Matter of perspective really. But whether or not I like or agree with the president, it shows a disgusting disloyalty to threaten the president's life. He has said a lot of concerning anti-American rhetoric in the past, but even so, nobody deserves what he went through. As someone who has been through an abusive relationship, it's incredible how when your in it, all those horrible events get rationalized in your brain.

Everyone's entitled to their own opinions and I was certainly no fan of President Trump. But he was still our president, and threatening our president even in joke is disgusting.

We're at a place where we have advanced as humans but for some reason we're still following the rules of a previous generation. Especially when it comes to race and gender and everything else for that matter.

 There are laws and rules specifically designed to give rich and more powerful people the advantage and not to turn this into a race problem but.. Anybody considered beneath them are at a disadvantage. Rich powerful people were basically getting away with murder and that was normal and unfortunately it's still normal.

She may never be punished to the same extent that the person who suffered the damage was punished. Johnny Depp lost so much and is still losing so much from her lies. When it's all said and done they're still going to be somebody out there who full-on believes Johnny Depp is a wife beater.

 There's someone out there now still spreading the false information still spreading that he's a horrible person. She'll never experienced having her character questions and disrespected because of something she didn't do. She's nothing but a narcissistic gold digger.",2021-10-05T05:37:33Z,0

You're using something that is completely irrelevant to this current situation. If Melissa took him to court he would've surely been found guilty but she decided not to and even painted him as a good guy when they broke up. She only revealed that he was abusive several months after they broke up but still never took him to court for that.,2021-08-11T03:08:58Z,0

You act like because your a man that your invincible from anything a woman that weighs 100 lbs can do to you. Have you never heard of poisoning a persons food or drink?
