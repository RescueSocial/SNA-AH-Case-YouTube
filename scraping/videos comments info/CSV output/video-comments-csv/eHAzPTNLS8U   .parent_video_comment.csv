13,UgxTs0Vy5lJOQIpV6DR4AaABAg,"She is like this in interviews about EVERY CHARACTER SHE PLAYS. I remember seeing a video of her describing Mera. She literally was incapable of just giving a succinct description of the character or anything that occurs with the character at all! It drove me crazy. I tried to go ahead and watch The Stand, just because I thought I'd see how she is in it. I could not get through the 2nd episode - there was too much Amber in it. I only got through the 1st episode because she isn't in it. lol Or, if she is, she's easy to forget. What a waste of an actual acting career.",TrueBliu Nineleven,0,2021-02-17T04:07:23Z

18,UgyIxKeoxZrJ-ue7eMx4AaABAg,She is thinking so hard because her character in the show is awful and really hard to spin into something else and given situation she doesn't want people to associate what she says about the character to her. Also tries to avoid clips taken out of context for memes and stuff.,Aleksi Suuronen,0,2021-02-02T10:14:11Z
19,UgyzR8r4wrIAtkvROB94AaABAg,"Spoilers. Her character hasn't atleast in 7 episodes I've seen struggled at all if she wants to be on the good or the bad side. If someone is it's Harold and Nadine pushes him over the edge. All the time I watch the show I'm thinking she is just playing herself, the being horrible and all. There is nothing redeeming in her, maybe the kid but it even feels just like a cover for her given how easily she leaves him behind and all we see is her walking with him, no interaction really. Even the parts where she is supposedly being rightseous given the circumstance and for example don't let Harold go to Flagg because it will be agonising death so she gives him agonising death?? What. Then in couple scenes I think there should be conflicted feel to her with Larry but she just looks annoyed at him. She shoots the Harolds friend without even blinking an eye, up until now she has pretty much been after Flagg the most nonredeeming character for what we have seen. Her face after the sex scene with Flagg made me think that maybe now she starts to realize that she has been groomed but the next time we she her she is happy even tho there is a demon baby inside her and she looks like Tim Burton wax figure. The grooming aspect could lower how awful she is but it's left so vague that it feels like she didn,t need much grooming to start killing people and pumping out demon babys. For that there should be much more fragile person on the screen to sell it or show more smart and heavy manipulation. Also wouldn,'t a normal kid be scared if essentially a ghost to her introduces himself by hi I'm going to marry you, that's some bad grooming if she isn't heavily troubled already and don't really need any. Fuck I went forever.. just irritating.",Aleksi Suuronen,0,2021-02-02T10:09:08Z

29,Ugw-YG-jYuNaZjihkTx4AaABAg,"What, she is in the Stand series? I didn’t even get to that point in the serie.
I’ve been a Stephen King fan for some time now, and read The Stand, something like, 20 years ago (I don’t really remember exactly).
But I do remember that I really liked it. Since this series was a Stephen King adaptation, I started watching it but didn’t even finish the first episode. 
I thought it lacked the atmosphere of King’s stories, and didn’t like the acting of some of the characters presented in that episode.
The thought that came to my mind was: it is probably better to read the book again than watch a weak adaptation.",JC Horta,0,2021-01-02T15:33:56Z

How hard can it be to say ""I'm playing this rather bitchy, selfish character, who is out for herself, as a counterpoint to all those good guys around her who self-sacrifice and play together""? Nah, she is trying to make herself sound sophisticated, plus she doesn't want to be critical about herself, not even in a role of a fictitious character.

She didn't hesitate to say that Serena is fucking evil. She didn't try to redeem her in any way. I guess it's because her own personality must be so far from that of her character that she can't identify with her, or at least, with the horrible things she does. But here the Turdmeister is trying to defend a horrible character she played. If she says 'Nadine is awful', she is saying 'I am awful'.

431,UgwYJmP-6-90irq3hI14AaABAg,"I was wondering just how much money Amber has left. Her legal bills must be eye watering, then she has the coterie of 'friends' that she has lying on her behalf (allegedly, do I need to say that, we are still waiting on the verdict of Depp vs. NGN so maybe I do). Those friends most likely are demanding to be kept by Amber in the lifestyle that they think they deserve. The 'entertainment' bill alone must be considerable.
In any case, I was thinking about her bank balance. Not my business but still, and I was wondering about what we can learn from the dresses and handbags and shoes Amber and her little sis wore during the London court case. I don't know that much about high end fashion but I remember thinking what Amber wore seemed to be high end. But Whitney was not so much, I was wondering if Amber cannot afford to dress her little sis in the same way as she dresses herself. And that got me thinking. It could just be that Whitney is dressed expensive but just doesn't look it. Or Amber is too selfish to lend a Birkin to her little sis. Or maybe Amber was stretched to dress just herself. I am a bitch for asking this and I do know that, but I can't help but wonder. Does anyone know what they wore and how much it cost?",Kate Gould,1,2020-10-10T15:55:06Z
