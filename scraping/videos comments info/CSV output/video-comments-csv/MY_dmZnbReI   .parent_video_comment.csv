10,UgyUl-AuGAXmUs5Coud4AaABAg,"OK people.. Let me school you a little:
Amber hearts personal life is of no intrest for any of us.
What she and johnny depp did does not concern any of you. Nobody of you can say anything about that. You are not involved.
So if she fits for zacks vision, then she is his choice for mera. And therefore she will play a good mera.
And I really love emilia clarke. She has been my favourite actress for years. I really think she could join the dceu. But not because some people are butthurt about anything they read in the news.
She would be perfect for a different role. I just say ""new gods"" to stir up something..
And now stop with your hate and let people live their lifes.

As to Emilia Clarke, when you come out of a movie where Arnold Schwarzenegger delivered the best acting skillset, that's pretty telling about her level.

That's the part that shocks me, it's one thing to keep her for future Snyderverse ensemble films that will be planned, but it's something else to push an entire show on her character (which many fans are petitioning for her to be removed from)... that's BOLD. 
And before anyone bring up Johnny Depp... that doesn't matter once HBOMAX entered the conversation.  HBOMAX didn't fire Johnny Depp.  So they have nothing to do with that end of it.",Jax Ry,1,2021-02-28T19:42:35Z

100,UgzKXAyByhqWUovtPwp4AaABAg,"I dunno. Emilia Clark hasn't done anything where I have been impressed by her acting. Allow her to speak in her native dialect so she can focus on the acting and maybe it will be better. I don't have any emotional connection to Heard and Depp, don't care. When it's official ,cool.",alwaysxnever,3,2021-02-28T18:46:09Z
101,Ugw48XRiRigGiUUXfn54AaABAg,"They've been talking about Emilia Clarke replacing Amber Heard for a long, long time. WHAT is so special about Emilia?? Why her specifically?? 

As far as I know, Emilia was simply a fan favorite that simply got a lot of traction on social media. Nothing more.

IF Amber is to be replaced, I can think of a million other actresses that could replace her before I'd ever think of Emilia.

But as far as I've heard on official channels, Amber is still Mera. And she's still Mera in Zack's Justice League too. -OG",Oliver Gutierrez,2,2021-02-28T18:45:31Z
102,UgyAQe3RxZCGtntp7ih4AaABAg,I don't know about this. But sorry man. Amber heard just toooo good to be Mera. I don't care about her problem. But she is perfect Mera.,Naime Shirou,10,2021-02-28T18:45:10Z
103,UgxDiAuedWzllFiAi_V4AaABAg,No way.  I hope so. She's not my cup of tea.  Love Emilia Clark. She's fudging awesome.,David Sherrington,45,2021-02-28T18:44:35Z
104,UgxfLuaPCrU_dxrzSKp4AaABAg,I think it should be true! If Depp got fired so should she. It has also been proven that she has lied and been disingenuous. She has even admitted it publicly. #FireAmberHeard,Shane S. Almond,24,2021-02-28T18:43:41Z

107,UgzYXgwZZCz2RCidArZ4AaABAg,"Deborah Ann Woll would have been a good pick. She looks like Amber Heard and did a very good job in Daredevil. Normally I'm not a big fan of recasts but when a person did something that screwed over innocent people and should have landed her jail time, seeing them in films just take me out of the story and make the whole viewing experience unpleasant.",Perseus Kao,3,2021-02-28T18:41:20Z
108,UgwzbSNBWe4GFGrMxOJ4AaABAg,Hope this is true.. Emilia Clarke has good chemistry with Jason Momoa. Plus the fact they are good friends. Amber Heard deserves everything she gets.,Chris82,47,2021-02-28T18:40:57Z
