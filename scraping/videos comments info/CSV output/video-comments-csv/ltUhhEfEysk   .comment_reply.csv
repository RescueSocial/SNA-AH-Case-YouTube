4,Ugw1rOdhvhlgeuaYuZN4AaABAg,Rock Candy,the first case( in UK )was against NGN (The Sun) and Dan Wootton for publishing an article which called Johnny a Wife-Bea ter and asking why JK Rowling  was still casting him in Fantastic Beasts 3. Amber was the main witness in this case.  this is the case where the 'Judge' Nicol's son actually worked with Dan Wootton and the judge provided a biased verdict against Johnny.   The one is the USA is the main case. it's being held in Virginia  against Amber for defamation since she wrote an op-ed published in the Washington Post saying that she had suffered domestic abuuse and implying it was by Johnny.  It's titled ' i stood up against Se xual Vi0lence and faced our culture's wrath'. This case is for 50 million and is  considered the major case because it is against her - it will be held next year.,2021-07-14T08:32:44Z,1

13,UgxBKW74JV7mkNJkMnp4AaABAg,Fullmetal Gamer,"@Jerry So in other words, you don't believe in justice. You don't like bad people like Amber to take responsibility of her actions which is even more childish. One person can ruin all that ""hardvwork"" for everyone. What part of that don't you get? That's why Amber's recent movie only made $36,000.",2021-07-14T14:39:37Z,2

15,UgxBKW74JV7mkNJkMnp4AaABAg,Jerry,@Fullmetal Gamer first Johnny career isn‚Äôt completely ruined he will come back when he wins all l say is just bc she did something terrible doesn‚Äôt mean you shouldn‚Äôt watch a good movie now stop complaining bc you really don‚Äôt no a thing if you say that l support abuse bc l think ppl hard work shouldn‚Äôt go to wast so stop being childish,2021-07-14T14:28:28Z,1
16,UgxBKW74JV7mkNJkMnp4AaABAg,Fullmetal Gamer,"@Jerry Since Amber ruined Johnny's life, we have every right to have our nose in their business. Since Johnny's career is ruined, so should Amber. You can't have it one way and not the other. Now, I know you support abuse despite you saying otherwise.",2021-07-14T14:00:58Z,2
17,UgxBKW74JV7mkNJkMnp4AaABAg,Jerry,@Fullmetal Gamer so let it play out all l said was at the start was just bc she is a terrible person doesn‚Äôt mean the movie will be bad so stop acting like a child and grow up,2021-07-14T13:55:35Z,1

20,UgzzKRnKJhN4ymQZ3ot4AaABAg,lohkok gitu,@Otr O frio then they should not side with amber. If they decides that siding with her is more beneficial for them then they should be ready for whatever the outcome will be.,2021-07-30T11:59:36Z,1
21,UgzzKRnKJhN4ymQZ3ot4AaABAg,Fullmetal Gamer,"@Otr O frio You know what they say ""life's not fair."" One person can ruin it for everyone. If we do watch the film, then WB is going to continue supporting Ambuser Turd.",2021-07-25T16:31:13Z,2
22,UgzzKRnKJhN4ymQZ3ot4AaABAg,Otr O frio,"@Fullmetal Gamer no, they should be in jail and amber too but if we don‚Äôt watch the film the other actors will be afected too, not just amber that‚Äôs why i said that would be unfair with the other actors",2021-07-25T15:50:59Z,1
23,UgzzKRnKJhN4ymQZ3ot4AaABAg,Fullmetal Gamer,"@Otr O frio So, do you think Bill Cosby shouldn't be in jail because he's a good comedian? Do you think Jared Fogle shouldn't be behind bars because he's a good spokesman for Subway?",2021-07-25T08:58:21Z,2
24,UgzzKRnKJhN4ymQZ3ot4AaABAg,Otr O frio,@Fullmetal Gamer but dude we need to separate the art from the painter the film has nothing to do with this law fight so i think it‚Äôs just unfair for the other actors from the film,2021-07-25T06:49:02Z,1
