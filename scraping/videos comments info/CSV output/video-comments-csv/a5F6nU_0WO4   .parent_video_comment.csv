4,UgxEL9mjZmNabF0BYA94AaABAg,"I always have supported Amber since the day all this situation, and only the misoginist males and Dumpf supporters can support an vile and evil male like Johnny Depp. Now they all starting to wake up and realise Amber is innocent.  Even Netflix knows that Amber is not guilty and cancel all Johnny Depp films from their platform (the news here https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.thegeekbuzz.com/the-basement/johnny-depp-titles-removed-from-netflix/&ved=0ahUKEwji65u6jfPtAhUMC-wKHc55DIoQxfQBCEYwBA&usg=AOvVaw0VF2oqeVETiBlfi1qdVRjh). The fact is that the Depp supporters are so scared of this woman, also because she support LGBT rights, woman's rights and feminist rights, and also because she is strong and powerful. I will support her till the day i die and i will watch every movie that is going to make even if is boring to watch!",Unicorn Vic,3,2020-12-29T11:42:24Z
5,UgwUW5BGebUhp11Qkfl4AaABAg,"I sort of rarely follow the Depp/ Heard news, but I’m here for Benoist. The thing I find scary is that there’s a legion of incels and MAGAs fully on board with their self-serving agenda to hate women/ not believing female victims and support male abusers ( Heather Morris, example) like Blake Jenner for practically blinding Melissa. And again,  I don’t know what the Depp/ Heard story is but I presume it’s the same; men and women supporting this hateful bigoted ideology that majority of women are the abusers to further their agenda. Don’t get me wrong,  They support men whom are abused, then it’s great, I support it, but do they support women that are abused too and believe them? Absolutely not, because they say: “ women are mostly domestic abusers to  men”  (which is false) and make all sorts of over the top falsehoods that demonized women. I hope women will continue to fight for injustice and bias. Yes, women can abuse too but majority it’s likely men That are the perpetrators.",Kay GEe,10,2020-12-05T06:26:40Z

7,UgykOHlk16dwtetauyt4AaABAg,"#SaveLives #911 - For years, Amber Heard – Mera in Aquaman, a Human Rights Champion for the United Nations, humanitarian, and Women’s Rights Ambassador to the ACLU – has been harassed, cyber abused, threatened, and faced hate online for speaking out against abuse in society.

What people don’t know is that Amber data-collected the abuse against her with technology before 911 systems could collect real-time data from applications.

Read the article: 
Amber Heard’s Story of Cyber Abuse Inspires Change to Public Safety to Save Lives - https://www.truehollywoodtalk.com/amber-heards-story-cyberabuse-inspires-change-public-safety-save-lives/

911 cannot even locate with data to know where a caller is or use text info (https://SaveMeNowApp.es). 

She did this before the European #Innovation Council and Swedish govt supported creating a cell phone application (BrightAct) that was founded during COVID-19 to streamline services, reporting, and Data-Collecting for Domestic Abuse victims. 

Amber Heard took photos, texts, recordings, and evidence using her cell phone before it was culturally accepted.

Most women will never make backups of their texts, or store years of photos and recordings, not until culture has changed.

Society is not only not-victim-centered to tell women to protect themselves; it isn’t proactive to tell us to help victims.

We need to do more to improve and save lives.",Motivator Network,5,2020-10-30T04:09:07Z
8,UgxUDrriXfgQye5pa0Z4AaABAg,"Oct 23, 2020: Victory for Amber - Opposition lawyer Adam Waldman was removed from the 2nd case Virginia, USA by the Judge.
This is long overdue with how Waldman threatened witnesses and utilizes social media that, as proven, is biased to approve of male public figures over female figures - allowing women's exploited images, verifying women less, threatening female reporters and politicians more often, and allowing hateful imposter accounts of women to be created.

""Heard had moved for sanctions against the Washington attorney last month, contending that the press leaks happened “on at least two occasions.”

She said Waldman was responsible for disseminating audio recordings, surveillance pictures and declarations from third-party witnesses to websites and Twitter users, “leading readers and potential jurors to believe that these declarations are somehow official case documents, which they are not.”

White, who is chief judge of the 19th Circuit, agreed Friday to revoke Waldman’s pro hac vice status. Despite finding that ethical standards were violated, the judge declined to issue a gag order against Waldman.""
