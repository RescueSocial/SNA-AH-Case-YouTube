0,Ugxug7GUTp-0HQg2_X14AaABAg,Xiao-Fury: The Channel,"And what you said would make for a far better story. An ingrate adopted child who is bitter for many reasons (I dunno, make her part of an alien race who actually despises Tamarians, or her planet got destroyed which is why she fell into emo/goth depression?)

Obviously jealous of Starfire (which Tamaki clearly is), Mandy gives her adopted mother a hard way to go. She joins with Blackfire who manipulates her to make matters worse, but then Mandy realizes that Starfire isn't the enemy or evil like Blackfire. Insert Mandy's alien powers to help defeat Blackfire as she rejoins with Starfire followed by an apology.

And then they become friends. The end.
