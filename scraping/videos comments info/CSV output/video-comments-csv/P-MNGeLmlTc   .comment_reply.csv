35,Ugw2iRa5y2KR-3rR4_54AaABAg,Shifting Mercury,"@Riana DeMaio Yet the makeup artist testified that she had injuries and she covered the, before she went on James Corden. We also know from the metadata that the photos were taken when she said they were and that they were unaltered. As for the photos of her without injuries, the dates were all messed up. I don‚Äôt know why you think she would walk around without makeup on showing her bruises anyway. She only did that when she went to file the restraining order. Up until then, she had hidden everything. Its possible she didn‚Äôt actually have bruised ribs but was sore in her rib area. She may have been overly dramatic in that moment but the photos, texts, witnesses, recordings all point to her being violent on two occasions and Johnny being violent on many more. It‚Äôs not about picking sides. It‚Äôs about interpreting the evidence. While everybody‚Äôs so busy defending Johnny against these allegations, nobody is really showing any concern for Johnny‚Äôs recovery or mental health. It‚Äôs more important that he be innocent so he can fulfill his role as movie star it seems. Even if it means he can‚Äôt seek help and focus on himself and his recovery because he must focus on his ex wife and legal battles which keep him trapped in a place of anger and resentment. He should be in rehab. Not court. None of this will lead to any good outcome. I just hope he finds the strength to save himself before it‚Äôs too late.",2021-07-13T13:43:09Z,0

46,Ugw7EnPgy6JIDqd19EB4AaABAg,Shifting Mercury,"@Emily Morton She might‚Äôve drank a little too much sometimes and got high with Johnny on a handful of occasions but Johnny is the hardcore addict and alcoholic of the two of them. You think it‚Äôs a competition?  I‚Äôm not judging him for being an addict. Im saying it is difficult to be in a relationship with an addict. I don‚Äôt know how any Johnny Depp fan can be unaware of his struggles with addiction. He‚Äôs been very open about it over the years. He had a lot of time clean and sober and during this time, his life was a lot more stable. It seems like many of them don‚Äôt seem to care. A lot of you seem to like the idea of Johnny Depp as this sensitive bad boy movie star but don‚Äôt really seem interested in the actual man and all that has struggled with and been through. It‚Äôs an insult to ignore everything he has dealt with and pretend that all his problems stem from one relationship. It‚Äôs an insult to pretend that Johnny sees himself as some sort of traumatized victim of Amber. He doesn‚Äôt. He‚Äôs trying to defend himself against accusations because the society in which we live in is only sympathetic to who they see as the victim. If they don‚Äôt like what someone says, alot of times they will just deny that they a victim and pretend the accused is. Just depends on who is accused and how popular and likable they are. You could be incredible powerful like Harvey Weinstein but not really all that likable and so it‚Äôs easy for people to believe his victims. But if you‚Äôre the most beloved actor of our time, you‚Äôre going to have a lot of people who will jump alot of hoops for you just to defend you against any accusations. It also depends on the actual allegations and if there are many potential victims. But then again,  look at Donald Trump. He got to be president and he had a ton of sexual abuse allegations against him. Yet half of the US population just dismissed them and made their lives hell. Democrats accepted his guilt because they didn‚Äôt like him anyway. Johnny is a better person than both Trump and Weinstein but he can be crazy when he‚Äôs angry and intoxicated. He needs help. It doesn‚Äôt mean you have to hate the guy just because you condemn his actions. I haven‚Äôt seen anyone else say they believe he‚Äôs guilty and actually show concern for the man. People are complicated. They can be decent people for the most part and still do bad things. There isn‚Äôt anything more human than that.",2021-07-19T05:45:27Z,0
