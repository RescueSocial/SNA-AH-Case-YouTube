19,UgwvZGdK9ykPVW003Th4AaABAg,Robert Thompson,"If i remember this correctly, i think she was the one that brought the tapes as evidence in her favor. Imagine, her most favorable evidence was so bad the judge had to exclude it against every logical sense that could possibly apply.

This is a witch-hunt kind of prosecution and it's hilariously tragic for much more than just 1 person or even 1 judicial system alone, this event has shaken the trust, hope and voice of truth of millions men and women who we wish could speak up and get their rights in place. Imagine hearing of a case going like this for people of these fame and wealth proportions, backed by highly professional expensive lawyers and expert advisors, imagine the regular everyday people's chances.

Oh, so i don't forget to mention... He was ""fired"" because of all this, his career was essentially destroyed and his economic situation has been set on fire and is burning down as i write this, even after everything turning back to his favor after more truth has been LISTENED to. But meanwhile, she gets caught lying, cheating the system, faking evidence, faking circumstances, faking her alibi, forcing and pushing people to falsely testify in her favor and on top of all, officially lying under oath giving false statement... But gets to not only keep her job but still gets all of the defense and protection anyone could get in that place if they were the victims... Which would be great, if she wasn't caught doing all that and on everyone's eyes, proven to be the abuser.

I have strong feelings towards domestic violence and i would have to admit they must have always been biased towards the ""women are almost exclusively the victims"" but no, this one has hit me by surprise, this was a huge disappointment and the case's trial just topped that up by an order of magnitude for me.",2020-12-09T08:35:15Z,11

However, it was against the Sun. All the Sun defence team had to prove was there was at least one instance of violent behaviour from Dep, which they did (11 of 13). Even if the judge had a Bias, and i suspect he did have a gender bias, it would only have overturned some instances of those 11. Hence why the Appeal is unlikely to succeed.",2020-11-25T23:40:01Z,0

69,Ugxce8t_KyzDI9c94_l4AaABAg,Ally Gator Animator,"@Light House Psychology  It's a shame too, as their core goal is wonderful (protecting women and children from violence isn't something I think anybody would or should contest), but tone deaf statements like that end up implying that men must always be somehow responsible. You know, the kind of people that others use to mock feminism but real feminists actually hate.

It's not even really a Metoo issue, either (at least not what metoo stands for). It's not unusual for movements and charities to focus on specific groups and doing that doesn't necessarily dismiss that others suffer too, it simply draws attention to specific examples that have impacted certain people. Things go to pot when you get people who are either so passionate about protecting one group that they turn on others/dismiss other possibilities, or people who falsely assume ""this charity for this specific group has more attention, therefore its cause is more common.""

People will always have bias from their own experiences, but that should never stop us from thinking critically.",2020-11-07T17:37:59Z,1

""Again he mentioned instances of supposed violence""

Wrong. The judge said this violence did happen. That's why Depp lost this court case.

""not instances of violence due to intoxication like you were trying to sell.""

The witnesses said multiple times that Depp was intoxicated. Here's a selection of them.

""The Claimant was getting drunk and high on drugs and was angry that Ms Heard had hung up a painting given to her by someone she had formerly dated.""

""On 21 April 2016 Ms Heard had a birthday celebration with friends at the  couple‚Äôs  property  at  849  South  Broadway,  Los  Angeles  (‚Äúthe  South Broadway apartment‚Äù). The Claimant arrived, drunk and high on drugs.""

""He was drunk and high. Ms Heard was present together with Elizabeth Marz, Raquel Rose Pennington and Ms Pennington‚Äôs fianc√© Joshua Drew who were in neighbouring penthouse apartments in the same building at the time of the Claimant‚Äôs arrival.""

""As had happened previously when Mr Depp became drunk and high on illegal drugs, he insulted Ms Heard and screamed obscenities at her.""

https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/QB/2020/2911.pdf

You should try looking at reality instead of repeating claims that I have repeatedly debunked.


""This means that he did not see it""

He heard it, thus he was present.

""Once again, the recording I provided is NOT IO tillet speaking.""

And I suppose the police just failed to note down what number they were called from because if the evidence showed IO Tillet was calling this would destroy your entire claim.

""You can't prove it wasn't Amber""

Well except for the witnesses who said it was Depp. And the fact that Depp had a history of going on rampages when drunk/high. And that Amber was sober. 

It's almost like you're ignoring all the evidence so you can pretend it wasn't Depp.

""she used to do this with Tasya van ree (ex-wife) too.""

Citation needed.

""And this podcast aired recently which was quite interesting""

And the reason that Depp didn't have this guy act as a witness for him is what exactly? Could it be because his claims wouldn't stand up in court?

""Amber admits in the recordings she was the one getting physical and I'm being retarded?""

Yes because you failed to understand that these recordings weren't allowed in court because Depp was manipulating her.

""Are you just going to keep ignoring those tapes?""

They're worthless as they can't explain why Depp attacked Amber on 12 different occasions.

""Because LLoyd is female?""

You said they were a man. Here's your actual quote:

""He couldn't have seen any of the actual violence.""

Funny how you tried to back-peddle after I pointed out how little you knew about this case.


""Made another timed google search and that picture did not show up on the internet""

This means nothing as it's possible to take a picture and not upload it to the Internet, so you're still wrong about the date.


""This article talks about the TRO where Amber said she was conforting him""

No it doesn't, the closest is this part:

""Pennington had been at the couple's home last Saturday May 21, along with friends Elizabeth Marz and Joshua Drew, when Depp came home 'drunk and high' at around 7.15 pm, according to The Daily Beast. 

""The group then left as Heard tried to comfort Depp over the passing of his mother the day before.""

It's unclear who from this group said Amber was trying to comfort Depp but given the previous quotes in this article it seems to have been Pennington, not Amber.

""There were more instances where she talked about it but this one suffices""

This image doesn't prove anything as it's not Amber making this statement. It doesn't even say what Depp did immediately.

""Reminder this is ""I was conforting about his mums death him then he became violent"" vs ""He didn't talk about his mum's death at all""""

What is your point? It's possible for Amber to try and comfort Depp even if Depp didn't want to talk about this issue. Also if Depp immediately attacked Amber when he got in then Pennington would have seen this attack. Thus there had to have been a period of time between Depp arriving, Pennington and the others leaving, and Amber being attacked during which time Amber could have tried to comfort Depp.

""I have read most of the evidence put forward by both parties and was following the trial live.""

""‚ÄúTillet was present for some of this abuse‚Äù False""

Literally on the phone with Amber when Depp attacked her.

""‚Äú[IO tillet] called the police because the abuse was so bad.‚Äù False""

You provided a recording of this.

""He doesn't deny that she was violent.""

Then you should have no problem finding a quote where the judge says Amber was violent.

""Amber LITERALLY admits on tape to""

A tape that the judge rejected because Depp was trying to manipulate Amber.

""You didn't even know about half the instances I've told you about""

Well most of them had nothing to do with this trial.

""what facts have you got other than 'hurr durr Deppp admitted to have an addiction to drugs'""

Other than all the damage done by Depp when he was high on drugs. I suppose you think the apartments magically damaged themselves.

""Do you think he can't glance at the floor to see what has hit him, look back at her to engage with her?""

Again how would this let Depp know who thew the can at him? Especially since there were multiple people behind him.

""Well smirking during tapes that recount abuse is traumatic for victims of domestic violence""

Just one problem; in that tape she wasn't her recounting being abused by Depp. Perhaps you should have watched it.

""""Also you omitted that Depp attacked Amber and her sister first"" Of course. Because he didn't.""

Now you're just being retarded.

""I made a timed Google Search from 27th of May to 29th 2016, and found the original daily mail news post ""arrived at the office at around 3.30pm on Saturday"" Saturday is the 28th of May.""

Which means that the photo was taken before the 28th of May but doesn't prove which day, month, or year it was taken.

""""I was comforting him about his mother's death before he turned violent"", when in the recent court case, she said ""he didn't even come to talk to me about his mothers death"".""

So a phone call where Tillet says that Amber is being physically assaulted by Depp.

""the caller sounds like a doormat""

And this means the abuse isn't real because ...

""B the caller says ""I'm downstairs"", which IO tillet was not.""

And you know where IO tillet was in their own house how?

""IO tillet did not make this 911 call""

Source needed. Especially since it's easy to determine where a call came from as 911 records the number of the caller.

""Btw AH's friends also changed the locks to all the penthouses the day after this happened because ""we don't want your properties Johnny"" ...  (‚ïØ¬∞‚ñ°¬∞)‚ïØÔ∏µ ‚îª‚îÅ‚îª""

Well Depp did trash these penthouses because he was high and drunk.

""In other words she painted that bruise on her face that narc.""

Wow several photos with no evidence showing when they were taken. That proves literally nothing, which is why this claim didn't work in court because they checked the metadata of these images for the dates.

https://theblast.com/c/johnny-depp-amber-heard-text-messages-parents-eviction-lawyers-fault

Wow some cherrypicked text messages that could have been sent at any time. This proves nothing, which is why they didn't work in court.

""Is it really that hard to connect the dots?""

Only for you. First you claim that Tillet didn't make the 911 call, then you talk about how they wrote an article about this call.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVL4Bn3uLxs

Oh no she's smiling. That somehow means Depp didn't assault her.

""JD is suing Amber for libel about an article where she doesn't mention him""

What? Amber isn't the one being sued. I guess you didn't read the judgment.

""First off JD does say that Amber attacked him.""

Citation needed for all 12 incidents.

""Johnny's whole case was that Amber was the abusive one""

Which utterly failed because she wasn't the one who kept taking alcohol/cocaine and losing control.

""Jennifer was contacted after Whitney Heard's declaration in court that she was sleeping in her floor""

Didn't she own a bed?

""How the hell did you expect them to know before she said it?""

Which incident are you referring to?

""the throwing of things, such as a Red Bull, a TV remote, or something, and other things that hit me in the head and in the back, thrown by Ms. Heard""""

How did he see who threw something at the back of his head?

Also you omitted that Depp attacked Amber and her sister first, and that Depp's security guards didn't mention anyone throwing things at Depp.

""v)However, Ms Lloyd makes no mention of Mr Depp being struck on the back by a can of Red Bull. Either this did not happen, or the force of the blow was so minimal that it was not worth Ms Lloyd referring to it. Either way it is of no consequence.""

It's pretty hard to unintentionally headbutt someone.

""I am way more inclined to believe Depp over Heard because Heard has been caught in multiple lies.""

""Which the judge didn't believe.""

The judge literally said that he believed that Depp had been drinking, doing cocaine, and lost control again. That's why Depp lost this case.

""The same judge whose son works for a sister company of The Sun, owned by the very same Rupert Murdoch.""

So what. These sister companies employ thousands of people in the UK and there was no evidence this influenced the judge in any way.

""That alone is enough for him to recuse himself""

Not under UK law.

""He should have never been in a position to rule on it""

Your opinion is not a fact. The law said he could rule on it.

""Yes he was only inclined to believe what Amber Heard and her friends said.""

Evidently because it seemed more reliable.

""Throwing out testimony of several ex employees, police, doctors, psychologists, audio, video, receipts""

All of whom were mentioned in his judgment and some of whom sided with Amber.

""As if they had no vested interest in the outcome of that trial.""

They didn't since whether the Sun won or lost they wouldn't gain/lose anything.

""That was literally a travesty""

Your opinion is not a fact. 

""I just hope you keep that same energy once the trial in Virginia is totally concluded.""

It won't be difficult given that Depp doesn't have any excuses for the 12 incidents of domestic abuse.

""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQFFm_X2lps One of several videos of Heard's deposition being review by a body language expert""

Got one where the questions are one of the 12 incidents of Depp abusing her, not some random incident. You know something relevant to the 12 domestic abuse claims that Depp needs to disprove if he wants to appeal this case.

""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWpLoq8teMU One of several videos of Depp's deposition""

What did the body language expert say about Depp's body language?

""What evidence?""

You know those things that the judge used to find Depp committed 12 incidents of domestic abuse.

""There a lot of lawyers, some of whom believed Heard initially, who were viewing this case from an unbiased perspective that would LOVE to see this previously unheard of evidence.""

You're really deluded if you believe that. The judge sided with Amber because there was more evidence supporting her claims than Depp's.""

Yes, the same judge ruling on a case against The Sun.  The same judge whose son works for a sister company of The Sun, owned by the very same Rupert Murdoch.  https://www.sausageroll.com.au/lifestyle/celebrities/exposed-the-sun-libel-trial-judges-son-works-for-rupert-murdoch/ Huge conflict of interest.

He should have never been in a position to rule on it so forgive me if I disregard the conclusions he came to, particularly when they seemed to be shockingly biased.

""Another thing the judge didn't believe""

Yes he was only inclined to believe what Amber Heard and her friends said.  Throwing out testimony of several ex employees, police, doctors, psychologists, audio, video, receipts etc, etc, etc because all that supported Johnny Depp and there's NO WAY Amber Heard and her friends would lie.  As if they had no vested interest in the outcome of that trial.  That was literally a travesty but hey, if you want to go with ""cus judge say"" that's fine.

Is there any proof of that?

""How many people have you head-butted?""

Two but I have done a lot worse than that in my life.  Have you not done anything worse than head-butt someone?  If not, you are almost surely one in ten million, maybe a hundred million.

""Who cares.""

The CHLA, Depp, Depp's legal team, several families would at least be interested as that money would help and in the interest of justice in general.  It's kind of a big deal.

""Why was this an obligation?""

Because she pledged to.  It was also used a a defense by Heard's legal team to prove she wasn't a gold digger.

""A deposition is a written statement.""

Incorrect.  A deposition is USUALLY a written statement.  However, it can be recorded.  This isn't unusual in cases that involve a lot of money, like the case against The Sun.

""Because the evidence shows Depp attacked her 12 times.""

What evidence?  There a lot of lawyers, some of whom believed Heard initially, who were viewing this case from an unbiased perspective that would LOVE to see this previously unheard of evidence.  They're seeing nothing but statements from Heard and her friends so some hard evidence would go a long way towards swaying them (back) to Heard's side.",2020-11-22T20:17:38Z,1

Since you seem so absorbed in this case, you should use your time listening to the recordings and reading the transcriptions of the trial, so that you may actually be able to make useful arguments in the future. A basic knowledge of human anatomy and psychology would help too.

""I can see that if your viewing information for confirmation bias.""

What is this meant to mean?

""There was a recording where Depp said he headbutt Heard's forehead.""

And Amber said Depp hit her in the nose.

""In that recording, Heard was admitted being the aggressor.""

Source needed.

""Johnny said there can be no violence""

Except for the head-butt, which according to you Depp admitted to.

""Johnny's account was, and has remained, Heard attacked him.""

And the judge disagreed as Depp had been drinking, doing cocaine, and lost control again.

""He never once admitted to intentionally headbutting her.""

Which the judge didn't believe.

""It's an opinion that goes against a mountain of evidence on Johnny's side (and none to support Amber) but you are entitled to it.""

You're really deluded if you believe that. The judge sided with Amber because there was more evidence supporting her claims than Depp's.

""The only thing he admitted to was playfully kicking her in the ass.""

Another thing the judge didn't believe,

""If you want to cancel him for that""

And the other 10 incidents of domestic abuse you forgot to mention.

""just cancel everyone since I'm psure we have all done worse than that.""

How many people have you head-butted?

""Why do you think Heard petitioned to have CHLA records removed from the proceedings in Virginia in 2021?""

Who cares.

""If you donated your settlement like you said you would, and were obligated to""

Why was this an obligation?

""Why petition to keep Jennifer Houston away from the stand when your side had a subpoena with her name on it?""

Source needed.

""Why is Heard's mother shown to support Johnny even after the divorce?""

Source needed.

""Why did Heard's father say he still loves Johnny like a son or brother after the headbutt incident you were referring to?""

Because Depp texted him saying it would never happen again. Also Heard didn't tell him about most of the abuse.

""Why did Amber change her story countless times?""

Source needed.

""Why have several body language experts state she is lying in her deposition?""

A deposition is a written statement.

""Why did the cops say they saw no sign of abuse when they visited the two after being called?""

They were there less than 15 mins and encouraged Amber to make a complaint against Depp.

""Honestly how can you possibly believe Amber Heard when everything points to her being a narcissistic, manipulative, pathological lying sociopath?""

Because the evidence shows Depp attacked her 12 times.",2020-11-22T18:25:04Z,0

Edit:- 
Came across this in the comments section earlier. 
In 2016 a journalist wrote an article for The Sun newspaper (yes the same one in Johnny Depp's case). He was reporting on a case in which he suspected Judge Nicol of some form of bribery or foul play. This was in regards to a gagging order that he'd issued in the naming of the accused who's case he was presiding over. 
The judgment he made on this case was highly questionable.

His numerous connections to Amber Heard have also come to light.

Even if breaking bottles on surfaces while holding them it would be very very unlikely to have this injury to just ONE finger and slice all the way through a tip. As you're holding a bottle by the neck when breaking it, it wouldn't break in a spot to injure your finger and also would affect more fingers and the hand if it did. They never said he cut it picking up glass or slamming his hand in glass which would be more appropriate. Which by the way, she never said he did it that way with the bottles either anyway. That is the story he and his people told at the time to keep her out of the news, as victims often cover for their abuser. She continually has said he cut it on a plastic landline phone that seems from all photos and accounts was never actually smashed. Not to mention unless you're karate chopping it, couldn't happen if you threw it. Also, even karate chopping wouldn't shatter it to have it cut you. It would be a broken bone or blunt injury.

Sure none of us are in a position to say who is innocent and who isn't but a lot of people, including myself, have lost hours researching this case over the months. 
When people just start slinging insults and supposing to know the inner workings of her mind I don't agree either. The reason she's getting that flack is because she genuinely has come off as manipulative and a liar and really very little of her evidence supports her. AH's own deposition, testimony, her witnesses testimony and quite a lot of her own evidence ended up working against her by supporting Johnny instead.  Inconsistencies in her stories, straight purgery, almost all of her evidence being hearsay (and again inconsistent hearsay) even though she started recording depp in private years prior to this case but she still had no hard evidence. In fact one reason people are calling her crazy is because of her deposition, her responses to her own recordings of convos between her and depp are strange. A lot of tics. Chuckling and smiling at bad times when discussing dv. Saying she swears she never hit him while a recording of her own voice she submitted confirms she did and she seems like she's disassociating from the audio. Awkward behavior could be a lot of things but yeah tbf. The vast vast majority of evidence only solidified Johnny's potential innocence more and more as it came out. Corroborated stories well over 10 witnesses who come from all walks of life, Ambers own witnesses ending up aiding Johnny more than Amber. Amber not being able to keep a story straight to save her life. Her own sisters testimony working against her. Her two best friends couldn't keep their stories straight about a couple of alleged instances they were involved with. One of them even claimed to be their during one incident, said person (Io Tillet) was proven to be on the other side of the country at the date of said incident. Not to mention the slew of staff, medical staff and security JD and AH SHARED over the years that all corroborated JD's side. Or the actual multiple women that had no connection to Johnny that said Amber had no visible injuries, including a dv officer, a nurse, a stylist. Not to mention the times unaffiliated cops were involved and saw nothing on AH. I could go on.
So thinking AH is crazy.. well yeah it started to feel like that. 
It felt like any sane person would have given up. Based off of the supplied evidence it's not even just that JD should have won (tho his lawyer did excellent and should have won) it's that it's amazing that Amber isn't getting slapped with perjury. That she even had a hope of winning. Ik the video may seem biased based on your views but did you watch it? This might just seem like one side hating on another but honestly after watching this all unfold and seeing just about nothing that confirms at alllllll JD's committed acts of dv, how well his information held up whenever the case was specifically focused on an instance of accused dv and how poorly Ambers side did almost the whole time no truly fair or equal Judge would have made these rulings. Even if they had wanted to the only thing amber has close to real evidence is hearsay, i'm not kidding, and thats hearsay from someone that couldn't remember from one second to the next they outright admitted to dv.

229,Ugx01IkzIXpUjtU2sAl4AaABAg,Steven LeBlanc,"Is it possible Johnny Depp hit her on certain occasions?  Sure.  Did Amber Heard and her team prove this?  Not even close.  If anything all of the hard evidence is on Johnny's side.  The naivety rests on the shoulders of anyone who believes Amber because she is a woman.  Getting drunk and high doesn't automatically make you violent.  Where are the other people who felt the wrath of ""The Monster"" if this was the case?  Is it not suspicious to see a lack of other individual accounts after an initial and extremely public accusation and subsequent trial?  IE: Epstein/Winstead.  When these men, and I use that term loosely, dealt with one accusation a tidal wave followed.  Is it not suspicious that such is not the case with Depp seeing as how his alcohol and drug use is nothing new?

I find it likely if Depp did lay hands on her, at any point, it was most likely in self defense.  Literally everything that came out during the course of this ""trial"" made Amber look bad, moreso than Johnny.  People who were on Amber's side flipped in droves.  SJW's abandoned her.  It's a mountain of evidence and suspicious behavior versus someone who is obviously manipulative at best and seems to be a compulsive and inscrutable liar when it suits her.

The fact that she repeated a rape story of someone else is a conspiracy theory? It's you who's grasping at straws, pretending these things aren't real. 'Anyone with a brain'... she says. Millions of people support Johnny, because they have a brain. Anyone who defends Amber does not have much in the way of brain or logic. The judge didn't see through anything. He acknowledged Johnny's evidence was strong, but assumed (it's just an opinion) that Amber wouldn't lie under oath. Based on what he assumed that when we have many instances of her provably lying, is a mystery. I would like for you to explain to me why she allowed a video published by TMZ to tell the world that Johnny beat her at the end of that video, when he walked away and left the room.

The reason that an appeal process exists is because judges can be completely wrong. Did you read the judge's reasoning? Even his reasoning written out in the verdict basically screams 'my reasoning is shitty!' It was pretty much, yeah, Johnny has good evidence, and yeah she talks about how she abused him on tape, but hey, the tape is irrelevant, as are the testimonies of all these professionals like doctors, cops, therapists, nurses, and her former assistant, etc. because Amber said under oath she didn't do it, so.... she must have not done it. Cause people never lie under oath. Why then do cops secretly tape people to catch people in the act, to have them verbally confess to wrongdoing, that is later featured in courts? How is that irrelevant? It's never been irrelevant in the history of courts! That's the most incompetent 'reasoning', if we can even grace it with that much credit as to apply the word 'reasoning' to it. If you can just reply on a defendant's word, a defendant no less whose testimony was inconsistent and contradicted itself numerous times, why bother even having witnesses? All the impartial witnesses corroborated his version, the only people who corroborated hers were her two shady best friends who helped orchestrate this, and her sister, who seems afraid of her.¬†One also has to wonder why the judge blocked the discovery of the metadata on her May 2016 photos. Crucial information. That in itself is quiet suspect. 
We know Amber lies. Here are three examples. She knowingly sent a video to TMZ that made it look like when it was cut off that he was beating her. Even if we say it was TMZ that cut off the end, she allowed the world to think that video ended with his beating her. She allowed it. Without challenging it. She was lying to the whole world about him. That's a huge lie, man!!! That is as low as it gets, not to mention filming him in such a difficult moment, when he found out he lost so much money and was upset. What kind of person does that? Would you do that to someone you loved?
Second example, she lied to the Australian authorities about the dogs. Third example, her former assistant says she stole her rape story, which is amazingly despicable and low. This person lies like she breathes as per numerous people. But... she said this and that under oath so it must be true, according to Judge Nicol. That is the most incompetent and careless approach to law imaginable. He wasn't basing anything on the evidence presented, just her word under oath. If you listen to lawyers dissect this verdict, they're bewildered how a judge could consider a person's recorded confessions irrelevant. The judge was given three (at least three) provable examples of her lying (big lies! lying to federal authorities?), and he still figured she's someone who would tell the truth under oath.

282,Ugzu_Sjfy87XbWa7ceF4AaABAg,Danielle Burchette,"@Shifting Mercury this is an excellent point. While I don't agree, yes I do think his addiction wasn't helping him during his marriage. Sadly being addicted to drugs, and alcohol, takes us to a low and lonely place. But where's A.H.'s responsibility in this? As his wife, who profusely swears she loved him to the end, she stated his addictions to be a major reason for their troubles. And for his behavior. Where was she? Did she quit drinking? Did she quit using? No she didn't. Instead she took pictures of him at his lowest points,( not as a tool to show him he needed to change, but to post on social media.) She kept on with the party lifestyle, all while holding him to a higher standard. I've seen some awful things, I've been in her shoes. And while my husband struggled with his own issues there, I've never done these things. When he quit, I quit. Though since I wasn't a drinker( my dad was an alcoholic all thru my childhood, so I made that choice while I was young), or drug user, beyond smoking a hooter on occasion, I stood by him while he fought to stay clean. We passed our 27th anniversary this last September and he's still clean and sober. I don't think that he beat on her. She had all these specific episodes of abuse, all these times that he slapped her around,  controlled her life. Yet there is little to no actual proof. She says, he dragged her thru glass, leaving damage enough to scar her feet. Okay, so where's the doctors report? This event happened the same weekend that she supposedly threw a vodka bottle at him and cut off the top of his finger. So he ends up in the hospital, where she followed him to. Do you really think that a hospital full of doctors and nurses are going to ignore her needs if she's injured that badly? Feet are alot like your hands. They have their own set of prints, unique to the person they're on. This is why hospitals take a print at birth. A paper cut, on the hand will heal and disappear within a few months,but injuries like the ones she claims? They're the type to alter your footprint forever. To deep to heal and just go away. Glass is not a forgiving medium. I know from experience. I have scars from when I was in high school, learning how to make stained glass windows. Im 48, just last week. I sucked at this lol, hence the scars.  They were both bad partners, and just toxic. But in truth, she wrecked her own self, by thinking she's allowed to play the ( I'm a victim) card. When she stole the abuse story of another woman who had to strive to reclaim her life. A.H. had delusions of being this huge hollywood star, when in truth, she's a decent actress, but even if she had lived happy ever after with J.D. she just isn't memorable enough to reach that level. That's not picking on her, that's just truth. She had every chance and she chose to make the drama, and to accuse someone well loved, and known, of a crime that screwed him out of a job he loved. So who's the victim? It's not just a he said/ she said issue. They both lost. It's the reasons behind those losses that should count. A person can lie, cheat, and steal, and never get caught, but the universe knows, and you eventually get what you've earned. One of life's many truths. üòâ",2020-11-13T08:43:28Z,1
