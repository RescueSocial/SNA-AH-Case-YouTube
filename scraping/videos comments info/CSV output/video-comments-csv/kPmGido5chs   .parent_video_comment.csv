105,UgyCetuthMHmgyB9hsd4AaABAg,"Strangely, only now I've noticed a major flaw between Justice Leage (both versions) and Aquaman movie. In JL, Mera said her parents died in the wars, and Atlanna took her in. However, in Aquaman, her father, King Nereus, is perfectly alive and well. 

Maybe, the connection wasn't that perfect anyway. In JL, it seemed like Arthur had a grudge against Atlanna for leaving their family but in Aquaman it looks like he loved her a great deal and instead held grudge against Atlanteans for ""killing"" her.",Dima Udalow,78,2021-03-25T02:30:40Z
