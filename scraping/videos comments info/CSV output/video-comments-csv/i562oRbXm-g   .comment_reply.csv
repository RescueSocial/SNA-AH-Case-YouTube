I've been experiencing very painful side effects from the surgery, and my surgeon wants to see what's going on. The painful electric shocks are off the charts and I'm not allowed to drive again until it's resolved. ‚òπ‚òπ‚òπ",2021-02-21T04:21:00Z,0

2,UgwrzlBk3nfn1BlTnHx4AaABAg,Danielle Burchette,"100% correct! She's responsible for any loss of career or reputation she's had. She lied from the start, and is thinking that everyone will just believe her because "" I'm a victim"". Like that means we have to agree? Uhhh..... Nope. Let's see the proof honey. üëÅÔ∏èüëÅÔ∏è",2021-02-24T10:24:37Z,0
3,UgycCNYKKL6m4TzGldN4AaABAg,OVODJAS,"@Doctor Soup not really a rumor because it's entirely fan speculated. the Forbes article is old and Emilia Clarke was never interviewed for it. they just reported about her selling her home. on top of that the article itself states that it's their own ""opinion"". now i, as someone who does work in this industry has not heard anything nor has any credible insider heard anything, its all baseless. it's the same for the Emilia Clarke as Zatanna ""rumor"", its not real. if there was any credence to it it would come from Variety or Entertainment weekly, those are the Warner Mouthpieces.

now another big tell is that Emilia Clarke herself in 2019/2020 stated multiple times in interviews that she's effectively ""done"" with working in big budget or any franchise work. she's openly said she wants to focus on passion projects, indie and charity work.

now could it happen? of course. will it? nope.",2021-02-20T23:53:02Z,4
