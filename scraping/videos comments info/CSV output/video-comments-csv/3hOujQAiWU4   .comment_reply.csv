5,UgzWkAEZ86TxCWcuUPh4AaABAg,Rock Candy,i'm suspicious about this story of him riping the pages out.  he probably made a joke about doing that and she now runs with it - every media opportunity she has.  Because book lovers get angry or frustrated when they hear he ripped pages out - she ends up looking the 'better' person and a victim.,2021-04-27T09:23:53Z,0
