JD is Borderline. The very toxic self-destructive type. 
I feel for the guy.

1,UgyvYIXaRfRJZx6lTe14AaABAg,"I think they were both toxic yesss. I don‚Äôt like when people put Johnny on this god like pedestal‚Ä¶like he‚Äôs an angle or something. Cause that‚Äôs not true. But it is complicated because lots of his behavior can be explained in a way. Like him leaving during a fight‚Ä¶if I‚Äôm getting hit I‚Äôm leaving too. But that doesn‚Äôt mean he could of left in a healthier way. I‚Äôm positive‚Ä¶although I technically don‚Äôt know for sure..but I think he said mean stuff to her and did toxic things. It was a bad relationship. They were equally bad for each other. BUT that being said‚Ä¶I think people tend to look into this case a little bit and take the easy explanation and say ‚Äúthey were both abusive‚Äù. Not true. Trust me that‚Äôs what I thought to‚Ä¶but it‚Äôs not that simple. It is possible for a man to be the victim without also being abusive. I‚Äôve done‚Ä¶probably to much research on this case and after YEARS of research. Johnny was not abusive. There‚Äôs not much more to say. There is no evidence he ever was. I could sit here and type ever reason why he wasn‚Äôt abusive‚Ä¶but that would take forever lol. If anyone has arguments or questions I‚Äôll answer but unless amber give fool proof evidence I won‚Äôt believe her. And yes amber abused him.

OK SO to wrap things up‚Ä¶they were both toxic‚Ä¶but they weren‚Äôt both abusive.",Rose Margie,0,2021-09-17T14:32:16Z
2,Ugx0LWNO-v5tld_jwtt4AaABAg,Um‚Ä¶I do get there can be some things wrong with dating older guys but‚Ä¶that doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean it was all bad or Johnny was trying to manipulate them. I think Johnny and Kate were a lot more toxic tho. But Johnny was just as fucked up for years after being with Winona. Doesn‚Äôt mean she was a bad person. I just think they were in love. Right person wrong time she was too young and he was to young especially for them to get married. Idk and Kate has always done drugs‚Ä¶so has Johnny. That‚Äôs just them lol.,Rose Margie,0,2021-09-17T13:48:09Z

8,Ugx5h3stGuS60TFXJeB4AaABAg,"I know I'm a little late to this camp, but I've read the draft trial document ruled by Judge Nicol for the Johnny Depp vs The Sun case, and I suggest everyone read it too so as to get a balanced viewpoint instead of listening to rumors from those who are already biased for Johnny Depp. He is the abuser! All the text messages that he sent to the people around him were quoted in verbatim, and it shows a very disordered personality. The language he used, the complete mood swing from loving her and calling her his savior from his drug addiction to saying that he will burn and drown her and fuck her dead corpse. Also, the amount of boot-licking and enabling from the people around him, especially his staff, is just revolting. Amber, not sure if she's exactly innocent in this, shows a more stable personality through the messages that she sent to her sister, mother and she even wrote diary entries to herself talking about Johnny Depp. In the end, 12 out of 14 incidents where he attacked her were ruled by the judge to have occurred and the evidence presented was overwhelming, so it's appalling that everyone is calling Johnny Depp the victim here.",Ha Phuong Pham,1,2021-05-22T09:55:26Z

75,Ugxpnlk01CSapHxhbzJ4AaABAg,"I respectfully disagree with the stance that ""they are both terrible people."" If you listen to the evidence and all the witnesses, including former partners of Depp, it looks like Heard was the abuser. There are accounts of him locking himself in a bathroom to get away from her when she was assaulting him. Also she threw a vodka bottle at him in one altercation which severed his finger tip.  As far as Depp's past relationships, they all speak highly of him. He doesn't have any issues with abusing former partners, but Heard did. 

Apparently Depp's mother had some mental health issues and he had to be an adult at a young age. People tend to repeat patterns from childhood. So some of his past partners may have had issues, but not because of him. Toxic people (especially narcissists) are drawn to empaths. Is he a perfect person? No. He had substance abuse issues, which is also common for people who had traumatic childhoods. They try to self-medicate. Someone else suggested Dr. Ramani. She is a clinical psychologist who specializes in narcissism.

If drinking and doing drugs is a reason people suck, then 99.9 percentage of people would ""suck."" Johnny never laid a finger on a woman; in fact, in the audio recordings, Amber gets mad at him for not ""fighting for her."" She, on the other hand, can't even keep her stories straight: ""Yes, I threw things, but only in self-defense, and I am not admitting to throwing things."" ""Yes, I hit him, but he was passing out.""

Finding  love in other, non-romantic, places, as you suggest, makes you stronger.  And once you're stronger, the love bombing isn't as intoxicating. If you've got your posse riding out with you, you can be picky about who to add to your group. Unfortunately, sometimes that means that you don't have a romantic love in your life, but being strategic as you suggest gives me hope that I can finally get to a romantic relationship free of mockery, emotional and sexual violence (and so often violence is masked as passion, it's really sick) that is constant, supportive and dynamic.

You will not be able to know evil, until you meet a narcissist. I used to think everyone had good intentions as I do, but no. Once you see the evil, you will not be able to unseen it. When you date a narcissist you think you have found your soul mate, but as the cracks begin to open and the mask falls you discover that in fact you met a copy and distortion of yourself. Your feelings were real but the narcissist‚Äôs feelings were not. The never loved you and the never will. We met online, he flew from other continent to see me after talking for few days. I tho it was too good to be true, and it was. He told me everything I wanted to hear: ‚Äúyou are amazing‚Äù, ‚Äúyou are valuable‚Äù, ‚Äúyou are worthy‚Äù, he love bombed to then gaslight me, call me crazy, make me things I was crazy and wrong. After he did run out of supply, he discarded me. He kicked me out at 3 am from his apartment with all my things on the middle of the street. I applied no contact and he tried to come back again several times but I refused. He would start love bombing me again. As revenge, he put pictures of us on his Instagram saying we are a couple.

If you are going to be lazy on digging more info to support your opinion of ""they're both abusive"" and your assumption that Johnny ""manipulated"" Winona and Kate and ""traumatized"" them without really knowing them personally let alone talk about what trauma they have, I think it's best NOT TO TALK ABOUT THE ISSUE AT ALL. Remember this is an ongoing case. A lot of people can be misled by your interpretation of the little information you chose for your convenience.  
Also, talking about trauma...if you are going to talk about how OLD MEN traumatize younger women because they aren't in the same ""life arena"" (see...I watch your channel religiously and can also call on your BS.), you should also look at yourself and how YOU potentially traumatized the younger boys you like to go after. And yes, I can back this all up with several of your published videos admitting to it and even saying it's your goal in life to get yourself a younger guy. Remember, your old video literally throwing yourself at a teenager while interviewing him is still circulating in the internet. Yes, I did my homework on Johnny VS Amber case because it's important that we deal with facts, not opinion before making videos like this that embellish the truth (whether knowingly or unknowingly) and empowers real abusers like Amber.  
I am well aware that as a woman you don't want to talk about another woman who was abusive and based on piling court evidence, had willingly and purposefully broken laws, and had no qualms to lie to get what she wants.  I get you are all about ""empowering women"" and I loved how you build women up. But in honor of the truth, integrity, and just basic human decency I challenge you to read more of the court documents about the Johnny VS Amber case.  Don't just rely on your opinion and assumptions before actually getting all the facts.

Naturally my father being the most successful pilot in aviation in the US, breaking ground breaking records in flight, only allowed for even more justified gaslighting when I questioned his severe abuse. I have never been shown true love by either of my parents. But people with money and success don‚Äôt fit typical abuse molds. People think you have to be poor, alcoholics, drug addicts, and degenerates in order to be abusive. Little do people know the most abuse occurs behind the white picket fence made out of pearls. So much you can hide behind that fence. No one will expect abuse in such a falsified glory of living (house, Cars, assets, success, etc). So essentially for this I was gaslighted by everyone else too. What do you mean your parents abuse you? You live in a mansion, they drive nice cars, have extremely expensive hobbies, travel to nice places, and have extremely respectable and successful careers. YOU must be the ungrateful one to call your parents abusive. They give you literally everything. But that‚Äôs just it. By giving me literally everything in the physical and material sense I was successfully gaslighted when I questioned their mental and emotional abuse in the form of abandonment, aggressive narcissism, constant degradation, belittlement, irrational reprimanding/nagging, and gaslighting to the highest degree. No one believed me. Not even CPS when I was a child. They looked too ‚Äúgood‚Äù on the outside and on paper. How could they possibly be fucked up right?

Both women were messed up before Johnny and have obviously not made any uplifting strides since then. Just as men are not allowed to blame women in areas they lack, women are also not allowed. All parties are adults with their own autonomy and, as such, are responsible for their own lives.

Even a private investigator went on record saying he couldn't find a single person who thought Johnny was a bad guy. Amber brought the devil out of him in that relationship I'm sure, but it is because SHE is twisted and toxic.

258,UgxGNrkeF6d4Jrp8L3h4AaABAg,"Yeah they both have problems but I noticed you deviating from the facts too much the minute you opened your mouth to say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to get into who chopped off who‚Äôs finger, or who pooped in who‚Äôs bed.‚Äù Your attempting to diminish the probable arguments made from Johnny‚Äôs side intentionally trying to level the field by simply moving the goal post to oh they‚Äôre just both wrong. Your within like the first two minutes trying to soften the blow delivered to Amber because despite knowing she‚Äôs more at fault than Depp, and there is nothing wrong in saying so despite the toxicity that came from both, because it isn‚Äôt likely the same or to the same degree. Your doing so because she just so happens to be a woman. 

I knew within mere moments of you actually discussing this subject you had an ulterior motive to push a narrative that doesn‚Äôt quite line up well enough to be conducive with reality. You a little before 4:35 said you will never talk about women lying about forms of abuse on this channel, and that you‚Äôll never say that it‚Äôs common place for women to lie about abuse EVER. Complete and utter crapola spewing from your mouth, is about as toxic as Heard‚Äôs feminist rhetoric and I ain‚Äôt even 5:00 minutes into this damn video.

I‚Äôve known 3 men who weren‚Äôt perfect guys, one better than the others, yet still not the worst people ever, whom were falsely accused of varying forms of abuse by women, whom those women then later came out and admitted it never happened or at least not in the way they had said, minimizing their own role as the main aggressor, and sometimes the ONLY true aggressor. And while you can plug your sexual talk advertisement mess in the beginning on what to do to please a man, yet you‚Äôll push a narrative that effectively removes men‚Äôs voice as people. Loads of men are lied on, and even have any somewhat bad deeds they did exaggerate to smear them.

And some professionals say when it comes to domestic violence, men are more likely to never report it. But if you asked the women who are spoiled by society to be abhorrent like Amber, they‚Äôd lie too and act like they never beat on men they were with, and never lied on a man at all. I can only stomach a total of probably 10 minutes of this video and finish the rest in parts because though I‚Äôm judging harshly for the first few minutes in, a lot of what I heard here sounds like some bs rationalization going on a little. 

The only thing I can agree with this far is yes they both were toxic to one another, Johnny tried to act like Amber controlling his meds was out of spite, because he obviously wanted control of something, but she was reportedly only following the orders of a medical professional to administer the meds at only certain times. There is nothing wrong though in clarifying  specific details to find the degree in which someone is wrong. However, not discussing the real reality of many women behaving badly by lying is wholly negligent. I believe there are many of them, all claims should be taken with a grain of salt. Especially given the rise of female narcissist in the U.S. alone.",LpsGlamourGirl 298,65,2020-07-19T22:31:43Z

At that point the gloves were off and shit really got crazy when she started suing people and he started losing deals. His ego couldn't take the bad press, even though his annoying fans easily took his side and defended him all day. Once he lost enough money between that and his substance abuse problems, he decided to sue her and now...as well they should...they both look insane.

They don't build you up, they tear you down - you cope as you can, it's incredibly destructive & confusing.
That's Depp: he was with an abuser & it's hard to keep your own way under those circumstances....it's a downward spiral.

315,UgxSm-aKLN_ZbP60lNV4AaABAg,"My former ‚Äúbest friend‚Äù definitely falls into the aggressive narcissistic/ dark triad category. She was a master of the silent treatment, victim mentality everything that you‚Äôre talking about. She once told me that her ‚Äú roll in life, is to be a hurricane and destroy as many lives as possible‚Äù because ‚Äú if they fall apart and rebuild themselves  I (she) created a better person out of them and they should thank me (her). If they can‚Äôt rebuild then I‚Äôve (she) shown them just how worthless they really are and the world should thank me (her)‚Äù. I removed myself from the relationship four years ago, two months ago she contacted my dad out of nowhere just to tell him that ‚Äúshe found someone else to take care of her‚Äù. I told my therapist that, that one sentence says everything I need to know about what our relationship was, my roll in it and how she saw me, and how she sees herself. At this point I try not to give her free rent in my head, but after fifteen years of trauma and mental abuse I still have to do mental inventory when I get triggered. Honestly though EMDR therapy has been the most helpful course of therapy for me in dealing with her abuse.",Sarah,80,2020-07-19T21:13:16Z
