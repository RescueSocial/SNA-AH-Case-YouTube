11,UgxhjWXIagj-pfN53Ld4AaABAg,Jeremy Van Weyenbergh,"@Yeah Okay You clearly didn't read my entire comments: it is not about the evidence you HAVE seen SO FAR, it's about the ENTIRETY of the evidence and the financial motives of these sources. Also, 'body language' is not evidence, it's pseudo-science used to prove exactly what you want and nothing more or less. Your interpretation of somebody's body movements is inherently not objective and therefore not an accurate representation of their relationship. Again, even though Johnny could seem to be totally innocent  (just like everyone thought he was guilty in the beginnening), that's merely based on the evidence that has been carefuly selected and leaked by their own legal teams. You can't take information provided to you by biasses sources and claim to know the facts of a situation you never witnessed. ""Fans"" don't create a new version reality just because they have a fondness for the accused.",2021-03-29T20:58:48Z,0
12,UgxhjWXIagj-pfN53Ld4AaABAg,Yeah Okay,"I don't know how anyone can look at all the evidence we have available and still think people are mindlessly supporting Depp. And clearly courts can't be trusted since the last judge just disregarded Depps actual evidence and just took Amber at her word, and then it turned out that the judge was close with Heards friends. You just have to look at videos of them together and have a basic understanding of body language to see that she is a very manipulative person. People are siding with Depp because from everything we've seen so far it clearly points to her being the main instigator and abuser unless you're being willfully naive",2021-03-29T02:07:46Z,0
13,UgxhjWXIagj-pfN53Ld4AaABAg,Jeremy Van Weyenbergh,"This also goes for many other news outlets. For instance, CNN is owned by WarnerBros which owns the Aquaman franchise Amber stars in. If you compare the media coverage of WarnerBros versus Disney-related media, you will (not surprisingly) see a VERY different version of these events. These movie franchises are worth hundreds of millions dollars and these large companies won't want to lose the money they have invested, so don't just believe everything you hear/read.",2021-03-28T23:08:20Z,1
14,UgxhjWXIagj-pfN53Ld4AaABAg,Jeremy Van Weyenbergh,"These high profile celebrities are both envolved in enormous contracts for big movie franchises. Those publishers often own other smaller media companies such as news outlets and therefore have a very big impact on the narrative that is being told. For instance, Clevver News is owned by Hearst media, a publishing conglomerate that has many enormous financial partherships with the Walt Disney Company, which owns the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise Johnny is known for. Please be mindful of these types of financial connections before taking every single news publication about a high-profile court case like this as fact.",2021-03-28T22:54:41Z,1

She even states that she threw pots and pans at him. There is a video of her sister talking to friends after Amber beat her up, and the sister had purses on her body. Even Amber's parents had apologized to Johnny by text and told him that they love him and what their daughter is doing is wrong and that she is lying because she is afraid she might end up homeless. The text were leaked look them up and see for yourself. Also, Amber had been arrested before because for abusing and beating her girlfriend in late 2010s.

I just don't blindly believe things that posted on YouTube‚Äã & spreading misinformation about who is the abuser and who is the victim and their personal chemistry between the two of them because how scary that there can be a lot of fake things or spreading fake rumours that could destroy someone's life. In this IT world, everyone can do anything since the technologies are super advanced. Anyway I'm sure both sides have been wrong to each other plus I'm too tired of seeing their personal news on YouTube since 2016 and up until now. I'm just a fan of loving their movies or the characters that they played but I'm not that interested their personal life problems for such a long period of time while I'm struggling with my life so as everyone and no time to put their problems in my head.

This entire thing started as a hoax by Amber to extort more money in the divorce settlement.  Amber painted herself as the victim, and the audios publicly available demonstrate that she is very much the aggressor in this relationship and not the helpless victim she portrays herself as.  I can assure you, since I'm on Twitter following this case and have seen for myself, that most people who are supporting Johnny here are NOT his fans but DV survivors themselves. After hearing those audios, they KNOW who was the victim, and it's not Amber.  There is a YouTube channel called Incredibly Average which breaks down this absolute hoax.  What's not FAIR in this situation is that Depp lost roles on her allegations, which have since been dismissed by a judge who heard her restraining order application, as they are absolute garbage.  Meanwhile, Amber Heard keeps her roles, despite all the evidence to the contrary.  She may well have fans of her role as Mera, but she is an absolutely garbage human being who beat up her former (female) partner, as well as her sister, and Johnny Depp.  Please catch up.

You seem to be avoiding answering the statements about heards abuse. You keep bringing up ‚Äú Oh Johnny has a drug problem‚Äù yes maybe he does but does he deserve to be abused because of that? No he does not, no one deserves to be abused just because of a drug problem.

187,UgwPFvNFOsFwbOUvhnx4AaABAg,TS Xtina,@Tanya G that is a flat out LIE. Disney did NOT rehire him. They said they would CONSIDER. It's not a fact honey. And you all are the ones who act like you know them. What a hypocrite. Like I said your FAKE outrage is not progressive or help in any way. Until YOU publicly pay for YOUR questionable past behavior you don't get to call for someone else to do so. You all act like AH is the worst thing to ever happen and like JD is a literal saint. As if a drug addict alcoholic who losses all their money is not capable of making terrible decisions or as if they are in control of their actions all the time. It's it's a bunch of hypocrisy.,2021-03-26T19:20:56Z,0
