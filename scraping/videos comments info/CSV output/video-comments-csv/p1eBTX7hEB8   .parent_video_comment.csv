3,UgwydCpuFXQAMcMzGLR4AaABAg,"A caracter doesn't meant to represent all th√® mental illness and neather all the persons with that illness. For me this is as to say that a actor that portrait a caracter with a story, a personality and a illness for example epilepsia is offending all th√® people with neurological problems as  parkinson, corea, Lewis corps illness etc....
It doesn't make any sens to me.
Of cours if you don't show the arc that bring humanity to the caracter, personality, etc you will have just symptomes but this is not the fault of the actor, who did a realistic portrait with the few mat√©rial that he had.The ignorance about the subject is offensive. Thinking that that reality doesn't exist is offensive, cause it exists, I ve seen alot in my job. and can be worst than that. Troubled behaviour, cognitive degradation , sexual deshinibition etc are part of the symptomes of that illness.",B. T.,1,2021-03-31T06:57:22Z

10,UgyDsUy-2spirvPXghZ4AaABAg,"You're not being fair.  First, you are just hating on Heard because it's fashionable - she's no worse than any of the other actors, and better than some.  And Miller is the worst, but he did not ruin The Stand.  The Stand was trash as soon as the script was approved.  Then the director made it worse.  There's very little that an actor can do when the source material is this bad.  And even a great director is limited by the story, and this was not a great director.

Say what you will about Ezra‚Äôs acting and other facets of their life, but to say that they‚Äôve never dealt with serious mental illness is just plain WRONG. Ezra has personally dealt with sexual abuse as a child and suicidal ideation stemming from the trauma of that abuse for most of their life. They also have adhd and anyone who has it or knows a person with it can tell you that it is not the easiest disorder to deal with. They may not be a schizophrenic person or someone who has worked with those that are but they have mental health struggles of their own that they deal with on a daily basis. Funny how you chose to skip over that or fail to research it in general.

Sounds like you‚Äôre just upset that they aren‚Äôt following the original story to a T and you‚Äôre just shitting on everything about it because of it.",Gambarizing,1,2021-01-29T16:45:14Z

I don't know why Ezra Miller is given acting jobs anyway, but shouldn't someone have directed him to do a better job?  Additionally, shouldn't you be required to read the book that did movie you're doing is based on? What kind of actor wouldn't as part of the research that they're doing to play the role?

181,Ugz2RD3kXu5gcYXqEex4AaABAg,You forgot someone...Goldberg was the worst choice out of the horrible cast. How do you fuck up The Stand? CBS is notorious for the worst programming on Major Network TV. Did Stephen King actually approve of this version? It's fucking so bad I dropped out after episode 3. Infact I couldn't even finish the 3rd episode. Heard was awful as well and looks terrible and has signs of extreme stress on her face. It's a disaster. They definitely ruined any chance of a cinematic adaptation which is what The Stand really needs or a seriously done mini series on the same kind of budget & caliber of HBO series where it could pass for a long film instead of TV series. If you are a fan of the ABC version from the 90's (which had it's flaws but in all honesty was done extremely well considering the limitations) don't watch this adaptation. It's beyond horrible.

From what I hear, the actor playing the deaf person has done a good enough job for his performance to be passable (not sure if its good as I haven't seen the show but as there are no complaints about his performance other than him not being deaf then it must be at least decent).

To GUARANTEE that the millions of dollars spent on productions are not wasted, it is the job of the producers and directors to find the BEST talent they can to make the best product they can (to appeal to audiences). Just because a character may have a disability does NOT mean you need a disabled person to portray them. That goes for gay, trans, mentally ill, etc. An actor is someone who is hired to portray a certain character, and I for one am sick of all these advocacy groups telling actors they should not be playing a role with a disability, versus another person who has a disability. If these advocacy groups are that adamant about hiring practices, they can invest their own money in these projects and see how far it takes them. If the public wants to see/ support their casting choices, their project will make money.
