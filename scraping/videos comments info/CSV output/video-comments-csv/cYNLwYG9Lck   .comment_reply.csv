I do not look at the in movie characters the same to real life. I agree with u guys as bre larson and amber r mean and dumb and alot more but I do not judge them like that when I watch them act. because they r not them. example bre larson I don't judge her in the movie because we are watching captain marvel. not bre Larson. but it is what it is. enjoy what u want to and enjoy life. no sense in debating we both have different opinions on it. so if that's how u feel then that's fine but I feel differently,2020-05-11T19:46:42Z,0

It makes sense to fire her so they can have the upmost success of getting the most amount of money.
