3,Ugz9hLguLoH3-5T0vGR4AaABAg,"This woman scammed sick children by not donating to the Children's Hospital of L.A, she abused Johnny by hitting him and slicing his finger off with a broken  vodka bottle, projecting her own abuse that she did to Johnny(meaning everything she is accusing Johnny of, she was doing herself!), OH and she lied with audio and video proof that she was a victim of domestic violence....The part that is most infuriating is the fact that she is using REAL victims as a shield now making it even harder for real victims to come forward since AH has no problem lying about it. Women will be doubted even more because of her horrific actions. I really hope she gets thrown into jail and stays there. What a monster with a pretty mask.

It is dangerously reductive and not ultimately true. You don't have to be a fan of either or to be upset by a woman taking advantage of a movement meant to help actually survivors of domestic abuse. I have been in an abusive relationship, abusive in every sense of the word, and all she had done is give validity to those who interrogate and attack those who dare come forward. She had done a LOT of damage for the world of domestic abuse survivors and THAT is why people are, appropriately, angry. Not because she said something bad about a mob of Johnny Depp fans.

Choosing to step away or go get some air is not the behavior of an abusive husband.  Listen to their phone conversations they're on YouTube.   Disney and Hollywood must believe her.  But they forget there's domestic violence against husbands as well.
In the calls he's calm, he listens and he doesn't interrupt her.  Never raises his voice to her.  Yes he's an actor. And sure he was aware of the recording. But his demeanor is docile.  He does stand up for himself but in a reasonable normal manner.  His behavior is not that of a abuser.  Her's oh honey girlfriend has major issues.

48,Ugy8HwF7F_hBzuy6vsR4AaABAg,"This new feminist woke culture is trash. Lynch mobs of ppl demanding male accused loose EVERYTHING with zero evidence, meanwhile when the genders are reversed that same woke mobs like ""Shut up! Men still suck! You all have more privilege than us"". Riiiiight, when a women gets caught lying about rape or violence the prosecutor just drops charges while ths male almost does 15 to 30 years over a lie. 
When a wife divorces her husband she AUTOMATICALLY gets the kids, the vehicles, the house, not only child support and allomony money but HALF OF HIS BANK ACCOUNT (Thats not fair. Why doesn't the male get half of her account? Or the house, cars, n kids).
When a man cheats [Feminist be like]: PIGS!!! All men want is sex.
When a woman cheat [Feminist be like]: He should've given her more attention and love. Clearly she's the victim here poor thing. She's wants attention and to be loved by him and he neglected her (which is such bullsh*t. I've watched a friend deal with this situation. Him always telling me ""idk what to do.. I tried everything bro. She always makes excuses to not have sex, when try to hug and or kiss her she pushes me away, and she always cancels our dates"".. only for months later when she's caught she's like ""You weren't there for me. You wouldn't give me the love I needed. This is on you, not me"").
Men have to face their crimes or judgement wither they're guilty or not...
Women don't have Accountablity or Responsibility..
When they are in trouble or in the hot seat if they're not deflecting everything on a man, they're like ""sorry but.. mental health issues... social unfairness issues... husband not giving me attention issues..."" and 101 more excuses. Why even say sorry if you're not sorry.. you can say sorry cus society is saying you have to but when you start throwing in excuses after the appology effectively what you're actually saying is:
I'm only saying sorry cus you're all making me.. I'm not sorry.. I'm not wrong and HERE IS WHY: Excuses Excuses Excuses...
Thats not accountability or responsibility.. own your own actions and stop blaming everything else. They always take all the credit when they do good things... never ""yes it was me.. i did that awesome thing you all love BUT... (Its because of the male privilege arguments I've been making resently that gave me the opportunity to do what I did...) or (because of me taking my medication since I have mental health issues of depression that I even was able to do that thing you love. Yay medication the true hero)... NOPE... They own it.. when they do good its all ME ME ME ME I DID IT IM GREAT...
When they fail its: sorry BUT: YOU, THIS, THAT, IT, HOW, WHAT, WHEN, WHERE, YOOOOOU... I'm not wrong, but sorry if thats what you wanna hear, goodnight.",Russell LeBlanc,0,2020-06-16T19:06:00Z

But when shown with a pile of proof in favor of heard being the actually actual abuser, she doesn't get affected at all , she is even shown as a role model by L'Oréal Paris and gets to keep her one in a lifetime roles in the DC movie Aquaman.

They have enough celeb endorsements & spokespeople that they didn't need to choose her. PLENTY others who aren't embroiled in this level of a controversy. I'm not even expecting them to speak out against amber or fire her -- maybe they don't want to judge the situation until the full trial comes to a conclusion. Which is good, I wish Disney did that w Depp. But to actively promote, when they have the option of just staying silent about her, is them purposely trying to provoke and give the middle finger to naysayers.

They're telling us loud and clear: *WE DON'T CARE WHAT EVIDENCE HAS BEEN BROUGHT AGAINST AMBER. WE DON'T CARE THAT SHE ADMITTED TO BEING ABUSIVE. YOU GUYS DON'T LIKE IT, DEAL WITH IT!

Also, there is usually a power shot where all the famous faces are sitting around laughing and smiling at each other, that one has been missing.

I was very angry at first, but then I thought about the commercial. The other actresses had long glamour shots and she didn’t. I think it was a test. Probably, her team contacted L’Oreal legal and strong armed this production line.

This is a woman that used a platform of abuse to stand on. 
 This is also a woman that is guilty of committing abuse both verbal and physical, in her own words,  yet she is being put in our faces as a humanitarian, a woman of ‘inner beauty’. 
 That’s a absolute slap for true victims of abuse. Man or woman. 
 This woman is a fame seeking narcissist that will use any situation to advance herself.
