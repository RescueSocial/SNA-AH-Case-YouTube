3,UgzhR8UpFNiyxRuoF4V4AaABAg,"It's not complicated at all: Johnny Depp got with Amber, didn't know she was an abuser, he got abused by her, and she as most narcissists accused him of abuse and tried to play the victim card. And most of society fell for it, after all, the way society thinks is ""Only men can ever be abusers..."". But, Mr. Depp then came out with absolute evidence that showed he is innocent, and that she is the abuser. Ever since then I refuse to see any movie with Amber in it.

8,UgwXbxC5Zav5QHdOqox4AaABAg,"Keep in mind, FOUR (4) cops saw her that day and no one saw anything on her face, just the redness of her crying. They had NO IDEA that they had arrived at Johnny Depp's house until much later. Plus there is the bodycam video from the 2nd set of officers showing a perfectly neat penthouse. Amber Turd and friends claimed that Johnny had swung a magnum wine bottle all over the place, destroying everything in his path.... that the first set of cops saw the mess. Cops said not true. The 2nd set caught it on their bodycams and there's nothing out of place. Not a single thing. Turd's friends claim they had cleaned up the glass by the time the 2nd set of cops showed up, but they had said they had left everything else how it was... well it's funny how not a thing is out of place. There's no wine all over the place. 
Turd & her friends staged the scene after the 2nd set of cops left. That's when Johnny's friend Baruch, who lived in one of the penthouses, arrived and saw wine in the hallway & thought Turd & her friends were having another wild party.",karismatica55,1,2021-10-19T19:27:19Z

23,Ugw4HmQNMH47tSKbGAh4AaABAg,"I think it is likely that Depp may have got aggressive with Heard during some moments(maybe yelled at her, or thrown some things around her -- not at her). It definitely seems like she would egg him on if he was emotional and/or under the influence.. Depp isn't a perfect human being either, and a lot of men will abuse other men easily -- but not women(not an excuse for any of his behaviour). She definitely manipulated him and used his addiction to suit her narrative.

I'm also pretty sure Depp has a history with addiction and alcohol abuse and his previous relationships have said he never laid a hand on them in an abusive way...so even if he has a substance abuse issue, people don't usually become woman beaters over night...and he needs help, AA and therapy.",Emily Canfield,0,2021-08-27T01:42:33Z

25,UgzWsE5eJETgIE4LKAJ4AaABAg,"when substances are constantly involved and both people have poor self control, you‚Äôre going to have some back and forth abuse or dysfunction. abused people aren‚Äôt all totally passive, some go on to be abusers, sometimes in a back and forth immediate relationship dynamic instead of the more often discussed ‚Äúfuture‚Äù abuser role. when someone you love who says they love you too crosses that boundary it can be confusing. It also can set a new horrific precedent for what is acceptable treatment when angered if you‚Äôre poor at coping yourself. and you may feel you ‚Äúdeserve‚Äù each other. it can be a loop of back and forth abuse until one either expires or gets tired of it. I hope they each learn from this and that everyone is OK, but unfortunately the media coverage has stirred up a lot of obnoxious discussions of disbelieving the victim, men‚Äôs rights panic, and stereotyping victims as always passive, and a black and white opinion of such.",hankypanda,0,2021-08-23T06:48:39Z

Hell, even *without* any substances involved, it is an incredibly common abuse tactic to push and needle (esp with statements/actions that sound innocuous to the outside observer, but that both the abused and the abuser know are not) until the abused snaps and loses control, allowing the abuser to paint them as the bad guy and/or crazy and unreasonable.",Intyalle Valinquen,1,2021-07-31T04:42:06Z

74,UgxLiZHb2nrcq2VrYB94AaABAg,"The evidence against Amber and Johnny is similar. She‚Äôs on tape saying she was violent, but says this was in defence of herself or her sister. He‚Äôs on tape saying he head butted her, but says accidentally. They both have a lot of witnesses, but most are arguably biased. His are all friends or on his payroll. Hers are friends or family. They have both been accused of violence towards others, but never convicted. 

On 24th May on a private plan Amber says Johnny accused her of cheating (quite possibly correctly) with James Franco, pushed a chair at her, slapped her and kicked her.  Johnny said in his Witness Statement he remembered the flight clearly, he was sober and she was acting aggressively towards him. Stephen Deuters, his PA, said JD was quiet on the flight. Johnny sent Paul Bethany a text about that flight and referenced being on cocaine and described himself as ‚ÄúAn angry, aggro injun in a fuckin blackout, screaming obscenities and insulting any fuck who gets near‚Äù. Is that consistent with Ambers story or Johnny and Deuters? 

9 March 2015 - Amber and her sister both say that Johnny repeatedly hit Amber and was aggressive towards Whitney and that Amber hit Johnny to protect her sister. He denies violence towards either. Johnny‚Äôs Nurse Debbie Lloyd was in the flat and texted the next day ‚ÄúGood thing he called or they would have hurt each other. We had to physically restrain both of them.' Johnny‚Äôs on tape saying Travis (his bodyguard) pulled him off Amber. If only Amber was violent why would she and he have said that?

August 2015. The Eastern and Oriental Express in South East Asia. Amber says Johnny hit and pushed her against a wall by the throat causing her to fear for her life. Johnny did not recall either him or Amber being violent in his evidence. In an audio recording, Johnny said  ‚ÄúSince Australia we've been on our honeymoon other than the fact that we had a fight on the train, which was physical...‚Äù. Again who‚Äôs evidence is that more consistent with?

May 21 2016 Amber says JD threw the phone at her face hard. He denies this. JD‚Äôs witness Laura Divenere says in a recording that AH had a red and swollen face not long after. Officer Saenz observed reddening on Ms Heard's cheek but attributed this to crying.  Photographs that day of Amber with an injury to her eye timed just after the security cameras show Johnny left so not enough time to put makeup on. IT expert testified that the Photos have not been altered for time or data, edited or otherwise manipulated. The photographs were taken in different lighting conditions and that is a good reason why what can be seen differs from one to another

While Johnny was detoxing on his Island he alleges Amber withheld medication he needed (which would amount to torture if true).

His Nurse Debbie Lloyd‚Äôs notes show that he got the medication he needed.  Sending as text describing his Detox Johnny write of Amber ‚ÄúIt was an exercise of monumental patience and instinct . . It was Amber and Amber only that got me through this‚Äù. So what does the evidence show?",Lilyanna,0,2021-07-20T16:53:03Z

I think after a while she got a lot more media support but I remember so many people accusing her being a gold digger and saying not to trust her because she's bisexual. I also recommend people read the medium article because it talks about dv in a great way and how it's not always black and white (regardless who's side you believe). I feel there's a lot of context we're still missing and both of them have done horrible stuff. Victims of domestic violence may even use violence themselves against their abusers, and it can be very difficult for outsiders to establish which person is the primary abuser and which person is the primary victim. I'm not saying people need to believe Amber is the victim (or Depp). Just that we don't know everything and we can't say for sure who is the abuser.",hellotimekitty,0,2021-07-20T06:39:20Z

He's claimed responsibility for whatever actions he took while under the influence, and he can only move forward. Heard, though....it's deeply sadistic that she's patently aware of the fact that men claiming abuse get believed less than women, and she uses that to her full advantage to abuse him and then play the victim. It's revolting and makes actual survivors of all genders be believed less, but she still can be paid big money to advocate for survivors despite actively harming them.

A good friend of mine, a feminist whose against abuse, advocates for social justice and is a pretty great person, is an ardent Depp defender that continually badmouths AH. This makes me feel like she's grossly hypocritical for falling into the same type of nonsense that always happens when a celebrity is accused of a crime.

 Look at that person with all those Depp tattoos or the one who made those scarves; Are they really defending a possible abuse victim, or are they just upset that Edward Scissorhands is facing abuse allegations? Let's face it, AH doesn't have nearly as much acclaim that Depp has gotten over the years and his defenders seem to only like Depp's past movie roles over any sort of justice they think he's owed.

Those women grew up in abuse themselves, and were themselves abusive towards their children and even myself when I was small, and they were also complicit in further victimization and gaslighting I experienced throughout my life. Some statistics report 80 percent of relationships that deal with abuse are dealing with mutual abuse. Amber isn't Machiavellian in her black and white understanding of herself as an ""all good"" victim. It's the way that society wants to understand her and the paradigm she had at hand when attempting to understand her situation. Don't assume any victim is to any degree also violent, but don't stigmatize either a lack of the skills needed to maintain healthy relationships or just reactive violence. The tale she tells and Depp's are the same. I suspect they both lack the self awareness needed to leave behind a victim mentality.

And because they had documented my abusive behavior IN RESPONSE TO THEIR ABUSE, and i hadnt documented their abuse as well... well he basically was Johnny Depp in this situation... everyone in his family thought I was crazy and needed help.(and maybe that was true) but no one knew that it was HIM who pushed me to a psychological breakdown... he was the one being so abusive he brought out the monster in me... looking back, he was the abuser 100% and was also grooming me but had me delete everything throughout our relationship til i turned 18 so there was no proof.

I was on the fence about the Marilyn Manson situation, but ultimately, it tracks. If it was just what's her face I would say no because she clearly needs a lot of attention (and wants her wrongs swept under the rug, and tried to go after Dita as well) but the volume of people coming forward and the coke abuse makes me think yeah, some shit went down.

With Depp? I just don't see it. Everything I have heard about him is that he's a good person. Now hearing the tapes? Yeah, I believe him. He did things wrong, but who doesn't when emotions get that high? I know I have. But the things he did wrong that I was able to identify are immediately absolved when someone gets physical (without consent). She did the thing we need to be careful of. Pushing someone past their breaking point, then gaslighting them, threatening them and using social expectations as a weapon. ""No one will believe you."" I've dealt with women like her.

253,UgxuSdccfRdO-43yhaF4AaABAg,"Witnesses: 
There where more than just the police officers that were independent witnesses.

There was also multiple Eastern Columbia Building employees. Yes, Depp owned penthouses in that building but these weren‚Äôt his employees.

While I agree that employees have a vested interest in testifying for their employer, that alone is not sufficient to discount their testimony in any court case. For example, Depp‚Äôs island manager testified that she witnessed Heard abuse Depp. When asked about her interest in defending Depp, she clearly stated that her family was independently wealthy. She had no need for Depp or his money, nor did she work in an industry where he had influence (managing a remote island in the Bahamas) 

Contrast this to Heard‚Äôs witnesses: her sister and friends. 2 of the most prominent witnesses having lived in Depp‚Äôs penthouses rent free thanks to Heard. 

Time: 
I don‚Äôt put much weight on this because 1) in general time is very skewed in human memory, and this extends to professionals especially in high pressure jobs.
 
2) The officers weren‚Äôt the only one to distort the time for the May 21st incident. Heard‚Äôs witnesses did too. 
For example, one of Heard‚Äôs witnesses claimed to a slew of activity between going up to the penthouses and the police arriving, yet camera footage shows that there was less than 5 minutes between the two events.",Luna Wolf,2,2021-06-07T18:10:10Z

All of it was to get fame and money she begged him to marry her for two years then immediately cheated on him and divorced him as quickly as possible then pocketed the divorce money and one of his priorities.

264,UgwKyePq8EwiBNa2Otx4AaABAg,"Have you actually listened to the full audio tapes? 
For me what it ends up standing out (aside for her literally trying to excuse her behavior by explaining to Johnny that she slapped him and not punched him- semantics that are typical for a DM abuser) is how she yelled at him, how she was screaming her lungs out at him. 
I'm not saying all abuse is the same, but I am saying that if you were terrified for your life, if the person abusing you often clicked and flipped into a ""monster"", who  you genuinely thought was about to cause you serious bodily harm, because he had done it before, then I doubt you would be screaming at them with this much confidence. 
The whole time during those tapes he doesn't get angry, he doesn't shout, in fact he has to try to interrupt her constant ranting and defensive tirading, multiple times, to even get a word in edgewise and it's usually to defend himself against her twisting some reality to fit her narrative. 
The way people treat one another when they think no one is looking is very indicative. Those instances we're recorded because they were going to counseling for their marriage, And they were literally to help them gain perspective on how they treat and talk to each other during arguments.
Also, when Amber was abusing her ex-girlfriend, at one instance that a cop came to defend the fact that Amber heard was definitely abusing, Amber had said the cop was just against the LGBTQ community, which wasn't true considering the cop was actually a part of that community herself.
Amber just seems incredibly manipulative to me, and with how hasty their passionate relationship began, turned sour, and ended up, (as Amber would hope) with her on top, very wealthy, and more well-known than she ever would have been if not for this case. 
After all she hitched herself to Johnny's fame more so than perhaps any security guard who worked for him. Ask yourself, would anyone really even know her name if not for this?

She also doesn't sound scared at all, she is intentionally triggering him, mocking him, calling him a baby etc. None of that sounds like he's an abuser.

290,UgyjS3KkLgtnuJrrW-R4AaABAg,"Frankly I've never been into celebrity gossip or been curious about knowing of their personal lives (none of my business), but I find this case noteworthy on several levels because it reveals so much about us as a society.
Certainly I knew who JD was and liked his work, and had no idea who AH was before this case. Honestly I was shocked by the accusations she made. The little I had heard about JD (one does hear even when one doesn't seek out any info) didn't indicate he was in any way that kind of man. I was curious why, when just about everyone who personally knew JD, including all his ex'es, said that they could not recognize the man they knew from AH's description, that media and so many others were so quick to rush to judgment. AH obviously had a bias in describing him in that light, true or not.
And while it is true that we can never be quite sure what is happening in marriage, I would think the fact that JD had never done anything abusive in ANY of his previous relationships, should have given people pause from the outset. That there has since then been more and more evidence to indicate that not only wasn't JD abusive but rather it was AH, doesn't surprise me. The early warning signs that this might be the case were all there. So why were so many besides AH (who obviously had her own reasons) so eager to push the narrative that he was? What does this say really about our society?
Do I think JD is an angel and pure as driven snow? No. He's human- a guy who happens to be great at acting, but with faults and flaws just like everyone else. I just don't think he happens to have the flaw of beating up on women.",A. Westenholz,2,2021-06-05T12:49:32Z

307,UgzQS6QxrUTLQJ2lrpZ4AaABAg,"So Johnny Depp has a history of violent outbursts going back decades, and a history of people covering up those outbursts for him for *DECADES*. He dates Amber Heard and there are documented incidents of him abusing her. She‚Äôs selfish and irritable because, you know, she‚Äôs being abused. The evidence against her is a slew of witnesses who all have biases against her and a cop who lied about how long they were there (because, you know, bruises take a hot minute to show up so the fact that the cop was there for 15 minutes and not 60 is a huge fucking part of why her testimony was flawed). And the supposed flaming gun evidence is a recorded therapy session in which Amber is taken out of context saying ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt punch you‚Äù and ‚Äúit was open handed‚Äù. You know, like how reactive abuse might be. Or like how someone might behave when they‚Äôre fighting back. Again, Johnny Depp is a massive household name that has insane power in Hollywood and literally everyone who testified has a vested interest in ingratiating him. He LOSES the lawsuit because the judge declares that 12 of the 14 incidents did happen. As a victim of abuse myself I find this whole pro-Depp or ‚Äúboth sides‚Äù arguments to be absolutely disgusting. Hey guys, abuse victims are messy. Was Amber probably out for number 1? Was she probably someone with some problems? Yes. That‚Äôs literally what abusers look for, someone that no one will believe. And as for the tape, do you know how many times my abuser twisted events to say that self defense was actually an act of abuse in and of itself? ‚ÄúI screamed at you for two hours but then you yelled back at me and there is NO excuse for that‚Äù It‚Äôs almost like taking a couple‚Äôs therapy session out of context was....misleading??? You know he‚Äôs guilty because he hides behind his fans and gives out little lovenotes to the reporters. Why would he do that if he were innocent. Did Amber make mistakes? Is she money hungry?

The Heard/Depp case is actually a pretty accurate example of what some domestic violence cases look like, where sometimes there isn't a clear abuser/victim when all sides are examined and people involved (e.g. family members, friends, witnesses) can have biases against one or the other party.

Amber has lied, lied, lied some more and then continued to lie.  If the situations were reversed, this whole thing wouldn't even be getting talked about at all.

There's a reason people are lining up to defend Depp and not Heard.  As much as some of them might be financially inclined to side with him, there's a lot more money/notoriety that could be made nailing him to the wall.  The opportunity costs have to be accounted for.

At 'best' they abused each other and neither one wants to take responsibility.  At worst, Depp was the one being abused and Amber maneuvered into a more favorable position beforehand.  All it does is take away from real survivors if that's the case.

In the end, I think all abuse victims should be given the benefit of the doubt (regardless of gender) and at the very least receive some sort of therapeutic intervention.
 I've seen plenty of relationships where both parties were abusive to each other, including some where the woman in a hetero-normative partnership was the worse of the two. I generally think it means both of them need counseling of some kind (& obviously, to extricate themselves from the relationship). 
I'll leave legal matters to the lawyers. Just saying that overall, I don't think we should have this mentality of, 'the man is always the abuser' OR that 'one woman's bad personality means she's definitely lying, and this reflects badly on all other women'. I mean, I guess the reality is that it IS that way currently. But it doesn't have to be.",Mel Austin,1,2021-06-04T02:21:04Z

I have immense sympathy for all victims of abuse, male and female. But the way that the sexes are treated differently when it comes to these cases is incredibly frustrating. 

I can still remember a friend of mine growing up trying to discuss the sexual abuse he encountered from an older woman, and he was basically laughed at. His story wasn't taken seriously whatsoever and I see this pattern still happen so often to this day. The way the media reacted to Amber's story in the beginning compared to how they react now that Johnny appears to be the victim is a perfect example of this. 

This is so disheartening to me when I see people so often dismiss male victims or barely even acknowledge the issues men face. It seems like anytime this stuff gets brought up, suddenly everyone goes quiet. Or you get told stuff like 'well, women get abused more'. This dismissive attitude is so aggravating. 

Both men and women can be abused, let's stop pretending like this double standard is ok. I'm glad that most people seem to see Amber's story for what it is, it gives me hope that maybe the world isn't completely crazy yet.",Tori Carson,8,2021-06-03T19:44:58Z

I feel the the true culprit in this entire shitshow is that they got together at all. A prime example of this sort of thing is Liz Taylor and Richard Burton. They were trouble together from the start and only fed each other's worst sides. The fact that the public thinks one if beyond reproach while the other is a devil is exasperating. The Depp vs Heard debate actually drove me to stop using Facebook altogether when a Depp fan got mad at me when I said I didn't want him cast as Gomez in a Tim Burton Addams Family. It had nothing to do with the defamation lawsuit, but somehow my objection drew the flames to me. I just kinda can't wait for the rabble to stop caring. If they weren't famous a lot of people would sadly be very indifferent to this case. Domestic violence against men and women happens on such a regular basis that many people try to not look.

On balance, though Depp has a history of violence when drunk, there is far more exonerating evidence and testimony than testimony condemning him, which seems to be based solely on Heard's accusation alone.
It seems that the judge may have bought into the ""Believe Women"" narrative, or potentially feared a feminist backlash if he didn't side with the Sun. If it was simply a matter of UK libel law, then that shit needs reform.",Akadius,0,2021-06-03T12:04:38Z

454,UgxQNVjX9OhdPackc7t4AaABAg,"I think the core things you missed out on is how most if not all of AH's claims has been debunked or filled with contradictions. 

Several some crucial information you missed out on are the following: 
1) The Australian abuse did not happen as it has been *debunked* by her photos fashion shoot on the beach - it never existed.
2) Amber receiving a smashed phone in her face did not happen - it has been *debunked* by the police bodycam recording. 
3) Amber split lips she claimed she received from johnny (the one she claimed caused blood to splatter on the wall) never existed - i) *technically impossible* without actually splitting the lip. ii) *no surgery or doctors receipt* showing she required treatment such as stitches.
4) Ah offered *ZERO proof* of her dressed being ripped and an assault happened, nor did she have a witness testimony to back her Hicksville incident.
5) The incident on the plane been *debunked* because you CANNOT throw chairs on a plane as there are connected to the floor, and all witnesses there backed Depp.
6) AH said that deep was violent to her in LA and NGN said there was a major incident that occurred. HOWEVER, both AH and NGN provided *ZERO evidence* and ZERO details on what exactly occurred, which is practically a contradiction. 
7) Severed finger incident - AH *already proven* that she caused it via the audiotapes that were recorded by the landlord manager (the one who passed away). So that's debunked. Note that Justice Nichol *IGNORED* this vital evidence in court, evidence that proves Johnny never cut his own finger.  Also, you didn't mention that Judge Nichol ignored Johnny's Doctor's certificate that said the finger was smashed and cut by a heavy powerful object, and instead the *Judge made his OWN STORY* to what happened - a story that didn't match AH or Johnny.
8) Failed to mention that LA Thanksgiving incident has been *DEBUNKED* by an actual family video and AH's mother and father's phone messages.
9) Failed to mention that in all the audio recordings, AH *NEVER CLAIMED* ONCE that Johnny hit her. She only got pissed off with him for running away every time she physically assaulted him.
10) Failed to mention that the TMZ show that Johnny only became violent to objects and furniture, and in that same video she was *caught smirking* after being ousted in her failed setup.
11) Failed to mention that out of ALL the witnesses, the only people the defend AH were her 4 friends and even then, *NONE OF THEM was there* at the time of any incident that she claimed.

Complete double standards

If anyone actually looks at the timeline, the evidence, and AH's claim, you'd see how her side is riddled with lies and contradictions, whereas Johnny has proof and testimonies.

Due to this, they looked for a ""balance of probabilities"" for Depp to hurt Heard, and that the term for that was ""wife beater"". Now, regardless of what ""balance of probabilities"" means on paper, in the lawsuit itself, the judge accepted any cause and reason that could mean Depp hit Heard whatsoever - this included self-defense, being baited by Heard, taking marijuana and alcohol (with most of Heard's evidence involving pictures of those next to a sleeping Depp), and, in their japan incident, Johnny's argument was that ""the kids were in the other room and he wouldn't hit Heard to avoid traumatizing them"", but this was ruled as the judge as insufficient to stop him from hitting Heard

493,Ugw4srFsdcLxYfKdk1N4AaABAg,"At first I thought poor woman, but the person who made me believe she was an abuser was AH herself. I have listened to many of the phone recordings that they made when they were in relationship counselling and as an abuse victim, she made my flesh crawl. One particular recording she called him a coward for hiding in the bathroom and as he opened the door she shoved it soo hard she cracked his head with it, it rebounded onto her toe so she punched him in the jaw. You can hear her say she didn't realise that she hit his head with the door, but he shouldn't have been hiding in the bathroom. He's very upset that her toe got hurt, and very sweetly apologetic. The toe injury was her own fault, but she blamed him and called him a coward. This is just one of many recordings.

I am genuinly someone to give women the most credit and I still think I am with amber, I think she need alot of counseling so she can hurt less and have better relationships. Johnny dosen't seem perfect by any stretch and shouldn't date people so young but seemed to TRY to resolve his frustration in a less toxic manor, again, we all have our problems and all we can do is strive to be better.

That can give you so much insight. There's also NO evidence Johnny hit her, so the idea that he *could* have comes out of where? Further, the Rocky Dennis or whatever his name is story has another side, too...one where Johnny was defending a homeless woman. One where the rest of the cast and crew say Johnny was being protective and not just randomly trying to fight some guy while drunk. One where the guy settled out of court because his story kept changing. I think you would give a more full story if you...give the full story. The documents for both the UK case and the Virginia case are freely available to peruse and get as full a picture as possible. The evidence there shows very clearly that ONE person is an abuser in this. It isn't fair or healthy or even realistic to claim they're both abusive. That's simply unfounded by the mountains and mountains of evidence. It's made me question how thorough your other videos are with so so much left out that is freely available.

562,UgzozMFanANHn2yMCR94AaABAg,"I don't think either of them should lose their jobs without solid proof of abuse, and because this is a ""he said/she said"" situation, that will never come.  And though I don't blindly support Depp - he's been a train wreck most of his career, despite his success - I have to say that the recordings of Heard do not in any way support her claims of being a victim of abuse.  I have seen many documentaries and programs on women who are genuine victims of abuse and one of the most common aspects of their stories are the constant walking on eggshells and trying to do everything possible to avoid setting the abuser off.  Heard, in those recordings, not only is not trying to avoid setting him off, she is actively antagonizing him and almost seems to be baiting him to lash out at her!  She's calling him names, telling him how old and useless he is!  Those are not the actions of a beaten-down terrified woman.

567,UgxiUOsRuxU59dZsSt54AaABAg,"This really isn't related directly to this case...but...

There's a fictional story that perfectly sums up my thoughts on this...It stars a girl who is abused by her brother in multiple ways...when we meet her in the story, she's also an abuser, albeit a much more passive type.  She gets pleasure out of emotionally and mentally agitating her abuser, which does result in more of her own abuse, but it's the only power she has...she even low key bullies another person (constantly naming her animals after this person while knowing said person is terrified of animals), even to the point where she is complicit in certain manipulations and abuse alongside her brother...it was the only power she had.  

In short...I can't say what happened between these two, I wasn't there...but it's not unheard of for a victim of abuse, as a way to regain some of their power or autonomy, to become an abuser themselves, either to their own abuser or towards others, as this girl did.  Yes, the story of that girl is a work of pure fiction, but all fiction has some standing in reality and psychologists even study how abuse victims become abusers themselves.

Drinking and losing his temper and possible abuse towards Amber could very much be a result of his chronic abuse suffered at her hands.  Or...even vice versa but I find that unlikely that it was the other way around.",Crea Kimoi,1,2021-06-02T21:12:16Z

However, there was recorded evidence that she 100% admitted to hitting him but last time I checked she still had her job on Aquaman. The thought that companies won't make decisions is a cop-out because as said court of public opinion has spoken. They likely would not face backlash for acting now. All that being said the petitions are woefully imbalanced and all those people who signed for Amber to lose her job should also sign Depp to get his back but you don't see that.

Sucks and it only reiterates that Johnny has a lot of work to do when it comes to drugs and alcohol. However. That case did indeed uncover that there was at least one abuser in their relationship. And Amber Heard is her name. Does that mean Johnny never did anything to her? No. And that should not be forgotten. The crowd of fans also just feels wrong and he should have spoken up against it.

Picture of her at the beach on the same day she claims to have an injury. Or the reference of her being assaulted by journalists out the courthouse actually footage all of them are publicly available. Not mentioning those things kinda present things like eupheminism of facts. Also, the reason why the charitable donation is important is that they are actually stated as a reason by judge Nicole as to why he believes Ms. Heards. That a statement in legal documents.  I'm not reproaching you to not take Mr. Deep's side, I just think at this point it would be really better to state actual proof when it exists as you do for other videos.

598,UgwD4_EdePaqU0AseyB4AaABAg,"I feel like even at this 40min video length is just to short, too simplified. Such as the Amber putting waste on the bed and Depp throwing bottles, the police office saw no harm to her face but also to the environment, seeing no bottles thrown and what not mentioned is the bodyguard supports these statement. While the driver of the car is in the support of Depp involved in the situation too. While most substances he takes makes him slow, sleepy, weak and the situation brought up is alcohol while these other substances don‚Äôt bring that type of side effects. While this is shown by the photos taken by her of him, which in itself is very suspicious and looks very staged. With taking photos of Depp high and on the floor rather than helping, taking photos. These are only some points, but another issue which isn‚Äôt talked in detail is that both his ex-wife‚Äôs who have known him longer disagree to the claims of Amber,  and Amber divorced him days after his own Mother died. With the smug and relaxed attitude in court involving domestic violence and the many images and photos images rather supporting Depp claims and when they don‚Äôt, looking very staged or purposely taken. Just seems elaborate, funnily enough her fame came from dating Jonny and what seemingly more funny she tries to date Elon Musk like she trying to date big people to reach higher. That part my own opinion but you can see how I think that. There just to much stuff not even stated in this video which is understandable, but I wanted others to know other important points and do there own research if ever interested. To my current mindset I support Johnny Depp over Amber simply because of facts and evidence proven and quite reasonable theories to alternative situations.

That's why it's so important that she didn't actually donate it. The judge did not go over the 14 incidents but straight out chose just to believe her. It was also found that the judge has ties to Amber. Ya'll can go read the court documents or check out the aforementioned YouTuber's videos on it. Also for anyone who hasn't heard the tapes, do so.

Not only because he has physical evidence (the video and presumably medical records regarding his hand) but also because non of Amber's allegations seem to hold water. Even if she was a pro at covering bruises on her face, wouldn't someone in a private setting, like her mother or a close friend, have noticed and come forward? It just seems unlikely that, with how unprivate celebrities' lives are, that no one would've snapped a picture or made a comment about her injuries, especially if they were as drastic as two black eyes. 

I'm not saying they never hurt one another, couples can have fights and it's natural (verbally at least), and it's not hard to believe it would get physical between the two given both their histories.

Its not anyones buisness if two married people fight or beat eachother,mentally or physically or both.
Its important of corse that cases of abuse get solved. But no need to make a public scene or political/social statement with it!
Thats just abusive of the system and populous.

And Finally, as Blair states, this kind of behaviour is the reason victims dont come forth.
And why so many people fight systems that are meant to protect and help victims.
Not because the victims are ""oppressed"" or bevause they ""arent taken seriously"".
Nor are support systems held back because of ""powerhungry people"" who want to abuse others.

702,Ugy1omSUM-LMJ-T2_M54AaABAg,"As a survivor of domestic abuse. I have one question for you, that you seem to not have addressed AT ALL. Do you know that there are such things as EMOTIONAL and MENTAL abuse? Let me tell you: There is! Amber mostly mentally and emotionally abused Johnny. I am a survivor of such abuse. Mental and emotional abuse are just as, if more harmful than physical abuse. That is what you and everyone who has ever spoken on the Depp-Heard case have NEVER addressed are the instances of mental and emotional abuse. Abuse is not only physical. I was mentally and emotionally beaten every day just like Johnny was. You learn to reflect their abuses back towards them, and yes that makes you just as bad as they are, but its helps you SURVIVE. That is the point. SURVIVAL. I am now going through therapy for the SEVEN years of abuse I went through. I've listened to the audio. If you don't know what gaslighting is, please watch Cinema Therapy's video on that about Mother Gothel from Tangled. Amber in that one audio clip gaslights him, puts him down, tries to triangulate him with his exes, moves the goal posts, uses abusive language, and is all over just awful and disrespectful. He admits to locking himself in the bathroom to get away as his personal body guard and runner of his personal film company have supported him. Amber proceeds to call him names. That is emotional abuse, she plays mental games with him, that's what the shitting on the bed is about. That's why he tried to ""placate"" her. That is a part of being mentally abused, trying to keep the peace. That is the life of a victim of emotional and mental abuse is. You didn't even touch on the majority of abuse. Abuse is not only physical! Mental and emotional abuse leave long lasting invisible scars. PTSD, depression, anxiety. I should know, I suffer from them. Johnny I can grantee is now suffering them due to that very insidious monster that is known as Amber Heard. That's why I won't touch anything she's been in. Yes I have bias, but its for a very good reason. A zebra doesn't change its stripes. Her ex wife was covering up shit so she didn't get abused again. That's called survival. The Sun only succeeds in making sure domestic abuse and domestic assault victims in the UK are not believed. Especially if they are men. When you're abused you see things from a different light, especially if you've experienced the same kind of abuse. I've not only been mentally and emotionally abused by a partner, but in a professional capacity as well. I am well and truly versed in what it looks like. I am intimately familiar with the debilitating tactics of emotional and mental abusers. Amber is the abuser. I will always know that as a fact because I know what my ex did to me and I know what she did to him just off of that one recording. That one recording is not a special act. Abusers don't just put on an act for a recording. That is truly who they are. That is truly who Amber is. An abusive manipulative person who has no right to have her roles or her job in her profession due to her diabolical nature.

Additional Note: I have to say I love how people who appear to not have been abused hem and haw about ""we don't really know about bla-bla-bla."" No. When you've been abused you know. Its quite obvious when you've been abused because you are fine tuned to that kind of behavior and the red flags an abuser gives off. I do applaud the non-abused wonderful way of giving the benefit of the doubt. Its a nice thing to do, but it can get you into to situations such as these where you are mentally, emotionally and physically abused if you're not carful. I know this from experience.

He tanked his career due to his own on set behavior and because he kept bringing unwanted publicity to the franchises he was working on. He could have focused on his career but instead he got his lawyer and his PR team to release as many unflattering things about Heard as possible, so that most of the public now thinks she's a scheming heartless monster.

The film's script manager, who was also there at the time of the ""altercation"", claimed he didn't see Johnny assault Rocky. He did be verbal with him since Rocky was verbally abusing a homeless lady, but he didn't get physical with him. They also made up and took a photo together.

823,Ugz3KpUfCGdUwtb3lSt4AaABAg,"It's interesting to note that while Blair is right in what she says about Johnny Depp and Amber Heard that we don't know them and can't say for certain what happened that she wouldn't have extended this same consideration in reverse.  That is the narrative and the bias that is a problem.  That is the bias against men at work in domestic violence and sexual misconduct situations.  As soon as a woman makes an accusation everyone believes her, but if there is evidence presented that she lied or was in fact the one doing the abusing we get the, ""well, we really don't know what happened."" answer.  Blair needs to confront her own biases with regards to this, not necessarily because Johnny Depp didn't do nuffin', but because average men get railroaded everyday by the bias assumptions made around this narrative.  Anyone who has spent a large amount of time around low income housing can tell you that women yell at men MORE than the reverse AND are more likely to become violent.  Honesty is necessary if anything is going to change DV and not taking an honest look at how women behave in these situations is not going to do anyone any good.

There was literally no evidence that Heard was harmed by Depp.  I'm not saying this to defend Depp, Hell, I have an issue with Depp staying with Heard after the first incident even if his side is absolutely true.  A real man wouldn't tolerate a violent woman in his life if not for his own sake than for the sake of his children.  My point is that we take for granted that women don't lie and men do even when the man has recordings of the woman and the woman in question has literally NOTHING but her word and those of her friends 'supporting' her.  If you want to pull the, ""I'm trying to be unbiased card."" than pull it BOTH WAYS, not just when a certain situation seem to defy the common narrative.  If you want to know my bias, it's really easy, I am on the side of the children.  In any situation involving parent's disputing almost anything I have never encountered a situation were I went wrong defending the children.  And yeah that includes Depp and Heard.  I would definitely yell at Johnny for having an abusive relationship around his kids.",Darrek Workman,4,2021-06-02T15:56:33Z

I don't give a shit about Depp's status as a wife beater right now. Could be true, could be false, whatever. He's being financially destroyed either way, and has lost his biggest roles.
Amber Heard is claiming to be some outspoken survivor of abuse when she has directly, overtly stated that SHE IS AN ABUSER. She is. She's untrustworthy and she's an abuser. Any and all organizations that would distance themselves from Depp because he MIGHT be an abuser need to launch Heard into the sun because she IS an abuser. She should not get any work, ever again, on any public platform. She should not be getting paid tens of thousands to rant about a bunch of bullshit because she's such a victim.
