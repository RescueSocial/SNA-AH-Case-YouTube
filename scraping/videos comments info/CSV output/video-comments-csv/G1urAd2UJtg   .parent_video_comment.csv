She sounds like she‚Äôs manipulative. She talks faster and louder to win the argument.  He tries to respond to what she says. But she interrupts. He tries to make a point and she goes another direction.  She says, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt say that‚Äù when she did. 

He‚Äôs right to try to leave when she verbally pokes at him and he gets frustrated.  He doesn‚Äôt want the fight to get physical so he‚Äôs doing the safe thing. 

Her verbalizing is crazy-making. I‚Äôm a person of peace and even I would need to leave to get away from her irrational word-salads.

She can‚Äôt even promise she won‚Äôt become physical.",Wonderwomantam,0,2021-11-11T21:03:49Z

How is this still a question on who‚Äôs the abuser?! How has this case not been solved? How is her career thriving while his is ending? ALL of his ex‚Äôs came forward to tell everyone that JD was NEVER abusive to them and always kind! HOW with ALL of this proof, is she still the victim?! How has she not LOST the case yet?! I‚Äôm completely baffled! This is the most ridiculous thing I‚Äôve ever heard and seen! She is nothing but a complete and total psychopath who gets off on ruining the lives of anyone who dare try to get her out of their lives! She not only gets off on it, but absolutely loves watching her lies destroy innocent people! She has no regard for anyone‚Äôs life but her own! If it were possible for her to get away with, she would have killed him and even then with the way this BS case is going she might have gotten away with that too!!! She‚Äôs absolutely loving this! I can‚Äôt believe that someone can be soooo damn twisted, disgusting, psychotic towards someone who gave them nothing but love! She deserves to have the exact same done to her! She deserves to lose everything and more! Someone needs to beat her a$$! She is an absolute disgusting, waste of flesh, oxygen, and space who needs to be taken down! She cannot just do this to a beloved, innocent, kind man! Johnny‚Äôs only fault was marrying this POS! She is a truly horrifying psychopath who now knows she can get away with something this disturbing so this makes her even more dangerous! *FUTURE VICTIMS BEWARE* because there are absolutely going to be more victims! Please for the love of god someone take her down and give her a taste of her own psychotic medicine!!! Take her down before she can do this to anyone else! She has been proven to be a big fat liar many times! She says herself how she got the bruises painted on her face to screw him over!

She MADE herself seem irresistible to him, made him think she was the ‚Äúperfect woman‚Äù, LIED her way into the relationship, manipulated him into the relationship, she NEVER loved him, she‚Äôs incapable of loving anyone but herself. She pretended to love him to get him to marry her!

She tried to make herself seem innocent and sweet during interviews about the ‚Äúabuse‚Äù she‚Äôs SO despicable, dangerous, disgusting, a lying tw@$, everything about her SCREAMS abusive liar, fake, psychotic, who needs to be heavily medicated and locked in a padded cell!

48,Ugxurj2NXErsDU5AWeB4AaABAg,"I didn't catch this until now but she had said, ""I'm the one that comes and knocks at the bathroom door."" - Amber 
This is proof she is a LIAR. In another video tape where she was being asked under oath if she ever hit Johnny Depp several times and it was a yes or no question, she had escaped the question by telling an elaborate story of how she had locked herself in said bathroom to get away from him but if she really was trying to get away from him then why was she knocking on bathroom doors to get him where he was? I'm sure everyone has caught that lie as her claims don't add up but want to point that out in case anyone had missed it. I watched the movie, the ""Danish Girl"", prior to realizing that Amber Heard briefly featured in the film because I didn't know who the fuck she was and she's not a big name star to me. So I was like oh her? She's nothing . . .She climbed her way to fame after she dated and married Johnny Depp.


She is so insecure of herself and so  jealous of his fame, money, and status that she would do whatever to control and destroy him even cheat on him and have side relationships with Elon Musk and James Franco while he was recovering from his finger injury after what she did to him. She's a terrifying and evil human being. I'm glad Johnny never got her pregnant, I can NOT imagine her being a mother and abusing the kids in the same way she does to him. Healthy relationships don't have all these red flag qualities that Amber brings into the dynamic of that marriage. If Johnny were with a better respectable woman and offered all the solutions he has given Amber, the relationship would definitely work out and be as righteous as he is and grow. This was not only a stagnant marriage because of Amber but it was also violent. Johnny is a soft-hearted guy who, like me, are uncomfortable, when it comes to aggression towards him from others, especially at no reasonable cause. We're more ""let's be peaceful and find common ground"" rather than ""let's have a full blown fight/argument and go around in circles"". Amber reminds me of my ex-gf, who loved the drama of a violent relationship than making love itself. 


Her terms of that marriage is based on her twisted interpretations of their marriage vows, the when it comes to ""for better or for worse"", to her it means, he should let her beat the shit of him because they are married and if he makes an attempt to protect himself or walk away from the violence, she will punish him for breaking her expectations or twisted version of their marriage vows. Her boundaries are all over the place. Even in marriage, there are boundaries, and well, she's crossed, hopped, jumped, and slammed those boundaries all over the place. She had no respect for him or their marriage. Why? Because Amber Heard is toxic. Everything else that comes with her bad behavior are just excuses to stay toxic.

63,UgykWKrSfGtvFY2udvF4AaABAg,"The man I married beat me down so far I couldn't recognize myself any more.  I thought I was brave, an adventurer, and I thought I found a man that was a good man.  One who appreciated my mind, my ability to fight back, who cherished me,  and I prayed that he would never lie to me.  I gave him total trust, which he totally betrayed from day one.  I don't know why he married me.  The men in our circle thought I was sexy, and talked about me, apparently.  So maybe he wanted to be seen owning me?  I had over 10 years of the argument I just listened to. 10+ years married to a sociopath that I had become numb to.  My heroes were Katharine Hepburn, Beatrice from Much Ado About Nothing, Elizabeth Bennet from Pride and Prejudice.  At the end, I was barely a shadow.  I was so tired of the gaslighting,  and  always being wrong, and never being allowed to own the meaning of my words, and there was no point in arguing any more.  
    There were certain days I'd notice a look on his face.  It was his mean look.  The pulling wings off a fly look is how I thought of it, --thought, because I didn't have friends any more, since all my free time was to be devoted to him. I learned to avoid him when he had that look, because he would come at me and pick at me and pick at me, so cruel, picking  at me and pushing me, verbally, all the time with that look in his eyes, and when he pushed me to the point I was finally in tears.  Once I was totally defeated and the moment the tears started, he would get this new look on his face, almost orgasm, because Mr. Hyde would immediately disappear, and he would laugh and throw his arms around me and try to hug me and force me to stand there since he's built like a line-backer and I am 5'2"" and 120 pounds.  He never hit me, or I would have left.  I just let him take the most important parts of myself, the self confidence that had been destroyed when I was a school kid, and that I painstakingly worked on, which I prized about myself because I wasn't tall and beautiful.  So I worked on my mind, and my confidence and I made myself into the person I wanted to be.  I married a man who I though appreciated those traits about me.  But he spent our whole marriage berating me, mocking me, pointing out I couldn't do anything right.  
      I had to cut all ties with him.  I can't stay in this headspace thinking about  that part of my life.  I cut him out of my life because of the lies, the cheating and the betrayal.  Living 4 years under Trump, was a nightmare of having my marriage in my face daily.  No, he wasn't Trump, but he is a narcissist and a sociopath.  listening to this tape is like being back in that marriage.  I gave up contradicting him, or having an opinion so I wouldn't have to fight with him.  I could write a book.  No one will ever make Heard happy.  She is sick, and all she can do is destroy.  
    It breaks my heart to see that this is what he's gone through. I was trying to be respectful and not get into the gossip of someone's divorce, but I also couldn't believe Johnny Depp was guilty of domestic violence.  I only started listening to what was going on after a really sweet Instagram or whatever it was, it was just sweet, and sincere, and almost like a kid hoping he's not about to be rejected.  It hurt my heart for him.  My brother's first wife nearly broke his nose with a pan, then took the kids and left.  He called me.  I took him to the hospital and I made him file a police report.  She was-- is -- totally insane.  I can't imagine what her kids endured.  Women can 100% be abusers.  It's time for the pendulum to stop swinging to the extremes, and to go back to the range where the majority of people are.  Not all men are abusers, and not all women are victims.  Stop branding the Red Letter on people, and wait for conclusive proof before allowing someone's life is blown apart.

Anyway I didn't mean to ramble on.  Amber wants someone she can order around, and she will expect him to fight with her, so she can dance to the psychotic tune in her brain,  She'll want him to hit her, she wants to his him.  Then she betrays him by attacking his career, telling people he's fat and old.  I found out my ex had shared some of the most deeply personal things about me in my illness, from the 30+ surgeries and what he'd had to do for me, and made me into a joke to them - and since we worked for the same company, in different offices, everyone knew what he was saying, except me.  Everyone knew he was cheating and lying.   Yet even when I confronted him with proof, he still made it about me being wrong.  All you can do is realize you cannot stay in a relationship with someone incapable of loving you.  Who delights in hurting you.  I could cry when Johnny suggests a list, or a note to each other every day until the kind words help them be their best selves with each other, and remind them they love each other.  And Amber put a stop to that suggestion fast, didn't she?  She DOESN'T WANT A POSITIVE SOLUTION.  You will never redeem her.  You will never her change her.  You  can only change yourself, by making yourself less.  She wants screaming and hitting.  She wants drama, she wants Johnny under her thumb.  She will lie and cheat, and she will always make him the bad guy, and no matter how many times he proves his love for her it will never be enough.  She is mentally ill, and there is no cure.  

Get out.  Run.  Don't look back.  I can't believe how kind and loving and sweet Johnny is.  Man I'm sorry he's going through this. Those of us who were in relationships with sociopathic narcissists, all, all can listen to something like this and lament the time we lost trying to contort ourselves into what this person we love says that they want. All of us who have fallen in love with Doctor Jekyll, only to find out that Dr. Jekyll is almost never in the room,  and you are really married to Mr. Hyde.

RUN.  I wish I could reach out and hug Johnny and set him free of her and erase what she's done.  I've been there, I've been there.  I won't go back.   Just RUN.",Esme W Vimes,10,2021-01-06T14:05:37Z

65,UgynFajSH4vu9pQOz8V4AaABAg,"You guys he needs help.  Read the texts messages and look into the truth not media reports.  There are witnesses to the abuse.  That are on record.  Johnny has admitted to it.  
Come on..we gotta do better.  
This is a perfect case study of media manipulation. 

He has admitted to it.  They have police report and records of her face.  No, it was not make up like Media said.  The police wrote a report.  And RN testified to seeing Amber's face swollen and red and lip bloody.  His assistant is on record stating Johnny kicked her.  He threatened to kill her, burn her, and rape her dead corpse.  The dog shit on the bed and it was not her.  How absurd!  

Can you not hear the gaslighting and manipulation?  Its apparent.  They knew they were recording as they would watch them back to help with their fights.  He NEEDS HELP.  He NEEDS HELP.  And his team instead of getting him help they enabled him.  He beat the crap out of her several times.  I cannot believe this is really happening!  Depps team leaked the information as an offense because someone called the police because he went on a drinking binge and beat her up.  Come on!  This IS NOT HOW WE TREAT VICTIMS.  THIS IS SO DISTURBING.  
Amber's father was an alcoholic, and she tried to change him and make him better.  Stop before you post because this is unjust!

68,UgzOAb-PP0RNm-E18kx4AaABAg,"Anyone else notices how she constantly says she is FIGHTING FOR US when she is FIGHTING WITH HIM.... how dejected and broken she feels when he walks away when she is screaming and shouting at him... I am an abused woman myself, and I notice a lot of things in this conversation people reading about abuse online may not notice. I agree with another commentor here, people who side with amber are definitely those who have never been ABUSED themselves. These days so many people jump around claiming they have been abused, a husband and wife have a fight, both say some mean and hurtful things, but the wife goes around claiming she was emotionally abused and mentally tortured. A woman is slapped by her husband once, she goes around telling she was PHYSICALLY ABUSED. most people either don't realize or don't want to accept or decieving others for sympathy, that's not abuse. Abuse is characterized by a pattern, it's not a fight, but rather what goes on in that fight. It's not a single slap, a single slap definitely counts as DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, but it's in no way equal to DOMESTIC ABUSE which has a much much deeper meaning than people using these words care to find out. It's like a loafer on the street hooted on a woman and grabbed her wrist, and she goes on to tell the world that she was raped. That's not rape, that's molestation and eve teasing. I hope more people start realizing the difference, DOMESTIC ABUSE is so much deeper than what most people make it out to be. My heart goes out to johnny, I can understand most people who have not been abused themselves can not read between the lines when they listen to this conversation, but most people who have been abused themselves are siding with Johnny, and that's not a coincidence. They see and understand a lot more than normal people simply swayed by words.",toobaaaapi,7,2020-12-31T13:00:25Z
