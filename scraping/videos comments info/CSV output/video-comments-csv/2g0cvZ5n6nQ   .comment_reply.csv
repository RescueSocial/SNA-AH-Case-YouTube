And I do agree that this is just for her image, if Johnny filed for divorce because she cheated on him with Elon musk and James Franco it would be damaging to her career, though if she filed for a divorce because Johnny ‚Äúbeat‚Äù her then that would boost her career, as shown by all the endorsements and spokesperson gig she got after she went public with the claims.

After Depp's transparent payments to these charities stopped and he handed over the money to Heard instead, all of a sudden Heard kept a tight lid on said payments, she didn't even give to the charities she was close to because they weren't ""big enough"" to grant her more ""fame and celebrity.""  It's quite apparent that she pocketed a lot for herself and bought her way into places like the ADL's good graces, because she could use them to further her interests.  Because to Heard, it has always been about ruining Depp's life and gaining fame for being ""stronk wahman!""  Lmfao!  

Now however, she's trying to stop any need for her to provide evidence of giving the 7 million to charities as she's continuously implied.  She continually said it wasn't about the money, but it was always about the money and everyone knows as much.  I wonder if any people working at these charities she's using will lie through their teeth to provide a false statement for her on behalf of said charity, but when Depp's lawyer wishes to see the accounts used and transfer of money, the transactions to show validity, they will come up short and then get said charity in hot water lol!",2020-11-12T21:18:58Z,0
