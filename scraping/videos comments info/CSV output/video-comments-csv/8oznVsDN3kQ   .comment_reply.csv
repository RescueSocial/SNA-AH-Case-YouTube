In the long run, these things ARE creating really stupid problems. This is why we have weak minded people acting entitled and arrogant when anyone says anything they don't agree with, stating that they feel offended and trying to change everything just because of that...

YouTube should be a open platform for any kind of discourse as long as it didn't promote violence explicitly or similar things; but just stating that 'someone was raped' should NOT be a problem; and censoring the word 'rape' is NOT going to make the action disappear from reality.

'A problem that is hidden is NOT solved'.

39,UgwWLEqQNOAmty30uSZ4AaABAg,Francine Leach,"Seriously agree with most of what you said- although unsolicited/unwanted touching is unacceptable in my opinion (not just rape). 

However, with the information presented here, what it seems to me is the primary concern for most of these women was their ‘careers’; so they kept silent to preserve that. This happens in many professions, and unfortunately silence is normalized because most people (men and women) fear losing their jobs, reputations, etc; when perhaps they have obligations (such as children) so their belief systems/morality flies out the window when faced with these types of situations. 

With that being said, the sheer nature of the job of acting creates all sorts of illusions and delusions. As with many professions, people enter into it for different reasons... some for a truly artistic experience, some to be wealthy/famous, some because they are following in their family’s footsteps, etc. So other than speculate as to why these women got involved with Franco, I’m just listening, and what I hear is most of them wanted to work with him due to career goals. They seem to each have been capable of saying NO I don’t want to do this or that... I’m not hearing that anyone was held against their will or anything. The story of him pushing a woman down was completely awful, not sure why nothing was done to immediately correct that...? 

So what I’m hearing also comes down to this: Famous man uses his position to see some boobies and uses his ‘art’ as an excuse for bad behavior that wouldn’t be tolerated in other types of professions. What a big story 🙄 

I’m sorry that these women felt objectified and fearful of working with him, and they should absolutely speak out if that’s the truth; but they have every right to say NO and if there’s a lesson to be learned then it should be to make sure your reading comprehension skills are stellar, and you put your demands in the contract so there’s no ambiguity about where you stand, what you’ll accept or not, and what you will or will not do.",2021-10-18T18:26:51Z,0

When I was 19 my 45 year old male boss got the key to my hotel room, walked in, in the middle of the night, in his underpants. I went to a hotel for work, my door was locked, I thought I was safe and quite frankly I needed my job. How do you expect a naïve girl straight out of school in her first job with no experience of the world to know what to do in that circumstance? No one in my life had taken advantage of me before, I didn't understand you could say no and keep my job.  If I'd been mad and yelled I would have been sacked I'm sure. Problem is every woman I know has millions of stories like that as do I. How about men get taught not to do stuff like that?  How about men get taught not to sexually approach women ever unless invited to?  How about you understand sometimes women don't feel sexually abused until they leave the situation or till they become adults and understand what happened.  Some sexual abuse victims don't come forward for 30 years later because it takes ages to process or they are embarrassed or scared.

So, she did what she thought to be the only rational and logical solution at the time, she faked her own injuries and blamed it all on me in the hopes that I would get expelled. And it worked. One day a likeable guy that people enjoyed to hang out with, to an accused sex offender whom wanted to hang himself the day after and actually attempted to do so. I lost my reputation, my scholarship, my friends, and even a huge part of my family—for something that I didn't do. Oh, and her? She's happily married right now and has two beautiful kids. But the worst thing of all?... I don't hold it against her. I don't hold a grudge, because love truly does make blind.

Sure, some are and it is horrible, but I was accused of sexual harassment by a woman and I'm gay. She thought I was hitting on her because I told her how pretty her hair was and made a few comments about how nice she dressed a couple of times. She just didn't like me for whatever reason.

Hell people complain about having to do nude scenes. If you don’t want to fine but if that hurts your career I don’t give a fuck. Again no one is owed fame or an acting career.

Did she care about my hard work? Did she care that I had a family to take care of and feed? NO. She didn't like the way I managed so she took the easy way out instead of working with me.

He finds her in Australia and she says ""Kevin, nobody waits that long"" and he calls back to that line he'd said about his father holding a candle for his mother and he looks at her and says ""Some people hold a candle""......BRO!!!!!!

614,UgwoXBj6dE2y1gnIYGB4AaABAg,怪我ドル Z O M B O I D,"@Elvis Presley Songs and Performances There are some positive tides turning. Even the Hollywood Reporter and elsewhere published elaborate and overdue articles detailing mega producer Scott Rudin as the violent and abusive douchebag he is - and that's a big deal because Scott Rudin is the top of the top when it comes to producers in this town who've been untouchable. We really need to get rid of this system and bullshit so Hollywood bosses aren't a thing anymore.

And on the other hand, I'm very grateful so many people who take the time to explore the Depp and Heard bullshit are largely on Depp's side. He'll hopefully make a comeback and be vindicated because she really exploited MeToo to fuck his career and reputation he's built for decades. She does so much damage to actual victims.",2021-07-11T15:36:37Z,1

616,UgwoXBj6dE2y1gnIYGB4AaABAg,怪我ドル Z O M B O I D,"@The Blue Morpho No it's not. Depp is innocent of that shit and Franco already settled with a few of the women he coaxed to do predatory ""sex scenes"" at his private acting school. He was already caught years ago for texting teenage girls. And other shit you probably didn't hear about.... trust me.... thus why even Rogen has to publicly distance himself from him.

Depp is the one exception of a dude who got finessed who did nothing wrong. That's the extreme minority. I know people in this town and literally all of them, men and women, have said he's not that dude. He's been in this business for decades and it's seemingly only Heard who claims he's abusive which is a giant red flag. Does Depp like wine and drugs? Sure. He doesn't hide that. That doesn't mean he hits women. Heard called the police of him claiming he did this and that and trashed their place and yet LAPD body cams came out and showed literally nothing was askew so Heard is in trouble for that shit.

Trust me, I fully support and want the MeToo thing to continue giving long due consequences to a lot of scumbag pieces of shit in this town but Depp isn't one of them.",2021-06-30T09:03:20Z,1
