My ex hurt me & my children, was never found guilty & is out there free to do it again & again. He was never placed on the register either. As far as the law is concerned, he has a clean slate & could have more children. He is a dangerous predator. This is why many victims also feel so strongly about this, having been through it.

did AH PUNCH JD?- YES

Does AH have a record of being an abuser before?- YES

did AH throw pots and pans at JD and chop off his finger?- YES

did AH literally admit she has anger issues on tape?- YES

IF THE TAPES ARE MANIPULATED WHY HAS NO ONE ADDRESSED IT- EVEN YOUR qUeEn hasnt said anything about the tapes, which clearly shows they are untampered- ALSO THE TAPES WERE TAKEN FROM THE COURT CASE WEBSITE SO HOW CAN THEY BE MANIPULATED LIKE WTF U CLOWN WAFFLER.

82,UgyRwD6zMKkOsWpmdtZ4AaABAg,Shifting Mercury,"@Charizard Emmy And this is a link of the phone call between Johnny and Amber where he is trying to convince her to drop the criminal charges and she lists of all the abuse and he doesn‚Äôt deny it. She talks about how everyone thinks she‚Äôs a liar and he says he didn‚Äôt say she‚Äôs a liar. He promises to set the record straight and address the violence. So she then withdrew the request for a restraining order and because she did that, he didn‚Äôt have to face criminal charges. In the UK, if you request a restraining order, the person automatically faces charges. So she agreed and they released a statement. In the statement they said that nobody lied for financial gain. That was Johnny‚Äôs indirect admission. Outside of when he says on the recording that they have both been physical towards eachother. Which you will find in the first recording. Or I can send you a clip if you can‚Äôt find it. 

There are some lawyers that distort the truth a bit to make their client look innocent but Adam Waldman is purposely deceitful. Johnny‚Äôs supporters are being manipulated. I don‚Äôt have a problem with people being fans of Johnny and wanting the best for him. I do too. But not at the cost of the truth or by throwing someone else under the bus. I‚Äôm afraid he is sabotaging himself and his career by trying to hard to silence Amber and make her look bad. I think Waldman IS his Rasputin like they said in the ‚ÄòHollywood Reporter‚Äô article and it‚Äôs only digging a bigger hole. His fans can‚Äôt save him. His lawyer certainly can‚Äôt. Only Johnny can save Johnny.",2021-05-02T05:57:58Z,0
83,UgyRwD6zMKkOsWpmdtZ4AaABAg,Shifting Mercury,@Charizard Emmy Yes. Exactly. That‚Äôs all you heard. Because his lawyer leaked an edited version of the recording. The actual recording is around 2 hours long and barely anyone has heard it because all the YouTube accounts that obsessively cover this situation get more attention by defending Johnny. I don‚Äôt even know if people realize that you can find the full recording on here. Plus other recordings. Amber‚Äôs team must have leaked them afterward. I will post a link.,2021-05-02T05:44:47Z,0
