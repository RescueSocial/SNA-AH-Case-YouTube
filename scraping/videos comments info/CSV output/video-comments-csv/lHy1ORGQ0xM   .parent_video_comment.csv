Neither Johnny Depp nor Amber Heard deserve the discourse, I personally believe they were mutually abusive and I don't give a fuck if I'm wrong. Actors can pay for therapy and keep their pathetic personal lives out of the news, the question is why the fuck don't they?",tortorcles,0,2021-10-08T00:11:07Z

9,Ugz71cayXHIZ8w0h2Pl4AaABAg,Not at 50 years old. He would have had a history and he didn't. AH abused her ex and her assistant and even stole her assistant rape story to fit the op-ed she did that he's suing her for defamation for. She claimed Johnny sexually assaulted her too beside the domestic violence she perpetrated on him that she flipped around to make it her abuse narrative!,Johnny's Girl,2,2021-01-06T08:29:02Z

14,UgwBPu-LpEbX24iDWwJ4AaABAg,"Amber Heard is the abuser, there are tapes, there is court transcripts she has been previously arrested, history of assaulting others.

15,UgztRXiE58D73fv2AKt4AaABAg,"He may very possibly be a narcissist. (Scientific research has shown more often men are narcissists than women). So that's a possibility.
She might very well be a narcissist. That's a possibility.
For sure, they both are either good at being dramatic, good at lying, or both, by nature of their livelihoods. So it's complicated.
For sure, we don't know the entirety of their relationship between them. We're not there 24 hours a day, like they were around each other. Relationships are very involving.
How old is Johnny?
How old is Amber?
I think he's older. He may have had a lot of time to fine tune himself, to either emotionally mature or just maybe refine his deceit ""game.""  It could go either way. There's at least definitely a Daddy Dom Little Girl Sub aspect to them. A lot of themes of power, control, and dominance, are present in their conversation.
It could also be Amber has a mental health condition. (Maybe Johnny needs therapy also to be atttracted to, or attract, these kinds of partners. He's definitely dealing with some attachment  issues.) She may have borderline disorder, bipolar disorder, or other neurological disorders. She may need medical help. Robert Downey Jr. was a better person after being diagnosed with Bipolar disorder. He went on to make the Ironman movies. As for the lives of celebrities and their public personas, these public personas are only their avatars. They may agree with or claim or say things, in the public arena, often times, which may only benefit or brighten their avatars. These celebrities may, in private, say or act in ways that are slightly different from their public avatars or wildly unrecognizable from their public avatars. Each celebrity makes that decision. But we, the audience, may never know. Unless we get up close to these real people ourselves.
It's definitely hard to see a beloved friend go through something intense, and having to doubt, even for a second, whether we really knew them at all.
Prestige, fame, money-- being a celebrity. In terms of relationships (even the relationship one has with oneself! Or one's past!), I can imagine, it can be really hard.
I'm just happy, to know enough, to say, when I don't know!ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüíÅüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüå∑",Jacqueline Mireles,1,2020-11-25T23:09:26Z
16,Ugxd8p7FBUIRiLvQxUd4AaABAg,Apparently JD spent many many hours in bath rooms trying to avoid the fights and violence.  He has also said he leaves to avoid engaging in violence himself.
