By:Jeanne Larson
Livonia, LA, United States
Aug 23, 2020 ‚Äî 

Yes, you read that right.

Just when you think she‚Äôs grasped at the last straw, she goes and throws a hail Mary like this.

Me, I‚Äôm still trying to wrap my head around how she‚Äôs suing Johnny Depp for lost work that she already got paid for by the studio. She‚Äôs not going to be in Aquaman 2, from all reports, but the studio still paid her for it.

How bad to you have to suck for a studio to pay you NOT to be in their movie?

But yes. Now Amber‚Äôs throwing out more subpoenas, just about every day, trying to smoke up the mirrors, all while trying yet again to get the case dismissed.

You know, for a woman who insists that she will not be silenced, she‚Äôs trying awfully hard not to be heard.

Speaking of subpoenas, I haven‚Äôt been served with one yet, to go and testify that Johnny didn‚Äôt have anything to do with creating this petition. Maybe the fact that I keep saying it over and over is good enough. Or maybe they just haven‚Äôt gotten around to me yet. Or maybe I‚Äôm just not important enough to subpoena. I suspect the latter. But it would be a GAS to look that flappy wench in the eye while I testify. Well, once or twice. The view on the other side of the courtroom will likely be immensely more pleasant.

But there you have it.

Amber Heard subpoenaed Twitter. I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs just to get information about Adam Waldman‚Äôs communications, but still. Who DOES that?",KrKest,0,2020-08-25T19:51:12Z

106,UgzmdA3ZaloIDUiS68Z4AaABAg,"My first thought when watching the video is that she seems so calm. Even after he starts really slamming things around. Someone who is truly being abused wouldn't be so calm. For someone that's being abused, this situation would spark fear because you never know when their anger is going to be taken out on you instead. She clearly isn't afraid or even remotely stressed. She even goes on to say that he was so SWEET and KIND. The exact opposite of what she's trying so hard to portray him as now. And not once did I ever see him raise a hand to her or even verbally abuse her. The most he did was get close to her and set a bottle down rather roughly. He's clearly angry about something unrelated to her but even so he's not taking it out on her. I know she's trying to portray him as violent here but he's just blowing off steam. Lots of people slam things around when they're angry. It DOES NOT mean they're abusive.",Paige M,31,2020-08-18T18:00:51Z

Glad? 
Relieved? 
I‚Äôm tired... and numb. 
What little we have known about Amber for eleven years has been negative. She‚Äôs only a few years younger than I, and this is how she treats people? And not e we hen she‚Äôs drunk or angry, but when she is sober and calm. Her friends?!? Her significant others!?! Her sister!?! Her husband?!? Her stepchildren!?! 
We have know this. 
And L‚ÄôOreal hired her to be a spokesman for female empowerment. 
Female Empowerment! 
I don‚Äôt feel empowered by watching interviews/commercials of a person who abuses and manipulates every person she is romantically involved with. I don‚Äôt feel empowered listening to a woman who exploited a minor for the paparazzi. I don‚Äôt feel empowered by seeing the face of a woman who broke her marriage vows and maimed her husband. I don‚Äôt feel empowered by a woman who stole the survival story of a real victim. 
I just feel disgust. 
Deeply. 
Profoundly. 
When I saw Aquaman, it was a conscious decision. I thought on it, debated with myself, and chose to go in spite of Amber. I had full knowledge (well what full knowledge we had at the time...) and I decided to watch it. 
But I didn‚Äôt know she was a spoken for L‚ÄôOreal. I‚Äôve been buying L‚ÄôOreal for years, and I had no clue. Not one idea, until youtubers pointed it out. Now, L‚ÄôOreal is tainted to me. 
Maybe that‚Äôs bad on me for not paying attention. And maybe it‚Äôs silly, unfair, or even hypothetical. There‚Äôs always a bad egg somewhere, you just have you look hard enough. 
I guess it the whole spokesman thing that makes me so upset. She wasn‚Äôt just a recognizable face to sell a product. She was an official spokesman specifically for female empowerment. 
I am glad they took her down. I truly am. 
It‚Äôs just that I‚Äôm so disgusted by the whole thing that looking at the L‚ÄôOreal products now sickens me. I‚Äôm not using them. I‚Äôll probably just throw them away. I‚Äôll not repurchase them. I probably will never buy any L‚ÄôOreal product again. 
Maybe that‚Äôs unfair. 
But it‚Äôs my hard earned money, and L‚ÄôOreal has lost my trust.",Rebecca Vaughn,16,2020-08-18T16:09:04Z
