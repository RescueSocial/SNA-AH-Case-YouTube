103,UgxBTrtLw5Yyeed-bFN4AaABAg,Skittles,I read that they reported that they are highly considering removing her. They get nothing but threats and demands from fans on every social media group and not one positive note. It been clear they don‚Äôt want to have a bad reputation and they want to make money from the movie. They ain‚Äôt going to get any money if everyone is true to their word and not go watch the movie. They probably won‚Äôt replace her with another actress due to the timing but IF they do some changes It will be getting rid of all her scenes and just have Aquaman by himself.,2020-02-17T01:36:28Z,5
