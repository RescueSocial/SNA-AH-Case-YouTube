3. Right, and men have higher muscle mass than women do. 
4. Biological fact is not hatred. And that's up to you if you value strength and consider it to be a good thing. Strength is something men inherently have because its part of their biological role ie. protecting, fighting, hunting""

2. Men and women should be treated as equals.

3. Men are not stronger than women it is and has been proven over and over that women have a higher pain tolerance and it depends on the muscle mass of the individuals. 

4. It is misogyny as it is saying men are better than women as being stronger is considered to be a good thing, but in reality it hurts both genders.

5. Men can be loving parents, are they always? No, but can they be? Yes. So I believe it should be based off of the mental state and how well financially, physically, and mentally an individual is able to care for the child/children instead of it being more of a biased system.",2021-10-29T15:10:03Z,0
104,Ugw5nOpEhayDSKnXGpR4AaABAg,drabnail777,"@Bunny Many things wrongs there. 
Feminism today was never about equality.
 Men and Women by nature , by our very being is not equal. 
Men are stronger among many other things, and that is not ""misogynistic"" but objectively true.
 But that does not mean men would want or care less for children, quite the opposite really (paternal love)",2021-10-29T11:04:10Z,2
105,Ugw5nOpEhayDSKnXGpR4AaABAg,Bunny,"@drabnail777 As a feminist, no. We detest her, if she was truthful naturally we would be supportive; however the whole purpose of feminism is for equality. Misogyny is harmful to everyone, an example is men not being able to gain custody as easily as a woman due to the misogynistic standard that ""men are stronger"" and thus they ""would be less likely to want/be able to properly care for a child/(children).""",2021-10-29T08:34:39Z,0

110,UgyrgWAaFPwL2u6K9Zh4AaABAg,Lord Generias,"Johnny had a lot of proof. Audio recording of her admitting to striking him (closed fist or not, she hit him and admitted it, and he recorded her admitting it), among other admissions. She said he hit her, leaving bruises, but not even a day later, a dark bruise on her face had vanished, so if that wasn't makeup, shes got one hell of a doctor. At one point, she was caught on audio recording admitting that she could accuse him of being the abuser and she knew no one would believe him.

And then there's the $7,000,000.00  (to be clear, that reads seven million dollars) she said she donated to the ACLU and a children's hospital. She paid a few thousand to the hospital, but never donated a penny afterward, several years later. If she did, where's the record of it? Anonymous? Why bring it up?

She lied, the entire time. In the other case, which was not about abuse, but about her and a magazine saying he did as though it were fact with no evidence backing it at any point, the judge was a personal friend to her. She knew this and never had her lawyer bring up that it was a blatant conflict of interest.

What's more, she paid her friends to perjure themselves, which they admitted because of how long they had to live the life.",2021-04-14T07:58:04Z,16
