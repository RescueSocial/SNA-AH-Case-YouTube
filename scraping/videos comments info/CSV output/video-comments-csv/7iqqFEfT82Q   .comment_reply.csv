1,UgzYlUUHHxXr-UNKT-B4AaABAg,Hungry Bamba,"‚Äã@CARTOONIVERSE1 No. My argument will be - if you're dumb enough to settle for subpar food - you have no right to complain since no -one forces you to eat there to begin with.

This guy stated facts, the only ""clickbait"" we had here is that Jason didn't officially say anything.

We can agree to disagree :) that's fine.

EDIT: your Chinese restaurant example doesn't even make sense here but sure lmfao.",2021-09-11T13:51:58Z,0

19,UgzPkfKwqin9p3xF-PF4AaABAg,Joseph Carr,@Mercurial Shift Well.. I would have to side with logic on this. I personally would look at her past with other partners.. and the same with him. If one of them has a history of being physical.. that would bring to light some things for me. I can totally see them both being physical with each other. At the end of the day we will not actually know the exact things that happened. All I can do is look at the evidence ... and hey.. u never know ... maybe they are trying to spin it so that J D is innocent because he has more of a box office draw? I mean I really don't know... I will research and come back to you!,2021-09-09T01:42:24Z,0
20,UgzPkfKwqin9p3xF-PF4AaABAg,Mercurial Shift,@Joseph Carr She didn‚Äôt break Johnny Depp‚Äôs eye socket. She hit him on two occasions and allegedly threw a bottle which somehow cut the tip of his finger off but that is up to debate since Johnny spent the night smashing stuff. What do you think of all the evidence against him or does he get a pass? He admitted to being physical. It‚Äôs not even really a debate . He said it. You should do more research. People take Johnny‚Äôs side because they want him to be innocent. Not because he is. I still like Johnny but he has problems he needs to address.,2021-09-09T00:15:14Z,0
