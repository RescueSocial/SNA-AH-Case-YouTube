Anyways, I have heard he was not a nice person on set anyways so yea... sounds more like executives are backing out of a project and using this incident as the reason and not the other way around. 

Equal rights for men! If a women destroys your life by lieing, she deserves punishment. It should be illegal to lie in court, but women privileges.
(I had an ex do this, she tried to take my franchise from me and basically burn me to the ground. Made up lies and stories, claimed I raped her in the back of my store, I had security cameras, I just asked for a date and time, i had 5 years of footage, after she changed the date and time several times, her plan backfired, specifically when I presented evidence of her texts to her friends claiming as such and she showed up with nothing but words and ""you gotta believe me.""

4. Leave ""The Batman"" in its own universe for now

You have to ask yourself if you saw an actor having are you the type of person who would respect their privacy ? If not would you approached them would you do so waving your arms around like a complete idiot  ? 


Miller from what I have read about him seems quite an oddball and I would be glad if he doesn't get to play the Flash again because he wasn't very good  in the part .That aside I think the fan was at fault for acting the way she did and Miller was at fault the way he reacted .I get the feeling they both had had a few drinks .",jamie torch,0,2020-04-11T14:05:50Z

We know all about Quinn's history as a con artist, domestic abuser, self-described as a rapist, and then shortly after departing DC being accused of driving a guy to suicide through accusations that appear to contradict evidence.

That being said DC should reset and all the way because I only really cared for Man of Steel and BvS. They caught my interest and wanted to see where it went since it felt like a spiritual successor to the Dark Knight trilogy and the style of movies of the time even Marvel had that kind of quality during it's phase one and for a hot minute in two and three. But they should just reset and use Joker and The Batman as ground zero for the new DCCU. Of course after releasing the Snydercut since I still want to see the climax to the original trilogy.

Reasons:
Wonder Woman: was pretty lame. It was Superman returns good but everyone made it out to be Batman returns good because when it came out and who was behind it.

If they canned two big name actors in a short span of time, it would not reflect well on them and the higher ups at WB would be breathing down their necks. So they will most likely in my opinion axe Ezra Miller and scrap the Flash movie altogether because they had no confidence in it anyway. As for Amber Heard they will likely keep her on but reduce her role as Mera in Aquaman 2. Most likely even with the backlash of her lies and behavior towards Johnny coming out, Heard will not see jail time plus even though her spat with Johnny Depp is just as prolific if not more, unlike Ezra there is no video evidence of her abuse (though there are audio tapes) but not being able to see her act violent in the flesh is different than catching her admit stuff on a recording.",barbiquearea,0,2020-04-09T01:11:12Z

screws tend to be more forgiving in that if you get something wrong it's easier to take them out and put them back in some place else. For a professional carpenter (which I'm not but a relation was) they tend to know they're going to get it right first time so use nails for that reason.
The impact driver makes putting screws in a breeze compared to a drill, but you tend to want to drill a smaller hole sometimes before putting the screw in so that the wood doesn't split. Also you have to be careful to put lots of pressure on when using an impact driver to avoid damaging the head of the screw if it skips around.",zebedie2,0,2020-04-09T00:24:46Z

1. No plan, no plan, no plan, other than ""Coo, our rival just made so much money uniting their heroes on screen, lets do the same thing with our heroes!""
2. Rushed into production without building the characters up first, we had Superman then suddenly he facing Batman in his second outing and for the third with Wonder Woman, they add three more people to the team and yet do nothing to build them up as actual characters beyond, One a guy who has a trident and breathe under water, one is mostly machine and the third can move really, really fast and they all came across as rather flat!
3. Top brass getting cold feet and firing person who been trying to guide the roadmap


What needs to happen is for WB to wipe the slate clean with a HARD reboot, starting off with Batman, find someone else to play Superman in a solo film and select the members of the Justice Leauge to be formed and give them either stand alone movies or roles as surpporting characters and then do a crossover movie and go from there, Marvel phase one is the building blocks road map that all shared universe films need to follow more or less.",superomegaprimemk2,0,2020-04-08T23:55:21Z
