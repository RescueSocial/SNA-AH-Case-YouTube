1,Ugy2ooirMhG7fIPqg254AaABAg,dontstandsoclose,@Rob's Rules From what I hear and read it's a jury trial so they have to deliberate over evidence presented and hopefully not with their feelings and emotions. This Virginia case might set a precedence as well for future cases involving women on male DV abuse. Johnny Depp will make history if this case is won.,2020-11-12T20:58:09Z,1
2,Ugy2ooirMhG7fIPqg254AaABAg,Rob's Rules,That is true. I can only hope this Judge takes everything into consideration. It was not fair that all he did was listen to her and not the overwhelming evidence presented to the Court. That is not a Judge,2020-11-12T20:48:56Z,1
3,UgxfHARdV-xnfj9E0HR4AaABAg,Rob's Rules,I totally agree and I hope people steer clear of that movie,2020-11-12T20:49:51Z,1
4,Ugy4CZ4NY2dRADNKRG14AaABAg,Diane Brazil,"@Rob's Rules I think just about everyone, including me, sees it exactly the way you do. Which is why there's so much outrage. It's SO obvious who the victim is and who the abuser is. I think in the long run, Johnny will win in every way and she will lose in every way.",2020-11-13T18:40:33Z,0
5,Ugy4CZ4NY2dRADNKRG14AaABAg,Rob's Rules,I believe Johnny. I believe that the evidence that has been put out there is overwhelming and it makes sense. I don’t see Amber Turd fans rushing to show all the evidence in her favor. I do see a mountain of evidence in Johnny’s Favor.,2020-11-13T18:30:55Z,2
6,UgyvcmG0SxyNU3AFRxN4AaABAg,Rob's Rules,He lost because that Judge is connected to Heard’s Attorney and that can be proven,2020-11-12T20:46:24Z,3
7,UgwKxjzs7gghj4EAZJV4AaABAg,Rob's Rules,Hoping so much that Johnny Depp wins his case In Virginia and gets his name cleared,2020-11-12T20:45:23Z,5

13,Ugw9gQTjteMkI3uD2Ih4AaABAg,Rob's Rules,"I agree with you. She should be removed. There is no doubt about it. WB is making a HUGE mistake and as long as we don’t see the movie, is when they will realize their mistake. That is how the message would come loud and clear",2020-11-13T18:36:13Z,0
