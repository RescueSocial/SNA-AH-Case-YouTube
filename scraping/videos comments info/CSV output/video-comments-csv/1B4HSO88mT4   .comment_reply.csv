4,UgxLaptRWrg-khSs5Ch4AaABAg,Retro Light,"Youâ€˜re babbling utter nonsense. Sheâ€˜s a very kind and likeable person with a lot of courage fighting against
Hollywood Gods. Hardly anybody did that before as everybody was way too frightened. Without her the
Current draining of the swamp in Hollywood would not have been possible. Sheâ€˜s nothing less than a
fucking hero to me.",2017-12-03T15:42:42Z,0

13,UgxrRenOQqmUNiH1knJ4AaABAg,Trans Sylva,"Deanna Stroh youâ€˜re just another mental Deppy. Do you think the people hiring Depp do it because heâ€˜s
innocent ? Lol  Donâ€˜t you realize that the system that now is protecting Depp is the same system
that allowed Weinstein to do what he did for 30 years ? Itâ€˜s all about the silent code that is enforced
on all Hollywood actors. Heard has broken the silent code (for very good reasons) and thatâ€˜s why she is
blacklisted and has a vicious smear campaign to face. Btw these are the same sanctions that any of
Weinsteinâ€˜s victims would have faced if they had spoken up. Donâ€˜t you see it ?",2018-02-05T17:47:42Z,2
14,UgxrRenOQqmUNiH1knJ4AaABAg,Dee,"Last Bear such BS. Depp had already broken ties with this ex Financial managers when the text messages came up. Feeble try. I cannot believe how incredibly stupid some people are. His manager, like heard have an agenda and a reason to paint him in the worst possible light. Just like Morrisett's financial managers, these guys will do time for their theft. You really are an idiot that can't see what's in front of you. He has movies booked back to back and the most recent that have come out have been blockbusters. There goes your theory. People can see what really happened, especially those that do the hiring in Hollywood. Just because you print my lies doesn't mean they're believed.",2017-12-04T12:56:38Z,0
15,UgxrRenOQqmUNiH1knJ4AaABAg,Seeking Truth,"Deanna Stroh I would support Red Sabbath, they were sued by Depp for misconduct of his money
and in their countersue they stated that they heard from different sides that he got physical with
her. They also state that the text massage is true, because they saw Depp instruct his assistant 
to lie about it ! This is basically proof enough that he did it. And after Weinstein and everything else
that is coming out from Hollywood nobody with a sane mind has any doubts that Depp is nothing
than a brutal, coward wife-beater who thinks that heâ€˜s above the law.",2017-12-04T11:51:52Z,1
16,UgxrRenOQqmUNiH1knJ4AaABAg,Dee,"Red Sabbath Exactly how can they back her claims if they weren't there? They were not. They are under investigation for fraud by the securities exchange commission and the IRS brought about he's suit against them. They are cooked. Just like Heard there's a major axe to grind. How sad you find someone guilty when the accusers herself never took him to court. She divorced him for ""ireconcilable differences"" not abuse. She had her opportunity to prove her case but chose not to after her deposition... you've skimmed the surface of this case and have been duped. Luckily the majority out there are a but more savvy.",2017-12-03T02:05:51Z,0
17,UgxrRenOQqmUNiH1knJ4AaABAg,Red Roses,"Deanna Stroh Deppâ€˜s ex managers who back Heardâ€˜s abuse claims were sued by Depp, the FBI has nothing to do
with that. Sheâ€˜s sued because of a completely different reason, because she ddnâ€˜t want to do a hardcore sex
scene. Iâ€˜m using my brain and thatâ€˜s exactly why Iâ€˜m convinced the Depp beat her. In fact it is so obvious that
you have to be blind or a Depp worshipper to not see it.",2017-12-03T00:06:20Z,2
