2,Ugwyu1NXBp_zxs5EfhR4AaABAg,Thank you so much you for posting! Male victims of abuse all too often are ignored but Johnny Depp is NOT one of them. He is a textbook abuser and it's so sad so many people do not see the truth. I fear he will go on to abuse other women.  I hope that when people look back on this they will be ashamed of how they treated Amber. Her strength is truly inspiring üíú,Natalie Taylor,6,2021-04-29T03:58:21Z

9,UgzOHLUZIal3uVxz4Mx4AaABAg,"Bottom line is he's an addict.  Addicts lie. To themselves, to others, to the world. They want everyone to believe they are the best person ever because their hiding who they really are. Who get's to see who they really are? The people they live with.  The spouses and children. They are the ones who take on the brunt of the abuse. She was a young girl who got taken advantage of by an older man. He wanted her because he thought he could manipulate and control her and hold her prisoner.  She stood up for herself and left him and told the world what happened to her.  He's outraged and does not want to let go of her.  All these lawsuits are his way of trying to keep some type of control over her.  If he was really done with her, he would just make a public comment, ""not true, wish her well, sorry it didn't work out."" End of. If he would have done that instead of of all these ridiculous lawsuits, he wouldn't be in the mess he is now.  But no, he has to try to push her down because how dare she leave him and reveal him.",Oblivia19,4,2020-11-09T14:11:42Z
