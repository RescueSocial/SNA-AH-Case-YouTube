9,UgxX9PXwoG7MewZzob54AaABAg,Rock Candy,@Kristina R i don't know the official rules of the different States but i understand from watching YT videos on this topic that she had no regulations with regards to embryo implantation - so in terms of her DV abuuse issues it was not a factor in whether she could have a baby by surrogate.

You ignore the facts I stated and rely on an anecdote as argument logical fallacy. 

Most kids who don’t live with their dads came to that sad place in life due to divorce. Most divorces, by an overwhelming margin, are sought by the wife. The vast majority of such kids do not want their dads replaced by a “father figure”, The sun child psychology literature is very clear and heart wrenching, the most common thing fantasized about by kids of broken homes is family reunification. So, your anecdotal experience is not only a logical fallacy, but also an outlier. 

It is also true that in huge numbers because the wife initiates the divorce and is the moving party causing the family breakup trauma and subsequent emotional pain to the kids, rather than admit to the children that she created their pain due to her own selfishness and expected them as mere children to sacrifice for her grownup happiness she will demonize their father to make it appear as if she had no choice and it was all his fault. 

These same women once they bring a new man into the picture— and make no mistake, the evolution airy science is quite clear, the man who dates and marries a divorce/single mother is of low social status and cannot attract childless young women who offer a breeding opportunity to create his OWN kids and further his OWN bloodline as instinct dictates — often coach the kids in the mantra you regurgitated in your comment, it is almost cult like. It is also for some odd reason far more common among the female products of broken homes than it is the males. 

You also identify your self as a woman who any thinking man would avoid as a potential wife, given that women from broken homes, especially those like you who advocate family break up and imposing new romantic partners on the children, are statistically far more likely to themselves divorce their husbands and take his kids. In your world, since mommy brought a new man into the home to replace daddy and everything was just fine it’s no big deal if you do that to your own kids.

An attitude such as yours is the last thing a high social status man with romantic options would want in a wife.",2021-07-09T18:02:11Z,0

The danger in saying silly things they way you have is that women get the false idea that men are interchangeable and she can just remove the dad are replace him with a “father figure”—aka her father or new husband.

In fact, THE most dangerous man in a child’s life is their mother’s new husband or bf. A child who does not reside with their natural father is 40 TIMES more likely to suffer abuse.

99,Ugzt1Yw1G2mMRmhp5_V4AaABAg,Stefanny Dvorak,"@Angle Daily Not exactly correct.
The proverb “It takes a village to raise a child” is an old Nigerian saying.
It is better translated as “It takes a COMMUNITY to raise a child.”

The meaning is more akin to the philosophy that the whole community is responsible for children’s good or bad development.

Because, growing up, children get influenced by their whole community.
Their mothers,fathers,friends,teachers,religious authorities and so on and so forth. Everyone in the child’s life takes a part in shaping who they become.

I’ve never seen anyone take this saying as a carte blanche to evade their parental responsibilities.

We can clearly see, based on the replies here, that it’s only the original poster who didn’t get that quote’s actual meaning. Because he (or she) ironically described exactly what the quote was about, whilst try to denounce it.",2021-07-08T22:06:42Z,2

Yes your life could be easier by avoiding people who come from dysfunctional homes but if everyone normal avoided people abnormal then that would lead to catastrophic ends.

151,UgxekbkCwG93LuTttAV4AaABAg,ScottCantDance,"This is the way of the political Left as a whole. They introduce economic and tax policies that make it more difficult to start families and raise children without state assistance.

Their news media constantly puts out fear articles about how the world is going to end due to climate change or whatever the fear du jure is, and why it's better to not have kids and how much happier you will be and how much more money you will have if you don't have kids.

Their entertainment media promotes sex and sexuality in a way that emphasizes only the hedonistic side of it, leading to things like the sexual revolution, hookup culture, and the great majority of women being on hormonal birth control.  
Sex and reproduction are the greatest drives humans have to form pair bonds and create families, and this de-links sex from reproduction, and ultimately even from relationships in general.

This all leads to collapsing birth rates, which threaten everything from the economy to social security, so then the political left along with their media turn around and promote mass immigration as a solution, which erases the identity and character of the nation state itself. 

This mass immigration they promote then makes it even more difficult for the native population to start families and raise children because of the downward pressure on the value of labor that waves of mass immigration creates.

If you look at the overall pattern, and the countries that it is being done in, and the periods of time that it's been done in, it becomes clear that it's about ethnic hatred against white Europeans, not related to their supposed claims of climate change or anything like that.

It's also clear that declining birth rates are very easy to rectify. Germany solved their demographic crisis in the 1930s merely by promoting mortgage loans with great terms for people to get married, and tax breaks for having children. They also promoted policies that brought production back domestically, rather than overseas, like with the textile trade.
Hungary has similarly fixed their demographic crisis, just during the time that Orban has been in office.
It's very easy to do, human beings naturally have a drive to form families and have children. You just have to put policies into place that make it EASY for them to do so.
