People like you who fear monger over a slim minority of cases where women Falsely claim rape, and get away with it while the vast majority of rape claims go without prosecution perpetuate a climate in which women are presumed to be lying before any evidence can be provided allowing people who would have otherwise been caught to go free because people don't take woman seriously. Lets say 100 men have been falsely convicted, I guarantee you for every man who was falsely convicted 50 who were guilty went without  conviction.
