7,UgzRX1NJ5YjfkJyNCYx4AaABAg,Cassie Campbell,there are strong ties to kids who were abused by their parents are more likely to fall for an abuser in the future. I don't know exactly why that is but you can look it up.,2021-04-11T15:17:35Z,1

9,UgzRX1NJ5YjfkJyNCYx4AaABAg,NIBS,"I am a survivor of narcissistic abuse. You have to understand the narcissist. They do not present themselves as they are. They ""mirror"" the person they want, reflecting the same interests, values, thoughts and personality traits. They are masters of hiding who they really are...for unbelievably long periods of time. They ""love-bomb"" you, shower you with attention, with interest, with support, with gifts...until you suddenly realize that they have gradually replaced everyone in your life. They are abusers--they want to cut you off from your friends and family so that you will have no support, no back-up but them. Then they trap, marriage usually. After that--they can reveal themselves. This is the part that they enjoy the most. Make everything your fault. Persuade you that you are crazy. Gradually let the violence out. Promise to never do it again. Become violent again. Blame you for making them violent. Mr. Depp had never met anyone like Amber Heard. He was at a vulnerable age, and was, quite frankly, a bit innocent. She saw the weakness and knew exactly how to exploit it. When Mr. Depp says ""I loved you for so many years, but you didn't exist. You don't exist, you're not there. You were a made up thing in my head."" that is the actual moment that Mr. Depp realized that the person that he loved was not real. It was all an act. She never loved him. Narcissists are not capable of love. It was just a game for fame and money. As much as he loved her, she was capable of completely destroying him, to get as much as she could financially, and because, to a narcissist, destroying people is fun.  If there are people in your life that you trust, be it friends or family, always listen if they tell you that something is ""off"" about a new person. It will save you from a whole world of hurt. May your life be filled with every blessing.",2020-02-13T00:13:53Z,8
