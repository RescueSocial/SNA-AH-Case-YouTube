25,UgwIsmQOz_Q5dqe_Xu94AaABAg,"When you hear these story's coming out about actors. You tend to believe them. I didn't Depps for a reason many will find stupid, dumb and crazy. I don't care, my nan was a huge Depp fan. Pirates, Alice, ninth gate Edward scissors hands. So many more. She always said he seems like someone you can trust and that he's kind hearted.
The story came out many turned on him some didn't. I stuck by my nans words and look at that they were right.
I don't mean this to cause offence to some. But part of the problem is a few things as I see them. The first being innocent till proven guilty. Now a days it's guilty even when proven innocent. We (as a whole) really started to listen to woman about abuse. No problems with that. But when some women make up story's against men. That's a problem. Like a man near where I live was accused. People slamming the man saying he should be killed. He had a go pro from that day. The whole event was made up. Only thing he had ever said to that women was excuse me. To clear to path for him and his bike. She knocked him off. And she called cops and make up the story of he was going to rape her. Like it's sad that our word the one thing we really have of value in life. Is pretty much meaningless. You have to record everything cause we've all been lived too soo much. We expect it.",Ian McLean,0,2020-09-05T13:46:03Z

209,Ugzgo-fwokMuHCXT0Vd4AaABAg,Johnny Depp is #1 when it comes to making alot of movies and he would be great in a any of those movies you mentioned and as far as Aquaman it made money because of Jason NOT amber because Jason was a huge favorite in Games of Thrones and he brought alot of fans from that HBO series to see his Aquaman movie. No one even new who Amber was before or after the movie so she wasn't the reason the movie made money. People only no who she is now because of Johnny Depp suing her nasty ass. Johnny Depp has millions of fans that will bring in money üí∞ weather he wins or loses his case because we all no he never beat her and will stand behind him even more so now. And people who didn't like Johnny Depp before these cases are now backing him up because they no Amber is a liar. Johnny Depp is a REAL HERO because he will go to hospitals and stay there for hours just to make a child smile. He will stand in the rain and sign every poster book or arm so no one is left without meeting him and getting what they came there for. He is generous kind loyal giving honest and none judging animal loving person who is humble and not flashy. He is the type of guy that will give you the shirt off his back to a stranger . Every person who knows him or has worked with him or for him will tell you he is one of the coolest sweetest people you could ever meet. Not one person has anything bad to say about Johnny Depp other rhen The trashy Amber heard. Now think about that and think about everything I said about Johnny then ask yourself who the hell Amber is and would anyone say even 10% of that about her? NOPE. and she definitely doesn't have a huge fan base or fans at all. Again people that are fans of the AQUAMAN movie is for JASON not Amber so they should replace or they will lose alot of the fans. Im a fan of Jason but im a bigger fan of Johnny Depp and if they keep Amber i wont go see Aquaman 2. If they are willing to lose millions or billions to keep her then they definitely are not to smart,DaisyDo,4,2020-08-28T23:20:29Z

213,UgyYz69GqU8i-Eug2_Z4AaABAg,"I ignored all the news on this because it feels like getting entertained by people's personal business, so I just try to avoid this. Then I heard the Heard tapes. I was in an incredibly verbal/emotionally abusive marriage for over ten years.  Hearing those tapes definitely triggered me pretty hard.  My ex had these moofs I called his, ""pulling wings off flies mood."". He'd get this cruel look on his face, and he'd pick at me, over and over until he finally had me in tears.  These moods came out of nowhere, and after he'd finally managed to push me over the edge into a total mess, I would see the OTHER look on his face, like a junkie who just mainlined some heroin after being on the edge of withdrawal.  He was delighted, he couldn't hide this satisfied, elated smile, like he needed the catharsis of breaking me. Then it was all hugs, and, it's ok, don't be upset, let's forget it, I forgive you, I'm not angry with you....  Yes, he would forgive me. He never did or said anything wrong. He never made a mistake. He was always right. 10+ years I think he apologized twice.  Anyway, I recognized Heard and her sick, twisted idea of love or a relationship. I'm just sorry Johnny had to live with that.  He consisted himself with discretion and dignity, another reason I didn't feel right about getting into his personal business, but they're comes a point when resistance it's futile.  All best wishes for Johnny.  AH likely treats everyone worse than she treated Depp. Make up artists, costume designers, assistants.

275,UgxjgprN_i0gavf1Mpd4AaABAg,"If Disney turns down Johnny Depp for Ghost Rider, especially with Robert Downey Jr's endorsement, then they are truly a lot of damn fools. The House of Mouse is on its way to the mouse trap if they pass this up.

Despite the embittered claims from A. Turd saying otherwise Mr. Depp is far from a washed out, fat actor. His name and face in any film are guaranteed for profit. Especially because fans want to support him so much. While I know Disney wouldn't let him back into the fold out of the kindness of their hearts it would still serve as good justice. And with the new penny pincher CEO in charge I have a strong feeling he will tell the executives that they cannot afford to dig their heels in over this regardless of who they side with between Mr. Depp and A. Turd. They'll give Mr. Depp whatever he wants because a movie with him is their only other way besides Disney+ to make money. Especially with the politically charged live action take on Mulan, which you know is going to flop.

So it's all a matter of seeing what Disney values more - their pride or their pockets.",LunaMane,53,2020-08-28T20:11:54Z
