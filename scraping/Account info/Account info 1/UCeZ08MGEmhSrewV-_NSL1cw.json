Thank you for watching :)\n\nI spend a lot of time creating my videos. Let me tell you a bit more about my process: I usually research new topics for hours on end until I find a suitable one. Once I came up with a topic for a video I start by writing the script. Then I record the audio before I begin with the editing process.\n\nOnce the audio is perfect I edit the video and make sure I include relevant footage that makes the video interesting to watch. This is the most time consuming part and easily takes 3-5 hours per video. Once that's done I upload the video and hope that you guys enjoy it!\n\nI look forward to seeing you in my future videos! Thanks for your support :)\n",
