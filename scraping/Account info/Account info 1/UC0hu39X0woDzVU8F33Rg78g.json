I'm a work in progress, like all of us are, no matter how long we've been on any path of recovery.  All of us want to live happy, healthy lives and while it takes work, it isn't impossible.  Narcissistic(or \"Narc\" for short) abuse has many layers, and none of it is easy.  It's not something anyone can just \"snap out of.\"  But we can embrace better things as we walk away from what doesn't work for us anymore.
