Seeing as though stories only last 24 hours, instead of highlighting 52 movie reviews, I decided to take my talents to YouTube. \n\nHopefully you all enjoy the videos enough to subscribe to the channel. Look for new videos every week, and feel free to send over any TV or movie requests that you want me to check out.\n\nI am currently based in New York City and the link to my Instagram page is below. Enjoy the ride!\n\n-Tait",
