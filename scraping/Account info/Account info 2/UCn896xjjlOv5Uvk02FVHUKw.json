We look at cases using current and old newspaper articles and map out locations  using google earth, which lead to the development of rational theories based on the reported facts. One of the main goals of this channel is to donate a significant amount of money to crime related charities each month including RAINN, NCMEC, Texas EquuSearch and many more.  We have also built a Forensic Genealogy fund for use by Identifinders, a company founded by Dr. Colleen Fitzpatrick (the pioneer in forensic genealogy).\n\n",
