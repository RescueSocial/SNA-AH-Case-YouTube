            "description": "Hello! My name is Justin and this is the primary channel where I'll be uploading the video edits accompanying my podcast \"TOO SERIOUS.\" There's no real outline or structure involved. This is just an opportunity for me to document the conversations I have with my friends and other interesting people. I honestly think the majority of people take themselves and their beliefs too seriously; and I'm starting this podcast in hopes to lighten the tension. A lot of what I say here will be in jest, so take it all in through the lens of a light-hearted dialogue. Thanks for checking out the channel and my content. I genuinely appreciate it. You clearly care enough already considering this is a super long about section and you're still reading so I can already tell you'll be fine listening to my mildly-offensive rambling. Welcome to the community!",
