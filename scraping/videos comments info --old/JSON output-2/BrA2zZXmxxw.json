People forget that Mr. Depp and Ms. Heard divorced in California...and California has No Fault Divorce, so infidelity doesn&#39;t affect the divorce in any way, but it makes a powerful statement to her character (and the character, or lack of it, of Elon Musk...who still claims he had no involvement with Amber Heard when she and Mr. Depp were married, despite his emails from 2013 to Directer Robert Rodreguez begging to arrange a date with Ms. Heard <b>even though Mr. Musk knew she was in a committed relationship</b> being made public, along with the videos and testimony that he visited Ms. Heard when Mr. Depp was not in the country and stayed overnight).<br><br>     The amount of hearsay evidence in this trial took me by surprise.  Not the hearsay concerning Ms. Heard&#39;s behavior...Ms. Heard&#39;s almost total reliance on hearsay evidence to support her claims of domestic violence.  It appeared from the Samantha Spector letter of &quot;demands&quot; sent <b>before</b> Ms. Heard made any claims of domestic abuse, that the &quot;abuse&quot; was simply a threat used to force Mr. Depp to comply with Ms. Heard&#39;s idea of a fair settlement.  Despite Ms. Heard&#39;s narcissistic personality, I still thought that she would have realized that once she had pushed Mr. Depp past the point where she could continue to manipulate him, the likelihood of his acquiescing to her demands no longer existed.  I still find it difficult to understand, even from a narcissistic point of view, why Ms. Heard continued with her plan <b>after</b> Mr. Depp showed up to the Penthouse Apartments <b>with two security guards</b> who witnessed everything that <b>didn&#39;t</b> happen.  But to continue after the 911 call was botched, so they made a second 911 call, and the police responded and insisted in doing a proper check of the property and Ms. Heard&#39;s person, and found no evidence of domestic abuse...seems madness...alright, it seems narcissistic.  After the Judge dismissed Ms. Heard&#39;s allegations of domestic abuse with prejudice, ending the restraining order, I thought that Ms. Heard&#39;s attacks were finished.  Now, I realize that she simply moved her trial of Mr. Depp to the court of public opinion, where you don&#39;t <b>need</b> any evidence to completely destroy someone&#39;s life.  It must have come as a complete shock when Mr. Depp pursued her claims legally.  That Ms. Heard believed that she could manipulate <b>all of the different people involved</b> and persuade them to alter their testimony as to what actually happened <b>when she knew that she didn&#39;t have any viable evidence</b> is a testament to her belief that she possess superior intellect, is a consummate actor, and a master manipulator.  Fortunately, during &quot;The Sun&quot; Trial, Ms. Heard&#39;s testimony was embellished to the point of implausibility, and Ms. Heard shows no signs of slowing down in the Virginia Trial. <br><br>     Still, it seems that Amber Heard has one, single person (Melanie Inglessis, who did not participate willingly, and filed a motion to quash the judges order to give live testimony by video feed, but was compelled to testify, because she voluntarily signed a declaration about events in 2016 for Ms. Heard) willing to say that they saw injuries to her body, on the night of the James Cordon Television appearance--even though Ms. Heard&#39;s personal assistant (Samantha McMillen) has testified that she saw her all of that same day, with and without clothing,  and she could &quot;see clearly&quot; that she had no marks cuts or bruises.  Ms. Heard also has one, single person (her sister, Whitney Henriquez) willing to say that she witnessed Mr. Depp strike Ms. Heard once, while he was still wearing the hand cast that rendered one hand useless.  Adam Waldman stated that Amber Heard had to sue her family to testify, and as this was her only family testifying, I assume Ms. Henriquez was also not a willing participant.  Other than those two witnesses, all of Ms. Heard&#39;s witnesses could only relay what Ms. Heard had told them had happened.  That is a lot of hearsay evidence.",
