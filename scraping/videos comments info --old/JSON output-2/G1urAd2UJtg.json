How is this still a question on who\u2019s the abuser?! How has this case not been solved? How is her career thriving while his is ending? ALL of his ex\u2019s came forward to tell everyone that JD was NEVER abusive to them and always kind! HOW with ALL of this proof, is she still the victim?! How has she not LOST the case yet?! I\u2019m completely baffled! This is the most ridiculous thing I\u2019ve ever heard and seen! She is nothing but a complete and total psychopath who gets off on ruining the lives of anyone who dare try to get her out of their lives! She not only gets off on it, but absolutely loves watching her lies destroy innocent people! She has no regard for anyone\u2019s life but her own!

She cannot just do this to a beloved, innocent, kind man! Johnny\u2019s only fault was marrying this POS! She is a truly horrifying psychopath who now knows she can get away with something this disturbing so this makes her even more dangerous! <b>FUTURE VICTIMS BEWARE</b> because there are absolutely going to be more victims! Please for the love of god someone take her down and give her a taste of her own psychotic medicine!!! Take her down before she can do this to anyone else! She has been proven to be a big fat liar many times! She says herself how she got the bruises painted on her face to screw him over! She\u2019s disgustingly toxic and manipulates him into thinking he\u2019s at fault too!

She tried to make herself seem innocent and sweet during interviews about the \u201cabuse\u201d she\u2019s SO despicable, dangerous, disgusting, a lying tw@$, everything about her SCREAMS abusive liar, fake, psychotic, who needs to be heavily medicated and locked in a padded cell!
