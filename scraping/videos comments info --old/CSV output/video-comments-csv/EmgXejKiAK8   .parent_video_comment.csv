2,Ugz7SDV8UAm3ORVvZ0Z4AaABAg,I wouldn't watch movies like that: Acuaman or superheroes any how.  I can't stand AH terrible acting. But people who like that type of movies. Do not watch it. This is the only way we can be heared.,Ariel Legolas,1,2020-11-15T15:44:00Z

That petition would have to go way past 3 million signatures to get the studio to rethink things! Hopefully, he wins and they get over 3 million signatures!",tom thorn,1,2020-11-14T16:23:41Z

6,UgzlBbpw8RAK4X7RZPF4AaABAg,"Whether Johnny wins or loses the fact that there are 1 million people who don't like her and want her removed says a lot. I know these petition don't do anything but it at least could affect how much she is in Aquaman 2. She may or may not be removed if she loses this next case but on terms of how many people will see Aquaman 2 and it's box office (despite where theaters are now) it will affect Aquaman 2 in a big way. Her role could get reduced she wouldn't be fired especially if she wins but to have her in the film a lot more than she should get or was suppose to be, I don't see it happing. Every time the audience see's her on screen they will turn the film off, walk out of the theater, be angry, sad, turn they're head, boo. No body will like her in this film. Now that is something Warner Bros. can not ignore.",MusicMan,1,2020-11-13T16:50:59Z
7,UgyRGg5o2wnlTNghcTl4AaABAg,"On the plus side for Depp he still got paid for FB even though he had to resign.  It does annoy me how many people in the comments support Heard though.  Are they saying it's fine for a woman to beat on her husband but not the other way around?  It shouldn't happen at all, but from what little has been made public it seems Heard instigated anything violent Depp did plus so many of his ex's have come out to defend him.  That's hardly something a wife beater would get is it?  Defended by all his previous girlfriends and wifes?

As for WB they are a hypocritical bunch and have proven that over and over.  Fire Hartley Sawyer from 'The Flash' tv show for tweets he made years back but keep Ezra Miller when he is on camera strangling a girl?  Fire Johnny Depp for allegations of wife beating but keep Amber Heard despite her being on tape shouting at Depp, severing his finger and having people (even women) come out saying she lied about Depp hitting her.",UK Media Warrior,0,2020-11-13T14:21:32Z

22,UgzcOQRXRQ8BjbU0Ewx4AaABAg,Wonder what impact it will have on the Snyder Cut coz that's the first thing coming out with her. I don't believe Grace Randolph but she keeps saying that Heard's role is reduced and the longer she says it I actually start to believe her.

26,UgzMwS7wSA5sPRh1lBB4AaABAg,"as someone who works in this industry, the Boss logic art is just that.. art. no other means behind it. in regards to Emilia Clarke, she is not & will not be Mera. She has said over & over again that she's ""done"" with any & all ""franchise"" work. well, for the foreseeable future anyway. she's even made comments about fully transitioning to independent & theatre work and more ""personal projects"" instead of big budget films in hollywood. she's distancing herself from hollywood.

in regards to the petition? nothing will come of it. i could see a recast MAYBE if JD wins his other suits against her & top brass at Warner/ATT are backed into a corner. i could also see her sticking around for awhile regardless of these suits & litigations going on. the studios don't really cater to fans & it's within their right to not to. so far, the petition & all the signatures are pretty much looked at as a bunch of people crying on the internet because they don't get what they want. is it a bad thing? no of course not. but a simple petition won't make a behemoth studio crumble.",OVODJAS,2,2020-11-13T00:24:16Z
