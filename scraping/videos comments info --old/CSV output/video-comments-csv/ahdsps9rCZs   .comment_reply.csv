''It's a slap in the face to all men and sends a message that false accusations by wahmen is still perfectly ok (as it has been for the last 30 years).'' From when courts have low value  in human society than the partisipation of that actor in hollywood movie nad by that she takes the sry????... seriously What!!!?? you mean that an actor who undenyble has commited crime(actuall torture an other human being) , but for whatever reason he gets the job and that somehow ,that means that the all society agrees with it, sends a message to other people or the men in this case, that its ok now??? , while by the law ,she  is already been judgeed , just beacause she will be in one movie or more , noone will forget what she did , not matter what , thats an idiotic idea that you say... 
Wow!! so courts for you have no value(and yet my ideas is bad) !!! and by your ideas a society say its ok when you have commited crimes if you are continue to play in Hollywood moves !!!! LOL 
Courts and National Law system  in generally are one of the principles of the human society , not Hollywood movies ... thats news for you !!!  so for you maybe by playing in movies somehow deletes the criminal record of  a person , but in really society doesnt ...",2020-09-04T16:51:31Z,0

44,UgwN2152C2JR22N-d0F4AaABAg,S B,"@James G    ''supporting her actions as are people like you '' that's abjective,and doesn make any logic , cause im not supporting the actions of Amber heard, what i want to say is that boycott a movie fro an actor who just partisipate in this movie , who its not even the protagonist , or the lead role ( cause its Aquaman movie , Jason Mamoa movie not Amber heard or Mera ) , i find it an exaggeration move , cause 1)this issue Amber and Deppes thing is at the courts right now , and Depp is winnig or won (i dont know to much about it, but i think the result is something like that),If it wasnt at the court , then i would be supporting the idea of boycot , but justice has prevail !!! no? 
And 2) its an issue just for the court(that has happend) , so it will be unreasible to chat here for who is the bad or good , when the judges have already comfirmed that Amber is the bad guy here clearely, and the name of Johny Depp is clear!!!
Also by say that the idea of boycott a movie cause of one actor is not good , doesn mean that i see with a good eye that this person will(or so it seems) to be in that movie ,its a shame, but not a reason to boycott , cause i sayed its at the court , and jsutice have been served. So there is no reason for more drama or ''blood''
