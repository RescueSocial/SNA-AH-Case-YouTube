1,UgzYlUUHHxXr-UNKT-B4AaABAg,Hungry Bamba,"​@CARTOONIVERSE1 No. My argument will be - if you're dumb enough to settle for subpar food - you have no right to complain since no -one forces you to eat there to begin with.

This guy stated facts, the only ""clickbait"" we had here is that Jason didn't officially say anything.

We can agree to disagree :) that's fine.

EDIT: your Chinese restaurant example doesn't even make sense here but sure lmfao.",2021-09-11T13:51:58Z,0
2,UgzYlUUHHxXr-UNKT-B4AaABAg,CARTOONIVERSE1,"Hungry Bamba- It's no different than going to a restaurant advertised as authentic Japanese sushi & finding-out once you eat there that it's owned & staffed by Chinese people making sub-par non-japanese sushi. Your dummy argument would be ""Well they fed you didn't they?""",2021-09-11T07:19:19Z,0

6,UgwRtPQ7hME-6P9fJm94AaABAg,Joseph Carr,People like you give hope to me. I honestly feared for my life with my last GF. Things that she would do. If she didn't get her way she would cut her self or pull out her hair.. or tell me to hit her. I never once touched her.. It scared TF outa me. She would purposely punch her self. I didn't want to be within like 50 miles of her near the end.,2021-09-08T21:44:12Z,0

19,UgzPkfKwqin9p3xF-PF4AaABAg,Joseph Carr,@Mercurial Shift Well.. I would have to side with logic on this. I personally would look at her past with other partners.. and the same with him. If one of them has a history of being physical.. that would bring to light some things for me. I can totally see them both being physical with each other. At the end of the day we will not actually know the exact things that happened. All I can do is look at the evidence ... and hey.. u never know ... maybe they are trying to spin it so that J D is innocent because he has more of a box office draw? I mean I really don't know... I will research and come back to you!,2021-09-09T01:42:24Z,0
20,UgzPkfKwqin9p3xF-PF4AaABAg,Mercurial Shift,@Joseph Carr She didn’t break Johnny Depp’s eye socket. She hit him on two occasions and allegedly threw a bottle which somehow cut the tip of his finger off but that is up to debate since Johnny spent the night smashing stuff. What do you think of all the evidence against him or does he get a pass? He admitted to being physical. It’s not even really a debate . He said it. You should do more research. People take Johnny’s side because they want him to be innocent. Not because he is. I still like Johnny but he has problems he needs to address.,2021-09-09T00:15:14Z,0

Johnny is being set up to fail because his fans insist on his innocence and he’s not innocent. If you need him to be innocent to support him as a person, maybe you aren’t a real fan. Not of the talented, complicated and flawed human being that is Johnny Depp. Only enamored by this idea of the movie star. You couldn’t give a shit about his actual struggles.",2021-08-17T22:27:30Z,0

Again, facts stated in court with evidence, including photographs of Musk with her in the elevator at Johnny's penthouse, her half naked wrapped on a towel leaning on musk, etc. This isn't even everything, just impossible to deny surveillance footage of the building.
