1,Ugwn3CJ__MUAY3AeAz54AaABAg,EAprima,"Not going to pay to watch the movie. That also means not buying the Bluray version when it finally comes too.  I will watch the movie for free in some other ways and WB only got themselves to blame. I think WB shouldn't keep her on, especially as she has stolen from sick children (the children's hospital), something that I wish was a joke. Sorry, you support a woman that do those kinds of things and more,  you can forget receiving my money.  Oh yes, I am not a johnny Depp fan. I'm just a person that followed the case, read all the statements, realised all the things she has done and became horrified at how she affected everyone. Cannot support a company that immorally stand by and support a person like her.",2021-03-04T12:34:36Z,3
