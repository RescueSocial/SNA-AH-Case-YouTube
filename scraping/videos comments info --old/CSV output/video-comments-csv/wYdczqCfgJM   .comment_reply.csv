Not at all the lier and so forth or other things that first were stated by her partners.  She never gets dumped or rejected. As far as story material. She is involved with endless women.

46,UgzMg4lfmrETH0ffvdR4AaABAg,PureSparkles22,"@Colonel KurtzOh, ur talking about the Star magazine gossip piece on Elon and Ambers breakup which basically said Elon couldn't trust her. she would lie she was home when actually she was at a club and acting as if she was single. I'll take star magazine with a pinch of salt cuz they have reported some inaccurate B.S particular in September 2016 about Amber being homeless and that johnny wasn't allowing her to get her things from his penthouse and that he had moved his friends in who were acting as guard dogs for him. But I guess we'll agree to disagree. I believe Amber broke up with him in August 2017. He was just donating in her name 1 month prior. I think he was a lovesick puppy for her up until late 2018 when her mask finally came off. Cuz in 2018 Amber got super skinny, she was doing cocaine, and she got major plastic surgery (cheek implants) it was a huge blow to her ego when Elon finally dumped her.",2021-02-05T08:22:24Z,1

The mentioning of her wanting to cuddle in bed was to imply that she was wanting to have sex with him - the man she claimed to fear. He didn't outright say "" She was leading me into a  trap"" and besides, he doesn't have to cuz anyone with half a brain can see what she was trying to do. She was trying to get Johnny to have sex with her so she could later accuse him of sexual assault. She was extremely desperate at that point.

100,UgzVPflWZ9nUv1zQIrZ4AaABAg,ElleJ,@Sheri bitton I know it’s in the court transcripts. Johnny said she wanted him to sleep with her in the hotel room in SFrancisco and he refused. He sat in the living room crying trying to make sense why a woman trying to bury him wanted to be intimate. I think also Incredibly Average  include some audio on one of his videos.,2021-02-05T23:57:01Z,11

102,UgxzUgLgjoPovGU1kYR4AaABAg,Bear,"I also suspect a lot of people felt duped by AH's claims in the media  where she received an outpouring of support and a not insignificant number of people (myself included) are very concerned that if JD is wrongfully judged by the courts in Virginia (after the arguably flawed, unfavorable verdict in the Sun UK case) especially with all the evidence that has come out about AH's actions, that no man can receive justice when they are the victim of abuse or gaslighting. Few victims will have the resources or the evidence that JD and his team can bring to bear.",2021-02-04T17:22:20Z,7
103,UgxzUgLgjoPovGU1kYR4AaABAg,Sheri bitton,People in America are now realizing that Amber is no victim that in fact she was the abuser. Were hopeful he will receive justice this year in Virginia,2021-02-04T10:21:23Z,11

105,UgwE8fI9kg9do327aeF4AaABAg,Robin Ryan,"Yes, I've wondered about the SF meeting. I've had much more sinister ideas about her motives. Like a spider, she meant to lure him into her bed and kill him. Yes. So she could have all his money and royalties. This other business is way to much  work.

109,UgxWWC0rWbpSgxmAsLh4AaABAg,Teresa Harper,I think she thought she could do whom ever she wanted to DO ( cheat ) Because she thought she had him wrapped around her fingers ( after she cut off his finger)  This girl is CRAZY..,2021-02-07T23:00:16Z,10

114,UgwnD5Z8zG4ShBj0P-t4AaABAg,How Are you,I think hes a dreamer who has probably lost touch with reality. Because let's face it AH is such a walking parody most people would be aware that she is bsing. She has no style or personality.,2021-02-05T13:51:20Z,6

116,UgxavoTvBOz3bxP2Pqt4AaABAg,Jessica Thomas,"@Mermaid It makes my head spin also. I was in a very toxic relationship. I can relate to him as far as the abuse, deception, and manipulation but she has done everything imaginable to him. I really believe he will prevail in the end.",2021-02-04T15:05:51Z,7
117,UgxavoTvBOz3bxP2Pqt4AaABAg,Mermaid,"@Jessica Thomas you never know with this type of personality. They feel alone and try to re connect with their exes if allowed.  She wanted to get back together after the divorse. If that would have made some difference in the trials, the eye's of the public or something? 
It's hard to Think like they do because it's such a selfish and distorted way it turnes my head inside out. 
I'm happy that JD have the public support and he finally saw her for what she is.",2021-02-04T14:14:05Z,7
118,UgxavoTvBOz3bxP2Pqt4AaABAg,Jessica Thomas,I agree. Didn't she get into bed in San Francisco and ask him to cuddle with her? I believe she planned to have sex with him and accuse him of sexual assault . Instead of her just claiming S.A. She would have D.N.A. to back it up. All of it seems like a horror movie. It's hard to believe that all of this happened in real life. Having his heart ripped out and dealing with all of the deception at the same time. He's a very strong man.,2021-02-04T13:59:03Z,8
