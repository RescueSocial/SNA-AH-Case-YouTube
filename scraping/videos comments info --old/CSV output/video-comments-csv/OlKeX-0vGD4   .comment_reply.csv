9,UgyR0EVihaz__S9USLJ4AaABAg,Evan Vazquez,@Kaytee yes that is a tactic to avoid providing the info. The ACLU figures since the op-ed was the main reason for the defamation they can get away with trying to use just that for the case. Their a charitable organization and anything that makes them look bad even more then they already do will destroy them,2021-06-14T16:12:12Z,0

Is an ALLEGEDLY non profit organisation which promotesALLEGEDLY progressive values in society. Such as action against domestic violence, racism, etc. The thing is that this apparently progressive organisation has become a massive institution which perceives millions of government grants and as we have found out, constructs false  narratives to detain and perpetuate the enormous power they have achieved in America.
