I was (emphasis on the past tense) the kind of gentleman women claim no longer exists; kind to a fault, willing to put other's needs before my own, ect. I followed the trappings of chivalry, yet more importantly, I lived my mother's training on how to be a good man to my core. Semper Fidelis... Esse Quam Videri... The ideals that mesh with the deepest parts of me. 

All that changed after 10 years of marriage, trying everything I could think of to save a ""sacred union"" and finding I was the only one. Two years of divorce and the legal, emotional and financial rape that came with it. The manipulation, the lies and false accusations that came with the debacle our current legal climate propagate to extort resources and the bias engendered toward the ""weaker sex""... I've been there, heard AH's lines before, experienced the gaslighting, manipulation and ""I'm smaller and a female, so there is no way I could be violent to you"". I've lived it...

127,UgxTchKFrXAeho55O4B4AaABAg,M M,"@Tiffany Daniels Speaking of Satanist, not to defend them or anything, but Church of Satan, LaVey's Bible, and even the Satanic Bible, all talk about pedophiles, rapists, and beastiality as horrible things punishable by death or worse. Anton LaVey says in his Bible that they frown upon it because pedophilia and beastiality ain't love because love involves consent and full understanding of what that is. A child has no understanding of it in that manner and nor does an animal therefore they can't consent. Cult stuff is very different and feuds with church of Satan on what he'd actually want his followers to do quite often. Those are the ones who make them all look bad because people refuse to look at the other side of it due to the fact it helps push their own religions like Christianity. Just remember, Satan was once an angel and always is the morning star. Anyways. God promoted through his Bible that you can be sold to your rapist. So people need to get their priorities straight or at least study things they clearly know nothing about. Coming from, someone who's studied religion before the age of ten and is in anthropology classes now. Also as a disclaimer, I don't know what Manson follows but I'm tried of the stereotypes towards religions as they aren't just black and white. They're all in a grey area.",2020-08-18T01:55:44Z,0

135,UgzSWbIJlUMTppZVsrt4AaABAg,Darklyn Stormember,"@The Amber Heard Playlist!! ¬†@Mandy Cole¬† This wine bit is true. BUT a great many people don't really care how much he drank/drinks.  

Unlike Amber, Johnny denies neither drinking nor using drugs (even suggesting that the amount typically spent on wine far exceeds 30k) and the trial isn't about either of those things anyway. Just like it's not about any potential affairs or claimed promiscuity on Amber's part. 

The difference is that the Heard team seems to bring up Johnny's substance use as if it's some sort of secret revelation that makes him an abuser by default. His struggles with substance abuse were never a secret. And substance abuse and spousal abuse are not remotely the same thing. Nor does one necessarily lead to the other. 

Depp's team, on the other hand, seems to reveal the lies that Amber has told with respect to her contact with various men (whether or not they were ever actually affairs) only to illustrate a pattern of dishonesty and not to suggest that any potential affairs would somehow justify possible abuse  - which they would not. 

While I suspect, from this post, that you are ""Team Amber"" as it were, you might still want to note that the focus on substance use is likely just a way to distract people from the lack of tangible evidence on the Heard team's part.",2020-08-23T09:24:23Z,7

276,UgzU-TN0Q3S_9fZUv8t4AaABAg,Karlyn Finnegan,Irrelevant. I am discussing this story and you‚Äôve got about eight distortions and fallacies  in that comment. It is how abusers evade and deflect from the actual subject. Much is known about this story and about what is dysfunctional and more functional thinking and behavior. Many people deal with abuse and sincerely want to understand it. Johnny depp appears to be going to any lengths to destroy amber heards life which was not only his stated intention several times but the evidence reflects that prejudice and abuse.  The fact he and his lying lawyers have stirred up a mob of trolls only proves his lack of empathy conscience and remorse. Thee is no excuse for his disgusting behavior. I hope she counter sues and these lawyers lose their licenses.,2020-05-10T00:12:19Z,0
277,UgzU-TN0Q3S_9fZUv8t4AaABAg,Karlyn Finnegan,"Contradictions are lower standards of communicating. It looks grandiose and deluded to healthier people to see someone reason like this. They will be appropriately prejudiced. The ignorance and the evil lies is repulsive to others. Amber heard was a victim of Harrassment and discrimination. And what mature and loving leaders do is discuss codes of conduct and core values and functional grievance procedures. Bullies imagine the victim is bullying when she is trying to do that. The reason is that they are so prejudiced that they imagine the person has no rights. A subhuman. And they literally falsely accuse the other of word salad and talking nonsense in a fantasy world. So much of this is psychosis. Schitzofrenia. They seem to be brainwashed never to talk about the past and no negative feelings should be felt. To disagree or criticize or elaborate or even just talk about reality is to them abuse and the other has no rights. The megolomaniac thinks she has a right to decide who has no rights. They can dish it out. But they can‚Äôt take it. Hypersensitive for the selfish self, and insensitive to the other. It is a narrow minded bigot and really a racist.

There is no nonsense in what I am saying and misrepresenting it as ‚Äúramblings‚Äù is bullshit. That is what is nonsense. Just saying something doesn‚Äôt make it true. This omniscient certainty is what you will see in control freaks in dysfunctional families. And they are just the type of people to bully someone in a situation like this. They play the big protector and are triangulators. It is exploiting Johnny depp and this situation for a sadism addiction.  And too primitive to read in paragraphs. Continuing to evade and divert and deflect from the actual subject, it continues to be ad hominem attacks which are maladaptive defense mechanisms. You can also pick up on the core maladaptive beliefs. There will be rigid rules involved. In a distorted reality like a Pablo Picasso painting. It is the script of the lowest common denominator. And it is exactly what average guy and waldman play. We recognize we cannot reason with them because they are deluded and so we back off and they strut around like they ‚Äúwon‚Äù. This is the abuser. It is no wonder the scum here identify with Johnny depp. They learned this nonsense language and they will even pick up the jargon and flip the script. Another thing you will see are the vague generalities of the political shit weasel. So here is an abusive woman and manipulating and dominating. It is ghetto gang 101. This is narcissistic abuse. And it can cause psychosis in others. It is Johnny depps lies and games that have caused this. It is such a shame to see people behave like this. They are not interested in learning and growing or understanding what this is and how people can improve. They are too grandiose and rigid and terrified to face reality. With a limited ability to understand their feelings and the twisted thoughts that cause them, they automatically shift blame to others and attack in a very provocative way. If this was in a neighborhood and you had a woman doing this, it can spur a psychotic reaction. And it is what Johnny depp does. It is true that many women abuse. And play the victim. And how they abuse is exactly what Johnny depp does.",2020-05-07T20:24:30Z,0

I don‚Äôt listen to anything anyone tells me. I mind my business, live my life, and do my own thing. I already know that there is crazy shit going on in this world. Am I going to act like fucking Sherlock Holmes and try to find everything out? No. I mind my own business, am wary of life, it‚Äôs people, and certain things. Brainwashed is the people who obsess over these things to the point where they‚Äôd come into the comments section, comment idiot on a comment about someone making a strong accusation about someone being a pedo where there is evidence that there was a weird ass man who used puppet shit in order to bring in children and rape them. The man is in prison. There is no evidence to prove anyone is a pedophile. Only the paranoia of people who think that EVERY celebrity is evil. They aren‚Äôt. That‚Äôs hard, cold reality. 

Only a moron would think that everyone who is a celebrity has ill intent. Some of them do. Look at the politicians who‚Äôve been accurately accused of child abuse and rape, battery, etc. Damned is the man that puts his faith in another man. That‚Äôs the motto I go by.

Did I know about this show? Of course not because I don‚Äôt spend my life invested in celebrities. I have a job, a child on the way during these moronic times, a family to take care of, and a life to live myself. I refuse to spend it paranoid the rest of my life. Shocked with fear, clueless of what is to come next. Many have been proven real, but MANY have been proven wrong. That‚Äôs another harsh reality people can‚Äôt swallow. I know people that are so hellbent in believing in something that they refuse to accept the truth. Another reality in this world. Denial. Neither you nor anyone else can say otherwise. I‚Äôm not going to turn into some brainwashed person, stuck in this limbo of paranoia. 

Martial law is a thing created a long time ago in emergency situations to control panic stricken civilians. To stop craziness. If there isn‚Äôt martial law, then people will get crazy, but out stores, raid homes to steal their shit. There will be an increase in crimes all over the US because it seems that we as a whole can‚Äôt make decent fucking decisions. Before martial law was used people were stabbing each other and fighting over toilet paper. People traveling and partying just to end up sick and cry that they regret not taking shit serious. That‚Äôs the sign of a country that can‚Äôt control itself. No wonder why they‚Äôve used martial law. It was used in the past during wars, but this is a fairly dire situation where it should be implemented. I speak as someone who HAS the virus now as we speak. I‚Äôm recovering, but the virus isn‚Äôt a fucking joke. I was severely sick and I am pregnant at this very moment. LUCKY that I survived and it wasn‚Äôt as bad of a case as others, but I still had it and felt miserable. It‚Äôs a reality. Continue to remain stuck in that limbo, thinking everything is a lie, making you your own truths, and rolling with it. Right or not you‚Äôre too invested in the negative whereas I will never. If I could I‚Äôd move the fuck away to an island, build my own house, and live my life without social media and the terrors of the darkness that lie within this big worldwide community, but I can‚Äôt, so I will find a way to block out the lies, conspiracies, and make a life for myself. An honest life. 

The idiot here? Is you being so overly involved in shit that neither you nor I will be able to change. We can‚Äôt change everything and we never will, so this will be the last time I speak with you.

Ryder has spoken out for Depp after his ex-wife Amber Heard‚Äôs abuse claims ‚Äì claims Depp strongly denies. The truth is, we can never know what goes on in other people‚Äôs relationships

What to make of Winona Ryder and Pen√©lope Cruz defending Johnny Depp?

Two women say Depp never hurt them, ergo, he could never hurt any woman? Ah, were life only that simple. It recently emerged that Cruz ‚Äì who has worked with Depp three times ‚Äì filed a declaration stating that Depp is ‚Äúalways kind to everyone around‚Äù. Meanwhile, Ryder ‚Äì who went out with him three decades ago ‚Äì said in an interview: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to call anyone a liar, but from my experience of Johnny, it is impossible to believe such horrific allegations are true.‚Äù I think you just called someone a liar, Winona.

Ryder and Cruz both know Depp personally, and it is entirely fair for them to share their personal experiences of being involved with him. But that is what those experiences are ‚Äì personal ‚Äì and is it really ‚Äúimpossible‚Äù for Ryder to believe that Depp abused his ex-wife Amber Heard, as Heard has claimed and Depp strongly denies? I would suggest that Ryder needs to expand her imagination a little here. I am delighted for her that she had such a happy relationship with Depp. But after they broke up he went out with Kate Moss and, one night in 1994, guests in New York‚Äôs Mark Hotel heard what was described as ‚Äúshattering glass, snapping wood and loud domestic squabbling‚Äù . When the police turned up, Moss was sitting in a trashed room and Depp was ‚Äúin a state of possible intoxication‚Äù. He was arrested for criminal mischief, a charge a judge later dismissed, and Depp paid more than $11,000 in damages to the hotel.

Now, trashing a hotel room is not the same as beating one‚Äôs wife, and 1994 was a long time ago ‚Äì more‚Äôs the pity in scary 2020. But is it really ‚Äúimpossible to believe‚Äù that a man who once got so drunk he violently ripped apart a room with his girlfriend in it could, 25 years later, possibly get drunk and violent with his wife?

Depp is suing Heard for defamation, and has always vehemently denied abusing her, so it is entirely reasonable that his friends would speak up in his defence as character witnesses. But when I hear women say: ‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt beat me, ergo it‚Äôs mad to think he could have beaten his ex-wife!‚Äù, it reminds me of people such as Len McCluskey and Ken Loach, who airily insist they haven‚Äôt seen any antisemitism in the Labour party, therefore it isn‚Äôt a problem. (Oh, did you think coronavirus would shut me up on that subject? You underestimated me, dear readers.) There is something fascinatingly narcissistic in believing that one‚Äôs own individual experience reveals all: McCluskey and Loach are not Jewish; Cruz and Ryder were not recently married to Depp. So their thoughts on these respective matters are, to be blunt, of limited relevance.

No one, as the cliche goes, knows what goes on in other people‚Äôs relationships, and the only people who know the truth about Heard and Depp are Heard and Depp themselves ‚Äì not the internet warriors who furiously rage in defence of their chosen idol, and not their friends. Every day, there are stories in newspapers about men who kill their children and/or wives, and they are invariably padded out with quotes from friends describing the killer as ‚Äúa family man‚Äù, one who ‚Äúloved his kids‚Äù, who ‚Äúyou‚Äôd never think would do such a thing‚Äù. Do these people not read other news stories? Or even novels? Do they not understand that people are always, endlessly, unfathomably surprising?

I was thinking about the mystery of others‚Äô relationships when reading an interview with the chef Marcus Wareing and his wife Jane over the weekend. Now, it has to be said that Marcus Wareing doesn‚Äôt come across as most Guardian women‚Äôs dream man in the piece. Choice quotes from him include: ‚ÄúI asked Jane for one promise ‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt ask me to change. She‚Äôll play Scrabble with the kids, I can‚Äôt stand that stuff. I‚Äôd rather be doing my own thing‚Äù and ‚ÄúI wanted Jane to be a full-time mum ‚Ä¶ I was never going to be on hand to help.‚Äù Jane adds: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve lost count of the number of times he‚Äôs thrown shoes into the street.‚Äù Cue much social media tutting. And yet, the Wareings seem happy, so who are we to judge? Good luck to the Wareings, I say, with their contented division of labour, and good luck to any judge adjudicating in further Depp and Heard disputes. The world may be strange and scary right now but, honestly, let‚Äôs all thank the Lord that job doesn‚Äôt fall to us.",2020-04-29T22:02:16Z,0

421,UgzNTVuzddZBQPzrjZ14AaABAg,Families Supporting Trauma Recovery,This is a fallacious comment. It is irrelevant and there is no evidence of that.  You are simply devaluing and discounting me and it is evasive and a type of staging and framing game. It is not funny and an inappropriate appeal to ridicule when you lmao. I‚Äôm here to discuss the actual subject. The reality is that both people are dysfunctional and there is real help for people struggling with these issues. Much is known about the manipulation and domination and possession played by Johnny Depp. His language and behavior patterns are all of those things. Amber Heard clearly has her own character defects. She had no discernment from the beginning and is not qualified to handle someone with his issues. Not was it a healthy group around him. The best thing she can do is get real help for herself. If people around him truly care then they have work to do themselves to learn more about dysfunction and abuse and politics and psychological warfare.,2020-05-04T18:59:37Z,0
