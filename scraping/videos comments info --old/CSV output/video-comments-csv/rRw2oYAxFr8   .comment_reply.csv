7,UgxrC_9yKSUYmv9D_HN4AaABAg,TheAcePool,"You grow deeply attached to vintage iron like that Mustang. It's an expression of who you are. They took it from her without even asking and completely changed the car to something that she had no input on. To a person like myself that cares deeply for classics, that would be like a stab to the heart.",2018-03-18T23:54:39Z,2

13,Ugg5VnYSIR1ja3gCoAEC,Dave Clark,"It's not a 'right' it's a privilege, which all the other guests appreciate because they couldn't even dream of being able to do (afford) this. 
Now Johnny and Amber despise each other and she probably hates this car for what it represents. And Depp has now had this episode 'disappeared' from the Overhaulin Series, so it's not aired on TV anymore.",2021-04-21T16:22:29Z,0
