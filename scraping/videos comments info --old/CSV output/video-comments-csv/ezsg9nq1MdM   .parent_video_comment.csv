You can watch this movie that even your grandmother who doesn't know anything about Aquaman or DC will still appreciate it. Its story even Topo his side kick is also base in comics so the story is based in comics. It has a heart but not too dramatic, light comedy not too stupid but will give you a smile and brief laugh and full of action (great old and new stunts) . I recommend you watch it on IMAX.

The action, oh my god, is like Batman's Warehouse fight in BvS, that level of quality in every fight. It isn't just brute force and power, it actually portrays skill between the fighters. Nicole Kidman and Amber Heard actually killed it, powerful female action leads, like you wouldn't believe. Patrick Wilson as Orm, the best fighter there, not a great villain, but the best warrior. Loved the Ending of the movie, not the cliche villain forces the hero to kill him or kills himself kind of thing. It's simply awesome... 

I hope they keep this up! In my opinion, they should wait a few years before planning a sequel, take their time with the plot and build the universe from there...",John NK,309,2018-12-19T15:41:00Z
