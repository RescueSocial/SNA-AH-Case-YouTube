11,UgyDE_XG1xZ2OzbSwGF4AaABAg,Stephanie Sandlin,"Disney is full SJW.  Being California based and not wanting to harm their primary bread and butter audience - women - they will not take a position that will harm them.  In this case,  Johnny just by being accused is perceived as a damaged property and they don't want the wrath of the SJW and #metoo activist culture baring down on them for hiring a 'horrible' man. It's a fear move.  See it as nothing else.  If anything,  what JD is doing now, at minimum even if he loses, is damaging AH's reputation to such a degree that employers may avoid her too.  The kicker? She doesn't have the insight due to her cluster b personality traits to know her actions created all this.  She's deflected and gaslighted it all onto him.  This is the most scary aspect of her.  Her splitting him all bad, she's woven a fantasy narrative projecting her behaviors on to him.  Studios aren't going to want her attached to their projects because of her negative publicity that'll overwhelm the PR they are trying to avoid.  This is JD in 'times up' mode to her.  When you anger a guy like JD with deep pockets that can drag into court after court, you play nice.  Her cluster b traits have put her in such a place, she's on the STAND making a mess of claims.  This is how narcissists fall in terms of accountability, making them go on THE record.  He's dismantling her career and holding her accountable.  JD will lose Disney, but AH has a lot to lose and the more she's exposed the more at risk her life becomes.  But, the narcissist doesn't see that.   I will say this though,  her leaving the british court looking dejected the last few days,  that was a sign she knew she got boxed in. She got called a liar in open court. Ouch. The judge opening asked if she had been diagnosed with Bipolar. Double ouch.",2020-07-22T19:03:53Z,0
