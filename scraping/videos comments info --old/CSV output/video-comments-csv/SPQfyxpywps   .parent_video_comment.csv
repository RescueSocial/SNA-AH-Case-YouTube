5,UgxwPOZh-Y8iHbu4o714AaABAg,Amber heard has lied about the whole thing she was the one who abused Johnny Depp and Johnny never abuse Amber or anyone else ever she was the only one who did this to Johnny out of all his relationships why her  and if he was so abuse why her and no one else makes know sense to me,Megan O'Shea,2,2020-10-17T00:56:02Z
6,UgwwEDLTZrE-WhydRr14AaABAg,"Her photos show her face red. Not bruised! Johnny has photos of himself bruised and battered with a severed finger when she threw a vodka bottle at him and it shattered the bone and it cost him a MRSA infection three times that could have caused his death along with a cigarette burned on his face. And she even made jokes with her friends about killing him using their knives. Johnny's exes say he never abused them. She is also not sweet. She was verbally abusive and said that nobody will believe him. The reason why this is important is because many men are abused 50% of men and they are not believed more than women are not believed. Maybe more men will now speak up about it because Johnny did. And about that video. Johnny's mother died of cancer that week and he was emotionally upset. But if you listen to audio tapes of them you can hear a calm Johnny Depp and a rambling yelling, screaming Amber upset because he won't ""fight"" with her. So that video of him slamming things was at a very upsetting moment. His mother just died. Give him a break!",Johnny's Girl,2,2020-10-02T09:24:52Z

She picks up the phone, smiles and laughs. Then it cuts off. Both her and TMZ set him up. The video was taken the same day, he found out he lost 650 million dollars and was within days or weeks of his mother's death! She is evil! Plain and simple. The YouTube channel Incredibly Average does a great analysis of the tapes that have been released. Everyone should check it! She is f-ing crazy!!!

62,Ugwzbrsbg-a0BQDi7Hl4AaABAg,"This needs to be investigated fully, not just by social media and lawyer justice. Investigation, finding of facts, witnesses, testimonies, lie detection tests and finally if applicable, prosecution/repercussions. 

America nowadays bypasses most of that and goes to unfounded unprofessional social media which is heavily based on emotion, hearsay and crowd think; then straight to lawyers who play with worlds and legal technicalities. 

This will be the undoing of American society if it is not stymied and rectified. 

Look at Donald trump. ( by the way I’m in Australia, however your whole sordid political landscape has become a revolting fascination over here. Thanks to stupid shows like Plannet America, hosted by infantile journos and homosexuals sensationalists... (is that one category or two...?). Ever since he’s been elected there hasn’t been a day where the word impeachment hasn’t been brandied about in reference to him. Now presumably he’s been acquitted by a competent and accurate court ( to say that is not the case simply because it is not the result you may have wanted completely negates your whole justice system if you do so, and is a completely seperate matter entirely). If I were trump I would take a gamble and sue the other political party for slander, and do so with every dollar I had at my disposal. Let’s not forget that while this trial has been going on, who’s running the country, doing the things that this important office does daily. The handbrake has been on for trump ever since he started, as he was never suspected to win. The impeachment debacle has only been pathetic diversion, that EVERY American should be ashamed of.

Notice how quiet it has become in the Amber Heard camp? If she’s guilty, she should go through what Depp himself has had to endure. I personally will never watch anything with her in it again ( not that I have yet anyways)",Snozzy Bosch,0,2020-02-10T05:34:24Z

It's unfortunate that there are people out there who are taking advantage for whatever reason, and even before the ""Me Too"" and newer feminists movements started.. You couldn't trust what people said. That's why I ask.. Why do you think there was a movement? Because people just decided not to listen or trust women? No!

125,UgyNCZ-N-KUo5CCTZpN4AaABAg,"11 Facts that will make you change your mind about Johnny Depp 
(or Evidence Amber Heard falsely planted evidence of domestic abuse)



1) After receiving a domestic disturbance call from Amber Heard, the police visited Depp's home to discover neither a damaged house nor any wounds on Heard's body as she would later claim existed in court and social media. Though Heard later criticized the police's handling of the case, LAPD vehemently denies negligence and that there was absolutely ""no evidence of a crime."" 

2) Heard once yelled, ""Stop hitting me, Johnny,"" unaware that Depp's security team were ""just a few feet away"" outside of their room. When the security team entered within seconds of her screaming, they were perplexed to discover Heard on the sofa and Depp in the kitchen about 20 feet away from each other. 

3) Heard's own stylist Samantha McMlillen recently testified that Heard had not a single bruise, cut or wound on her face or body while McMillen prepared her to appear on the James Corden Show. She spent much of the day and evening with Heard after the alleged assault and saw her ""in good light, at close range, wearing no makeup."" McMillen also found it extremely odd that after Heard finished the show, she told McMillen, ""Can you believe I just did that show with two black eyes?"" But she had none. To McMillen, it all made sense after Heard went public with her domestic abuse allegations.

4) The couple's neighbour and friend, Isaac Baruch, reported seeing Heard the morning after the alleged fight and claims she shouted, ""He hit me! He threw a phone and hit me!"" While Heard ""stretched her neck"" to show Baruch her alleged injuries, he couldn't see anything remotely close to a bruise or cut that day or even the rest of the week.

5) Five concierges and a security guard were shocked when Heard revealed pictures of her wounds on social media as they had seen her all week without any. Trinity Esparaza, the owner of the concierge company of the building where the couple resided at the time, went back and reviewed security footage because she suspected Heard's allegations were ""false"" as the ""time didn't add up."" Esparaza had seen Heard ""several times"" without marks on her face as did general manager Brandon Patterson, security guard Alex Romero and two other employees who also reported having serious doubts as they clearly saw Heard ""without bruises, cuts, redness, swelling or any other injuries to her face."" 

6) A security guard working at Heard's 30th birthday party has recently come forward that he witnessed Heard punching Depp in the face and bruising his left cheek. This corroborates the photo of a bruised cheek submitted by Depp's lawyers which is interestingly more pronounced and visible than any of Heard's photos of Depp's alleged assaults. On top of that, Heard herself has now reluctantly admitted on camera to violently attacking Depp, as to avoid perjuring herself. 

7) All of Heard's witnesses are her close friends or people with a conflict of interest such as Joel Mandel, Depp's ex-manager who Depp was suing for spending millions of dollars without his permission. On the other hand, Depp's lawyers have now gathered 87 surveillance camera videos and 17 sworn depositions by neutral third-party witnesses that dispute her story while proving Depp's. There are even past girlfriends of Amber Heard that are coming forward who claim she is the truly abusive person.

8) In contrast, all of Depp's past lovers including Vanessa Paradis, his girlfriend for 14 years, have strongly disputed Heard's characterization of Depp. Paradis has said, ""I believe with all my heart that these recent allegations being made are outrageous."" She also added that Depp was never physically abusive and was a gentle being. However, Heard has a history of domestic violence as she was arrested and charged with domestic violence against her then partner, Tasya van Ree, in 2009. 

9) Depp had confided in his close friends prior to the divorce that Heard was trying to blackmail him, threatening to go public with false domestic abuse allegations. Close friends of the couple, including Doug Stanhope, have reported that most people knew how manipulative and abusive Amber Heard was early on but did not have the courage to confront Johnny Depp about it before it was too late. When Stanhope went public with the truth, Heard silenced him by suing him for defamation.

10) Besides intentionally ruining Depp's life for her own personal gain, Heard has done other questionable things such as 1) filing for divorce just two days after Depp's mother past away; 2) dating Elon Musk one month into her marriage with Depp -- a claim that is corroborated by several witnesses working late night in Heard's building; and 3) needlessly going public with images of her alleged abuse amid her divorce despite claiming she didn't want the attention.  

11) Amber Heard was named a Human Rights Champion by the United Nations and an ambassador for women's rights by the ACLU after the divorce despite the questionable evidence surrounding her allegations. She also became a global spokesperson for L'Oreal Paris and retained her role on Aquaman despite people's misconceptions about her career being negatively influenced.

Another question why did she stay for 7 years of them being together and when the cops came she never told me that she needed help when the cops saw her and Johnny and the cops saw Amber never had any bruises or injuries until a few days later claiming it happened the night of that the cops when they saw her. This is a mystery to me. Nothing adds up and the video of her describing the story she can't describe her face in words if he scratched or hit her since she doesn't know what words to put it together to make it believable for court and audience. I've heard of Amber Heard since she starred with Johnny Depp in 2011 when I first saw the movie when it came out before when they started dating and I never thought both of Johnny Depp and Amber Heard would ever come back 7 years later like two gorillas attacking each other in boxing ring. I love Johnny Depp he is my idol and inspiration to me he taught me my love for acting and want to persuade in career wise but what's strange is Johnny Depp had had other woman's even Vanessa Paradis when she was with Johnny for 14 years and other woman before her and every single one of them said Johnny always respected them, treated them right and was always a good father and wanted to do good in this world doing what he loves but when Amber and Johnny gets together and this hell she describes in this footage this story makes me wonder when did all this start and what or who started this bad blood between them? If johnny depp tried to kill you where is the weapon he used? Do you happen to have that weapon to use it as evidence or did he use his bear fist to smash your face until you are brain dead since no evidence has been showed that is hardcore evidence to prove he TRIED TO KILL YOU or abused you in any way. J.K Rowling said Johnny Depp showed her footage to prove to her he never abused you but you are using pictures of yourself that someone is taking of your face and since you can hire makeup artist or a friend or paying someone hush money and accuse Johnny and no witnesses has come forward makes me think what is she trying to get out of this story what is she trying to prove and even if she proves or doesn't prove what is she trying to get out of this story? Sounds like to me she wants to continue with these claims even though she's already divorced from Depp and staying away so what's the point of this drama? Why can't she just do her job audition for roles and live your life but she chose continue with these claims. These claims that are on going doesn't sound like to me these claims won't end anytime soon since she would do anything to boost her career and ruin Depp career and Depp wants to ruin her career because he has more money than Amber and Johnny paid her for support and she donated it so I don't understand the ongoing point of this story both are trying to tell. I'm not choosing sides between Depp and Heard but I'm saying she is just wasting her time trying to prove instead of moving on with her career and life. Johnny is crazy to pay $50 million defamation over an op-ed she wrote for The Washington Post in December 2018 instead of saving that $50 million on something that's useful instead of Amber false writing back in 2018. Both of them need to move on because we will NEVER know the truth who is telling the truth or not because nobody was there in the household with them to witness the truth so nobody like no press, Johnny Depp fans or Amber Heard fans or court or anyone in the world will EVER KNOW THE TRUTH OR THE POINT OF DEPP AND HEARD DRAMA and even if we find out now or ever nothing can't change the past or which one of Heard or Depp career. Both of them will always be successful since actors when bad things happen they continue to audition for more movies in order to sustain themselves to put food and a roof over there heads. Amber doesn't have hardcore evidence to prove anything if she did all of this drama would of ended a long time ago but all I hear is different stories and both filing a lawsuit but where is evidence that proves 7 years of abuse and she is the one that said yes to moving in, yes to an engagement and marriage and she defended him many times before all this accusations came about. I was sexually assaulted multiple times by multiple guys about 3 of them and physically and mentally bruised and there was blood coming out and my wrists were bruised, tears and trauma since the day a rapist took my virginity the day I had my first kiss and other guys when I told them what happened they used it as a weakness and lied and took advantage of me again and again and put fingers in my mouth and pulled my hair and one of them took video, pictures and messages but so for me as a victim of physical and mental abuse I know that Amber Heard story doesn't add up because I know from experience the truth and a lie and the hardcore evidence to prove. Her story doesn't make sense its just story but no facts of evidence. She can tell the world anything but to me personally someone out there will use her story to take advantage of her just like me when I told the truth even the evidence nobody cared and it won't change anything.",Jazz Showbizz,0,2019-04-14T00:07:52Z

Instead, every time one of these situations comes out, the public are implored to make firm judgments of people despite only having fragments of the actual facts.  And ultimately this maximalist position undermines real justice and due process, because all it will take is a handful of Jussie Smollett situations for people to start not ""believing victims"" again.


We should want a criminal justice system that takes these allegations seriously, and tries to make victims feel comfortable coming forward immediately, so crime scenes can be investigated and evidence gathered.  There's lots of evidence that, for example, rape allegations haven't been treated with the seriousness they deserve (ie. stories about evidence lockups filled with unprocessed rape kits).  But none of that requires anyone to simply ""believe"" anything - or on the flip side, to accuse anyone of lying either.

291,Ugwg8Bv8OB_PpoCj2-B4AaABAg,"It's taken 3 years because Depp's lawyers settling the divorce were also lawyers to Elon Musk.  It was reported back in 2012 that Musk had an interest in Heard.  Musk's lawyers buried the surveillance video and witness statements because the CCTV videos show Musk visiting Heard overnight multiple times and specifically while Depp was in Australia filming POTC5 and only one month after Depp and Heard were married. Musk was also married at the time. Depp's  new legal team obtained  those videos and statements. In the past 3 years even with an NDA in place, Amber Heard has breached it by claiming to be a victim of domestic abuse and each time she does she is ascertaining that Depp was an abuser. Depp now has the evidence to prove his innocence.  As an aside, Musk is also one of the biggest supports of the ACLU.  That explains how Heard got her position as their spokesperson. 

As far as the video is concerned, it was highly edited with no metadata as to when and where it was taken. We now  know that Depp had just learned that his business managers has swindled him out of millions of dollars. And if you listen to her side talk on the video she is goading him and trying to fuel his anger. His most angry moment is when he realizes that she's filming him. And by the way, as evidence that video is what they call ""fruits of the poisonous tree"". It was obtained unlawfully, she didn't disclose that she was filming him and it is not likely admissible in court.  

She sold all of her evidence, her witnesses are all her friends who benefitted by living on Depp's dime on his properties, rent free.  And her first step to get out of the marriage was blackmail. She (her lawyers) sent a letter to Depp's attorney demanding $50,000.00/month for life, their Range Rover and 3 of the 5 condos Depp owned, where she and her friends lived, including he would also pay of maintenance and utilities in perpetuity for those properties. In the demand it said that he needed to sign over all of this stuff or she would be going public with her allegations. That's extortion.  And they gave him 48 hours to agree.  It's my feeling if he knew he had abused her, his team would have reached out to her and settled and the media would only have heard that the divorce happened. 

If you want to see some good investigation on the witnesses and the video, look up Incredibly Average here on YouTube and watch the 3 videos that show the details on witness credibility or lack thereof.",Admirers of Johnny Depp Count,6,2019-03-28T17:07:38Z

Also in terms of the video of him, anger is a normal reaction to being abused. Victims constantly have someone messing with their head and manipulating them.

There is no more ""innocent until proven guilty"" after you Tenderfoots sacrificed freedom for false security.
You know why the Prequels are hated & LOTR is adored by a certain age group?
Because it represents Them.
Pawns in an insidious scheme that makes us enablers of endless war is harder to digest than scary Black orcs, Wicked Brown Men from the East, & Evil White Pagan Wizards who literally use suicide bombings in the Two Towers against Men from the West.
Why do you think Americans ate up stupid violent content like ""24"" & ""Saw""? Torture needed to be socially acceptable again. Just like the macabre literary explosion in the 1800s could arguably trace it's origins, as a reaction, to the atrocious War of Manifest Destiny that continues to this day.
America was founded, built, and prospered under Violence & War. This is a cycle that needs to end as we advance in technology.
The answer is simple: put down the weapons & stop fighting.
Use Cannabis and it's Unlimited Non Toxic Resources to provide food, clothes, medicine, homes, and energy for Everyone.
Many know this because it's Common Sense.
You can Hate all you want, just Stop Fighting. Stop Killing.

 The women who don't have the resources of Heard are the losers here.
 It's also DV survivor behavior to wait. 
 He's not listening to the video....the one she taped .....she's the one abusing him, clearly they, like everyone else, didn't LISTEN to her lie 3x in less than a minute .
 He was EXTREMELY upset about his business managers, who he trusted for nearly 2 decades, for stealing 20 MILL, & they fired a girl who refused to notarize a expenditure that Depp didn't authorize. 
 I'm a psychologist, but it's like they're having 2 completely different convo's, he's saying she wasn't there, she says she was....then admits she wasn't there. She's goading, gaslighting, & baiting him ...even TMZ said that!!!! Did you drink all that?.....the bottle's not that empty, & THEN SHE MOVES TOWARDS HIM! That's something NO ONE would do if they were afraid!
 If that wasn't giveaway enough....
 He says TO APPARENTLY THIN AIR "" Oh I'M crazy. I'll show you crazy....ALL YOUR CRAZY""... in a non menacing way. 
 So he's used to her crazy behavior by then. He's calling her crazy & not contradicting himself with lies....3x
 So why believe her? Because she's talking in the FAKE soft voice??? Ewww I'm so scared.
 There's a reason she never made it in Hollywood on her acting skills.
 He wasn't even facing her....if she felt threatened she could have left the way she came in....like a dirty lying whore.
 I can't wait to see how Elon Musk gets out of this!!!! He claims he wasn't at Depp's penthouse 1 mo after they were married, supposed to be a smart guy...COUGH SECURITY CAMERAS EVERYWHERE!!!!! And she asked for a parking spot for him, he came in late at night & left in the morning.
 Apparently Depp never said anything to her, knowing all along. I'm sure he was very hurt & he basically internalizes anger where she EXTERNALIZES anger....that's why almost all his X's said he would never hurt another human being, much less someone he loves.

Woman always were the target of villence, but in an more equal of rights and acts country like the united states, another phenomenom happened. The fact that women take a rol as a fake victim in order to exact a image of perpetretor on their partners, women have taken many times the role of real perpetrators in a passive agresive way. It's not rthe first time this has happened. The mee too movement politic statement has been atken advantage by many women. The case of Asia Argento of taking the rol of pedophile againts a minor actor in response of a reactive formation in her mind as a reaction against her own abuser is a extreme case of someone that took the advantage of the political movement. It's real and she remains free of charges and guilt. The case wit the facts of Amber Heard reaction to the accusation is the not denial of the occurrance of the assault, and it hapen many times, and in a toxic relationship this happen many times by the conducts of vilence of both members of a couple. So the escalation of the violence can be atributed to the real instigator of the original violence. Taking the woman out of the victim focus, is quite believable that an actor whit out fame, gains it by association, and by creating a fake image of victimization. Due to nature of the video that she took it's more believable due to preparation from her part that she knew how to provoque a situation of violence. To me this change the optics where she stand, not anymore as a victim, but as a high price fame gold diger, that it's a real protrait of many women on Hollywood with the correct exeptions of the inocent rest of the actresses that gain their fame trough clean ways.",Lenin Verdezoto Pozo,0,2019-03-27T23:21:29Z

378,UgxUtX1ih8cfbvmsKGF4AaABAg,"Hi guys! Thanks for discussing this, I think it's an important topic, because it shows a bigger problem, as well. Regarding the leaked video of Johnny slamming the cabinet doors you've mentioned: he did address it, in his GQ interview. He claims it was taped the day he'd learned he'd lost shitload of money (hence his lawsuit against his ex-managers) and that was what he'd been upset about (and let's be honest, catching your wife recording you in such low moment wouldn't calm you down).
Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to say that he's at his most charming and cuddly in that video. Yes, he is loud, drunk, swearing and taking his anger out on his furniture (note, though: he is facing away from Amber at the time and mostly ignoring her up to the point when he notices the camera) and it's not nice, but there is a difference between throwing a tantrum (or having a meltdown, depending on the interpretation) on your bad day and being a monster who treats his wife so badly that she's scared for her life. People say you can see him hitting her on that video - that's simply not true.
Also, as far as I remember, it's not stated in his lawsuit that she had necesserly hit herself - it does, however, contain several sworn testimonies of people who had seen her and interacted with her shortly after the alleged incident (the police officers) and in the days after that (their neighbours, front desk workers, security etc.), which directly contradicts her claim that her face had swollen within minutes (the photos from People magazine had been supposedly taken right after the incident, but before the police had arrived - that's what she said). One of the most damning parts is the testimony of the worker who says she'd seen on surveilence Whitney Heard (Amber's sister) pretending to punch Amber in the face a few days after the alleged beating and then Amber bursting into laughter along with her friend. Supposedly, Depp had just recently recovered the footage along with other recordings from the building.",tra lala,55,2019-03-27T22:33:57Z

She's known for this shit . Depp has been a heavy drinker for 30 years  he was in a relationship with a woman for almost half of that and even she said it's not in Johnny to hit a woman .

I do wonder what Rowling knows.

If Amber did half of what Depp is alleging, there'll be a real mess on Warner Bros. hands.
