Her doctor told her she should never fall pregnant because of the serious anti psychotic drugs she was on, plus all the alcohol and drugs she took daily! How much she paid this surrogate will surface one day. This poor little baby will be used as her pawn to get out of every damaging and horrendous thing she has done!

This baby if it was born in April, was conceived in July. She has stated by a surrogate which means that during the London trial last year during a pandemic she opted to have a baby, that would be born in April, three weeks before the original VA trial against Johnny was due to start. Unfortunately for her that trial being delayed until next year scuppered her plans but this baby is the most obvious stark demonstration of how calculated and shameless she is and how low she's going to stoop, regardless of who she damages.
