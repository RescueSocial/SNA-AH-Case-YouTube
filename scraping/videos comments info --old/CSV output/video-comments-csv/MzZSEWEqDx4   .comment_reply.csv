0,UgyhgyI8udh7XnIkKMh4AaABAg,Mary-Lynne,"Exactly Laura! WB doesn’t give a poo about the audience. They are deflecting away from the ruling of the court regarding JD’s subpoenas. I would have more respect for them if they just came out and admitted they made a mistake by siding with an admitted abuser. We can all fight strong and hard and spread the facts. It’s clear that JD has won the court of public opinion with the truth! Too bad WB has doomed theirs. WB, Disney, MGM, L’Oréal or L’Oréal’s sub companies 
won’t be seeing a penny of my hard earned money Ever!

She needs to b held ACCOUNTABLE n if WB is standing by her then they too will be faced with  Accountability along side her,2021-07-31T14:15:08Z,3
6,UgxQ7j9KqJU3jWP__it4AaABAg,Kirsty Fairly,"Unfortunately there are far too many people who either do not know the full story behind the case, or do not care about it at all, who are actually happy that she's still in the movie. I've seen these people commenting on how they do not care & just want her kept in the movie. I saw a comment about it on a youtubers channel last night, were the commentor stated that they were glad that she was still in the movie & that her ""personal life"" was kept out of the decision. When I replied to them explaining how morally wrong the situation was as Johnny lost his career due to her word alone while she gets to keep hers, & pointed out the double standard in that decision & how this was about something bigger then just Johnny & AH, the person replied that all they were saying is keep her personal life out of their entertainment, & that it would be ""selfish"" to get rid of her as Mera, not even acknowledging how selfish it was of WB to get rid of Johnny in the first place when there was no proof that he'd done anything wrong.",2021-07-31T16:40:23Z,1

8,Ugz5upltDHaK4b6Rrm94AaABAg,Kicknowledge Smith,Yup but The money will flow in. many have HBO MaX and will watch suicide squad and everything else they release.

12,Ugw-j3cPGADkgURjoEx4AaABAg,Kellie Green,"@Kicknowledge Smith It’s a he said she said situation. But it is based on her being a women.  Because no one believes she can be an abuser because she is a women. the UK rejected all factual evidence and only believed her because she donated the money. The UK trial was a total mess. I wouldn’t believe accusations because I can’t condemn a person based on accusations. I used to. But after this trial makes me wonder how many people where condemn with lies. I’ll truly believe it when there’s is a trial and they are found guilty. Now with Amber no trial is needed for people to realize she lied. Court documents, camera footage, emails, faked photos, her past record, many witnesses are enough for me and for others. But if it turn out she was in fact solely the abused. I’ll apologize .",2021-08-01T03:06:05Z,0
13,Ugw-j3cPGADkgURjoEx4AaABAg,Kicknowledge Smith,Yup but no court has said Johnny is innocent and Amber is guilty. Those recordings don’t prove Johnny innocent. I’m not team Amber or team Johnny but from an optics standpoint WB was put n a corner especially after he lost his case to the Sun.  she accused him of  abuse and women being abused is a trending topic. She had bruises whether they are fake or not. It’s about optics. Johnny could have accused her also but he didn’t. Also there are many men that walk from abuse and accusations. Donald trump was accused by several women and became president and ran a 2nd term. Biden was accused of assault also and became president. Many love Mel Gibson that man did and said some of the craziest stuff on video. Kaitlin Jenner/Bruce basically got away with manslaughter and running for office. Cosby out on a technicality. James Gunn back making 2 movies.  and many other examples I look at this as life is not fair. Not all women have Amber heard privilege. It’s not just because she a woman this happening.,2021-07-31T19:22:25Z,0
14,Ugw-j3cPGADkgURjoEx4AaABAg,Kirsty Fairly,"@Kellie Green -Exactly, they are basically helping her reabuse poor Johnny all over again by doing what they are doing, & the most disturbing part is that they know it, but they do not care as they've always had it in for him. We all know that the Hollywood elite, & of course the media, have been dying to destroy him from the very beginning of his career, because he was never willing to play along & be another fake like the rest of them, AH's accusations just gave them an excuse to finally get rid of him.",2021-07-31T17:08:21Z,1
15,Ugxtfyeol4OD0MdKLQB4AaABAg,Kirsty Fairly,"I really hope you're right, because so far she seems to be able to just get away with every horrible thing that she does. She needs to be stopped before someone else gets really badly injured because of her, or worse.",2021-07-31T16:52:31Z,0
16,Ugz-8pLxxs673hv7uk54AaABAg,Jay A Errington,"@Kicknowledge Smith why wud Johnny be in prison? The whole point of this is that he didn't do anything and despite the media and private investigators hunting down his past he has never been aggressive towards people. She threw a bottle at him that sliced off his finger and calmly walked over to him put a cigarette out on his face and went upstairs... Guy was abused. Its revealed the inequalities in how men who are abused are seen. The money that goes to abused women when the figures for abused guys are almost as high and guys get nothing... It needs to be acknowledged. Double standards let this female abuser work but not her victim... Nope not right.
Yes they do care about money. If every movie she is in bombs people will stop casting her in these roles.
She is paid around 35,000 to represent women in domestic abuse cases... She is an abuser! She called abuse victims doormats!
WB might get paid for flash and suicide squad. They might not get paid for aquaman 2 as much as they thought though... And from what I gather they need it. We will see. Obviously they will make millions but they won't make the billion the first made",2021-07-31T05:51:04Z,4
17,Ugz-8pLxxs673hv7uk54AaABAg,Kicknowledge Smith,"Ww84 did horrible. It doesn’t mean anything to the studios if a movie doesn’t do well. The average movie goer doesn’t even care about this, neither does China. Many have HBO Max and will watch suicide squad. Many are hyped for the Flash. In the end WB gets paid. I think Amber heard nuts but I’m not on Johnny side either. I feel many being hypocrites. Life isn’t fair. Cosby out on a technicality. James Gunn back making 2 new movies. Kaitlin Jenner basically got away with murder running  for office,. Biden was accused of assault and is president. Mel Gibson crazy as all hell and had a huge fan base. This situation is nothing. The system is corrupt and needs real attention. Men and women get away with murder. Not all women as privileged as Amber Heard. Prisons  are full of women that are not as privileged. Johnny not in prison either. There are men who might be if it were them",2021-07-31T05:20:58Z,0

There were pictures released. He lost his case, whether she lying or not, it looks bad for him, from an optics standpoint. If WB kept him. The petition be way louder and the media be ripping them apart. It is what it is. They not firing her over those recordings. If it was videos of her actually attacking him physically maybe!!! Those recordings are just a an ex couple fighting!! Many have done way worse in Hollywood. and government. Trump was accused of assault by several women. Still became president and ran a second term. Biden was accused also and became president. Bill Cosby out on a technicality. Many love Mel Gibson. That man had crazy abusive moments on video.
