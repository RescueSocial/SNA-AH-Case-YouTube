It upsets me that people who have deliberately destroyed the hope those of us had who have been attacked, abused and live with the scars of our attackers preying upon us are again facing credibility being undermined by greedy, lying and deceitful stalkers. 

The damage goes so much deeper than she will ever understand. She is the one who seeks to find victims, that she can harm and destroy. When these criminals prey upon us they not only achieve their sick goals of power over us they know that it is so hard to come forward because of the shame we feel. They take advantage of our moment of weakness and humiliation as a victory and vindication for them to justify the way to their next victim. 

The cycle of attackers who succeeded in overcoming prosecution gives them an advantage that is a mountain for us to climb if we are brave enough to try. 

The me too movement was set back because she took advantage and in doing so we are once again seen as the instigator, the ones that encouraged our abusers to harm us. 

We will never be taken seriously when people like her give credibility to their cause. We‚Äôre all then accused of being the ones lying and trying to destroy our stalkers and abusers. 
We must prove our attackers were the ones that took advantage of us. That it is them who have destroyed our lives. That what they did to us, harmed us beyond the physical scars, that our mentality, our fear doesn‚Äôt go away, we question everyone‚Äôs motives, we lose out on living life because of the nightmares we relive. 

They will never understand how it feels. How hard it can be to overcome our fears so that we may one day be in healthy, stable, safe and loving relationships with people who are willing to show us patience, kindness and unfortunately we need them to prove that they are genuinely good people when in reality it shouldn‚Äôt have to be that way. 

The damage that can‚Äôt be seen by a scar is the most difficult to understand. 

Please stay safe, I hope your family including your grandchildren are getting love and support through the world wide situation we are all facing.

9,Ugzlv6utF0kck08cszV4AaABAg,Ingrid Finicle,"I think he does imbibe in alcohol, but she was definitely a catalyst in the eruptions. I don't think he's lily white in his alcohol-infused outbursts, but it's (I believe) because she pushes and pushes and gets physical with him. Back in the day, after she came forward with 'secret' video, I wondered WHY she was secretly taping him throwing stuff around while drunk? The person choosing to do such secret filming is obviously going to be on their best behavior, only to entrap nasty footage of the other person responding back! I believed her at first, because of his drunken-outburst, but something didn't quite add up either. It wasn't' until I accidentally tripped upon the analysis video done by ""Observe"" where I saw her true colors. You don't have to be a body-language expert to see how bad of an actress in real life she is. Buying time, rolling her eyes, playing puppy-dog-victim...and then watch her body language when she interacts with Johnny on the red carpet...it's like watching an Elephant Trainer master his/her 'animal' in public. VERY controlling. She's a nasty little sprite.",2021-04-27T21:17:02Z,0
