9,UgyDXKMq0RPvhYn9oCN4AaABAg,"Thankyou for speaking out and giving ur oppinions on this subject. 

Its true. i;ve fallen for the same thing, I seen an article witha title saying she was FIRED, like u I was excited n ready to send u the link, n then I read n find, its awready stuff uv covered n ISNT anyhing OFFICIAL

its hard to hold it against youtubers who do it coz MOST r good guys that we like, n we know Youtube is TOUGH, n ONLY getting harder, so I dont blame em. With every1 reporting the same hing over n over u HAV TO sumtime do sum questionable hings dat mite be classed as immoral in order to make their news seem different from the rest and to get a click. So I get it. I mean its NOT ILLEGAL, n EVERYBODY does it, so yeah a lot of people are like who cares.  As long as they werent doing it ALL the time, I dont really see a problem with it.

The only hing I would say on it is it kinda gives u a bad name, n then people call u out for lying. Its esp sad to see BIG youtubers who do it coz they dont really hav to, but they do it anyway which gives others the idea that its okay coz THEY do it, which only encourages more n more to do it. 

Its especially bad in the Fandom Menace which just gives our haters more weight behind their belief n arguments and doesnt do our cause any good, but then again the problem with haters is most just hate for the sake of it and just look to find ANY reason to hate so why bother what they think?

Im glad you didnt fall for the clickbait n just do the same as everyone else. So thanks for having sum integrity
Dont EVER change...sure it might get u sum clicks in the short run but in the long run people will start to question you and then you lose more in the long run",BIG Daddio John Bamford,1,2020-04-04T04:59:03Z
10,UgxYdGg--pnIdpCojop4AaABAg,This will not be pretty for Amber.  Her public behaviour and demeanor in court proceedings is demonstrating contempt for the proceedings and for the serious nature of the allegations.  She could be assessed huge punitive damages.,Kevin Gault,1,2020-04-04T03:51:27Z

16,UgxovQhzv6hdQU-2qtd4AaABAg,"Ms. Heard used the media to destroy Mr. Depp without evidence. Ms. Heard has been making media releases (remember ScreenGeeks ""Warner Bros. doesn't care about the allegations about Amber Heard nor do they have interest in social media. As such, there's nothing going on with her role on Aquaman 2 and they wouldn't consider firing her""...yes, Ms. Heard, we know that you wrote this yourself, as the English is appalling, and the statement contains outright lies) I wonder how she feels about the media getting back at her, by creating Clickbait headlines supporting Mr. Depp? When I see these headlines, I go straight to the WB website to see if they have released a statement yet, so they don't tend to catch me...except Darth News...he's all about the Clickbait Satire!",NIBS,1,2020-04-03T23:10:33Z
17,Ugy7sB41xObxeHft2cx4AaABAg,". ..Depp knows there‚Äôs a torrent of anti A.H. videos on these channels. ..and even if he doesn‚Äôt view them himself, his publicist probably does view for him (I believe it‚Äôs the same one for 30+ years, a woman) to get a sense of how the public sentiment is stirring things up. ..
this being said, he‚Äôs got to have a real good feeling about himself now knowing there are millions of voices speaking for him. ,.because years prior things were very different for him. ..but he needed to sue her first to prove he was cold serious . .then the audios came out. ..and now the avalanche is caving in on her. ..channels like yours helped create the impetus to get things moving in a forward motion and this is good. ..it‚Äôs all good. ..üçÄ. ..your vids are X-lent ‚ùóÔ∏è",J Lee,2,2020-04-03T23:05:52Z
18,UgxDUB--nv3KPVpNcuB4AaABAg,"Exactly, how many times we saw Ryan Johnson ""fired"" and the Kennedy woman too. Sadly Hollywood has its own truth and they get like children when they close their eyes and think that as they can't see themselves, others can't either. Then if they keep it long enough, people might forget and see other productions of this same people. Because people forget easy. Is frustrating.",Yo creo,0,2020-04-03T22:41:31Z

25,UgwayWrciFkJkbIb0kF4AaABAg,John let's say they do cast her in aquaman 2 Warner brothers would immediately regret once they see the irreparable damage with negative reviews and reception of the 2ND film which could destroy any chance of a third film I think ultimately she'll be removed,Ahmad Abraham,2,2020-04-03T21:36:50Z
