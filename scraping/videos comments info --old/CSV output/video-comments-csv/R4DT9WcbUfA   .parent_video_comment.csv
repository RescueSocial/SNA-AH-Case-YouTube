Hollyweird adores making film after film highlighting the degradation, cruelty, and criminality of Slavery in America, because they want to ‚Äúshine a light‚Äù on the suffering of the Slaves and share their story from beyond the grave‚Ä¶ and rightly so, we should understand their suffering‚Ä¶. BUT, they choose to bury this film that touches on everything Hollyweird seems to be about, evil corporations, their effects on the environment and animals and how that impacts innocent people, and yet they turn their back because of POLITICS and optics, because they want to protect the

I think this all has everything to do with ""rocketman"" and how he has his fingers in a lot of pies and NO ONE wants to loose funding from him...  so everyone is black listing him and black balling him... aka Instagram, youtube, and facebook all are protecting Amber Heard why do you think that is???  Elon Musk... this is a sad example of the power of money and it's such a shame the johnny is suffering for this...  at this point he will probably get railroaded by the court system.  Elon is too rich to ignore and this judge may be threatened with her job and her ability to have any life after this trial...  all for the power of a super rich man and his money (I dont know why hes protecting her. specially since they broke up a long time ago and she went and had those embryos implanted into a surrogate after a law suit where he tried to get them destroyed...) I have no faith in the system it's pretty clear if the super rich and powerful want you out there is literally nothing you can do to stop them...

I'm so sad and angry for Johnny I hope he finds another avenue for income (if he ends up on tour I'd totally get tickets for that if his band goes anywhere)  but clearly hes not welcome in the film industry... all for one fucking womans ambition and greed...  she hooked up with johnny for the money then hooked a bigger fish and left Johnny!   Hoping to sleeve him and still have the richer man...  there is no place better for her then the worst hell I can imagine... to ruin a person's life just because is so disgusting and vile there are no words for the filth of a human being Amber Heard is...  feces deserve more respect then her...  and i pray that that poor little girl grows up under the care of someone who loves her... as it's pretty fucking clear Amber doesnt love that girl, she loves the money that child will make her... I grew up under the care of a parent that only wanted the money in could make them and when that dried up they didnt care what happened to me as long as I was gone and they disnt have to spend any money on me anymore.  It has caused me to struggle with self worth and self confidence my whole life and has made relationships challenging I always find the worst people to love...  so I pray for Johhny and I pray most for that little baby girl who's caught up in all this and doesn't even know it...",Susanne Boretsky,1,2021-08-02T21:46:54Z

If nerds aren't interested in politics, ruin Star Wars. That'll make them care. Attack their hearts. Someone wants the people pissed off, fighting each other.

They take icons we love and tear them down in front of us. It's a strategy to make us looking in a certain direction. It's actually sadism. First they gave us Britney, now they fuck her up. Marilyn.. MJ. 

Johnny Depp also was a rebel. He won the world while giving the finger to the suits. Someone wants to make an example of him.

Growing up on comic books both by DC and Marvel, it's a must for me to see all those super hero's movies, even if they have bad reviews before I go see them.

Please don't give these abusers and their supporters your hard on money to someone that deserve to afford to eat a bologna sandwich. We all heard the tapes and seen the cop body cam video it's time to either stand for something or let then use and abuse what we as Americans hold on dearly to and that is justice and the right to be heard and have the truth come to the forefront.

How many of them hold shares through Wall Street. These people are in their own club, Joe Average isn't part of it. If some of these corporations are still in business, even if they changed their names, it could hurt business. Dig deep enough in the background of the higher ups, you'd find how in bed they all are.
