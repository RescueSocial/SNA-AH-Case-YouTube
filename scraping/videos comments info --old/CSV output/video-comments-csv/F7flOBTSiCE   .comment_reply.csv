2,UgxX_rkg9M7qka9uQvF4AaABAg,Rock Candy,we do know she framed Johnny with the help of her co-conspirator friends and accused him of DV when she was the one puunching him.   This destroyed his reputation and his career and then she kept going and going making up more and more stories of abuuse against her.   We know she did this all very publicly so he would never work again.  On audio she mocked him and said no one would believe or side with him because he was a MALE v1ctim of DV.  So that let's us know she does know what she is doing.,2021-11-04T02:26:28Z,0
3,UgyuEyLa3ISNys5a_Ph4AaABAg,linzi94,The judges son worked for talk radio which is owned by News group who also own the Sun newspaper. The judge should have excused himself from the trial due to his connection but he didn’t. Also his son then deleted his work info from his Twitter account when everyone found out.

He has been like that for years and handles himself with respect for others and follows thru. I do wish him peace and happiness.drugs and alcohol catches up with us all. Don’t ever judge a book by its cover or someone base on a drug. Thank god the man has talent and a real one. Prayer for Johnny deep and his legal trouble.",2021-05-05T06:03:49Z,10

20,UgygtbVem4gbjWaBEeR4AaABAg,Dad Comp,"I want to be clear now that this comment has been brought back to my attention-> Obnoxiousness side, I really am impartial on everything about this situation EXCEPT Amber being displaced in career trajectory bc of this; just doesnt feel right to me.",2021-03-22T22:15:35Z,0

22,UgygtbVem4gbjWaBEeR4AaABAg,Dad Comp,"Hey, Ellie O'Connor, I only got half of your comment before it disappeared.... but from the intonation from the half I did see, I feel you both know what exactly I'm talking about and also could use someone like me on your team to alleviate whatever you're working with. I don't think you're a bad person... but you can't tell me you look at this situation and see Amber as anything but a bearer of a tragic misfortune, that wasn't even her own. 

Now, to address real issues,  how can we prime the media landscape to assist the masses in being prepared to close ranks around her when she returns while acknowledging what she did was a demonstration of positive behavior (1), (2) what are the long standing ratifications and coinciding vulnerabilities of this choice that we need to prepare for, and (3) how is this going to be  produced.",2021-02-23T15:52:58Z,0
23,UgygtbVem4gbjWaBEeR4AaABAg,Dad Comp,"​@Carrie Nelson Ok I finally listened to the recorded conversations... Amber Heard is not over, by any means imo. Moreover, I do get she should be held accountable for her beliefs, but also I think in this instance it's abundantly clear exactly why those were her beliefs (Johnny's horrible ego and spiritual needs), so I think one shot of extremely uncomfortable public humiliation more than suffices. Neither of them feels ""over"" to me, though Johnny is a bit up there  in unkemptness rode out... also for his age this was extraordinarily irresponsible, but as I said elsewhere, I can't judge him because I don't know what choices he really made leading to this series of unfortunate events. He may be over from his 15 minutes simply having timed out which doesn't feel great to say but Amber's dealt hand shouldn't be slighted just bc her ex is finding his time has come and very likely on a subconscious level just didn't want to go out alone.

Anywho lastly, one comment.

This is America. We will always respect someone who shows up to court and fights, over someone who shows up and can't be bothered.",2021-02-21T20:18:28Z,0
24,UgygtbVem4gbjWaBEeR4AaABAg,Dad Comp,"@Carrie Nelson I agree it was her choice to take it on. But when we're looking at what Johnny took on...... and even could take on... if we're talking character and virtue, 1. he instantly could not win, and 2. I'm not sure why she's being read the riot act for being smart and mentally strong enough to hold a punch that packs a wallop when Johnny clearly seems so grief stricken he couldn't even try...............",2021-02-21T19:10:31Z,1

27,UgxzIOJTYD2LFs5g1G54AaABAg,Katya L,"@mrfroman945 I hate that word. It's 1000% used only by bullies when you stand up to them and present actual evidence. Spreading information is called journalism. We already have Amber's side, God knows we do, now it's Johnny's turn. Any one is welcome to present evidence to defend her, but they can't, so they claim we attack her, just like she claimed Johnny attacked her when she didn't get her original settlement demands.",2021-03-02T20:04:33Z,1
28,UgxzIOJTYD2LFs5g1G54AaABAg,mrfroman945,@Katya L I'd say I'm on the attack tbh lmao id do the same if it was Johnny she has been absolutely heinous,2021-03-02T19:45:12Z,2
29,UgxzIOJTYD2LFs5g1G54AaABAg,Katya L,"It's not about attacking Amber, but defending Johnny. Remember who is the one being labeled an abuser, who is losing roles. I don't see the same concern about Johnny from you, which shows how much you care about evidence. Speaking of, Amber herself admits to hitting Johnny, on tape. There is a mountain of evidence against her. just because you're too lazy to read it, doesn't mean we are.",2021-03-02T18:53:22Z,4
