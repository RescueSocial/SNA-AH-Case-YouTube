20,UgzexJDJicRPG4GF8yB4AaABAg,blameitonthepixie,"Amber is s a lesbian. This is not a insult it's a fact. When she got busted in Seatac airport for assaulting her wife then went to the press saying the officer was homophobic when in fact the cop was gay, she was a lesbian. 
After meeting JD who was a A lister she had dollar signs in her eyes. She dumped her girl and perused Johnny. Once she had him and was getting parts in bigger roles they married.
Within months she was looking at a bigger fish and that was Elon Musk.  
She's back with a woman and frankly I think she's a  man hater, so I think women attorneys are a must.",2021-07-16T00:36:23Z,1
21,UgxbE0tDlnwZOkAt7OB4AaABAg,Deb,"How anyone male or female can believe that what she's bringing forward is proof is beyond me. This is more about her just being able to say he did this to me and everyone say ..OK.
The ACLU is up to its neck in this, Its not going to just lay down it will find away to regain its position no matter what they have to do. This is a tactic for sure. If at any chance they find they can't scheme manipulate or buy their way out they won't hesitate to throw her under the bus.",2021-07-16T02:54:51Z,4
22,UgxbE0tDlnwZOkAt7OB4AaABAg,blameitonthepixie,"I don't think that would work here. To many people in the states are paying attention and backing Johnny. So I think it would be political suicide.
