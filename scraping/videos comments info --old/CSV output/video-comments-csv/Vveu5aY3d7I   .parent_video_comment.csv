6,UgyGNQU9wPV1G9ZJiHd4AaABAg,"So to all the guys the I see in the comments that are happy that amber heard is staying wats ur reasoning? You kno besides the fact we have proof of her admitting to beating depp, what's your reasoning? Let me guess ur glad she's staying because she looks good in a body suit",Black Mysterious_23,1,2021-09-26T06:16:37Z
7,UgwV1lWndJjH4iHnv6t4AaABAg,"I‚Äôm glad Amber is staying, and I‚Äôm really glad for Cavill. He is our Superman.",Jonathan Welch,1,2021-09-26T03:33:12Z
8,Ugxp5mrYUjpWsqW8gyt4AaABAg,"WEll, well, well what a surprise.... Amber Heard is staying. They dropped Johnny Depp like a piece of sh&¬ßt with only rumors 
but she is staying after admitting on tape that she is BEATING him!!!!!!!!!!!
Anyone still believes that there is no double standard??? I am NOT GOING TO WATCH AQUAMAN 2. 
What is wrong for men is also wrong for women!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",Cassius3388,2,2021-09-25T18:44:42Z

10,Ugy6bMDoYU74cGdWeDp4AaABAg,"As an American, I just fine with Superman‚Äôs catchphrase change. The US is not the center of the world, and Superman is a worldwide/universal hero.",th3garbageman,1,2021-09-20T23:37:18Z
11,UgwiquBmMtOoAeRyDCN4AaABAg,"OMG...   It's not ""Justice League Society of America"", it's just ""Justice Society of America"".  Superman's ORIGINAL saying did NOT include ""the American way"", it was just ""For truth and justice"".  They added ""The American Way"" in the late 40's because of all the Communist paranoia.  As an American and a heavy comics reader (can you tell?), I am SO glad that ""the American way"" is finally gone.  Take care, -Eric",Eric Horchuck,11,2021-09-20T19:45:47Z
12,Ugxz6JnjPqcknUGbnhl4AaABAg,"It's weird, I'm not American but I'm a huge Superman fan and it just doesn't feel right to me that they changed it like that. Superman believes in traditional American values/morals as he was raised by American farmers and is an American citizen himself. It doesn't mean he's a mouthpiece of the US government at all in fact he goes up against them multiple times in the comics.  He just believes in the American dream because he believes it can motivate people to transform themselves to be better people.",InOneEarAndOutYourMother,2,2021-09-18T15:36:49Z
