1,Ugy4oLM762rGk6A8qlx4AaABAg,Ruthy Can’t Fail,"Interestingly, Amber is friends with his main accuser,  Evan Rachel Wood. There does seem to be a lot of evidence that
the Manson allegations are also a hoax.  Colonel Kurtz you tube channel has a lot of info about that is you're interested in taking a look with an open mind?",2021-11-08T10:33:50Z,4

3,UgzJO3ZFsGsd1mwpfsl4AaABAg,Niklas Lund,@Cindy Stephens-Law Thats a day i'm looking forward to aswell. I think the judge got more than a few words for her. Honestly hope she gets some prison time,2021-11-08T23:09:47Z,0
4,UgzJO3ZFsGsd1mwpfsl4AaABAg,Cindy Stephens-Law,"@Niklas Lund I'm in the U.K myself. I think he was abused by his mother but I might be wrong. I'm sure I heard that. Yes I agree he wouldn't hurt a fly and she has all the bearing of a classic narcissist. I'm really looking forward to April. I think even the judge has had enough of her actions now, if not getting close.",2021-11-08T21:08:01Z,0
5,UgzJO3ZFsGsd1mwpfsl4AaABAg,Niklas Lund,"@Cindy Stephens-Law I'm not from America, but even over the seas here in Denmark it's been a big case to follow. I always loved depp as an actor and he always seemed so calm and respectfull. Not a single abusive sign from him. I might be wrong, but wasnt his mother abused when he was young? and there for he swore never to abuse a woman. I mean amber's story is full of holes. One day she got a bruise, looked more like a pimple that got rubbed on to much. Then her bruise was on right side, and then on the left. I've studied body language for more than 10 years. And Her whole way of expressing her self is so fake. You can compare her mental state like the victoria secret karen. Both acting childish, with violence when they dont get their way. I'm pretty sure Amber been doing this for years and always been positively confirmed in it untill now. She screwed up big time and i'm going to cheerish the day the judge will destroy her.",2021-11-08T20:05:33Z,0
6,UgzJO3ZFsGsd1mwpfsl4AaABAg,Cindy Stephens-Law,"@Niklas Lund That's right. The whole divorce settlement was supposed to go to charity. Johnny even made the first  $100,000 Installment in her name for her as far as I know. Then she said she needed the money for the legal battles. And then a photo expert saying that the photos she submitted were taken on or after August 2018 on a machine that didn't come out until 2017 just prove she faked them. Oh and the fact she appeared on live TV the day after it was supposed to have happened and the make up artist who worked on her said she had no injuries at all pulls everything she has said to pieces.",2021-11-08T19:28:18Z,0
7,UgzJO3ZFsGsd1mwpfsl4AaABAg,Niklas Lund,Yeah the 11th april 2022 right? Also amber tried to get the case dismissed 3 times. Last one was rejected in august 2021 and she is also required to show proofs of her donating 7 m $ to a charity since it was included in their divorce i think.,2021-11-08T18:44:58Z,1

The fact that those people actually thought that it was ok to write such cruel things on a public forum where they knew poor Johnny would most likely see it, when he was already suffering, is just disgusting. Whoever those people are, they really need take a long hard look at themselves & think about how they'd feel if it was them going through this crap, & they were the ones having people throwing that kind of hate at them day in & day out instead of Johnny, maybe then they'd think twice before they write those kind of comments.",2021-02-27T17:49:09Z,1

112,Ugy2SSy-KvgdTaXX6Jx4AaABAg,Simon Maile,"@TinaMaria Moore So if I, a random person on the internet happen to stumble across this legal case (im not even sure why it popped up in my recommended section but it seems to be pretty interesting anyways), and after all the videos and evidence and recordings ive seen online i am NOT on your side... what does that make me? I would believe that i could approach this case as neutral as possible as i have not watched pirates of the carribean my entire life, nor is there anything else i really associate with johnny depp. I am not sexually attracted to him, if anything it would be the opposite if i didnt now believe that amber heard is a person that should be imprisoned for what shes done. All this doesnt impact my life in any way, shape or form, and yet after all the evidence, and after reading through this rather wild string of comments i can only come to one conclusion: youre in ABSOLUTE denial and i cant even begin to imagine why youre so deluded about this topic, that i believe takes as much neutral assesment as possible. You blame the opposition for stating facts about Heard that are a couple years ago that proof she did exactly what she accuses her ""abuser"" of having done to her, yet you go off on some crazy random rant about what bad johnny depp has done in is life? The only hard piece of evidence of him being an abusive spouse is ""he got convicted of it"". Its not evidence, its the result of a human being saying hes guilty. You know what would be hard evidence? For example an audiorecording, where you can hear him saying that he always initiates physical fights. How can you ignore something like that, or dozens of eye whitnesses? Would you choose to ignore that evidence if it was pointed against Depp? From what i can tell reading through your comments, i would not believe so. You keep calling your opposition in this argument biased, yet all you do is drag random statements into the discussion, while not adressing any points the opposition actually gives. 

Ill say this again one last time because im not under the impression youre one of the fast thinkers:

Youre

In

Denial

I am absolutely positive you wont read through the above and that no human being in their right mind could drag you out of your illogical mindset,

Stabbed himself, threw himself down a flight of stairs, starved himself, etc. Luckily for him, one officer had been to their house enough times that he finally got the guy to tell him the truth. It took over a year but she was finally sentenced to, I think 5 years. He went into hiding, he got dragged on social media because he was man who was a victim of d.v.. the officer said that it happens so much more than people think. The case was in the U.K. #himtoo",2020-09-12T03:06:59Z,1

Signed and shared again. AH is a babbling fool. She lured in such a decent, kind, loving, generous, talented, devoted man into her toxic web. He loved her with his heart and soul. Instead of cherishing the man, who gave her the world, she and her parasite partners took advantage, squatted in his penthouses, on his dime, while she cheated on him, set him up, and they actually plotted on how she should stab him. She is a vile, venomous excuse for a human being. Johnny deserves to find the woman of his dreams and live happily ever after. I wish he had a husband camp where husbands could go to learn how to treat their wives the way he treated her. I’ve been with my husband 20 years and I’m still jealous of how well Johnny treated her.

This may not be popular I think Johny should still try to be kind to Amber.  It is not her fault in one way that she has NEVER BEEN TOLD NO and it has damaged her.

Anyways, I do believe Johnny Depp. Abuse does happen to men as well. My Uncle was abused for years by his wife before divorcing her and my brother almost went to prison. He went to jail for 6 months. He lost his job. Long story short, her version of what happened contradicted the evidence, character witnesses were called on his behalf and put in a good word for him and he was acquitted.

He said in one of the recording a that he thought the fights would lesson after marriage but in fact she got far worse. It’s like one of those “Deadly Women” episodes except he survives.

So ""please don't leave me"" but ""you suck & don't do anything right"" at the same time. Crazy-making. Interesting comparison of NPD & BPD. Never thought about it before but that sounds right on. I wonder why Johnny Depp stayed with her as long as he did. I'm sure she must have exhibited these behaviors before they got married. Obviously some glitch in his programming made him susceptible to her insanity. It's just that he seemed to have good relationships with several women prior to this. I guess we're all a mix of healthy & not so healthy tendencies & all it takes is one crazy person to tip that balance. Ayyy, good for him that he got out!

Notice on the tapes she has a huge problem walking away. Notice that every evening she is either with friends or with a new beau? She cannot be alone at nights. Who would make something up like this knowing they’re in the public eye and she’d been taped? Someone who is impetuous. It’s very obvious she’s self medicating with at least alcohol. She appears to be narcissistic and all of her actions look like signs of NPD but the motivating factor behind the actions is what sets NPD and BPD apart, morbid fear of abandonment. That’s what I got from the tapes. She matches the facts to her emotions instead of the other way around which is where the word salads that don’t make sense to the rest of us come from.",2020-04-27T07:48:16Z,1

Good-hearted, well-balanced men and women are 99% of the population who love and care for each other as Americans.  Feminists and their male counterparts are the abusers; we all condemn a male who is abusive and we all put up with the feminists who abuse men.  the problem in leveraging the #metoo is feminists who LIE merely to hurt a man.  It doesn't matter to feminists if an innocent man goes down--that's how you know they are disingenuous when they say it's about equality.  Otherwise they'd be called equalists.  You know who the real equalists are?  ALL the wonderful girls and women who you see posting comments (*edit: it seems like every comment is from a female and not a single one is in favor of AH*) who represent the majority of the women out there; all the women in the world you DON'T see at those ""women's"" marches.  0 are feminists, you and I both know it.  #metoo was great when it exposed Hollywood and other male abusers.  The point the WOMAN to whom we are replying here was making, is that proponents of #metoo should be pissed that the good cause it represented has been undermined... by a Hollywood feminist.

You mispronounced it.
It should be pronounced “ha-RELL.” Additionally...
Thanks for these videos, as it is a terrible thing that mainstream media is covering this such an inaccurate manner.
It’s horrific.
I work in the music business, and Lisa Richards is not my real name.
I did some work for Disney in the past, and they went to great links to cover up things they thought were scandalous, which was why they hired me.
I was stunned that Johnny didn’t file a lawsuit against People magazine, and Amber’s friend at the magazine, who insinuated that Johnny beat her and gave her that black eye.
It falls perfectly into liabel laws, which I am extremely familiar with.
It is a surprising to me that Johnny did not file against People, not just because he didn’t give her that black eye, but also because Depp can prove financial damages as a result of this fabricated publicity.
It’s terrible that he lost work over this, and I am just grateful that she and Johnny did not have kids together, because Amber would have taken so much physical rage out on those kids, and she would’ve tried to convince those kids that it was their fault.
I am also really glad that Johnny’s in a band right now, because it is great therapy for him.",2020-02-09T22:18:35Z,3

Based on these calls, I think Depp is 100% a victim of that psycho woman. He’s also the victim of Hollywood trying to CYA about Weinstein by creating this “me too” shit. He’s a victim of what the public school systems & California social requirements have implanted in the sociopath he married.

She lies about everything on the stand, whereas he's honest to his detriment. My point is that you don't need to be somewhere to have evidence of something that happened.

553,UgznU8fIXEz-s13aSkl4AaABAg,Susan Gavaghan,"@4Neo Designs I see.  I have never been in a romantic relationship with a narcissist; I am straight and this young woman was a friend.  When we became friends I was going through a vulnerable time in my life and had lost confidence.  She was a few years younger than me.  After she failed to split up her ex with his new girlfriend (after 3 months of pretending to be pregnant) she then honed in on me, trying to find my sensitive issues and pressing my buttons.  Shortly before Christmas we went for a night out.  Some guys came chatting to us.  I rang her on Christmas Eve and she told me that the guy she had been chatting to her advised her that I was too old to be her friend and must be preventing her from getting chatted up and that I must be dragging her down.  I realized that I was actually hearing her opinion of me.  This ruined my Christmas with my family and knocked me into a severe depression which lasted for 3 months.  After that I refused to take her calls but she love bombed me with letters, saying she hadn't meant to hurt me, that she had said this out of concern for me, and that this was a result of her being angry because she knew I disapproved of her pretending to be pregnant (trying to blame me).  She also said that because her ex boyfriend had left she realized that she had taken this out on me.  When we went out she would try to pick arguments with me.  For some reason she always managed to gaslight me and I was not able to get my point across.  We started exchanging letters and in black and white I proved my point.  I told her that I believed she was lying about what the guy in the pub said.   She insisted it was true;  I reminded her of a previous incident in which she told me someone had criticized me; unbeknown to her I had asked this person about this who then told me that it was in fact Carla (the narcissist friend) who had been criticizing me.  It felt brilliant to have caught her out on a lie and reclaim my reality.  Up until this point she had always managed to lie but covered her tracks so I was unable to prove that she had lied.  I managed to come out of the depression and regained my confidence.  Luckily my other friends advised me of what she was doing.  I wasn't aware of narcissism until last year when by chance I watched a you tube video on the subject.  I recognized Carla immediately.  When Carla made the nasty remark about me during the phone call, she knew she had hit her target and pushed me over the edge.  I could hear it in the tone of her voice and it went right through my stomach.  It was like coming face to face with the real Carla.  When she love bombed me she tried to make out that had not been her real personality and that the reason for her behaviour had been because of her ex boyfriend having left.  But I realized that it was the love bombing which was fake - she just wanted to hoover me back because she realized she had no other friends and was dependent on me to go out with.  She hadn't managed to split her ex and his new girlfriend so she decided to push me over the edge just to prove she had the power to do this.  She then expect to love bomb me, say she hadn't meant it and for me to fall back into line.  I recognized all Carla's tactics on the you tube videos on narcissism.",2020-02-04T08:36:21Z,0

Yes, what you say rings true. My understanding is there are ~3000 unsolved murders in America every year. And many of them are believed to be contract killings. How many of those are ordered by women is anyone's guess. Men tend to commit murder in spontaneous acts of violence, and are caught/convicted easily. Women tend to kill in more calculated ways (like hiring someone else to do it), and are more likely to get away with it. Even if the police do their job and assemble a strong case against the woman, she can always claim she acted in self-defense. She needs no evidence, and there is no one left to refute the allegation. There was a shocking case that occurred a while back in Canada - though the male victim was not harmed. I'm not sure if you are interested in this (given your awful experience) but there was a well made video series about the case.

My ex husband cheated on me, and I carried some baggage for a while that all men are cheaters and can’t be trusted, but I was recommended a support/forum group online, and I couldn’t believe the number of betrayed men on there who were totally jaded and thought all women were manipulative cheaters.  
As a monogamous person myself, I was honestly kind of offended, so at that point I had to quit being such a hypocrite and drop my suitcase full of bullshit beliefs that all men are cheaters. 

Unfortunately I’ve actually heard of lawyers *recommending* that a client accuse their spouse of domestic violence to help their divorce case, and apparently its recommended on a lot of websites too, so while I don’t love the idea of being skeptical of victims, it’s honestly necessary in this day and age. 

And as an abuse victim myself, I don’t think we are as fragile as Hollywood and the mainstream media would have us believe, so I definitely think getting to the truth is more important than worrying about someone’s feelings.

Honestly, I don't remember much abou tit, especially since the people who adopted me were amazing. Last week, my Grammy (she was the one who adopted my half brother, and fostered my birthmom) passed away. My mom was hysterical and I can imagine that my brother was too. But what I can't imagine is what he is going through. Elijah, ran away from home when he turned 18 and has been living homeless for months now. He was upset that he couldn't graduate from high school, (he had learning disabilities as a result of my birthmom drinking while pregnant) and he thought that my Grammy and Granpa wouldn't accept that he was gay. They already knew, as it was a bit obvious, however they didn't care. He barely ever visited and I imagine he feels awful that my Grammy is dead and he didn't make it to her in time. Honestly, I don't consider it betrayal. I feel badthat my birthmom went through all of that, and I don't blame her for it. Without her, I wouldn't be with the amazing people who are taking care of me right now. I wish my birthmom had found somebody who treated her right, even though that probably won't happen until she realizes that abuse isn't OK. Even my brother feels the same, and he was hurt worse. He has met her, since he was adopted. I haven't seen her since. Elijah thought that she would treat him like a mom would, even after he was adopted. It crushed him when he saw her and all he got was ""HI Elijah"". He lives her. Actually one of the times her ran away, her ran to her house and her boyfriend. He tried to hit her, and Elijah protected her and broke his arm and his rib. Candy (my birthmom) and her bf both went to jail, as they had drugs in the house and Elijah was taken back to my grandparents. I just wish that my birthmom would find someone who can help her. I don't even know where I would be if she hadn't given me to that drug addict, and bless them for doing the right thing. I think of them almost every day, as they mde an amazing decision that changed my life. They knew they couldn't take care of me in the state they were in, and they saved me. I hope they got help. I hope my birthmom got help. And I hope that my birth dad was a good person. Nobody knows who my birthdad is, not even Candy. Her DID screwed up her mind so much.",2019-09-21T21:22:46Z,0
746,UgwJc8cnZLGpTXtABxd4AaABAg,Scribblebytes,"@Pamber 13
Whoa, I'm sorry to hear that. You're really strong. I can't imagine that kind of betrayal by a parent. The fact that you made it and we can have this conversation right now is a blessing all in itself! And thank you for being so authentic and standing in your story. For me, the way it manifested was in lying. From a young age I figured out that lying to my mom made her feel better and not come after me, so I ended up becoming a massive liar. But here's the thing that took me years to figure out, it wasn't that I was a liar to other people. I've always told the truth and I've never been one to do what I didn't want to do. The trick was that I was a major liar to myself. With my mom, I made excuses for why she was the way she was, and so that made it okay for me to let her treat me like a dog. In my mind I'd always say ""Oh, well, her mother was like that"" or ""she grew up in an extremely physically and mentally abusive household"" so it's okay that she treats me this way, because she doesn't know any better. That was the biggest mistake of my life because before I even knew it, I was attracted to and attracting people who I would create excuses for ALL the time. I felt comfortable with people like that. Just thinking about it makes me sick, and in a way it ties into being promiscuous because at the end of the day, it's about feeling so low so that you put yourself in dangerous situations with dangerous people who feel entitled to do with you what they please. The last guy that I let break my heart to shreds, literally doesn't give a fk. And when I started to question ""why would I fall in love, want to alter my life for someone who doesn't even care about me?"" I was able to work on it and find the root.
For a long time, I blamed my experience in high school. I was bullied and some sexually inappropriate things happened (I went to an all boys school) and throughout the entire time I would sit in the library and read psychology books, thinking up excuses for why they were doing this stuff to me. I had all the excuses in the book for them. I never realised my arrogance at not researching why I thought it was okay for them to do that to me. And when I'd tell my mom, she would dismiss me as if I was crazy. I'm not gonna front, that was the hardest time in my life because literally nobody cared. I remember going to ask the principal for help and they told me to write a letter. The teachers would look at me while things were happening, I can't tell you how that fked up my mind about people. So what did I do? I started using sex to protect myself. And I think this may give you insight on maybe why your mom might have done what she did.
I felt that, okay, these people won't leave me alone. So let me present myself in a hypersexualized way (which is what they liked) in order to protect myself. If I come on to them, and if I allow them to touch me and talk nasty to me, and encourage it, it's a lot better than being spat on, or harassed. So in my last year, after 4 years of doing nothing, I kinda became promiscuous. And then when I went to the real world, I carried that with me, but I lied to myself and said ""No, I have to sleep with people on the 1st date because I'm looking for love and I need to know if we have chemistry"". Lies. I was still just trying to protect myself and using sex as a power tool/defence mechanism. I don't wanna speak for your mom or invalidate all pain she caused you. But if it were me, I'd feel too ashamed to have a child around me because deep down you know the situation isn't right for an innocent child, but you just don't have any other way of dealing with things. If I didn't trust my 6th sense and get professional help on all fronts I would most likely be dead or in a gutter.
I don't mean to pry and if you don't wanna talk about it I respect that, but I'm sure the instability in your childhood caused you to have some kind of weird perception about people, if it did, how did those manifest in your life? Because its almost like a computer malware, you don't know it's there til something major happens and then you're like ""What in the hell? How did this happen?"" and you start unravelling it.",2019-09-21T20:43:10Z,0
747,UgwJc8cnZLGpTXtABxd4AaABAg,Pamber 13,"@Scribblebytes I'm sorry that happened to you. I can relate, not for myself but someone who I know has a very similar story. My birth mom was abused for six years by her father , and she ran away from home and became a prostitute because she had no money. She was also state hopping, as the police were after her. She drank, took drugs, and wouldn't stop running. She had my older half brother, and I don't remember what happened to him, but I know that he was adopted by my soon to be grandparents. They were also the foster parents of my birthmom at one point! (they weren't the abusive ones. They took her in at one point but her scarring and her DID convinced her to run away.!) Anyway, she eventually had me, and just dropped me off at some random persons house and said they would be back. Two weeks passed and she still didn't come back. The person was a drug addict and they knew they couldn't take care of me, so they turned me in. I eventually was adopted by the parents I lived in now, and my mom is my birthmom's sorta sister. My grandparents were my birthmom's foster parents while they were my mom's biological parents, so my mom was permanent and my birthmom was temporary. So as my birthmom was on the run she had multiple boyfriends, all of which abused her in some way. It wasn't her fault, as she was broken from the abuse she got, and she subconsciously thought that it was right. She still does have abusive boyfriends today. She was broken, and she couldn't be blamed. Do you think it could be the same way for you?",2019-09-21T19:37:10Z,1
748,UgwJc8cnZLGpTXtABxd4AaABAg,Scribblebytes,"@Pamber 13 I have been in toxic relationships and after 2.5 years of therapy (after the last one), I realised and accepted that it was my fault. I was the one who allowed myself to be treated badly because of how I grew up. I grew up in a home where I was taught to lie about my feelings in order to not upset my mother. My feelings never mattered. When I'd say I was sick and could not go to school, I'd be told I was lying. Stuff like that. Or I'd be blamed for stuff I didn't do, and when it comes out that I didn't do it, I'd never get an apology. I started thinking I was wrong for any little thing. And then as I got older, after attracting abusive and manipulative women my whole life (to the point that I even started hooking up with men to avoid women altogether, thinking that was the problem) I realised that it came from my childhood. Even the men I attracted were manipulative and shady. 
It was a lot of work to get my mind right, but I finally worked through it and now I attract healthier people who treat me with honesty. Yes, it's not as ""fun"" or ""exciting"". Women like Amber Heard are addictive, but it's only cause they're good manipulators and they make you feel special as a trick. 
I never judge a situation publicly unless I've been through something similar. I've been with so many gaslighting, drama queen women (lying, scheming, listening  through the door to private conversations with my friends, secretly recording my voice...It goes on) way more than manipulative men, that I still find it difficult to trust women and I probably never will (in a romantic relationship context) ever again in this lifetime.",2019-09-21T08:02:24Z,0

It was the first time that I had ever considered that men could be the abuse victims in a relationship.  I was much younger at the time and living in a healthy household, so this was news to me.  The one scene that sticks with me after more than 25 years is near the end when the husband, the main character who was the abuse victim calls a shelter for help and the woman at the other end of the line acts disgusted because she thinks he's trying to trick her and hangs up on him.  She erroneously thinks he's really trying to get her to reveal whether or not his wife is there, so he can find her and assault her further.  I really thought that was messed up.  What I didn't know at the time of watching it is that it's based on a true story.   So it's more than a quarter century later, and things haven't changed much.

When you very graciously thanked the OP in his use of the word lugubrious in the video, you seemed especially impressed bc he was Southern. While I very much enjoy the use of a great adjective, specifically, but words and the ability to effectively communicate in a broader sense (wordsmiths are exceedingly rare these days I feel), Southerners as a whole tend to be very careful and articulate communicators due in large part (at least certainly in my own personal experience), of non-Southerners' misconceived notion that we are of lesser intellectual ability as well as being largely less-educated compared to others everywhere else in the country, which as you know is an erroneous assumption to make.

889,UgxIUljLHabfaBznYe14AaABAg,Kt.H-talks to holograms,"Because Amber Heard is a clinical narcissist that thinks she is better and smarter than everyone else. She used her fake abuse claims for attention and to extend her 15 minutes of fame. No one even knew who she was before she married Johnny Depp. She used the pain of real DA survivors for her own gain. Amber abused others before Johnny and was arrested for DA against her girlfriend before she met Johnny Depp. It is uncomfortable to think a woman would lie about such a serious matter, but she did. Because Amber was the preptrator in that relationship and when she lost control of Johnny and he asked for a divorce, she took out her revenge on him and continued to attack him publicly. He is such a private man, I don't think she ever thought he would call her bluff and actually sue her for her false allegations. Johnny Depp has mountains of evidence proving his case that Amber lied and abused him. It's all there in black and white, 87 surveillance videos with metadata, 31 witnesses and Johnny's medical records. Amber has yet to bring any evidence to the table that she didn't fake and sell to the media. Amber tried to get this defamation case thrown out multiple times to no avail, this is the desperate action of someone who is afraid to go to court. Think about it...if this really happened to her and she is such an advocate for DV survivors then why not fight Johnny in court and legally prove her story. But she can't, because it never happened. ScAmber prosecuted Johnny only through the media and public opinion, she has always ran away from legal pursuits.The judge in 2016 dismissed the case with prejudice, because even back then her evidence was bs. So far, her lawyers have not even supeoned anyone in her defense or submitted her evidence. Johnny's lawyers on the other hand, have supeoned all her friends and lovers. Johnny is actively pursuing this case to clear his name after the years of damage she did to him and he will win.

They ended things on good terms and still remain friends from what I gather in the public letter Vanessa wrote in Johnny Depp's defense. She called their relationship wonderful and is listed as a character witness for him in the court case against ScAmber. All of JD's former partners have come forward in his defense. He is not abusive, but kind and gentle as far as they say. Also, he did not cheat. Johnny Depp takes monogamy very seriously and has talked about that in many articles over the years. He has never  been involved in any cheating scandals with any of his former partners and stayed with each one of them for many years. He did not start dating Amber until after he and Vanessa decided mutually to call it quits. Johnny was extremely generous to Vanessa. He gave her nearly half his fortune when they went their separate ways, even though he did not technically have to since they weren't actually married. As for Amber Heard, she is a deplorable person, who physically and emotionally abused Johnny Depp. She preyed on him, stalked him and controlled him. Then if that weren't enough, she falsely accused him and tried to ruin him publicly for personal gain. Her age has nothing to do with it. Johnny Depp is a genuine person and is a good guy, who did not deserve any of this and believing so, just because he married a younger woman is totally ignorant.

But he has been falsely accused of something there is no coming back from and that was her goal all along.

So instead of kicking him while he’s down how about you spread the good news he’s not a wife beater and it’s been proven in court give a man a chance , maybe if he had support he would get the help he deserves but he hasn’t been cause most people hate him now because like you they only see the bad .",2019-09-03T12:38:17Z,4

Unfortunately, when I found myself locked up in a holding cell, with about 30 other MEN who were arrested for various charges, I learned that there were plenty of falsely accused men in holding cells... jail... and prison.

I later came to understand that some of them were definitely abusive men... toward both men and women; however, what I witnessed was that the vast majority of abusive men are physically abusive towards both men and women. It's uncommon for a man to be solely abusive towards women. People need to open their eyes!

Additionally, after working in nightclubs and personal security for over two decades, I witnessed how women are far more physically abusive towards men, than vice versa. Unfortunately, physical abuse from women directed into men is somehow deemed _'acceptable.'_  When we see a woman being verbally and physically abusive towards her boyfriend, or husband, we think: he better not lay a hand in her. We don't allow for any situation, where it might be acceptable for the man to use physical force to escape his situation. Conversely, we allow a great deal of latitude to women to use whatever physical force is necessary to escape their situation... even deadly force.

No! Men are prisoners of their relationships, regardless of what you think now.

Even my wife, who is only 5'0"" tall and 9 lbs, has sometimes abused the ""don't touch me, or I'll call the police"" line, when she was extremely upset with me; and I've never been abusive toward her. You'll never know what it's like to have the person you love threaten call the police, when all you want to do is extract yourself from the situation (a.k.a. LEAVE). It's a helplessness that women DO abuse quite frequently.

I've been called to come get some of my friends; and take them away from _""domestic abuse""_ situations, where the only abusive person was the woman.

I love my wife... so do my friends love theirs... but the legal system is the furthest thing from a JUSTICE SYSTEM. It entirely favours women, the way it is now.",2019-08-29T04:49:26Z,8
986,Ugw0fNbPRIYZkYPaWHF4AaABAg,A side of Aioli,"Exactly. Sorry you went through that. Just know there are plenty of female ""allies"" who are against those practices of automatically taking the side of women, just because they are women. It does a disservice to all of us, male and female. 

It's important to recognize certain facts; that women are disproportionately the victims in domestic abuse, BUT that does not mean they are the ONLY victims. Nor does it mean that fabrication doesn't exist. 

I don't think the majority of abuse claims are false, I really do think it's a small percentage of claimants that abuse the system, and most are to be taken seriously. With the information available for this case however, with depp and heard, I'm tending to believe it IS one of those in that small percentage. And I'm sorry yours was too. Unfortunately we won't always know the real from the fake, which is why I say, give compassion and consideration to the claimant, while also sincerely considering/investigating the side of the defendant. At least until there is reasonably enough to form an opinion either way....and if not conclusively certain, keep an open mind that your opinion could be wrong.

Someone doesn't need to get professional help to move forward and nobody can force you to move forward and only you can decide to move forward. I've dealt with everything I went through on my own and it helps me know how much strength I have in me when I didn't know how strong I was. I didn't get professional help from anyone not even a friend and I'm glad I didn't get help. A professional psychiatrist or therapist will just make you talk when I can do the same to a friend. I didn't want to get help from a psychiatrist or therapist and I didn't want  any of my friends to help me because they would have a different perspective on the situation than someone who experienced it and since I knew exactly what happened to me I dealt with it on my own and if I told someone they would of had a different perspective on the situation. I didn't want to be on medication because that doesn't heal the root of the problem. For me I believe in spiritual healing and that has to be dealt with on someone own. Medication is not good either good or bad medication so only spiritual healing can do miraculous things to helping someone or anyone move forward.,2019-09-03T22:07:59Z,0

1010,Ugzn_p-qmFe9Nf9YGgd4AaABAg,MG,"@Helen K Haha, no. Try harder.

You didn't even try to dispute women being to ones to initiate divorces more often than not, you even try to dispute women being more likely to abuse kids, you didn't even try to dispute women get custody of the kids 85% of the time.

All you take issue with is the stats concerning DV. And no, women *ARE NOT* the victims ""waaay more than men"".
The thing about DV is that women are more likely to hit their partners, but they are arrested for DV only 15% of the time. That's where these bullshit statistics come from.

Most domestic violence is reciprocal. Meaning both partners are abusive. However, if you look at non-reciprocally violent relationships (meaning only one partner is abusive), then women are the aggressors 70% of the time.
Why do you think lesbian relationships are THE most violent out of all sexual relationships? Homosexual relationships are the LEAST violent btw, with heterosexual ones being in the middle. What is the common factor? Oh, right... WOMEN.

Men are more destructive though, meaning they deal out more damage once they do hit, which is why most people who die from DV are female, but that's NOT the same thing as saying most people who are victims of DV are therefore female. 

Even the most pro-female statistics out there still show that at the very least, men make up 40% of all DV victims. That is NOT ""way more"".

Except, as I've already proved, this phenomenon isn't ""just"" about a few crazy women here and there... most marriages fail this day and age, meaning a huge portion of women call for divorce, considering most divorces are initiated by women. Which leads to single mothers, etc.

These aren't just some random ""made up"" statistics, you can look them up for yourself, and honestly, you should already know about these things.

They fired him without looking into the evidence he has always had, that proved the allegations in 2016 were crap. The judge dismissed Amber's abuse claims with prejudice back in 2016, because she did not have any valid proof and still people ignored it as if he was found guilty. All this evidence we are now seeing, Johnny had back then in 2016. JD wanted to go to court back then and prove his innocence, but Amber withdrew her abuse claim to the courts and the case was dismissed with prejudice. She didn't have a leg to stand on because she had been the real perpetrator and abused him throughout their marriage. Her false allegations from the beginning had been a hoax and extortion, look at her blackmail letter to JD. I remember reading about that years ago and the media completely ignored it, back then and now. This video by Brian is fabulous and thorough, but it's sad that an average guy on YouTube has to make something like this, because bias journalists and media refuse report the truth about Johnny Depp, because it doesn't fit their narrative. POTC was one highest grossing films of 2017 and it made 794 million worldwide and still that wasn't enough for greedy Disney...ugh! Then Disney claims some bogus lie like it was always their intention to go in another direction with POTC. Yeah right.🙄 I don't believe it for a second, he was let go because of Amber's continually media assault on Johnny's character, no doubt about it. Johnny Depp is the only reason there is a franchise for POTC. More than half the dialogue in POTC was improvised by Johnny and everything about Jack Sparrow from his walk, look and talk came from JD's wonderfully creative mind. Even so,  Disney turned their back on him. Poor Johnny...he can't seem to catch a break nowadays. Even when he does something with honestly good intentions people/ media want to hate on him. It just seems like everyone is out to get him or misrepresent him. Too many people seem ok with throwing this innocent man under the bus. I think they would rather believe the lie than look into the evidence of his innocence. They don't want their opinions changed, even if they are proven wrong.

1129,UgwW3ZeTZqND5IfSBIN4AaABAg,Ericolas Chandra,"​@A side of Aioli of course false accusation is far worse than the actual crime.

1. the innocent get punished as much as the accusation for the crime he/she didnt commit. this alone is already as bad as the actual crime.
2. false accusations fade the real victims out. it would be harder to believe similar accusations, because of previous experience witnessing the false one. it multiplies the damages to further cases to other people who are the actual victims.
3. it attracts more abusers. if false accuser got away that easily, other gold diggers will figure that the methods work, so they will follow it. it multiplies the number of next abusers.

compare rapist who got away with false accuser who got away. the false accusers definitely do much more damage. everyone hates rapist, terrorist and criminals, but false accusers get pity, attention, even donation and charity. feminist always act as if there is rape culture and others are okay with such crimes. in fact, if ones rape a woman, other men will fight them to death.

everytime you feel there's a crime, just try report it to police. the officers will find a way to investigate it. yes, there are always some flaws and loopholes in law, but it still definitely better to tell the polices instead of telling the story to politicians and medias.",2019-08-30T01:40:43Z,0
1130,UgwW3ZeTZqND5IfSBIN4AaABAg,A side of Aioli,"@Ericolas Chandra I can appreciate you reading my entire comment. I'm obv not that great at being concise. But anyway. 

Yes, holding back evidence is a problem. But abuse crimes don't always leave behind a trail of evidence. What evidence would I have for the guys that cornered me at a party and tried to break into my rm? Witness testimony? Everyone was shitfaced. Or the person that grabbed my chest and ran? I was walking home alone. 

I'm actually dumbfounded that you foreal stated that false accusations are worse than the actual crime though. One, every situation is diff, how can you make such a statement across the board? Second, you can't qualify or measure the harm done to someone after being a victim of crime. It's like saying _""I'm more damaged from losing a loved one than you are at being diagnosed with end stage cancer.""_ We each feel our own pain and stress, we each have our own mental demons and limitations. You can only know what your pain feels like, you cant feel pain for anyone else. 

And I know males suffer abuse. That was never something I denied. My ex (male) was sexually abused as a kid. It is disgusting no matter who it happens to. It's sad that our society doesn't always take male abuse seriously. And I genuinely feel terrible that it's taboo for guys to show emotion or vulnerability. I agree with you on that. I think having conversations like this, and being open to understanding other pov's is what turns us into better human beings.

1131,UgwW3ZeTZqND5IfSBIN4AaABAg,Ericolas Chandra,"​@A side of Aioli i replied to the long version not to TLDR.

on first paragraph you basically said that I have no rights to believe or not believe on the victimhood story. I think it depends on the provided evidences. Accusers who refused provide any evidence dont deserve trust anyways. The principle is being called innocent until proven guilty. False accusation is far worse than the actual crime, and only false accusers would avoid investigation. is it so hard to report illegal acts to police instead of spreading it thru internet?

fuck, no one condone or celebrate rape nor any illegal acts. it's very unfortunate. it's been illegal for a long time and no one will against the victims of rape, all the victims need to do is to report it to police. Dont let political groups ride the story for their agenda. that's why real victims better not to use #metoo. there are many gold diggers using it now for bashing men.

just report it to police, it's simple. #metoo does nothing but made it worse and worse. I gotta tell you something, this might surprise you: men have tons of bad experience too. the difference is that the system you mention above expect men to always protect women and children, so men  dont cry women may cry (read: ask of public to help). it's unfair right? feminist do agree it's unfair but they mean it's unfair for women. they demand more unfairness towards men with addition myths such as wage gap, pink tax, rape culture, etc. Too much hoax and lies already.

1132,UgwW3ZeTZqND5IfSBIN4AaABAg,A side of Aioli,"@Ericolas Chandra I wrote a lot.  The TLDR for the last half of my comment: You have no right to judge someone for not going to the cops, nor do you know why some don't report. 

A system that relegated women to being under men. We couldn't own land, or vote until the 20 century. In antiquated practices, we were literally purchased by men with marriage. Even education, when given that right, reflected our perceived value at the time. For awhile, college for women meant degrees in home economics or domestic sciences. And yes, domestic violence used to be seen as a tool to keep wives in their place. All of this, and similar things were not plans or ideas orchestrated by women. Men created those laws and standards. That's the system I referred to, one that gave men the upper hand, with women holding little power, and vulnerable to abuse. Feminism rose out of all that, and demanded for women to be seen as human beings no less than a man. So the treatment of women is what spawned feminism. You cant blame feminism unless you're going to first blame WHY women turned to feminism. 

And you can hold that belief all you want about the validity of abuse claims, won't make it true though. I've had guys corner me at parties, and tell me what they were going to do to me, follow me back to my room (college) and try to get through the door. I've been roofied, but thankfully my friend found me in the bathroom stall with him before anything was done. Once while walking home, a teen grabbed my chest and ran.This is all to say, I've been sexually harassed plenty. And attempted rape. Those were just 3 of my experiences, my life. Things that happened to ME. My decision to keep quiet about it up until this point is my business, and my prerogative. You don't have the right to tell me what to do with my experiences. You can suggest, but ultimately it's my decision. And You have no idea why someone may or may not report a crime. You're right, It is brave to report, but not all decisions not to report are due to that. I didn't realize until #metoo that what I had experienced was illegal. I didn't even realize it was sexual harassment, I just chucked it up to situations with shitty guys, nothing more. How many more like me didn't realize their experiences counted? How many maybe feared for their life, and were scared away from reporting? How many worried no one would believe them? How many feared they'd be the one to get a bad reputation, or blamed for it? How many put their family or loved ones first, and didn't want to bring any negativity to them? How many just couldn't completely remember enough that they felt confident to report? How many withdrew into themselves, sinking into a deep depression that kept them from feeling that they deserved justice? 

You don't know why, and it's none of your business. I pray you don't ever find yourself in a situation where you're made to feel either guilty or like a liar for not speaking out about a wrong done to you. I also hope that if you can be so cold and strict towards those who don't report actual assault, that you're not a hypocrite and you speak up for EVERYTHING. That means the old guy at the grocery store being racist, the kid at the mall being rude and disrespectful or shoplifting, the woman at work who you know is lying. If you expect ppl to report actual serious things, you better be able to stand up and speak out for the small things. If a traumatized abuse victim is reprimanded for keeping quiet, you better be able to voice any wrong you witness.",2019-08-29T07:40:11Z,0
1133,UgwW3ZeTZqND5IfSBIN4AaABAg,Ericolas Chandra,"@A side of Aioli what system did you mean built by men? I dont remember any underground meeting for building such world-wide oppresive system for women. lol. realisticly speaking, women make 50% of population, it's just natural that political party/group or individuals trying to appeal for women's vote. the abuse is that they created a victimhood narative to replace the principle of ""innocent until proven guilty"". for that they need real victims to be part of their group too. I'm sorry for the real victims whose story were being used for political agenda. If someone claimed to be a victim with #metoo but wasnt brave enough to report it to police for investigation, I will not buy it. In the end it's investigation report that is trustworthy, not #metoo",2019-08-29T05:55:34Z,0
