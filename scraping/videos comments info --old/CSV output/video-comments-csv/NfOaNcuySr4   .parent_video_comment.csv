Don't make me laugh!
She's the worst possible choice for that role and there's no way in hell she represents me!
Every word out of her mouth just smacks of fakeness and narcissism.

And central park Karen got what she deserved the first time.
There's no baseless claims.
The privileged white woman saw a black man who was minding his own business and she decided to have a massive freak out.
If she had seen a white man bird watching, she wouldn't have bothered him.

I'm not a die hard fan of Depp but what she and the media and the industry have done to him have turned me into a huge supporter and will boycott anything to do with Heard.

Logical depression at least makes sense.
When it happens to me or my wife.
It can be figured out a dealt with and has a sort of origin.
The fact that the brain takes something one can usually deal with
And turns up your system to 11
So the molehill becomes a mountain.
Easy peasy... sorta.
But...
When Clinical Depression hits... üò®
This is when your just chugging along and the world is just a turd sandwich but hey who cares because love exists and we shall overcome and magic gummies are legal and TRANSFORMERS toys are awesome and life is good.
Then for no F@#$ing reason at all, your brain turns against you and your soul falls out.
üò≥
And. It. Won't. Stop. Being.... difficult.
You cannot talk to it.
All you want is sleep, weed, hugs and the quiet darkness of the Batcave of Solitude.
It cannot be reasoned with.
It won't just stop.
The meds help a bit.

But man does it get in the way of Life.
Inconvenient. To say the least.
Dangerous, more often than anyone knows.

89,UgyGbYJurq1GypDTXyh4AaABAg,"Okay, so as far as Any Cooper goes.

I am a dog owner who loves my state and national parks. We hike (and donate each time) at a park near us that requires dogs be leashed, and only use the trails on the weekends so birdwatchers can enjoy the birds undisturbed during the week. We follow those rules. And we even go beyond that and purposefully avoid any of the small loops on the trail that have benches for birdwatching and the info plaques of the birds to look for in the area. 

Amy and similar dog owners are a nuisance themselves. I cannot stand that they are causing parks to ban dogs all together because they can't follow basic rules and live in harmony.",V T,0,2021-06-01T16:29:48Z

Personally, I think the issue here is colour-blind - she allegedly unnecessarily wasted police time, she allegedly misrepresented a situation to the police in order to weaponise them. 

It does make me uncomfortable that companies will sack people, not so much for those crimes, but for sentiments, for racism.

I don't see what it has to do with the employer, basically.

Nobody can deny that social media is now, measured by practical effect, reducing our personal freedoms, via the pressure online users can effectively exert on an employer.

""Central Park this morning: This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.

ME: Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there.
HER: The dog runs are closed. He needs his exercise.
ME: All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.
HER: It's too dangerous.
ME: Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.
HER: What's that?
ME (to the dog): Come here, puppy!
HER: He won't come to you.
ME: We'll see about that...

I pull out the dog treats I carry for just for such intransigence. I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.

HER: DON'T YOU TOUCH MY DOG!!!!!

That's when I started video recording with my iPhone, and when her inner Karen fully emerged and took a dark turn...""

[End of Christian Cooper's FB account]

It's clear that he made a threat and that he wanted to lure her dog to him to give it food (this could very well be poisoned). He did this to get a reaction and it was even premeditated since he brought dog treats! As soon as the woman was in distress, he started recording. She describes him to the police as an African American man because he is an African American man. She says that he threatened her and her dog which he did BY HIS OWN ADMISSION. I want to know what your reaction would be if a massive guy (he looks very large) does this to your wife, sister, mother or daughter while they are alone and walking their dog.",JorgelShmorgel,1,2021-05-29T09:35:30Z

It's the approach I take to it, sad amusement, and it doesn't feel performative because it affected your work when you didn't want it to. It doesn't feel like it's intended to raise awareness, it's just being straight with your audience. And that's the kind of thing I appreciate from like youtubers or that athlete girl talking about it. Like at least with top youtubers the schedule being interupted isn't going to screw them over financially, but it makes the point that for the rest of us, or with athletes or traditional celebs traditional systems, those systems aren't designed to deal with breakdowns or the effect they have on people. 

On the other hand, when Dodie made that video a few years ago about dissociation, while she was, it was an aspect of mental health and depression that was rarely seen, and it was cathartic for me. And later her video of the pandemics effects on her, on everyone really, being similar.

The average person doesn't enjoy the same job security, and protections against discrimination that come with being a celebrity. I have experienced discrimination as recently as 2018. I was in a graduate program for clinical counseling and my advisor and director of the program found out I have bipolar, I was ultimately forced to leave the program as a result. I have also been denied/lost employment for requesting a set schedule so I could schedule therapies and get good sleep to stay healthy. They claimed the rotating schedules were company policy. Even with ADA stating that they are required to provide reasonable supports and accommodations. Actors, musicians, artists do not face those same barriers.

They ignored all the evidence which went against her claims and instead just relied on her testimony to prove her case. That's not how justice works. Furthermore she almost definitely lied about the charity thing as originally she wanted $50,000 a month, which she did not receive. I doubt that someone so greed would actually donate their settlement to charity, but the judge and jury ate it up. Johnny's past lovers have also stated they believe the claims are false, and there is recorded evidence of her admitting violence towards him.

I know that these days, fit women are often stronger than most men, and trained women are more dangerous than most men. My high school wrestling team was co-ed. Two of the the girls, both petite, were among the most capable wrestlers on the varsity team regardless of weight. The coaches even had the whole team watch a 3 fall match between one ~130lb girl and a beefy ~270lb freshman giant. It was very one sided in the girl's favour.

The video proves nothing either way. But its NYC, so the woke left of course says its racism, because it involves a dispute between a white person and a POC, and the white person is always racist regardless of the video.

AP reporters should not expect the organization to stand by them. If you want to have a political bent there are plenty of organizations you can get a job at.

As a person who doesn't get an incentive for my vax, but would love some student loan relief, let's adopt that wording to say some priorities are lower, and the relief might help raise those lower priorities up. 10-50k would definitely inspire me to tighten my belt further and pay down the remaining section of my loans.

The time for talking is over; *it's now time to fucking **_DO_** something.*



The current state of public psychiatric hospitals and wards is so horribly mismanaged, underfunded, understaffed and absolutely deplorable considering the wealth of this country. The people kept in psychiatric wards have NOTHING. They have no voice, they have no strength, they have no influence. We are treated like sick, dying livestock that needs to be quarantined and forgotten about, left to die. Only 38% of public psych hospitals even have a fucking crisis prevention team. From the 2018 NMHSS survey, 15 states had their inpatient facilities operated at or over 100% capacity meaning there are more patients than beds.

We are kept in the most dark, cramped, cold buildings. They are not built for rehabilitation, but for _containment._  It is a literal prison; the only difference is that instead of being beaten by a CO you're restrained/sedated by nurses. In 2018, about 50% of involuntary admissions to public psych hospitals had a criminal legal status. The links between mental illness, substance abuse, psychiatric hospitals, and prison are deep and have a lot of crossover.

Link for the stats; honestly I didn't even scratch the _surface_

I am _extremely_ lucky that I was able to get out, but I will never forget the fear I felt. I remember at my hearing (because I was there involuntarily, there was basically a little ""hearing"" that was done to judge whether or not I needed to stay) I calmly, respectfully, and intelligently gave my case, but the judge never even _looked at me_. It was as if I wasn't even there; I had never been so humiliated, and I felt pure terror believing I would never be able to get out. You are truly not seen as a human being by those who don't work with you everyday. There are more than enough stories that can be found of others who have been in psych wards that showcase what it's like living in such a hellhole. 

We need to be getting more momentum for policies and changes that can be made; thankfully there are some working on that. https://mentalillnesspolicy.org/ is a great site that gives statistics on serious mental illness to give guidance to those that can actually help them. When talks of mental illness are brought up, THIS is the kind of thing that needs to be highlighted and focused on.

1319,Ugw9bHULto4GVGz3AB14AaABAg,"Glad that mental health is being more publicized. The brain is a crazy organ. One of the natural things that the brain does is create stress. The brain wants to be challenged. When there is no challenge or external stress factors  to make the brain think. For example, physical exertion, socializing and academic goals (school or personal). If there is no stress for long enough The brain starts to re-wire it‚Äôs self, possibly shrink in clinically depressed individuals, and makes it harder to do those external stressors to help ‚Äúrecharge‚Äù the brain, making it re-wire more. And the downward spiral continues. 
All of that being said we live in a society where being the victim is cool. You probably can walk down any crowded area, have a conversation with someone and eventually they would either say that they are bipolar, have anxiety, have PTSD, or sometimes they‚Äôll say they have clinical depression. (Which is rare but likely) when in actuality they in fact do not have any diagnosis of any of these mental illnesses. 
Talk to any combat veteran who has been diagnosed with PTSD and discuss the symptoms they experience, you might find that it‚Äôs miles away what other people claim to have experience. 
This is not a comment to put down those who have mental illnesses, it‚Äôs just to make light that there are real people suffering from these experiences and others just speaking out of their ass for clout.",Gatlin Baugus,0,2021-05-28T02:30:24Z

I was laid off unexpectedly during Covid from my job after getting the highest rating for performance you could and has only happened twice in the company. The reason wasn't due to Covid but because they lost a major contract and wanted to put someone else in my position (Different Contract) that made 4x the amount I did to bring the company more money (This company is pretty much gone now and lost the contract for letting me go). This was right after buying myself a vehicle and I am still going to college. I was really stressed out at first from it. Unemployment didn't cover my bills. My mother thankfully helped me out some until I got the increase from gov aid. Got a job offer a few months ago requiring an S+ which I got after a month of studying and now have a new job on a 5-year contract making twice as much as I did before with the company willing to pay for all my future schooling and certifications I would like. I understand life is rough, but don't tell me if I didn't have 2-5mil I wouldn't be set to not have to worry about anything money-wise in life again which for me seems like everything right now other than family. The past year hit by covid and before that hit by hurricane Michael. Life has been intense the last few years but it is on the up which I am thankful for and the extra money I am making will go to paying back my mother, school, savings, and investments. This time around I will also get my savings account to 10k instead of 1k in case anything crazy happens and always keeping 1k in my checking account for now own.

You, using your ""issues"" to write a narrative about mental health, is using your social influence to create more capital gains for your platform/media releases, knowing your name alone will generate more revenue. If celebrities truly want to speak about mental health, they should use their influence to get a true message out from their productions rather than try to relate to the common man in social media. 
It's pandering to think Ryan Reynolds and I  have anywhere near the same ability to handle our individual struggles. Maybe some celebrities do need help, like all humans might, they aren't super-humans. The difference is they have the ability to help themselves infinitely more ($$ bills), and subsequently others (through media), where individuals rarely see any support or difference in their lives if they lack these fundamental structures, from income, to family/friends/supporters. We aren't the same and trying to think you are is ignoring the disparity between socioeconomic power of individuals, no matter how well meaning either side is.

1681,UgwOZKaLusFwqlArtGl4AaABAg,With the Karen lady I think she‚Äôs a symptom of a much larger problem in society. She is what happens when you raise people unchecked who believe they can do whatever they want. Usually found in women but  men as well just to a lesser extent. It‚Äôs this weird mentality they have where they can talk and say all this bullshit and act like their free of all consequences and then when they get in trouble it‚Äôs not even conceivable. Basically the outcome of people not raising others right and them growing up in an environment that pampers them so when the real world hits they breakdown like said lady did. She prolly would have done that with any men she found threatening even women just who she is a scared person with no idea how to talk to people or engage with them.

I have a high chance of a bad side effect.  I can not afford to be out of work for 3+ days if I do in fact have side effects. 

I'm not talking about the possible side facts of this specific vaccine but ALL vaccines. I don't even get a flu shot anymore because of the side effects. I was out for 3 days last time I did. I'm not putting myself threw that for a yearly shot with the flu shot. 


Now I realize covid is different and hopefully it's more like mumps and such where it's a 1 time shot for roughly life. 


I would risk the side effects for a covid shot but I CAN NOT afford to miss that time off work. 

If someone was willing to support me and pay my lost wages I would sign up for a covid shot. I don't want a chance at $1mil... I just want my lost pay for a few days.

It can become a who hit first, he said, she said‚Äî but personally, with Depp and Heard, I‚Äôm focusing on the fact that the relationship ended because both partners were toxic with each other. Yes, I think she hurt him, and also yes, I think he hurt her. It also gets more complicated with the abuse of drugs and alcohol. Depp could also not clearly remember what happened while under the influence. He could genuinely believe that nothing happened‚Äî or could be misremembering incidents. 

Domestic violence is not clear cut‚Äî the whole beaten wife image is not the only reality. Wish more people understood that. 

It‚Äôs complicated‚Äî and there‚Äôs 3 sides to this story: Heard‚Äôs, Depp‚Äôs, and the truth‚Äî I really hope that both Depp and Heard move past this era and focus on their own lives and healing.

LAPD said she was not injured at all, they did not consider her a victim of DV, the apartment that Johnny supposedly trashed was perfectly fine and the new bodycam footage which was not used as evidence in the UK courts against NGN also proves this too. Nothing happened!  Now she is being investigated for perjury. They all lied! 

The ACLU and Amber are both to blame for working together to write such a defamatory op-ed, it was still approved and partly written by AH, many drafts mention the marriage. It was always about JD and they targetted him during the start of MeToo with the aim to release the op-ed at the best time to get the most traction thus do more damage to JD's career.

1. If she felt scared or threatened why was she up close to him at the start of the video? Why was she not seen running away when the video was filmed if he had just threatened her? How come her tone drastically shifted when she was connected to an operator?

2. If Christians did threaten Cooper, why did he pull out his phone to record? It doesn't make any sense to threaten to hurt someone or do something bad, and the immediately record it, nor does it make sense that she would be so close to him.

3. If Cooper is a victim, why did she say to CHRISTIANS that she was going to tell the police of his race? It makes sense to say that to the police, but it doesn't make sense to specify that to the accused.

The only defense for Cooper is that Christians threatened her, but the fact that this video exists contradicts the idea that he had the intention to hurt her, and the way she acts shows that she wasn't scared.

It's one you highlighted today and it's one that the last year, in particular, had me put more into focus. I am 49 and a husband/father. For my entire life I have been some kind of an entertainer to varying degrees of success. For the last 10 years I have been a musician. A write some songs/learn some covers/grab my guitar and go play at a bar guy.  For years it was evening life only but then I got laid off and made the decision with my family to go full time. So, for the past 4 years I have been full steam ahead, until the pandemic. I took a more regular job to pick up the slack. Anyway, here is my point. I have every reason to be happy. I have amazing friends, a loving family, a grown son who is fantastic and most of all, I make a living almost entirely doing what I love. It's a struggle, yes, but on good days I feel lucky. I have some fans and venues that like to hear me play. People listen to the music I write  But that depression creeps in. Even when I know I am doing enough, I beat myself up inside. I realize that no amount of success or fan-love could ever change that. That this thing inside me will be inside me no matter how great my world is... because it's pretty great now. It comes back to that old saying, ""no matter where you turn, there you are"". No matter how beautiful a day, we do all carry the capacity inside of us to be horrible to ourselves.

When people are suffering and/or not getting the help they deserve and need, breaks my heart, I'm so happy it's finally is becoming a little be it better and we're moving forward at least to take away stigmas etc. about mental health. 
One area of comfort for example that means a lot to me is with music. One being Jonghyun, he really did so much to be there for his fans and people, about his own feelings, struggles etc, it's okey to feel down, stressed and so on and actually talking about these things. Specially in a country where it's the biggest taboo ever to talk about it. 
Unfortunately he did not overcome his struggles and we lost him in late 2017.  His lyrics and messages throughout his career was inspirational and comforting for many. 
I only got to know him right after his passing unfortunately, but his work and learning about him made me a fan and it struck deep with me man.
He is greatly missed and he'll never be forgotten.üíéüåπ

2498,UgzFtSLWcam9V0FKZ-B4AaABAg,"Disclaimer: It's a wall, but I thought about all of it. Might be worth a read.

Maybe I'm being negative, because I can understand and appreciate the sentiment, but here's how I feel about the idea of celebrities talking about their mental health helping regular people. 

If you're someone who, like me, doesn't look up to people because they're famous, and your mental health situation is caused by issues famous people don't have to deal with (poverty, for example), it does require that said depressed regular person already be in a mindset of wanting to look for silver linings and things to hang their hope on for a celebrity's confessions to have much of an impact.

The problem with mental health issues, depression in particular, is that sufferers don't spend all or most of their time in a hopeful mindset. I mean just be real, I'm sure you know from first and secondhand experience that when someone is on a downswing, they're not unlikely, when hearing about a celebrity/more successful person's depression, to compare in every way how much worse their situation is objectively and how few options they have compared to the celebrity. It's naive to imagine that every depressed person is just primed and waiting to hear words of support to jump-start their recovery. Depressed people often don't even want to listen.

I've just had a fundamental aversion to celebrity worship my whole life, and so many things, this example included, feel like extensions of that. I feel like, to the extent the kinds of benefits you're suggesting exist in this case, there's a lot more post-hoc, subconscious rationalization going on in holding up mainly celebrity stories as examples than people realize.

We have the internet - it's more feasible than ever to share the stories of regular people instead of rich and famous ones. I don't think the reason we still choose celebrity stories is based on an honest analysis of efficacy - we just have an obsession with celebrity, and want to find ways to include it in every conversation, and I think that leaves a lot of people behind while we believe we're ""bringing awareness"". Honestly that phrase feels like a cop-out to me. It's not valueless to bring awareness to a topic, but if that's all you do, it doesn't really help anyone in the short-term. Lots of people will still fall through the cracks and be lost while the awareness of the issue is slowly sinking in without anyone just addressing the problem directly - all the actual regular people suffering right now. HELP them if you want to help them. We're aware now, let's start putting it into action.

Edit: ""Bring awareness"" to me feels kind of like ""I'll pray for you"". Assuming you believe the thing will work in either case, at best you're outsourcing your help and support to some distant force. If you don't want to go around and help individuals, at least don't assume the moral virtue that comes with helping individuals. And if you aren't helping individuals, honestly I don't know what specifically you're trying to accomplish. Are there some specific mental health industry reforms anyone is pushing for? Or does everyone just bring awareness to the fact that it's a problem?

Disclaimer, though, I'm obviously not saying people should talk less about mental health. I'm saying that, IF all you have the means to do is talk, at the very least be specific. ""Bring awareness"" isn't anything. To whom? Are THEY aware now? Did it help in this case? What was the actual result of any of it? 

There's more work involved in helping people than bringing awareness to the fact they need help, and I feel like this conversation has not progressed in the past 15 years to a point where people acknowledge that yet.",Ryleigh S,0,2021-05-27T22:06:51Z

It has been proven that she perjured herself on multie occassions and she is still getting plenty of offers and being rewarded while Depp gets dragged. No one wants to bring up her bs but have no issue pushing everything they have about Depp. If someone is an abuser they should be punished. Man or woman it does not matter.

You are included in that portion of people.
It doesnt bring me any comfort knowing Ryan Reynolds struggles with anxiety like me. Most of my issues would be gone if I traded bank accounts with the guy.
He's my favorite actor but I don't really give a crap about his mental health. It does nothing for me. Everyone struggles with something.
No one who actually struggle in life will feel better knowing a rich celebrity stuggles with the same thing they do.
It's not for the same reasons. What do you want me to say about it? Good for them, they are human too? They can fling some pocket money at the issue and feel better about themselves I don't view that as very genuine.

lady, all he was doing was asking you to leash your dog and his weapon of choice was a pair of binoculars
Either you wantonly used your race by pretending to be panicked to get him arrested or shot by saying 'An African American man is threatening my life'
Which is a lie because we all heard him say please call the cops, and please leash your dog
OR you are so racist that just being alone with a black man was terrifying to you because your automatic reaction was that he was an immediate threat to your life regardless of context
Trying to sue her job is so stupid but with the way the justice system works I would not be surprised if she won. Remember 'afluenza' worked as a defense for murder, so...
Just really....the kind of white lady that makes the rest of us blush and say 'please don't group me in with her. This is so embarrassing....'
What really gets me is that she's fuming mad that they fired her and 'ruined her life' by having her branded a racist, which she is, without once thinking of the IRONY that if the cop that approached Christian had been like Derek Chauvin he would likely be dead now, life gone and his family grieving, or arrested with a criminal record that would actually mess his life up.
Bitch, all he did was say leash your dog, by a sign right there saying leash your dog. If you don't want to, go to a section of the park where you can go leashless or to a dog park. THESE THINGS EXIST AND YOU CAN USE ONE WITHOUT THREATENING A MAN'S LIFE.
If this had been a smoker trying to light up in a place with a clear sign saying 'no smoking' would you be saying this is a case of an overzealous anti smoker targeting her as part of an ongoing feud with the smoking community? Probably, because you're an idiot. But it would be just as stupid.

She has convinced a professional therapist that she has changed her thought process, and understands that her false accusations could have potentially  caused a death but her current actions show it was all an act.
