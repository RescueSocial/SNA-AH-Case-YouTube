When I heard the audio it was like my dad channeling through AH. The lies... And how they lash out when confronted with the truth. I instantly knew Jd was the victim and this demon of a woman the abuser. She is going down now. She is getting caught in her very own web of lies and there is no escaping. Australia is preparing a case against her for perjury and instigating others to commit perjury. A criminal and federal case.

9,UgxsK6HR5Cdd7ciETxV4AaABAg,"I honestly don't know what to do when my mom is screaming at me. She gets mad at me if I cry or show emotion, but then also gets mad when I don't.",Cassie Campbell,1,2021-04-20T02:35:40Z
10,UgwofbFEqIMxzvFGLPd4AaABAg,"I just realized my mom does this exact same thing... When she is yelling shit to me or telling my siblings shit that they shouldn't put up with, I stand up to her. She then uses an intimidation tactic like making her voice deeper and quieter, threatening to take away everything that makes me happy, glaring at me as if to say, ""try me""... so obviously, I do the stupid impulsive thing (cuz no way in hell is she going to make me scared or make me back down or revoke the thing I am standing up against) she reverts to yelling and throwing things at me, pushes me down the stairs and into walls, slapping me, ect. I do not back down. I know this is my fault for ""prodding the bear"" but the more she tries to hush me the more I refuse to stand down. I also believe that in no way shape or form, no matter how mad or irritating your child can get, should you hit a child. 

The most recent incident I became aware of her abuse was when I remember her very clearly pushing me down my stairs. I looked up at her, horrified. I had no words. She had no remorse as if she could hear what I was thinking, and told me, ""oh, stop being a drama queen. You tripped, stop victimizing yourself."" At first, I tried convincing myself that it was just an accident. Or that I was just being ""dramatic"". But then, very slowly, I was able to separate reality from fantasy. As soon as I could after any incidents, I would write down everything I could remember. Then, when she would convince me that I just have a ""bad memory"" and explain the incidents from her point of view, she could manipulate the events to make it seem like it was my fault. For that particular incident, I confronted her several weeks later about the manipulation (I know what you are thinking... Prob not the smartest thing to do lmao). After she realized she couldn't manipulate my memory, she told me, ""you should have not given me attitude. It was all your fault."" 

Her mental abuse was far worse than her physical abuse in my opinion. She gave me an inability to seperate fantasy from reality, and dissuaded me on talking to anyone about it. She also made me feel like I was the terrible daughter. For a very long time, I was on the verge of suicide because I thought of myself as a monster. I would have brief periods of realization to her abuse, but then she always tamed me back into thinking I was at fault. Also, to help her allibie, she acted like the sweetest mother alive to anyone else. My stepfather is also a victim of her mental abuse and unfortunately is still under her spell. Everyone who she thinks I would be close with, she would come off as the last women who would ever be abusive. Even jokes about abusive parents to other people and asks as if horrified, ""wHo would dO something like this to tHeIr kIdS?!"" Nevertheless, her facade worked. The few people I actually did confront (before she went into her really sweet phase) all told me it was impossible, and that she loved me. Essentially calling me a liar and overdramatic. With her constantly telling me that, and with other adults I seemingly trusted telling me that, I believed it. You can bet I never mentioned the abuse ever again.",Cassie Campbell,5,2021-04-20T02:32:49Z

They‚Äôre all tortured souls who you can not fix. You are only useful to them for your resources. They exploit your ability to feel empathy for their pain. Something they can never do in return. Learn your boundaries and stick to them religiously. Do not excuse or ignore patterns of bad behavior anymore. The word NO is a beautiful word. Do not avoid rejection. If you are not someone‚Äôs cup of tea that is good information and worth paying heed to in order to skip having painful entangled sickening relationships. It‚Äôs ok to not give any üí©‚Äôs about the opinion of selfish ego monsters trying to designate people as nice/good people or not. Their criteria about wether someone they meet is a nice person or good is based on their assessment of how much they think they exploit you.
