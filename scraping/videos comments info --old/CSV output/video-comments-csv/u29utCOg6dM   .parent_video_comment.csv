23,Ugwxer5Un1j4_b6H2a54AaABAg,"I don't believe Amber Heard ever loved Johnny Depp. He loved her even deahlt with her mood swings, and anger issues. Did Depp not see this in the beginning of their relationship before he married her?  You know Depp and Amber were dating for a while, before he married her. I think she used him. Hid her intentions very well. Amber Heard was still seeing Elon Muskrat. ONE MONTH, after being married to Johnny Depp, this Elon Muskrat was coming over after hours, when Depp was out of town filming. Elon even had his own garage key, for this 3 times a week visitations.. Sounds like a booty Call to me. Elon being a control freak, and not taking no for an answer... This was a S&M 50 Shades of Gray, with a couple of Bruises.. Security at the desk noticed, Amber with Mark's around her neck, and Depp was out of town.  She also had the actor, James Franko over as well.  If you're not doing anything wrong, then why was Franko and Heard real close in the elevator trying to hide your faces?
If this woman, wanted this type of life style, bed whoever she wanted, involve yourself in whatever drug substances, then why get FREAKING MARRIED??  Amber Heard, you should have left Johnny Depp alone.

30,Ugw1TI9fUN4D6gvhH3J4AaABAg,"Most people aren‚Äôt shitting on Christopher Reeves or Michael Keaton. But it‚Äôs clear WB are actively trying to replace the shortly-lived legacy Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck. Flash‚Äôs first live action movie is looking like it‚Äôs going to be a mess. It does not make sense to bring Michael Keaton into the DCEU. At least for now. With Spiderman: No Way Home it‚Äôs different, because marvel and Sony set up and EARNED a multiverse crossover. WB is most likely just using cheap nostalgia tactics because they don‚Äôt know what the hell to do at this point.

And now you have the inclusion of Supergirl in Flash and the casting of a new superman. They‚Äôre throwing a bunch of random shit at the wall to see if it sticks. If I‚Äôm wrong I‚Äôm wrong but it‚Äôs hard to see any organization from WB right now. #restorethesnyderverse

The whole snyderverse sucks. Not just the Snyder trilogy. BUt they allowed Snyder to screw up the whole universe by casting the whole Justice league... HORRIBLY.
Gal Gadot... can't act... WW 1 was only decent by the grace of Chris Pine, Patty Jenkins, and a decent script. WW84... had Patty Jenkins thinking she was a writer so it sucked... and Gal sucks in Justice League.
Ezra Miller sucks as the Flash.
Ray Fisher is a whiney baby who can't get hired anywhere else cause he's not a good actor.
Dude-Bro Rock Star Aquaman is a mediocre character... but it's not Aquaman.
And Ben Affleck's Batman was the WORST. He was lame-o murder-man in BVS... and he was tired and burnt out SADffleck in Justice League.
Henry Cavill was NEVER Superman. He was just Man of Steel. Poor dude. He was clearly so pumped to finally play something resembling Superman in Justice League... but that was all ruined by mustaches, reshoots, and SnyderCuts.
Then Ayer ruined Joker with Suicide Squad.
The SnyderVerse is an epic fail as far as a connected movie universe goes, and even WORSE as a DC universe adaptation.
