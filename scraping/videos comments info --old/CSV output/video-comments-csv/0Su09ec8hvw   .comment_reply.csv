13,UgxUkyvIOvTe_LH3eC14AaABAg,sad times,@World of Art She gets away with it because she's a hot woman?? I think people at WB don't want to fire her because it doesn't look good for feminism (still confusing tho since literally everyone now knows that she was the abuser; if they fire her now there wouldn't be any backlash),2021-01-18T05:24:28Z,0
14,UgxUkyvIOvTe_LH3eC14AaABAg,World of Art,Because she is women. Hot women  It make her easy getting away tickets.,2021-01-18T03:35:55Z,0

18,UgwOIgPbhIontjBsH9Z4AaABAg,The Shibanaire,@Nightshade Novels atleast his part he plays better then fisher... I actually like this flash Ezra yea made some mistakes but man up to them unlike fisher just spreading lies and bullshit with no evidence of anything he claims and he actually sucks as an actor. Ezra acted the part perfectly.. fisher can't act for shit,2021-01-16T12:59:26Z,1
