80,UgyixNPHL0j3s8ZZnad4AaABAg,whatsup who,"Johnny's ex, Vanessa and the rest, sided with Johnny. he was never an abuser.
i even have a friend, she purposely got pregnant by one of the the 10 richest men in our country, now that she wants full support for her child. and half the inheritance. in the end tho, the guy died with aneurism. sucks to be her. she is fighting with the legal wife now to get the money. her lawyer told her to lie that she was rape. you see that's the real world. yes, my friend did admit she was a gold digger for a cause. lol. 
and whats happening in hollywood, is no different from the people outside who isnt in hollywood. i even told her about this, my friend told me, definitely , amber is a gold digger.lol. 
she started going mental when Johnny wants to file a divorce. it was not her who want out. all her friends and i think her sister were freeloaders in johnny's house anyway. what more can you ask for? lol.",2021-06-07T06:09:40Z,0

She has used her own self-abuse against those she has abused... People need to stop saying she did bad stuff because of drugs, etc...she does it because she likes to hurt & abuse - she is a female Trump or female Harvey Weinstein - a narcissistic sociopath & JD was lucky she didn’t kill him & then play the ‘rich widow role’ she was moving towards...without JD’s support-team it would have been so much worse... Really hope JD heals & grows & one day finds a mature love that teaches him what real love is again... He has a great future career in music & in producing films with worthy stories to be told, & no doubt he’ll direct again too... acting is the least of his talents... AH has done so much damage to abuse victims & to women’s movement & JD has done so much good to bring forward to conversation that there is a reality than men are abuse victims too...

He sounds much too lucid to have that amount of alcohol (or drugs) in his system.  In court, Johnny said that he broke his sobriety that day, because of the way Amber had been hurting him.  He said that he went into the bar of the home, poured himself a glass of vodka, and quickly drank it.  When Amber came into the bar area and saw that Johnny was drinking again, Johnny said that she threw two full vodka bottles at him.  One regular sized bottle just missed hitting his head.  She then threw a second larger vodka bottle onto the counter where Johnny had his hand resting.  This second bottle forcefully shattered, and sliced off the top of his finger.",2021-07-24T23:15:37Z,0

186,Ugx_ft0ylStMsrS5ZVl4AaABAg,Lisa R,"When I was a little girl, I wanted braces like Cindy Brady on the Brady Bunch. I also had a huge crush on Bobby Brady (Mike Lookinland.) One day I was playing in the park, making sand castles with a little boy. My mom was talking to his mother. She called me over and said, “Do you know who that little boy is? That’s Bobby Brady from TV.” I started crying, then ran over behind a garbage can and threw up. I was so distraught she had to take me home. Celebrities frighten me. Don’t know why. I could only kiss my Shaun Cassidy poster under the covers with the lights off. I mistook George Clooney for a Pakistani cab driver scamming starlets in the Polo Lounge, and flipped him off when he hit on me. I told Sam Shepard to bite me when he scoffed at my livelihood (I do equine bodywork and a form of chiropractic). “Oh, you’re one of those,” he said. “Five two, 102 lbs, there’s no way you could adjust a horse...” There is no universe in which I’m 5’2”, and I was 11 the last time I weighed 102lbs. So.... I think the best way for us to proceed—if in fact you are the real Johnny Depp—would be for you to send me a barf bag with the contact info, cuz in addition to the aforementioned charms, I am also a Luddite and I don’t understand the instructions you gave me. Lisa Rowan, 225 The Crossroads Blvd #114, Carmel-by-the-Sea, CA 93923. If you want, we could even go cloak and dagger—send me a burner phone with the barf bag, then you can call me from “an undisclosed location.” Yes, I know I’m weird. But you could be anybody—and I had a stalker once.",2021-11-06T02:56:25Z,0

225,Ugz4ObTbZZrcfpzy_EV4AaABAg,NIBS,"@Melissa Trent , I work with victims of narcissistic abuse, and therefore deal with many narcissists.  What is most interesting is that when AH listens to the recordings, she doesn't hear what we hear.  That is why she released them.  She hears herself as the suffering wife whose unfair husband isn't willing to fight for her.  She expected everyone to hear the tapes the way *she* hears them.  What a terrible husband Mr. Depp was, because he left whenever *she* wanted to fight.  

Narcissists *only* see themselves as victim, or hero.  In these recordings, she was the ""victim"" of a ""bad"" husband who refused to give her what she needed, (which apparently was a stationary target), and the ""hero"" wife, fighting to make her marriage better!  She would have been confused when people heard her multiple confessions of violence, and her bullying and demeaning verbal abuse of Mr. Depp, because she simply doesn't hear the tapes in that way.  When survivors of narcissistic abuse hear the tapes, they immediately recognize the voice of their abuser speaking through AH.",2021-06-22T19:03:27Z,3
226,Ugz4ObTbZZrcfpzy_EV4AaABAg,NIBS,"Mr. Depp, at the request of his lawyers, had asked for a pre-nup several times before the wedding, and a post-nup twice after the wedding, all of which resulted in physical fights.  This was the last of them. He was very much in love with her, and wanted to make the marriage work... but when she injured him so severely, the marriage was doomed.  

Ironically, if she had demurely asked Mr. Depp to write a ""fair"" pre-nup, and had signed it... she would have walked away with at least thirty million, a house, a vehicle, (and if she had been smart enough to agree the marriage wasn't working, and had done a quiet, equitable divorce, she would still have a friend in Mr. Depp, who would continue to assist her in landing good roles)! Mr. Depp is notoriously generous... especially with the women in his life.  He only began to fight her when his lawyer received the Samantha Spector letter of AH's demands, to be met within three days, or AH would go public and accuse him of domestic violence.

How long was she actually recording? Who released this audio? Did she record the actual incident?

You would need a typical dose of 700-800mg a daily for it to have the required affinity and efficacy for dopamine or serotonin receptors and to therefore have antipsychotic effects. 
Also the reason why quetiapine is very often used off-label for acute distress is because of how fast acting it is and low potential for abuse. Far better to give that than valium.",2020-07-10T13:17:44Z,0

In her filing she made outlandish false statements about how he abused her. She made statements she would drop the case if he agreed to giving her $50,000 alimony a month, along with some specific real estate properties she mentioned, and cars. AKA she attempted to coerce him with the abuse allegations. Johnny tried getting her to stop but she wouldnt. She then requested $7 million for “charity” in her divorce. Johnny agreed he would donate the money. Amber said no because johnny could claim it on his taxes and get money back so she then requested he either donate 14 million to charity or give her 7 million so she could “donate it” to charity. Johnny gave her the 7 million under the agreement she would donate all of it to charity and sign a legal document stating she would never again speak of the false allegations she made against him. So she signed it whatever. As time went on, she talked on and on what a victim of domestic violence she was at the hands of johnny🙄😒she broke that legal contract. She lied for personal gain just like in her divorce for money. She became a “me too” advocate🤦‍♀️ johnnys name got tarnished. He got booted off pirates of the carabean because of it and got blackballed in hollywood. He filed a defamation case against her. HE petitioned for it, not her.

Plus, it happened right after Paige voices support for Johnny and promised not to be anyone's puppet in the DV case. If AH is as psychotic as we're all assuming then I wouldn't be surprised.

If one watches the analysis by Derek Can Schaik of her deposition where she takes out some snack to eat so as to try to delay answering a lawyer's questions and also analysis by British psychologist Zoe on the LiveAbuseFree channel, it's very clear that Amber Heard is a manipulative and abusive woman who abused Depp and continually had a go at him for trying to avoid her when she became abusive. It's rather sick to her her attack Depp for not wanting to engage with her when she gets violent. It's a situation in which he can't 'win' with Amber - if he leaves the room when she gets emotionally abusive let alone physically abusive, she paints him as a ""coward"" and claims it proves he doesn't care about her, and if he stayed I'm sure she'd continue the abuse and then try to claim he was the aggressor. AH is emotionally extremely unstable, and in the audio from this video above she is going from crying to rage rapidly. It would be a awful to have been initially employed by Depp to work for him and to have Amber enter his life and have to try to deal with her rages, her abuse towards Depp, her crying jags and  her attempts to get his employees to believe her lies and then tries to fire the when they won't take her side.",2020-08-10T03:36:42Z,5

Even after doing it, she tries to convince herself that it wasn't her fault the bottle she threw hit him. A normal person, would recognise their mistake, admit guilt and beg for forgiveness. 
Instead, she was saying it wasn't her fault cause she couldn't face what a horrible monster she is.

My ex wife was a narcissist, but it was obvious, because she also wasn't very intelligent. She would lie instantly, and swap and change stories at the drop of a hat. She would be guaging people's reactions, to see if her narrative was working. Then if it wasn't, she'd be simply changing what she said there and then, right infront of them. Whereas if she'd been smart, she would've carefully crafted a watertight narrative in the first place, or made subtle changes to her narratives over time. The problem was that she'd keep a constant supply of new people rolling in and out of her social circle. This meant that there would always be fresh people around, who weren't wise to her lies yet. She'd use the new intake to beat down the people who had realized she was a liar. So everyone around her was always fighting.",2020-07-20T03:03:33Z,0

So his assistant might just tried to calm her down by saying what she wants to hear.


'The kick was supposedly on a plane and Johnny even says in recent released tapes that he can't de-escalate on a plane',  he was saying he can't leave on the plane, not de-escalate, it's pretty different. And he did say what he did in the plane , that he pushed her back, not kick. very different again. 


'There's also his finance team who say the staff told them of this incident.', who are those 'staff' that told them tho? for the record, TMG (hIs fInAnCe TeAm) was fired by him and sued by him at that point. So yeah, they're so reliable, right? someone who got sued by him making a story that can paint him in a bad light are so reliable. They have never even said who are the staff that told them about it. Their claims about him being an abuser because 'staffs told us' got thrown out by the court. 


Anyway, what you said and believe he did, is self-defense. Are you really going to blame him and go 'oh, he's not innocent. he's guilty, too' just because he defended himself? what do you expect him to do? standing there still and let her did whatever she wanted to him?",2020-04-22T03:49:31Z,0

How she was ""oh so distraught"" during his injury, and then there's the drug use ""evidence"" she supplied trying to make him look bad (which she probably thought would also work). She was also probably trying to show how ""untrustworthy"" the people around her were as a ""poor me"" pity plea. Basically, in a nut shell, she's what I like to call a narcissist. And narcs can't see much of anything from an outside perspective, only their own. Especially when people try to paint them in a bad light. They can't stand it. Their own perspective is so grandiose to them that everyone else's becomes irrelevant in their mind and their opinion doesn't seem to matter.

And on top of that, Johnny seems to be a very empathetic type of person which has a bad way of winding up with a narcissistic type. They are literal opposites, polar opposites, and he probably thought with his empathetic nature that he could help or fix her.

I appreciate what you wrote in your comment about standing behind your transcription because of how much work you put into it and because you did it to the best of your ability. That’s fair enough. I do really think, however, for the sake of the integrity of this project, you should have another listen to that ‘admission’ in light of what other listeners have pointed out: that what Amber is saying is ‘on top of’ instead of ‘was poppin’. You can clearly hear a ’t’ where your ‘poppin’ needs a ‘p’. Amber is listing all the drugs she wants Jerry to believe Johnny took. I really hope you’ll rectify this in some way.

   At the core, what it is, is a severe lack of true self love/acceptance.  When you truly love and accept yourself, you tend to treat others well as well.  While she and people like her are very, very self focused, deep down they don't really love, even like, or accept themselves.  And if you don't do that with yourself, how are you going to treat others well and with real love? 

  She will (on a Soul level), either eventually learn through difficult consequence and suffering, or she will just keep getting worse and worse, more and more cut off from love, to eventually become a full psychopath.  And eventually many of these, end up committing true and final death--consciousness death.  A sort of unconscious, unwanted, consciousness entropy happens.

One can have the whole world, and still lose their Soul (not saying that Depp has lost his Soul, I think he's likely a decent person, just trying to make a point that stuff and ideal outer conditions don't = happiness automatically).",2020-04-21T08:00:07Z,14

804,UgxcWSoanSKhBC-cSEZ4AaABAg,lucid,"​@BitterAlmonds Also I'd like to add that there's a difference between someone having mental health problems and someone who is legally insane at the point of committing some kind of offense.  People with mental health issues in many cases are fully aware of what they are doing and that it is wrong or illegal, which is why the argument doesn't often stand up in court.  It's quite likely most people in the prison system have some form of mental health issue, be it mild or more profound.  It is not an excuse for offensive or hurtful behaviour and I absolutely do not condone anyone who uses it as a shield or get out of jail free card.  However there are states of mind that go so far beyond the ability to control oneself, understand or comprehend what is occurring in reality in very acute episodes of psychosis or some other rare conditions that should be permissable as an excuse.  Of course this isn't applicable to Amber, or in the vast majority of situations.  But I don't think that it should be excluded simply because people attempt to use it as another manipulation.",2020-04-21T13:53:56Z,1
805,UgxcWSoanSKhBC-cSEZ4AaABAg,lucid,@BitterAlmonds I'm not sure where you picked up on any implication in what I said that she should be given any lenience; I completely agree that she should bear the full weight of responsibility and that her mental health issues are not an excuse for her behaviour.  I am simply making an observation that she isn't well and requires supervision as she quite clearly has some kind of mental health/personality disorder.,2020-04-21T13:39:18Z,0
806,UgxcWSoanSKhBC-cSEZ4AaABAg,BitterAlmonds,"@lucid I'd agree with you except the way it's being constantly used in court and on the internet as a get out of jail free card. ""Oh I was in a dark place when I did 'x' terrible thing, please forgive me."" Only the people who usually spew that narrative do it again and again and again harming everyone around them in the process. Whether they're having fits of psychosis or not, they're still hurting people by their actions. 

For example in this video everyone is obviously very much aware that Amber could ""kick off"" at any time, and they talk about having someone to accompany her who's not only physically strong but also able to resist her mental manipulation. That isn't someone who should be given special treatment in court, that's someone who's a danger to everyone around her. Even if she was messed up at the time, she severed Johnny's finger and made him lose it so bad he painted it around the house, exposing himself to a serious infection that could have caused him to lose his whole arm or even have killed him.

But, we now know ScAmber's M.O. is to project her own behavior onto others. Also, framing Johnny for 'something' seemed to be her intention from the get go, all her secret recordings and illegal filming proves that. Still, I think she probably got rid of some of the alcohol in the bar just before everyone showed up, in a panic attempt to cover up her actions and to contrive a story to make JD look bad. Mental issues or not, she is a very calculated person. Like I said, I don't know how they would be able to tell whether or not it was poured down the sink, especially if there where smashed bottles of liquor about. I use to be a beverage manager, one broken bottle of wine would stink up the whole dept for hours.

I'm sure the whole area smelled like booze. It's also known that Amber is a heavy drinker, and she has a vindictive habit of twisting the truth around and accusing JD for everything she does herself. It wouldn't surprise me if she was the one that drank the bar. It's pretty obvious that none of what she said, or has said, happened like she claimed. If Johnny had drank all that liquor and took as many pills as she said, they would have had to pump his stomach immediately at the hospital. This is just more of ScAmber's b.s. lies to paint Johnny like the bad guy. Gaslighting his bodyguards to make them believe her.",2020-04-20T02:56:02Z,0

832,UgzQU6iB8buwhbckOTF4AaABAg,Missy,"victoria vezich Right, I let fell aside the fact he would be probably dead anyway after that amount of drugs she claimed he would have taken. Although I don't know how much of a tolerance you can build of ecstasy and coke. All the other things people think in this thread which could be arguments for her claims being (slightly) right are just ridiculous enough I just didn't mention that he would be dead, especially since they'd argue then that she maybe just got the amount wrong.

It's kind of their thing who believe Amber at slightest. I don't know how often in the past I read arguments like that he wasn't charged for her claims doesn't mean he would be innocent. But they don't say that even in a way like ""we don't know the truth"" but it's always ""when he can't prove his innocence he's guilty"", although, of course, there were far more of these in the beginning since he actually has proof now.

About that they said he would sleep it off I really guess they gave him something to calm down like they did with her. Would be standard. But at the end it doesn't matter at all if he got something from the Doctor or if he was just tired from the drama. What matters is that nothing in this situation, neither that he could just sleep nor what the people did and said, made any sense if he would have taken alcohol or these drugs.",2020-04-26T06:44:40Z,0
833,UgzQU6iB8buwhbckOTF4AaABAg,victoria vezich,"@Missy yea that's true I highly doubt anyone would've put Johnny's life at risk just to sweep him taking drugs under the rug. ""Sleeping off"" 10 ecstacy pills and a bottle of vodka isn't an option  he'd be dead or hospitalized in ICU from alcohol poisoning alone.(and if he took coke AS WELL like Amber's trying to insinuate. He'd be over killed.) So I originally thought it wasn't likely Johnny took drugs bc he wasn't treated for anything drug  related and nothing was found so he obviously didn't look like he had either. They most likely let him sleep bc they could do nothing else for him while they searched for his finger except give him pain relief.",2020-04-26T00:51:54Z,1
834,UgzQU6iB8buwhbckOTF4AaABAg,Missy,"Some of these arguments here are ridiculous. If Johnny would have taken something to mentally flee from Amber it wouldn't have been party drugs like ecstasy or coke. It would have been opioids or benzos or alcohol. That's what you take if you want mentally escape from a situation. You don't take drugs which let you think even more and keep you awake. Also, that they said he slept it off is not an argument for the theory he took ecstasy or coke but against it, because like I said both are drug which keep you awake. Maybe he took alcohol but I guess the Doc just gave him something to calm down. That they wanted to do the surgery as soon as possible speaks for the last because they wouldn't want do a surgery when he's still drunk if it's not about saving his life. Especially not if the finger can still be saved later, even if the chance of an infection then is higher. It's unlikely they would want to put his life in such risk for his finger tip. 

And right, they don't do always a full drug screening but well... if they've been told there's such a possibility, and I really doubt anyone of them would think keeping it a secret would be worth Johnny's life, they for sure do the screening.

I mean, come on. You don't need to work voluntarily in the field of mental health issues like me to know this stuff. That is common knowledge and logics.",2020-04-25T22:01:11Z,0

Its the believe all women bullshit which turns the consittuon and our innocent until prvem guilty sust of justice on its head. The idea that men are perpetrators and women are victims. This is straight out of the Duluth model for domestic violence that is now globally accepted. 
It's frminist dogma 101. 

It's why Amber knew she could abuse Johnny and nobody would believe him and that she could actually nail HIM for the abuse. The victim is literally punished as the perpetrator. It actually fucming happened. Its what this is all about and it happens to millions of men each year. The ONLY reason this is being  exposed is because Johnny is rich, famous and got lucky that she taped all of her shit.  99.99% of men aren't so lucky that get steamrolled by women like Amber and a justice system corrupted by women like Amber. . 

Even now, look at it. It's clear she horribly abused him including chopping off part of his finger and there is ZERO threat of jail time for her regarding the abuse. They are only talking about her going to jail for lying. Big ducking deal. 

And yes the INSANITY of our gynocentric legal and societal system where women assaulting men is just fine but a man can't even criticize a woman anymore was all brought about by bat shit crazy feminists who think just like Amber.  

There's a reason women know they can lie about rape or abuse and destroy a man's life. Because women like Amber have changed our laws. Look at all the guys getting their lives destroyed in colleges by false accusations. Even when proven innocent and the girl confesses to lying he still loses his scholarship and can't return to school.

You realise I used the word 'generally' before vulnerable?

Even those who are genuinely trying to manage their problems are at risk of hurting those around them because mental illness is horrible to deal with for the person and those who love them. Think of depression for example, plenty of people take their lives thinking that they are dragging down everyone around them by remaining alive, but then of course their actions have all sorts of horrific effects on the people who remain. I objected to the way you lumped people into either victim or perpetrator because that is not close to the truth. Mental illness need not be stigmatized, but it definitely should be respected as something that can lead to extremely serious consequences for the person and those around them, regardless of the good or bad intentions of the person affected.",2020-04-21T12:07:10Z,0

I have had a range of abusers in my life, one who gets away with wickedness and has played mental illness whilst it's clear this isn't the case to anybody who knows this excellent actor. I have another person who is clearly unwell and I'm in no way prepared to deal with them.

Mental illness is not an excuse for you to fuck up someone else's life, and the fact you guys are on _this_ video trying to defend your point that usually those suffering from mental health don't lash out at other people means you maybe ought to start thinking about the consequences of spouting that rubbish a bit harder.

It makes me think of how I felt when my best friend finally ditched her ex-fiance. He was a drug addict and he verbally abused her, manipulated her, and isolated her from everyone who cared for her. I was always arguing with him and standing up for her and he hated me for not abandoning her and being her voice of reason and her defense. I was overjoyed when he was finally gone that I celebrated his departure. Lol. I'm sure Johnny's team would've felt the same way.",2020-04-20T16:13:33Z,2

915,UgyBY7t5ov3CT9D8sWN4AaABAg,myfairytalelife3,"@May Khaing  They didn't really say that they wanted her out of his life. They said that they needed to be separated at that moment because of what happened that night. They didn't want things to escalate, especially because Amber was not in a good state of mind. That's why they wanted her to be accompanied by someone who was strong enough to be able to control her both mentally and physically if she had another manic episode. They definitely were fed up with her, mostly because they were struggling with her mood swings and she wasn't really complying with them, but they were also frustrated with Johnny because they had helped him many times before and he still wasn't doing anything about it. You can only help a person so much until you give up, especially when it seems like that person isn't really helping themselves.
The reason they were acting that way towards Amber was because she wasn't mentally stable, hence why they gave her medication to calm her down. They didn't want any more problems with her, and they did not want her to lash out once again.
I see where you're coming from though. They were frustrated with all the bullshit and lies, and they didn't want anything else to happen. By protecting her they were also protecting him. I know that sounds weird but if they had treated her differently there could have been more problems for Johnny.
The fact that Johnny didn't want her career or reputation ruined truly shows his character, and I'm glad the truth is being revealed.",2020-04-20T12:07:17Z,1

He still covered up for her and despite people telling him he should retaliate and all the people who tried to protect him ,  he didn't.  He didn't want to go that far or ruin her name. He tried to protect her despite being abused still and yet what did she do in return , she smeared his named and painted a picture of him as a monstrous abuser. She kept accusing him of made up things and more.

You were hitting a man  closed fist or not. It’s DV. I think she has been  catered too! She has been protected by Johnny because he loved her. But it was one sided unfortunately!!! He only knows deeply how disastrous this women was and still is. She thought she had him wrapped around her finger. But he is much smarter then that! He knew she couldn’t keep her mouth shut for long spewing her lies. I’m sure he had all this evidence all along. But  because he is a kind man and LOYAL he didn’t use it against her. Until she decided she was untouchable. He is a smart man and knew what she was capable of. I believe Johnny will get his justice. But rest assured I know and believe he knows his fans believed him from the start!  I never believed her always knew she was a narcissistic person.  She is crazy! If he had not  protected her she would be wearing orange right now. But soon Justice will prevail! One more thing! Why is the media not reporting what she did to him!

939,UgzyThwoWevIp9Wvi7t4AaABAg,BitterAlmonds,"@Johann Daart I agree with you, I think people fight too hard against the stereotypes very much to the detriment of themselves. I think the problem ultimately is we were always totally reliant upon being a social group to survive, and so even now the threat of being socially stigmatized is very great to so many people. It then prevents people from doing what they need to do to make themselves happy, so they instead try and change the social conditions of acceptance instead of just being able to hear an opinion of themselves from someone who doesn't like them and move on from it. I'm not sure as a species how we can move on from this problem, but I think that shutting down criticism on the internet is the wrong move to make. I think a more sensible solution would be to learn to accept there will always be people who disagree or even hate you and that isn't a reflection on yourself. So long as we still come down on the people that commit or incite someone to do physical harm, then that seems like the only sensible way to get around the problems inherent on the internet. Certainly many great men and women ignored a lot of criticism in order to continue doing things that they wanted to do, and I don't think we will or even should get to a point where everyone all agrees on something.",2020-04-21T12:25:54Z,2
940,UgzyThwoWevIp9Wvi7t4AaABAg,Johann Daart,"@BitterAlmonds I think there are two big reasons of this behavior: victim culture and push for getting attention. We can't escape the fact, that we are what we are, men fit some roles better than women and vice versa. We could say that the world changed and a woman can source her happiness from her successful career instead of relationships. I believe so to some extent. But after listening to interviews with many successful people that feel happy, they all say that they needed to let go of attachment to their success and source their happiness from simple things, like being in the moment with their friends and family. It relates to men too. Deep down we are still ""traditional"". Here comes the problem - some people, both men and women have a hard time filling those traditional roles. Some men are just not prosperous, they are not successful, not resourceful. Some women don't fit standards of beauty and are not desired by men. Is the answer to this hanging your femininity on the hook and wearing pants, becoming a butch? Is the answer for men to become more feminine? It's a dark road for both genders, to hate your femininity and masculinity.
Some people (activists) figured out that if they can't get attention by being themselves, it's possible to get attention by cultural vandalism, because vandalism rises alarm and gives them a spotlight.",2020-04-21T11:17:35Z,2

I agree it's just gone too far and now it's just all about women all the time when men are just as badly affected and usually financially longer term too because they have to pay maintenance even after the whole awful affair is ""over"". The problem is that I was actually so ingrained to think men were the enemy and life was just so much better for men, I don't even know how to start convincing my feminist friends of how I feel now. Some of them are so deep I heard one of them insulting her own brother during her maid of honour speech at the wedding because she wasn't sure if any man was good enough for her best friend to marry.

Bipolar can certainly overlap with the personality disorders. I agree though, the borderline/narcissistic/antisocial qualities are above and beyond just Bipolar.  The level of manipulation is pretty evident. The thing to remember about character/personality disorders is that they tend to hurt everyone around them and are seldom receptive to help or think they are the problem which primarily shows up in their relationships.  It’s pretty much impossible to be in a healthy relationship when someone is that wounded.

Dr. Kipper allowed a higher dose of Seroquel to 100-150 mg because she was speaking *incoherently and hysterically* every five minutes- so it would be safe to assume it's to stabilize her erratic behavior.
He said to the nurse he'd allow the higher dose above her regular (daily?) low dose of Seroquel to help calm her down in this escalated situation. So the link is unmistakable in my humble opinion.

Sadly the lengths Johnny and others went through in order to conceal the truth and protect the perpetrator aren’t rare.  I think, and this is just my opinion, some people will continue to find reasons to doubt Johnny Depp‘s accounts solely because they judged him harshly without examining facts and they need to validate their rush to judgment! So they’ll listen to the evidence searching for reasons to excuse Amber’s behavior, thus making their initial response justifiable.

But since I'm not on the jury, I can look at everything else I've seen and I'm 100% confident who's the problem here. I will concede that it's possible JD might have harmed himself as well, to some degree, perhaps as a result of drinking or self-medicating as a result of AH's abuse. But yeah, pretty sure at least 99% of the damage is coming from AH.",2020-04-20T02:14:46Z,3

1154,UgytKoQT7QKU-uAxFWp4AaABAg,phoenixash Delfuego,"@Pé âkY BlïñDÉrß no arguments from me but you've also got to remember all of this was available for the public to see yet it took years for people to take notice even after her case was thrown out of court.  I think sometimes when a person's outlandish lies go unchecked the lies become more extravagant and they start to believe anything they say will be believed. I can't totally rule out a complete break with reality but when you listen to everything she has said she seems to know what she has done.  When she was talking to Johnny Depp her main grip was that he never stayed for the fights. If she truly believed all the things she was saying I don't think her story would change depending on her audience but like I said I can't be totally sure especially because of the prescription drugs she was taking with her recreational drugs.
The lawyer thing baffled me too but from what I understand they did declare to the courts that they had certain pieces of evidence and then they tried to hold them back until they were compelled by the court to hand it over. Maybe that was a kind of blackmail tactic aimed at Johnny Depp which backfired when the case actually went ahead.  Remember suppressing evidence can be considered as false evidence so her lawyers would have had no choice or they could have been charged for that.  All that said if just one other person (that wasn't prepared to lie) knew of the existence of those tapes and that her lawyers knew of them then I don't think her lawyers would have been dumb enough to take that chance, especially for a client which they knew couldn't keep their stories straight even if they hadn't declared them before the case.",2020-04-20T19:37:16Z,2
1155,UgytKoQT7QKU-uAxFWp4AaABAg,Pé âkY BlïñDÉrß,@phoenixash Delfuego what i guess is she got help from a lot of people in framing johnny and making use of the victim card in gaining sympathy and fame.. on the same time she was so dumb to release these tapes which infact ruined her... Thats why i think she is insane and second thing confusing me is these tapes must have went through her lawyers too right.. are they also this stupid as scamber?,2020-04-20T15:03:10Z,4
1156,UgytKoQT7QKU-uAxFWp4AaABAg,phoenixash Delfuego,"@Pé âkY BlïñDÉrß it's possible but with Jerry saying he told her he wouldn't lie for her and him saying she knows what she is doing, plus the lies that came from her friends (those that obviously didn't share his standards) throughout the years and the spray on bruises it seems less like she believes her lies and more like a conscious deception.  The one thing that leaves me unsure is the drugs she was prescribed.  I will say this though, if you are right and she truly doesn't know the difference between fantasy and reality then allowing her to act is like giving her crack to get rid of a cocaine addiction............that said I lean more to what Jerry said ""she knows what she's doing"" and in that case I am glad somebody informed me he died of cancer because I would be suspicious of that too when dealing with a mind as warped as hers.",2020-04-20T14:38:00Z,2

They got divorced in 2016, these accusations didn't come out until 2018 with the MeToo movement, etc. This was just one of the many stories that came out at that time, no real evidence of them being true but... They were believed anyway, just like the case of the gay black singer/actor from the show Empire -I can't remember  his name so that's why I discribed him- he came out saying that he was beaten on a street at night or some place like that by two guys and placed a noose around his neck...
