1,UgwpWh3NZR8ERlKc2dR4AaABAg,"We don't know if that's actually Elon's kid. Her timing is a total smokescreen. I don't think that she even has fertility issues or produced any DNA for that baby. No offense intended to anyone who genuinely has fertility issues, but I think it's just another boy to play her as a victim of something else. Or she did because she didn't want to put the stress on her body with a pregnancy. I believe she's either bought that baby through adoption using the money she never paid to the charity she promised it to, or she's just borrowing for photo ops. In fact, it may very well even be her sister's kid. And IF Elon Musk was stupid enough to fertilize embryos with her, then she certainly going after child support because she needs the money. It sucks because you can't believe anything she says. Regardless, I feel sorry for that baby. She ended up with the worst POS excuse for a woman as a mother on the face of this planet. I wonder if this sad excuse for a woman's sister is going to be raising that baby girl while Ambuser goes to prison for perjury and manufacturing evidence.",melanie ryan,0,2021-07-26T01:28:17Z
