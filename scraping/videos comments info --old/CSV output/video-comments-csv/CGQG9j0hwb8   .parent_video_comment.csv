same right to vote, same right to receive equal amount pay for the work- the right to walk the street without being harassed, definitely a right to say no. But along with those equality we, women should also should take the responsibility to be responsible to the faults we done.

211,UgwT4GtM1qcCGjKybd54AaABAg,"Aquaman II should get rid of Amber Heard as Mera by having the Black Manta and Ocean Master (Orm Marius) team-up to try to either conquer Atlantis and enslave all Atlanteans, or, if they can't, try to destroy Atlantis and exterminate all Atlanteans. In the process, they summon the ancient, evil, magical Atlantean spirit called Atlan, and he uses his magical powers from the ancient Atlantean books of black and white magical spells called the Atlantean Chronicles which reveal all of Atlantis' secrets to attack and invade Atlantis. 

Queen Mera is murdered and eaten (bye bitch! üñïüò†) by the extradimensional, alien, mystical King Shark who was summoned by Atlan. In order to avenge her brutal death, Aquaman assembles a team of Atlantean super-heroes in Poseidonis, the cousin city of Atlantis that is the Royal Kingdom of the Merpeople. These champion warriors are Aquaman (Arthur Curry/Orin), Aqualad (Garth), Aquagirl (Tula) played by Blake Lively, Dolphin played by Emilia Clarke, Neptune Perkins, and the mermaid Princess Lori Lemaris, heir to the throne of Poseidonis. 

With guidance by Queen Atlanna of Atlantis and with Poseidon's enchanted trident empowered by Poseidon, the ancient Olympian god of the oceans himself, they must battle the army of sea monsters channelled by Atlan, as well as the menaces of Ocean Master and the Black Manta, to locate the spirits of the ancient wizard Arion, the first Lord of Sorcery from Pre-Cataclysmic Atlantis, and his wife, Lady Chian, the first Atlantean Queen of Swords. 

They are the only ones who have enough power to defeat the magic of the Atlantis Chronicles. But they must also beware the presence of Garn Danuth, Arion's insane Atlantean demon sorcerer brother who seeks to control Atlantis again, too.

218,UgyYXa-DDcnXY7NmbJl4AaABAg,"Well, it's speculation for now, but if heard is out, I'll probably end up seeing this movie. As for the casting and story options, I think Mera needs to be in the sequel because otherwise, it would be weird and lazy to just have her disappear offscreen for whatever reason. She was an integral part of the first movie (from what I know, still haven't seen it) and a big part of the Aquaman lore. Who they could cast to replace heard, I don't know. But, there's no reason they can't also introduce Garth or Dolphin even with the inclusion of Mera. There is so much source material to draw from that finding a good plot won't be hard for the writers. And, in that source material, Mera dies and comes back, is stuck in a hellish dimension, and has a twin sister, so they can explain a recasting of her in so many different ways while staying true to the source",doctordetroit84,9,2020-02-22T00:47:58Z
