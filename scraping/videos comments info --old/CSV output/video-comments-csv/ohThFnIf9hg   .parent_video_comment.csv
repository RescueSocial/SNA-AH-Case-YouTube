94,UgxOtvUafyPi-rbqCjR4AaABAg,"I understand that you don't want Amber H. ""punished"" by losing her movie deal.  At least not until convicted of a crime. However, I disagree because I don't see it as a punishment.

Men in Hollywood are dropped all the time, even in the middle of production, for simply being accused. By not expecting the same treatment for women you are inadvertently reinforcing a double standard.  I understand that you're trying to be the bigger person and you're defending your principles.  It's admirable. But movie castings have nothing to do with her rights, or the legal system.

Johnny Depp was dropped like a brick.  She should receive the same treatment.  Not for revenge, but because that's how she would be treated as a man.  There is, at the very least, enough public evidence that we can call her an abuser.  For Johnny Depp's and other male victims sake, we have every right to demand her removal.",Tory Evans,86,2020-09-08T18:19:14Z
