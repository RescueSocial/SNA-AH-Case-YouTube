For instance just the other day i was watching ""This Americzn Life"" a podcast that had 3 seasons of a tv version, and there was a story about a young man that was paralysed and th only way he could comunicate was to tap an extention on  a computer with the tip of his finger, the interviewer asked him if he could have any voice to tell his story (besides that creepy computer generated voice ) who would he chose? He replied Edward Norton or Johnny Depp, well guess who stepped up to the plate? And this was 2006 when his svhedual would hzve been crazy with POTC, there are dozens if not hundreds of these examples. When he films a hard day of 15-16 hrs he will spend 4 hours not just signing autographs but actually connecting with people.
