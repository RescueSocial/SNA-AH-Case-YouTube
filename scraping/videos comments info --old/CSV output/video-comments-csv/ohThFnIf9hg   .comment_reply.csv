It's the gynocentric culture that you have to worry about where people will still flock to the film despite the evidence against her and not care at all or worse yet the large majority of people that don't even follow entertainment news which will be the biggest portion of the movie going general audience. They might not even know this is going on because it's no where to be seen on mainstream media outlets like Entertainment Tonight or anything.

Well, i still doubt she is in Aquaman 2. She didnt give any evidence. Johnny has an email with confirmation he is in FB3 but she doesnt. It is just her word. I will believe when I see her email.
+ Of course, she can be in A2, we cant do anything about it, bt we¬¥ve already won bc almost 500 000 wont see the movie. It is a lot of money people will save and WB will lost. 
The petition says that 500 000 people wont see it. We can not order WB to fire her bt we can say that so many people wont see the movie if she stays. That is why petitions mean a lot. We expressed our opinion about her and A2 (if she stays),  actually 500 000 poeple did. That is already a huge win. :D :D 
Bt I understand your point that petitions (in general) are not always considered. It is sad and bad bt we can always boycott. This way we win despite the petition :D :D",2020-09-08T20:33:30Z,1
