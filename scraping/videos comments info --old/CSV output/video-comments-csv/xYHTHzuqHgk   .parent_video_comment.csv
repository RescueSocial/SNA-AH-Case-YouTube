17,UgzBRtaP8HvGcO_7wWx4AaABAg,"That tweet is just another motivation for people to diversify their group of friends. When you just hang out with your publicist and your super rich white friends, you just have no clue. There's nothing wrong with doing housekeeping jobs. My mom did housekeeping when we were immigrants because nobody wanted to hire her as a tailor, her actual profession. It was a thankless job but that's how she kept us fed and clothed. There's nothing wrong with those jobs, but the fact that this white clueless rich woman's mind immediately goes there, shows how clueless and she is, and how much in the bubble she is. Moreover, there's a big problem with this, as there are many rich people who employ undocumented staff so that they can pay them less and not pay taxes, and these people don't get punished for it, the undocumented desperate people are the ones who get punished. Her tweet is clueless in many levels. But what do you expect from this narcissist. Time to go listen to Immigrants get the job done again. This riled me up",Jonida San√ßo,2,2018-07-07T07:38:58Z

Well, isn‚Äôt that quite bigoted in itself (not to mention- false statement!). Many white, black, brown Americans do those jobs and desire those jobs! How many folks are homeless in that county??

37,UgyP3MAuW215hjc9NCh4AaABAg,"I get that as an immigrant it may be harder to get a job in an office, and that it would be even harder if you don‚Äôt have papers. I can see that it may be more likely that such people would have the kind of jobs she mentions, but it just makes it feel like that‚Äôs all she thinks they can do. It also isn‚Äôt the best argument to suggest that undocumented people are an asset just bc they take care of the stuff we don‚Äôt want to do for really cheap. 

On top of that, there was no reason to even specify jobs. She could‚Äôve just let people know about the ice stop, but she chose to actually say specific jobs, which makes it seem like maybe part of her was trying to make a joke. But that stuff isn‚Äôt very funny anymore bc it‚Äôs overdone.

  Sure it may have a whiff of a stereotype feel if you just look at the words but it was meant well.
