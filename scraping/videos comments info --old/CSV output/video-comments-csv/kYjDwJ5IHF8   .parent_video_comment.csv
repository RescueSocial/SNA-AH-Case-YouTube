She used this feminine and old Hollywood beauty persona to seduce Johnny, and it worked. Johnny was always into old Hollywood actresses and their beauty/elegance, which explains her change of voice, manners and hair. Before she met Johnny she was all tomboy ish, no one can change their whole persona just like that. I hope things will get better for him, and I‚Äôm glad he managed to escape from this sociopath",Lilfalfs,61,2020-08-30T22:38:51Z
