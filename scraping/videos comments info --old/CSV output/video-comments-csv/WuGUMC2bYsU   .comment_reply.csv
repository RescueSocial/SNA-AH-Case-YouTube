2,Ugx1ldfS9F_GvAf9bbV4AaABAg,James Roa,"I want to agree with you, but mk 2021 is frustrating, it gets some things very very spot on, but then drops the ball completely, and because of that it makes it inferior to 95, hear me out.

Mk 2021 has lore and violence, but the arcana is too messed up, it tries to explain alot and in the end just becomes a plot device to explain powers but it fails in making sense.
The music was downright SHIT, please don't even defend it here. 20mins later I couldn't remember anything I had heard, it was such a let down. One thing 95 had was an amazing soundtrack, and memorable beat music, try if you can, compare a soundtrack from 2021 that's better than luikang Vs reptile music, the answer you can't, the tempo and speed is perfect for that film.

The lead character of 2021, lol Jesus man he was pathetic, his special power is to be beaten up, lololol, it was crap, Cole has no real motivation, no real motivation going into it. 95 establishes luikangs brother death in 2mins in, his revenge is the main catalyst runs with the film.

I could go all day, and yes 95 is such a 90s product and weakened by age in nearly all areas, but, overall it all works, it all lines up, it's verisimilitude works within its own world.

Mortal Kombat 2021 was a let down, could a sequel save it? Don't know man, Johnny cage is a huge draw, get that right and you have a heck of a lead character. Again very disappointed, 95 is just insane fun and you can accept it's fault.",2021-05-01T06:03:03Z,1

The film isn't made or broken over her.
If you got 2 million people boycotting that's like a potential loss of 40 million",2021-04-30T12:36:27Z,3
7,UgzeYwXK-R70gkMAWQV4AaABAg,Gabreya Bradley,"@IM BATMAN I’m sorry that the film dissatisfied you and I understand. There were some things that they could’ve done better. And to me, it kind of left me wanting a bit more in terms of the story. But at the same time, I do like the story set up, the actors all did a fantastic job portraying their characters, and the tension was surprisingly pretty good.",2021-04-30T16:10:55Z,0
