I'm trying really hard to be a fan man, but even though your videos do come off as being on the JFJ side, spreading more misinformation is only helping her! When people hear different accounts of the way things went down they naturally check out! The actual facts are a matter of public record! And the real story is a better crazier story than any press is giving it! You can report the facts and still have an amazing story on this one!",Nichole Shackelton,0,2021-07-28T14:40:48Z
1,UgxoXXlpcFMrUpShzbJ4AaABAg,"""Choosing to have a baby on her own terms""???? Um there is no problems with her being ""Able"" to carry or get pregnant! Her ""Own terms"" is the definition of:(I ain't gonna carry no alien in my body..9 months..getting fat and stretch marks? H to the No!""

2,UgxRsPAqwLyTtBTDv5p4AaABAg,"Check out how to pronounce foreign names on Google or YouTube. Oonagh, or Una, is pronounced Ooo-na, meaning the first. Not Ooo-nog. She has chosen the Irish spelling as Irish names are fashionable. Just think of the 'gh' in laugh and you'll be there! Ooo-nog sounds like a Christmas drink.",M P,0,2021-07-25T12:17:42Z

12,UgwV71blmvZ0UwVKUt14AaABAg,She wont be fired from Aquaman but i can guarantee she wont be in Aquaman 3 that or there just wont be an aquaman 3 over this stuff. Good. I would be worried about how that child is taken care of aswell,Dee xGretchx,10,2021-07-21T16:10:00Z

14,Ugz9KqlxUWv-UqxsyOp4AaABAg,I don't believe that she couldn't carry baby herself. I bet it was so she could keep her figure for aquaman and it would if been perfect timing if the va case wasn't adjourned till next year which by then we will see what kind of mother she really is. And she couldn't keep her charity pledges but was able to pay for a surrogate. Hmmmmmm so all the court fees and lawyers aren't going to affect the baby. I bet she's not too happy that people aren't just eating up her bs anymore and JD stood up for himself which she didn't want,Freeda Aghakhaineyan,0,2021-07-21T15:48:49Z

18,UgwwGG-2v9eZidG5L_h4AaABAg,"The fact that she thinks by her having a child now. Will spare her in court is laughable. I hate that she brought this innocent child into the mix. 
As for her ‚ÄúSupport for infertility‚Äù I‚Äôm sure if women had her money they could of afforded a surrogate‚Ä¶ üòí it‚Äôs easy to just ‚Äú PAY ‚Äú for that when you‚Äôre keeping JD‚Äôs money üôÑ",Alex Lopez,13,2021-07-21T15:22:17Z
