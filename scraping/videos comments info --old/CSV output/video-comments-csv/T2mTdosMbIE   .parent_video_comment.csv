3,UgxOyuY_kLkXAZ6PwWJ4AaABAg,"1. She didn't win in the UK
2. With bullshit articles like this only hurts her argument of lost work
3. It's not over yet, she still has criminal investigations open - let's see how that pans out when Aquaman needs location work in Australia
4. All of her recent movies have bombed ... I wouldn't be bragging about that 
5. She was asked to step down from AM, but narcissist she is, she refused. Contract clauses prevented WB from forcing it. JD took the gracious approach
6. The birth of the baby was deliberately timed for the original 2021 Virginia trial date. 

So.... Yeah not doing anyone any favours here",LittleMiss Sunshine,0,2021-07-13T07:09:16Z

6,UgwOsCQIWgwlN1XzZZJ4AaABAg,"I must say, I'm disappointed with the Virginia judge. She said that if AH's team don't stop being ridiculous there will be sanctions, but she doxed all his confidential finance information and no sanctions anywhere. It seems the more cooperative JD's team are the more outrageous AH's team are, yet nothing's done. This looks like JD's side is weaker and she's forcing the upper hand.

And how selfish of Amber Heard to make her sister and girlfriend travel with her a sister who was a new mom and her girlfriend who is fighting breast cancer... I don't care what you have going on in your life says Amber I need you by my side to make me look good...

She was only a whiteness üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ plus everyone knows the UK judge was bias asf. She‚Äôs so cocky that I pray the courts in VA break her down. She‚Äôs so arrogant and the fact she loves to troll people online proves she‚Äôs desperate for attention. Also we all know she‚Äôs planning to use her sweet baby as emotional blackmail. Shea pathetic. Also hate to break it to her but ONE mayor role in your entire life isn‚Äôt a career. She acts like she‚Äôs in the same league as Johnny Depp, Anne Hathaway or Meryl Streep.

33,UgyJ7hUcXpH80UfmJmx4AaABAg,"Great video Les. You're quite right  that she did beat him but not in the way that headline implies. If you think you're so untouchable why try to have the case dismissed on multiple occasions? If you're so confident you will win why constantly fail to provide the ""voluminous evidence""? If it's not about the money then why have you counter claimed for $100 million? Then to bring a baby into your ""3 wheeled, broken down, truck"" of a life. That's something else. 
You have no case. You will have no meaningful career. You will always be a liability to anyone who gets into a relationship with you. That said, I truly hope that the baby has a safe and happy life.",Raquelle Phillips,10,2021-07-06T21:11:04Z
