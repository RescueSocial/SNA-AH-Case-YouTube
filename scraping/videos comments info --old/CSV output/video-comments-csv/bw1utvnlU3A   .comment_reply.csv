1,UgwbiL31v6oguOITp6p4AaABAg,Rob's Rules,I really wish they would not back this horse. She is the one that has done the damage yet they fired Johnny Depp and kept Amber ? Unbelievable...,2021-03-03T19:07:16Z,1
2,Ugzse9KYE34SmHAZxSx4AaABAg,MAJOT,@Rob's Rules Yeah I understand. Being body shamed honestly hurts way more than some people think. I also wish for Heard to be fired but surely they can pick anothet reason to fire her. There's an endless list of reasons why she should be fired ðŸ˜‚,2021-03-03T19:58:10Z,2
3,Ugzse9KYE34SmHAZxSx4AaABAg,Rob's Rules,"No matter what, I wish they would get rid of her. The problem is she is under contract. She could also lose that weight, had that rumor been true since they are not shooting for 2 more months. I never believed the rumor once I read the reason. It did not make any sense to me.",2021-03-03T19:22:20Z,2

7,Ugwn1cWgxfVS93KmZA14AaABAg,shinkicker 123,If it is . they should have the backbone to say that.  Not let body shaming rumours to take hold. As there's a danger that Amber Heard could get the sympathy vote with the public who haven't looked into her behaviour as much as we have.,2021-03-03T19:18:26Z,2
8,UgzfN8FitfgUQZ4YJrN4AaABAg,Steve Kass,"The fact is until WB makes it official she is not fired. 

As far as weight gain is nonsense as she can work out to get her weight back. 

A lot of these rumors are BS as it helps sell raggs. 

Personal I donâ€™t think WB has made any decisions on Amber as shooting is still a year off.",2021-03-03T17:12:05Z,1
