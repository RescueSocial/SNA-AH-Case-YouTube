7,Ugy2vv1gQzCmsNOj94F4AaABAg,IM NOT WATCHING AQUAMAN 2 IF AMBER IS IN THE MOVIE ...Plus I didn't think she's a good actor in this movie at all. They can do better with another female actor who actually can act...   And Nooo she doesn't deserve a raise she wasn't very good actor in 5he movie.

12,UgwmPOM2JsrzvkAoo994AaABAg,No raise for AH. Wont pay to see an abuser. Sorry Jason looks like you are stuck with her. She needs to tell the truth of her abuse to JD. It‚Äôs only her words while JD has evidence. Be glad when this is over.,Coleen Ortner,0,2021-02-05T10:32:00Z

16,UgyqCXDULx93UuVh7MN4AaABAg,It‚Äôs amazing how Hollywood uses cancel culture unless it lines their pockets! She has a dab history and was connected to the judge that squired her!

But now she's getting the same amount of money from Jonny and the money she stole from ALCU and The children's Hospital.Shell make best friends with Mansons ex and try to drive Jonny insane, in the media to try and get him to drop the cases.....He needs to come out and make a couple of wisely chosen statements and crush her reasoning like he always does!!
