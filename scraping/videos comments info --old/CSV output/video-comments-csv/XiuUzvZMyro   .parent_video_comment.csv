That instinct takes over and attempts to protect us against violence our minds cannot comprehend because it comes from someone who says they love us.

I think they both intended initially that the tapes would remain private and she chose to use them in court. But this doesn’t help her. I think she honestly sees nothing wrong with her behavior.

Especially if they are clocking a man who they KNOW wont hit back. That's diabolical to then claim because she weighs less, he is a 'pussy' for complaining about said punches. Or cutting his finger off while smashing him with bottles. Its insanity. Also, within this conversation,  Jonny is explaining how to approach him, with a calm demeanor in order to express her issues. And she responds by saying he is 'taking her humanity away' because she has every right to scream and flip out. Lol. Total nut job. When u love someone. U can present the issue at hand in a calm and respectful way and aim for a resolution. When u want a fight, u want to win, making the other person a loser. That isnt a relationship. That's a dictator. She even admits she cant promise to not be physical. What the hell ? Jonny is a true man for ' splitting' as she says. He wants to avoid the madness.

194,UgxjUP9Owy_A-4Ci6oR4AaABAg,"What I see here is two totally incompatible people: first, Depp who seems to have some behavioural problems at times, impulsive and avoidant reactions under substances, who might find it difficult to keep a relationship stable, but who can think sensibly when sober and trying to provide healthy solutions. This man's reactions trigger a woman who surely is legitimately hurt at times too, but whose temper is all over the place and tends to twist any argument on her favour and manipulate the conversation out of her pure insecurity and need to be right, avoiding self-criticism, playing only the victim role, which obviously triggers him too. Both bring the worst from each other. I don't know them, but by the way Depp carries himself during the argument, it seems he doesn't actually mean any bad to her purposefully. However she gets overridden by her emotions which can easily turn into hate and believe only her own narrative of the situation. 

Yes it looks like they both engaged in physical aggression towards each other, but I don't think Depp deserves the bad reputation he's got. It doesn't look like this has anything to do with a man supposedly abusing a woman for his superiority, so her allegations are twisted. It's about people with dysfunctional behaviours, where one side is so explosive things get physical.",Yo S.,0,2021-04-20T11:49:39Z

With Johnny walking away, I feel like he was terrified of what she was going to do if he stayed longer. 

Amber is just extremely manipulative and physically and emotionally abusive. It's honestly sad that this audio came out and Johnny still lost the court case. This just shows the problem with gender and power. People always believe the female. And no one believes the male when he comes out with domestic violence. There is also evidence in a video. In the video of Johnny explaining his finger injury that Amber inflicted. In another video, a women asked about his finger, I think the cut/stitches/whatever were not healed, and she saw and asked Johnny what it was and he laughed it off as a joke.

Confusion is their favourite tactic, event recall to provide ‘evidence’ of their claims, except these recalls are not presented factually but rather as the narcs perception, or by the reality they are wanting you to believe.

They're actually kind of similar disorders in the way of they both exhibit up and down extremes of emotion but the key difference is with bipolar the manic wild or anger episodes tend to last for two or more days sometimes and then it goes back to a period of days being very low with depression and low serotonin levels. And with borderline personality one of the key markers is the extremes of emotion but they happen very quickly with borderline...  these are the people that will go into a rage over almost anything that sometimes doesn't even make sense and two seconds later they're calm being apologetic  a few hours later maybe crying or over dramatizing something. Borderline personality tends to be a lot more unpredictable even to the person experiencing it. It's also common in people with borderline personality to have experience some type of abuse during childhood usually the abuse being more mental as far as having a narcissistic parent or neglectful parent. Not trying to diagnose her I'm just saying that I see a lot of similarities in issues that I had and I was diagnosed with it and with people that I know that are medically diagnosed with borderline. But again it's just an opinion and a subjective observation. I wonder what a psych evaluation would uncover. There's definitely a lot going on here with her seeming to be the aggressor but we have to remember that she could be suffering too and that doesn't give her an excuse to treat someone bad but maybe it's good they're separating and hopefully she gets some help and he does too.,FrealFreal,2,2021-03-27T22:49:23Z
269,Ugy7q7GjLrB0W-XjoUx4AaABAg,"She is psychologically abusing him and then making him the reason she behaves that way without him even being the reason for the behavior. When the poliçe are called about an argument the first thing they tell you is to separate. They tell you to go to a friend's house or go to separate rooms. She is trying to make him admit to being the problem when she is clearly the problem. Depp you are in love with a person, who you know for a fact, that she lied to you and you are still there. Your codependency is just as bad and is going to leave you ruined, all your hard work will be for naught if you don't leave this shell of a person A.S.A.P.  She clearly is not worth the time nor the energy that it would take to change her. I also think her wanting you to stay after a fight is to make Depp hit her, the fights are to get a rise out of him and that is what she is missing, it is what She seeks! With her lying that he hit her and then admitting that she actually is the one that did the hitting is her trying to totally ruin, bankrupt Depp and come out on top as the abused wife. If she wants to beat someone and to be beat by some one, she needs to get her a dominatrix and not a husband. I am truly sorry for people who go thru this and don't know Love never ends at this address but destruction and death does. Johnny needs to run away from this and she needs to be arrested for lying to authorities if that is the case!!! I would love to hear from any ex's.",Tanya Truth,1,2021-03-27T22:25:51Z

364,Ugw4wcSsE0buODURqsx4AaABAg,"wow. This is hilarious. She staged this and it totally backfires on her. You can hear her escalate, then go into her scripted monologue. She honestly sounds like a freaking nightmare. Incredibly needy and controlling. When you take into account that Depp said he left because she was yelling at him and because he hit her, and she confirms this, it sounds like she is saying it is better to stay and be abused because it makes you stronger. Wow. Yeah, what kind of house did she grow up in? Honey, that is not healthy. 
Depp nails her on everything. He is super calm (intoxicated or not), responds to her points and asks valid, logical questions, and then she refuses to answer and says that she doesn't want to go over the old stuff (after she had talked about all the old stuff). She got one thing right though, she called herself a 'harping bully'.
This really feels like an invasion of people's privacy though. I stopped listening to it because I don't think it's right to publish this. Depp did not know he was being recorded or give consent. Just because the two were in a lawsuit does not mean we have a right to publish this on youtube and give the whole world unlimited access to it.",tammy d.,1,2021-03-07T07:19:13Z

She says at one point ""... don't act like you don't hit back.."" he replies, ""I pushed you."" to which she goes silent, indicating he may never at any point hit her and she has no response to him calling out her bullshit.
At some point, a third party is mentioned. It seems a mediator was called after an altercation during which she hit him in the face, he fled, called a friend and when asked to explain what happened she lied about everything that happened and denies ever hitting him. She then tries to lie about that too but finally admits it herself.

I love them both -- in a graceful manner. Hopefully, you all will understand their situation one day. This is somewhat manipulative in the spiritual realm, but it is also a situation where both can be justified. 

The important thing is that you don´t curse each other but constantly asking each other for forgiveness. Just don´t curse in your arguments. You will surely heal after a divorce or a reconciliation. She wants to cry, and Johnny Depp needs to despise the media and Hollywood in order to fight her like a real man. The media is truly the disgusting thing here! 

The woman needs the man to fight her so she can yield completely! Not in an abusive way, but their enemies are really the idea of liberalism.

I know how it feels when you are angry and the person you expect to understand your anger just walks away to avoid your anger. We are angry because we want the people we love to know that we need their support to pull us out of that feeling. And when the people you are calling for help just listen and then walk away and leave you to die inside, we feel helpless, angry, hurt, annoyed, frustrated, disgusted. Yes, all these feelings come at once. And that feeling cannot be expressed by words no Matter how much you try. She is trying her best to make him understand and he is not trying to understand it.

However, whenever we are in such a situation, we should just learn to drink the anger and move away from the person. I don't know why she accused him of physical abuse which seems to be far from true.

Metal Ill is one thing I can sympathize with if they need help but I fully believe this way premeditated by AH to try to convince herself that she is not the perpetrator. I think when we as human do unspeakable things it’s almost impossible to admit to ourselves that we messed up as bad as we do. I hear a lot of this in amber, she is so wrong to hurt her husband in this way, even though they are getting divorced Johnny has always treated her like a human being, caring about her emotions and even her public image. For her to not even treat him like a human anymore is so sick and twisted. She confused herself and we can all hear the gears turning in her head through these audio clips to try to gain control of the situation. Johnny is so level headed, rational, and patient with this woman that none of her negotiation tactics are working. Thank god johnny got out while he could. She has no empathy for him and would’ve ended his career and probably life if the abuse had continued.

This was so revealing.  She's really frustrated.  He's not being present in the relationship from her perspective. She says it - I feel anxiety, anger and frustration when he walks away. She's verbal and he's not. When he ignores her feelings, she feels abandoned.  I wonder what his ex-wife feels about him for 25yrs. Perhaps she didn't need him as much from him as Amber does. She's really into him, passionately, she needs his energy. He's so laid back. We have to know how our partners were raised.

Self defence is one thing, but hitting someone because they said something that upset you isn't self defence. I don't actually know what the court case was but she's admitting hitting him repeatedly. He also admits violence and he's obviously no angel but seriously, if you're admitting to repeatedly hitting someone out of anger then what was the case against him? I don't know the date of this, or if more violence happened after this was recorded. You can still have a case against someone if they caused serious injury even if you both had a history of being violent towards each other.

This video is essentially a master class in a few of the more difficult to articulate tactics used by narcissists in their table turning crazy making verbal crusades. One being the art of accusing the other party of committing an offense by way of doing something that  1) they have not done, and 2) in reality,  the accuser has actually just done in realtime by the very act of making the accusation in the first place. Another tactic is manipulating the conversational response of the victim, as well as the victim's internal impression of the abuser's intention and state of mind in the moment by way of changing their tone of voice and inflection pattern.",Eric Worley,0,2021-02-10T03:18:21Z

She has demeaned him so much and attacked him so much that he just sounds so broken! She is truly a manipulator and she is dangerous! She targeted him! She “fought” for that wedding! She damaged his family, his children, him by doing what she did! She can’t promise she won’t get physical again? Then leave him alone!

He seems to love her and try to understand something that has no logic... plus he seems confused or numb at times and also somehow addicted to the abuse or confrontation (or just to her). It’s also very typical of abusers to try to hide it from others, irs very revealing how she triggers when he suggests to invite someone over to offer another point of view.

She says she doesn't want to fight but she is the one going on and on. I saw a video of her baiting Johnny. I've known plenty of manipulative people and she is one. Man -- sad Johnny fell for her. ..... Further more I was married to a man for years - a really good guy - but we didn't always agree and he would not argue or have anything to do with voices raised because his parents verbally fought like cats and dogs and he could not deal with that. Amber wants Johnny to fight with her - with - not ""for"" her - she wants it. And he is not geared that way - for whatever reason. We all have things in our past that affect us. Amber probably does too but it doesn't change the way it looks - that she is the one that keeps things stirred up - and for some reason she thinks it's okay to abuse him. I call BPD... maybe.

If you compare the Cruise / Holmes or Brangelina break-ups (or maybe even friends you know) where the female just wanted to break away, there was no violence nor abuse ..She just wanted out and the Male stepped aside and licked his emotional wounds. Heard's thousand-agitated-words-a-minute here is _clear_ evidence of a needy controlling hair-trigger Narcissist who won't let go. Ya'll have seen the memes of funny Animals being annoyed by another, with a 'This is what I have to endure' expression. That's what's going on here. Depp had already mentally walked away (prolly after multiple red flags) and his legs were trying to follow. Heard has gone full 'Fatal Attraction' here because her heart is screaming at her what her eyes and ears are ignoring. 
She's the typical (male or female) incomplete unhappy 'half' human who searches out, woos and then demands and _insists_ with psychological finger-pokes at their -partner- victim, 'Make. Me. *Happy* Goddammit'  
A complete happy-in-their-skin life-loving successful person like JD should _never_ have tolerated a specimen like Heard.
Nor should anyone, male nor female. Life is too short and precious to endure a fun-sucking energy-sapping barnacle that erodes at your mental happiness and tries to change you, like a shower of hailstones walloping into your face from the moment you open your eyes.
Been there. You never get those lost years back.

946,Ugy_GJ3Zx6JXlN_vWDt4AaABAg,"I've been in a relationship with someone this toxic..

I will never forget when my ex (year long relationship) accused me of cheating when I'd didn't. At 24 years old I was working every day and night to pay the bills and was getting 3 hours of sleep every night from working 3 jobs. She was going to school and living off of my income. I got tired of it and I said ""if you're going to falsely accuse me of always cheating than I might as well do it anyways"".

She pulled a knife on me in my own kitchen and told me I wouldn't live to tell the story. She even asked me ""even if I was to stab you in 'self defense' who do you think the cops would believe you as a man or me?"". She even started fake crying with a knife pointed at my stomach while I was doing dishes and started talking to me as if she was speaking to cops afterwards.. saying things  in a sobbing voice like ""he was coming at me and I didn't know what to do"".

I then planned my escape that weekend afterwards, and moved out.. bought a gun (carry it on me 24/7) and have never looked back. But all I remember thinking all the time is there's women out there who are this crazy, abusive and hide that they think this way. They will hurt or threaten anyone to get what they want.

Still to this day my current wife tells me I have issues trusting people (like friends and family). We even reflected and it took me about a year or two to properly fall asleep overnight in the same bed together since we've started. I always tell her you would too after what I've dealt with.",Specter Green,3,2020-12-29T08:04:55Z

951,UgwBE7E6Fivug1nJQsp4AaABAg,"I had a similar situation/time with my boyfriend. He didn't get physical with me, but he would throw things around (not at me) and destroy stuff (his own) and always try to keep me there and keep talking (screaming), when I clearly showed and even stated that I needed ""a moment"" to myself to calm down and process the situation. The person starting a fight has always had time to think about it, so he/she/whatever has to give the other partner that opportunity too.
Sometimes he would get so pressing that I would either start screaming myself or become completely silent, because it seemed nothing I said could make the situation better. And in some cases I would just get up and leave, because he wasn't able to listen, being in the emotional state he was, to my emotional needs. And yes I get that that could feel like I didn't care about him, but I knew where I (!! not him) was gonna end up emotionally if I stayed and that wouldn't have helped either of us.
We had a short split, when I made him move out (it has been and is my apartment - contract and payments) and days later we were both at a more stable emotional state and were both able to actually listen and not start flinging accusations and curses and stuff. We got through it (for the most part, of course there is still work to be done, because it just became our default reaction and changing habits can be hard) and now we are much better at stating what we don't like. It was a hard time for both of us and we were both psychologically in a very bad place, but we learned from it. We grew. We love each other and want to be with each other.

Ambers way of talking here gives me PTSD actually. I feel my heart race hearing her gaslighting him in every other sentence, changing her mood completely about a certain topic the minute she realizes she phrased something in a way that made her the bad guy. She tells him he is a baby for not wanting to stay when she gets emotionally and even physically abusive. THAT IS WHAT AN ABUSER DOES. Also her constant apologizing for stuff and then trying to justify it anyway.

If you apologize and then (half) take it back by trying to justify a morally wrong action (of which she knows is morally wrong, because she admits to that a few times) is called gaslighting (or at least it's part of the definition). And completely undermines the apology, as if she never gave one.
I'm sorry I hit you, but...
I'm sorry I insulted you, but...
A sentence stating something that gets contradicted with a ""but"", is like the first statement never happened.
I was mad, You made me mad,... is putting everything she feels on his plate. It's HIS fault, that she can't be a flipping adult and rather reacts like a 10 year old.

995,Ugy_K9Dx49ci9gfU4PB4AaABAg,"First 8 minute's Johnny is disregarding her feelings and destroying her self worth. Acting dumb to her despair. Basically gaslighting her and provoking her and ignoring her while she's trying to suggest solutions to their problems. Then Johnny is agreeing to ""try"" knowing very well he's recording her with no intentions to have happily ever after... Now he's turning her words against her which is frustrating her. She's tried to resolve the issue and he's picked out the parts that he can be offended by and focused on that. ...now she's pointing out again that she does all the problem solving and chasing while he rejects her and focuses on the negative. 
Now Johnny is focussing on bring up things she's done and she's unaware of the recording so she's not making a point to clarify the story and she's focusing on resolving the issues. ...Johnny mentions something about when a guy gets so fed up that he DOES pop the wife. She continues trying to focus on the present moment confused why he's bringing up sections of the past. Johnny says she's lying and she loses it saying she wasn't lying. She tells him to run with that. He tells her to stop the attitude and she attempts to calm down but he keeps calling her liar which is infuriating her.... He accuses her of talking to Charlie, she's flipping out saying she doesn't know what he's talking about. They address her hitting him whether in defense or not, and he's minimalizing her reality. She says ""and then I lied"" sarcastically referring to his story. He's possibly dramatised her actions when she was defending herself which is making her explode. She calms and accepts his version of events and agrees to change (or stop self defense or responding), .....she starts saying she's wanting change. She speaks of times that he's great for months before he turns cold and changes. .... She mentions this is the first time he's let her talk. He brings up another instance of her reacting by kicking him out of bed. Johnny ignores her and just focuses on the negative and treating her coldly. She pleads that his behavior gives her stress and anxiety. She continues to explain her anxiety and resentment. She says Australia things were different and he responds negatively and puts things back on her. Shes clearly picking up on his disinterest to resolve things. He brings up an old fight again. She mentions she just voiced a complaint and she doesn't want to focus on that. She voices she's fearful of his reactions so she took an ambiom. She begs him to give her a break. He says she could have just spoken about it (probably because he knows he's recording), she's confused. She pleads again that in Australia she could fight healthily without violance  or him walking out. He starts saying how fights should be and she listens but reminds him that it doesn't go like that because of his reactions. She seems to just want to be allowed to tell him when things hurt her without him going crazy or turning cold to punish her. 
She mentions they need to walk away if they can't be better. He mentions out of nowhere ""but what about you"" and focusing on who started the fights. This would be frustrating for her. She asks what needs to be done differently and pleads again how she can tell him her feelings differently. He brings up her yelling and she's bought into his version of events and promised to do better. Hes making fake promises knowing he's making this recording to exploit her. She's telling him the wedding meant something to him. He once again focuses on negative and says he knew the fights wouldn't stop after marriage (devaluing the value she's putting on that day). She pleads more that his behavior gives her anxiety. She seems desperate and begs him to do things respectfully and communicate better. She admits her anxiety worsens with his behavior. He agrees he doesn't want to resent her. She says she doesn't want to chase him out again because he's always leaving. He starts saying he doesn't want things to be physical. She agrees and owns her part in the physical fights and submits to him. He promises he won't leave her again. She suggests they fall asleep together instead of him walk out on her (obviously to make her break), she talks about him breaking promises. He mentions she starts the yelling and it gets crazy. He starts saying he doesn't feel safe in the marriage stability when she's yelling. He admits maybe not to the same degree as she does. She tells him to help her with that. They agree they can do that. He says he wants time to calm down and she says that's ok as long as she can have a voice and talk about it. He agrees with her that he understands her. 
He goes back to negative and brings up spats. She mentions that she always chases so he has that sense of security and she doesn't have that so he doesn't understand. 

Sounds like he's mentally and emotionally abusive he provokes her to feel and act crazy. 
They're both toxic because she can't walk out on him knowing he's mentally destroying her, instead she attacks him.",vee 2020,2,2020-12-16T17:20:16Z

He sounds like he's really tried to love her and be there, but he just sounds tired and fed up of trying to get his points across.

So it doesn't surprise me that she does hit him. I can imagine she throws her toys out the pram when he acts calm and it's not the reaction she wanted so probably hits him. What a horrible women.

She's probably is feeling hella toxic, confused, drained, unstable and tired of not feeling good enough because he can't communicate or keep his promises. I've haven't watched into that far. Only 10 minutes. But I think there is still pros and cons to both their sides. Theyre both toxic and  both suck at communicating.

I feel really sorry for Johnny. I've always been a big fan, I used to search high and low in shops for videos of his movies when I was young (still have my old JD VHS collection, showing my age 😅), but I will admit I believed Amber at the very beginning (like way at the beginning). I should have remained impartial til I learned the facts. I guess it's like a knee jerk reaction to believe a woman when she says something like that, or to believe anyone who claims to be a victim of something. I think when you're someone who would never lie about something like that then you just find it so hard to believe someone else would. But people lie, and they lie about incredible things. And I'm starting to believe it's a lot more common than anyone thinks.

Hes a narcassistic controlling asshole. Amber reminds me of my ex-husband. He'd yell and use quick talk to win arguments because i didnt care enough to fight. They aren't right for each other at all. Hes chill and calm, shes dramatic and like to fight. Just like my marriage. Exhausting.",Candace Thigpen,119,2020-09-03T04:21:43Z

It sounds to me that Amber is frustrated because she feels her needs aren't being met, but by all means it doesn't give her the right to throw objects or hit him. I was in a relationship not all together like this but I think Johnny may be passive aggressive or even perhaps emotionally unavailable. Yes, he was being calm but I don't  think he really listened to her. In my own situation I would get extremely angry and frustrated when I felt my ex wasn't  listening to me or for the lack of meeting my needs. I feel love was there between them which is more than I can say in my own situation. Marriage counseling would have benefited them both but when something is broken, people just give up.  I think it was the both of them that weren't compatible. I understand he had a 12 yr.relationship with the mother of his kids and his exes had nothing bad to say about Johnny.

She says it’s “easier” to walk away and it’s “brave” to stay and fight, it’s just not true, she has deep misunderstandings about what matters for a healthy relationship. She really needs help.

Sometimes the most bazaar and shocking comments that come out of one's own mouth in defense of the insanity being thrown your direction can be unbelievable. Eventually we start to think maybe some of it is us. I was often loudly criticized for walking away but why stay in that situation when you know it will only get worse and you'll never compromise. After a while you just can't tolerate the screaming about the past arguments that resurface again and again. Sometimes it seems that they reflect their issues as being your issues. I often wanted to record and replay arguments for my previous partner just so he would understand what he sounded like. CONSTANTLY DENYING AND THEY NEVER STOP TALKING AND IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO GET A WORD IN EDGEWISE.  After a while they don't even know what is coming out of their mouth. A mess of meaningless words. One minute you are on a pedestal and the next minute you are the worse person that ever lived or breathed. THANK GOD YOU HAD NO CHILDREN TOGETHER! TAKE YOUR LIFE BACK!  You will NEVER be able to please this individual. Today it will be one thing and tomorrow it will be something else and sometimes you get accused of things that other people did to them, not you.

Johnny's so good at keeping the Bigger Picture intact, ""because I loved you"" (which, said in the past tense, makes sense considering the context obviously). He says it so patiently and kindly. 
How could someone miss the point like this with someone they love, the way she's missing it?  

Amber asks for an olive branch, throws it away when Johnny offers it because she doesn't actually want it.
She doesn't want to talk about past problems, but ignores that she's being listened to in the present, latching onto the past regardless.  She refuses any conclusion or agreement, and will restart her rant and gaslight. She contradicts herself left and right.

There's obviously no going forward with that kind of selfishness.

She makes it sound like marrying for love wasn't enough for her- If she wants more, if she wants 'something' else to change, because she 'fought' for that wedding to happen as if it were a material prize, then it sounds like all she wanted was popularity from his marriage. I obviously know nothing about their marriage though.. but there's just a lot here. But if she were really that self-centered.. that's shocking considering how long they had been dating prior to the marriage. I can't imagine it being that.. can it? Regardless, she is abusive.

She wants to go around in circles just to keep him there. When he chooses to leave the situation because he knows it will only lead to more arguing and abuse she panics. She doesn’t believe she is worth being his wife and keeping around. So she is self sabotaging the relationship even though that’s the last thing she wants to do. She wants Johnny to validate her gripes, whether they are dillusional or not. She wants to hold on to him for dear life but at the same time is pushing him to his limit so if he does leave the situation her feelings of low self worth will be validated.

1646,UgzFHWQqfhMlqW5qkF14AaABAg,"Is there space for a broader perspective? If you'd like to invite that in, please hear me out. 
I can see both sides.  Clearly she is the one that gets physically abusive and emotionally volatile.  And that is straight up wrong.  But that doesn't mean that there is nothing for us to learn here from what she is calling out for.  I suggest everyone research anxious and avoidant attachment relationships. They often become a match. It ends up creating an unhealthy cycle and can bring the crazy out in people for sure.  Even in relationships where it doesn't get abusive like this,  one person expresses an issue they are having in relationship, the other person gets overwhelmed and wants to run, their need to get away is perceived as abandonment by the other, who then starts to cling and claw, which ends up making the other want to get away more, which creates more feelings of abandonment... and it just spirals. 
There is wisdom to her request that if he leaves,  let her know when he will be back to try and resolve things.  She was saying that their therapist recommended that and it would bring her such relief.  But he never does it.  When you suffer from anxious attachment,  being walked out on with no idea when you will see or hear from someone again, can trigger deep abandonment and anxiousness to the point that a person starts to truly lose their mind.  Sounds to me like Johnny should be choosing to walk away much sooner and not let people treat him like that.  But also if it's someone close like a wife,  and you marry someone with an anxious attachment style,  which means she has some serious trauma, the simple act of saying. I'm walking away to keep us both safe and calm,  we can try again in an hour,  could work wonders at deescalating. And then she should get some serious trauma healing work done for her abandonment trauma and abuse patterns. 
Remember,   Most of the time, people who abuse were once the victims of that abuse and need help.  It's not always a lost cause,  it's about knowing how to work with the trauma so it doesn't keep perpetuating.  Absolutely walking away and taking space, before things escalate, is wise.  But if you are dealing with someone who suffers from anxious attachment/ abandonment trauma, giving them that knowing of when you are willing to try again can be the breath of air that they are needing to not completely unravel.  
This is in no way condoning the blatant abusive patterns she clearly goes into. But when we are in partnership,  it's imperative to be aware of one another's attachment styles and traumas and then learn what types of communication support one another and bring out the best in each other And what styles of communicating unnecessarily poke each other's traumas. 
All that being said,  she needs help. I just don't like to demonize anyone and while her shadow is glaringly obvious,  I'm also able to see some of the bits of validity in her side.  And since this convo is overwhelmingly demonizing her,  I figured I'd chime in  with this perspective.",Sefana Wilde,26,2020-08-10T17:26:12Z

That being said in regards to his feelings towards her in spite of the abuse. And how he could continue to love her. You sometimes can't help who you love.

It is what it is. She obviously has some trauma in her past. It's called the cycle of abuse for a reason.  To break that chain one must first acknowledge there is a problem.

I can only hope somehow this could be the start of a wakeup call for her so she can get the help she desperately needs and end the cycle of violence.

As for Johnny, speaking as a former alcoholic, it's always a struggle. ESPECIALLY when something like this is going on. It is not as simple as turning a light switch off.

Drugs and alcohol effect everyone differently. Some become violent, some depressed, some like myself due to the HH gene relive their worst childhood traumas. 

Just because he took drugs and drank does not make him more likely to be violent than anyone else. I don't believe (and never did) he ever laid a hand on her.

Johnny is an easy going person who is not used to fights, he's been in a very placid relationship with Vanessa Paradis prior to this and she was perfectly matched to him as their personalities suited. Amber has a completely opposite personality, she needs drama and 'fights' as she pretty much says fight in every sentence ""I want you to FIGHT for me"" how about I want you to talk to me, to meet me in the middle. No, she wants fights and she hates that he walks away as he's not used to people like her. She sounds like a very difficult person that tormented him throughout the entire marriage and there's no doubt in my mind that she instigated everything, whatever her gain was from this I don't fully know, but ultimately it was money and fame and to come across as some kind of female empowerment figure but she is far from that.",Christina Cooper,12,2020-08-05T08:23:57Z

At that point they are not getting each other at all and I wonder if he does that on purpose. She is not well in this relationship and put out very serious issues to be addressed and he neglect to address them and then turn things around which is like gaslihgting!? It could not be gaslight  if he truly does not get what she talks about, but at least the first part is abuse by being neglectful of something that truly allarms an other.

He is clearly super cautious about it. You know sometimes you gotta take the time to observe someone you are dating and then take step back and think about who they simply just are, and why. Because without that you are not truly in an understanding relationship. It would save a lot of time if people didn’t shove themselves down people’s throat and just let them be who they are and feel them out and see if they can truly fit together. Also it helps to have some laughs in between all. But mainly you have to be with someone who shares the exact same core values. Immaturity levels can be different because the mature one will always allow the immature one to catch up, and the immature one will always try to catch up as long the core values are the exact same.

She is also unable to see that her violence creates a barrier that is dificult to overcome. She wants him to get beaten and then come beg her for forgiveness. Deary me... is she for real? Get your head outta your ass woman. He was your husband, not your slave.

I understand what she says though. I make it a point to never go to bed angry.
Sometimes, if things get heated it is ok to take a time out. I will tell you for a fact that everything will feel tiny after you cool down. 
Compromise is the name of the game. Never go to bed angry. The resentment will build.
At the end JD has the right idea. He proposes a solution that is a compromise, but she is unable to compromise. She wants to continue doing the same violence.

It looks like she married him for fame and money (prior to getting together with Johnny she was unknown), but she didn't love him and was not happy in the relationship. That resulted in her starting many fights over most trivial things. Now she is in another lesbian relationship. The question is: was she ever attracted to him or any other man ?

2783,UgwsQsWoq-E2PD-DGoh4AaABAg,"I have been married to the same man for 38 years, in 3 months. We have never beat on each other. Our children are grown and married and there is no abuse in any of their relationships.  How can you tell someone you love them, then beat on them, the two do not go hand in hand. This young woman needs to get counseling for her anger issues. What was her upbringing like, why does she think it's acceptable to physically assault the person she claims to love? This girl knew what she was doing. She chose an older man who people adore, and used his fame to promote herself, than wanted to push him to fight so she could use that against him to try and get as much out of him as she could before she walked away, at least that's what I get from her actions. I could be wrong, maybe she is a very self centered person with a warped idea of a relationship. That would explain why she had other men in his home while he was gone. Johnny seems very mellow, he seems like he would be one of the easiest people to live with, how could she treat him the way she did ? Answer, she didn't really love him.

She was addicted to the conflicts and also addicted to the making up that followed eventually. The conflict could start with a very simple thing and rapidly escalate if I didn't say what she wanted me to say. It could start like this : her : I love strawberries. Me : Yeah I know that but I dislike them. her : yeah right, naturally, if I do enjoy something, you have to say you dislike it. From there it would escalate. Anyways, through out this recording, he seems to remain calm and objective but she gets agitated multiple times and aparently she is the one who gets physical, so when they have an argument, he eventually leaves because he knows what's coming, a battle that he can't win unless he says what she wants to hear, which will escalate to the poit where she gets physical if she does not get what she wants.

2887,Ugwhx7u_fUvei_hHJ8J4AaABAg,"This is almost exactly what my experience was like with my ex girlfriend. Honestly she was my best friend for many years until we started dating. She would throw things at my face and get mad that I didn't want to argue with her. I felt trapped and seriously afraid for my well being. She would try to make me feel bad for not wanting to fight with her which was her idea of ""working on it"". She would always tell me ""people who are actually in love don't just walk away, they work it out."" She would say this while screaming at me and call me a baby after she threw things at my face while I was driving. Usually I would only have a word or two in the entire conversation which was usually be ""I'm sorry you're upset."" Or ""I don't want to fight with you."" I would try to just brace myself emotionally when I could tell she was about to have an outburst, but it seemed the calmer I reacted the more angry she got. She wanted to fight everyday about everything and she claimed this made her the strong one. All the things this person did to me I could never imagine doing to another human being, just the lack of decency and respect for feelings. I recorded a handful of her outbursts just so I could look back and make sure I wasn't doing anything wrong while getting screamed at.
 We broke up and she continued to try and get close to me again. She would text me extremely long paragraphs switching perceptions, one text she would be apologetic and want to get back together and the next would be all about her being the strong one and how upset she was that we didn't just fight through our problems like ""normal couples do."" I blocked her and didn't respond to any messages she sent me. She continued trying to reach me for months through different profiles trying to guilt trip me with manic messages. 

 I think she truly believes she was right in doing all the things that she did to me. I think Amber here recorded this assuming that it would show something against Johnny and maybe in her mind she believes she is right, but she seems very back and forth and always ultra reactive usually in an angry sounding way to anything he says. No one would want to be in this relationship, I mean if you were Amber and you were yelling at your partner all the time (even if you feel like it's justified) wouldn't you want to take a break if you were that upset? 
Johnny keeps his calm and only talks 34% of the time between her ranting. I would say that she seems just really clingy but she actually sounds like she has maybe bipolar disorder too.",Jeremy Cremer,0,2020-07-11T17:52:31Z

Im hearing Johnny cut his finger, wrote on the wall in blood, drinks alot, does alot of drugs, wrote some vulgar texts but none of this proves he was violent towards her. This audio on the other hand proves amber was physicaly abusive towards Johnny and what's worse is she doesnt seem to have any real remorse or understanding that it was wrong. She even wrote that article telling a story that she was a victim of abuse, completly disregarding or not recognising her own actions. At this stage i don't trust her. I think Johnny is a self loathing, dark, weirdo, who, by normal standards is intoxicated to much(but such is the life of a rockstar/actor) but unless hes found guilty of a crime i will continue to be a fan of his dark and moody ways which i think alot of people love him for.",human male,2,2020-07-11T06:10:22Z

3175,Ugz6Ah7NV9ws_XOdjZB4AaABAg,"The problem is that they both seem to have issues with proper communication. He avoids, she is overly pushy. Polar opposites that cause abusive frustration. They are too different and (I’m not against large age gaps) their ages come into play also. Different historical and subcultural differences. These two issues combined create chaos. I think they need to split. Not necessarily based on who vs who, but by the fact that they are too different to the point where their defenses and ways of verbally expressing themselves don’t match. They are both progressive, but on different ends. They both make valid points and have both admitted to start violence against each other, but I personally think it is Amber’s fault. Based on what she describes, she is manipulative and uses violence to express her frustration with him rather than having a calm discussion with him.

She's horribly controlling in the conversation and seems to make him out to be untrustworthy because he won't continue shouting at each other. It seems like the fights would go on for hours with her. She is physically abusive and threatening and tells him that does not matter that he should run in to a physical fight. Disgusting.,Jolene Elms,0,2020-06-05T08:28:27Z

I have lived in this exact kind of relationship for 10 years which is now coming to an end but I always knew        deep down inside that having kids would a really bad idea. These type of relationships are usually karmic relationships and not a real marriage where you need to have kids..  it’s a phase where certain strong men  has to go through  in order to gain certain lesson of life. The funny thing is that society never believes that sometimes a strong man can also be a victim of a delicate looking sweet women who is actually a devil in disguise... this world has it all wrong.,Syed Siraj Rizvi,0,2020-06-05T04:08:35Z

Accountability is never in her court. She's so delusional she thought by recording these conversations, it would vindicate her behavior. This is how people like this justify their life decisions. She's sick, obviously prior to this relationship, and is forcing him to be responsible for healing her, although he's an actor, not a therapist. I feel bad for this guy, this happens all too often cause these women have lived a larger part of their lives in situations where they escape accountability constantly. Women like this destroy everything. And i'm not just talking about empires or careers. They destroy entire people, both mentally and socially. And where is the bloodthirsty media now? I'll tell you where, it doesn't fit into the current race war/men are toxic narrative they've been busy pushing. Meanwhile behind closed doors, sick women are taking full advantage of the situation by enslaving and destroying entire lives. When women are dealt a bad hand, they're much more likely to regain their footing because that's how our societies system is set up. This is not true for men.

3514,Ugwzg0xLL2HoLbtFsjB4AaABAg,"Amber seems much more collective and less disorganized, compared to some other audio I have heard. From a socioemotional and psychological view, and knowing what I do, I would have to say that this conversation highlights some serious problems. It sounds like Amber has emotional dysregulation. During the interaction, as it wasn't really a conversation, Amber drifts off more times than I counted, e.g., circumstantiality. Her thoughts seem somewhat disorganized. However, some of the presumed findings via interpretation of the verbal output could, and likely are, directly related to her emotional state, at the time. I have heard audio of what is said to be Amber during an emotional breakdown (what most people call it). But, in that type of situation, people can behave out of the ordinary.


John listens to her, but one can pick up on that he is done with her, i.e., relationship is over. He wants to have a real conversation, not some argument that is blown out of proportion, but he explains that the latter has happened so much and such became physical too much that he has walked away numerous times. He is calm, collective, and is trying to follow her thought pattern to have a conversation. But, it is very difficult for him, due to her poor coping, emotional dysregulation, emotional deflection, and play on fallacies, e.g., fallacious reasoning. She even tries to use a fallacious reasoning technique/method to argue with him as a means to justify her own actions, which John did not play into. John is obviously a smart guy.


I believe she did, maybe still does, love John. But, at her age, her brain just doesn't function the way his brain does. 
She seems relatively smart, so that's not the problem. There could be drugs involved, which would mean a lot. Or, and possible with/without history of drug use/abuse, she could have a personality disorder, mood disorder, combination of such, or even a combination of psychiatric illness mixed with drugs.


I'm not convinced that she tried to set him up from the beginning, but only close friends/relatives could hint on that, as they witness more than the gen. public. She could have felt like she did her part and felt like he did not, but the relationship went on to the point that she became emotionally unstable, as he might have as well, but the latter does not seem to be the case, albeit, the entire relationship and the divorce was likely hard on him. He likely was done with the relationship as evidenced by him walking out; yup, that one walk out usually means it's over. 


I don't know all the details of the relationship, etc., and this could be a much longer post, but I am on John's side, based on the evidence I have thus far heard/read. Only later in the year will the real fine details come out, and Amber probably is going to wish she didn't try and play mind games.",RobHTech,0,2020-05-02T03:21:03Z

Then I grew up with those same tendencies and got pregnant. My boyfriend has always been amazing with me. But I do horribly with change. If days didn’t go according to plan, I’d go ballistic on him and he’d gotten to the point of giving up, but he didn’t. Postpartum heightened everything my stress, anxiety, and depression was OUT OF CONTROL that I had such bad panic attacks and he didn’t understand so I was angry with him for that. I felt so alone that I felt like I was the weak and weird one around him but those were the voices in my head. So I got help. They found I have BPD.

Very very manipulative. Very.

So the scenario was: johnny texted travis to come up. He asked amber to TELL him what happened. But amber DEMONSTRATED it by punching him. In which she admitted to DEMONSTRATING PHYSICAL VIOLENCE  by justifying that she him hit, not punch.

She’s acting like a child and an attention whore.,Fallen Monk,0,2020-04-24T14:06:05Z
3615,UgxJRPV1Rkg9b_FMF8x4AaABAg,"She needed to use her energy to pack her bags and leave instead of wasting her breath on him.  How and why did they ever marry? He is totally withdrawn from her and the relationship which is a breach of trust.  He doesn't care enough to work on anything. Why is he there? Why doesn't he end it? Is he dependent on her for sex? Sometimes it is the kindest and most honest thing to do to end things completely.  Since he really does not care and has decided that she is not the right one for him why is he using her by being half there. He knows very well that he is in the wrong and disappointing her and infuriating her.  She is a young woman who got married and actually expected a husband, friend and partner and someone who cared about her and the relationship as much as she did. He is old enough to know what he was doing to this young woman was wrong. She is very beautiful and probably a nice person and she should value herself and her time enough to walk away rather than stay and lash out at him in frustration. Maybe she was physically abusive, but he was emotionally abusive to her. She was literally fighting for a relationship.  He was being dishonest to not tell her that he was not interested or in love.",Janet Wells,0,2020-04-24T13:51:06Z
3616,Ugz24oOhKuj_qvVOwSt4AaABAg,"Ok so Johnny is always calm people he NEVER RAISES HIS VOICE UNLESS HES THREATEND OR ITS ABOUT HIS KIDS. How would you like your privacy put out in the public eye, but it just proves that his real fans knew it wasn't him being physically violent with her. She lied soooo bad, just goes to show that there really are woman that abuse men. Only she's not a woman she's a coward. Somewhere in a past relationship or even family she's been abused whether its physical or mental. I hope there BOTH in a better place. I hope both of them can move forward but if you listen to the phone conversation about going to court he was willing to deal with it in private but she would not let up. 
He's got a drinking problem and he's admitted that, but the stress with this marriage definitely made him worse. I just feel bad because I'm going through something similar only roles reversed.

I know people can't see that because they don't know what hell it is to have BPD. The only way a BPD can control themselves is by controlling other people because they have no coping mechanisms...lots of times they will use drugs and alcohol to.

She took Johnny walking away from confrontations as burying his head in the sand and ignoring the communication problems in the relationship rather than civilly reflecting on their own behaviour and how they can improve it. The problem with Amber here is that while saying this to Johnny, she is failing to reflect on her behaviour. Johnny is walking away because Amber is extremely wound up and agressive. Johnny knows that no civil discussion will come from facing Amber so he is actually taking the RESPONSIBLE action here and walking away to avoid making the situation worse. 

Amber seems that she truly wanted to fix the lack of emotional fulfillment she felt in the relationship.

Never say always (unless you're saying you will always love them). Never exaggerate when you're communicating with your loved one because the reality is that 1. It's usually not true, it might be common or rare, but it's rarely always or never, and 2. Even if it is always and never, the other person will resent the picture you've painted of them and will be less likely to want to communicate with you and solve the solution because now you've not only attacked their actions but their character",Sammie Adamson,0,2020-04-11T01:52:31Z

I will not be able to see this woman in any movie from here on out without thinking about how immature she is and abusive she is. I think she is way out of her mental league when speaking to an older Depp. The maturity gap goes way beyond even the age difference.

And one of the hardest parts of that was that nobody believed it, because to his friends he was ''such a great guy''. Even I ended up not believing it, thinking that perhaps I was blowing this out of proportion in my head. I remember one amazing evening, when his friend was over at our place with his girlfriend and I was very gently and quietly trying to tell my boyfriend to slow down on the drinking, as he would become extremely irrational and aggressive when drunk, and I was worried what would happen once the guests left, when it happened right in front of them- he stood up, dragged by the scruff and threw me out of the house barefooted in an autumn storm for daring to ruin his fun evening and embarassing him in front of his friends, that I finally had a bit of an ''aha'' moment. I wasn't crazy, other people saw it too! Now he can't explain it away. And then, the idiot that I was, I went right back to him the following day, for another miserable year or so.

4267,Ugwzmp7YBdywZI6LeFl4AaABAg,"The way Amber talks suggests that she is completely ignorant about the effect a woman has on a man who actually cares about her.

Johnny is a rich/famous/handsome man.  In terms of women, he is set for life even if Amber takes him to the cleaners with this divorce.  He can have pretty much any woman he wants, and he was in an exclusive relationship with Amber.

I can hear the defeat in Johnny’s voice, it is a very familiar sound.  While Amber is passionately screaming all this rhetoric about “fighting”, “being cowardly”, and all these other expectations she has of him, Johnny is fully aware of the fact that the woman he was once in love with is gone.  This is someone else with a different agenda that doesn’t involve simply loving each other and having a good time.

Trust me, her “closed fist” punch at Johnny did not hurt him physically for more than a minute.  It was more so the fact that when it came from the woman he trusted/loved, and he knew enough from past experience that what he thought his relationship with her was is now as good as dead.  

So yes, to her it was a complete joke.  But she may have very well ripped his heart and soul out with that punch without even realizing it.  That’s why she is so ignorantly ranting at him about how she wants him to do this, that, and the third to maintain their relationship...but Johnny understands that real love is not some type of unbearable game of tug of war.  Despite what society might try to convince us at times.  

Trust me, this relationship is over.  It will never come back together.  I don’t usually bet on things, but I know for a cold, hard, certain fact that Amber fucked up here.  And Johnny fucked up by marrying her.  I doubt either of them are horrible people.  Just two people who entered blindly into a relationship which brings the worst out of each other.",Matt Konny,0,2020-02-23T04:28:18Z

It makes her feel crazy and he doesn't really care for her heart. She being overwhelmed and confused becomes the bad guy.He doesn't truly love her, she is his trophy wife. The heart knows!

4474,UgzG7VT-RJ-Mi-Z4SAR4AaABAg,"I think she actually has borderline personality disorder. She literally has a fight with him cause he (splits) leaves all the time and doesn't come back. She almost says her diagnosis a few times but stops short and changes the word. It seems to me they both knew what she has been diagnosed with and she is doing exactly what a borderline personality disordered person would do and top of it trying to tell him that he can't blame her for acting this way because of her condition basically. Borderlines feel empty and fear abandonment most strongly. They love intensely and as quickly as that comes it goes fast to hate, arguments with lashing out in violence in whatever way available with quick apologies for their behavior although strangely still believe they are justified for doing whatever they've done and quick to discount it because the actions of the other is supposedly the reason they acted in a certain way. Johnny Depp and Amber Heard are both unfortunate in this situation cause both feel abused in some way,  justified for one more than the other is not the answer as she keeps clearly seeking that she feels worse than him or her acts of violence or hostility could ever cause him compared to her feelings which is huge with borderline personality disordered people. They constantly fight and antagonize the other until the other fights back or leaves then gets increasingly angry that the other would leave them like they  always knew they would by playing the sympathy card for themselves. These people need constant reassurances and constantly must know that if the other leaves in a fight will come back despite them being horrible otherwise they don't feel loved. She reminds him that he has a luxury compared to her that feeling that he is not being abandoned knowing she'll be there for him and unfortunately she never feels this way cause of her disorder which is not his fault but she's trying to tell him how painful it is inside her to feel this way how it eats at her and consumes her. It's unfortunate but love and self worth is what is going on in her head and she won't find 100% assurances and that's what frames these as such hard relationships to stay in for the other party usually.",everclear wonderful,2,2020-02-15T19:35:33Z

I really can’t judge their relationship by this one conversation.  Amber appears upset in that she expects to have time with John. It seems that John wants the same thing. The problem seems to be per Amber that if she complains about one thing then John splits because he wants to have a good time. My question would be is Amber complaining because she just wants John to comfort her (and he is probably solution focused) and she is angry when he doesn’t offer her comfort. Also, I would want to know if Amber has her set of friends or neighbors she goes and hangs out with. Then I would also want to investigate the beginning of the relationship. What was the dynamic in the beginning. Would Amber wait for John and now she’s sick of it? Would John coddle Amber and try to sooth her and now he’s sick of it? The fact that they yell, throw things and get physical is not healthy. It matters not who started it. It needs to stop. My last question in my mind is this - were they purposely recording their conversations in order to analyze it later? If only 1 is aware then just remember that person will temper their words and actions, r even manipulate to look more positive (sound more positive).  Remember people just want to be understood for the most part. It needs to be a mutual goal however. Both have to work at it. Amber sounds anxious to me  - stressed. ( evidenced by some of the rambling on - she may be wound up. Could be an indication of trauma somewhere in her life).

She has all these expectorations yet. She doesn't know how to make agreement. She doesn't know how to ask for what her needs are. He's just supposed to read your f****** mind.
Honestly, maybe he's not communicating much with her. But she's definitely not communicating with him. She's not setting. I guess not a silly boundaries, but she's not telling him what she really needs from him what she really wants from him and because of that. It's going to create Havoc. She has these expectations. She shouldn't have that much price. You say look honey. This is what I need from you. I need you to be here. You can leave for now. Come back in an hour. Go cooldown. I love you. I'm pissed off at you. I don't like you right now, but I love you. You better be back.

You can't be playing these expectation games and he's mine games. It's not going to make her relationship any better if she really cares about him.

I heard her say some things. I don't know if it's truth, but it sounds like a little bit of Truth. She wants him to chase her.

Definitely an Actress.

These two should not be together, and I think that even tho Amber wants to be...she’s not mature enough to be with an older man, set in his ways. As fars as abuse...I. Think it’s just a cultural mismatch. She expresses her needs passionately, and he deals with conflict by finding peace in nature.

4888,UgzvjZ1wqC9qcy-IimV4AaABAg,"This audio is horrific.
She acts like he is supposed to take whatever violence or insults she dishes out, or else, he’s a “baby.”
“I haven’t been able to have a fight with you in so long.“
Like she needs someone to hammer on.
In her own words, she equates fighting with her as love. 
It’s very warped.
She thinks that somehow fighting with her is fighting FOR her.
Why should he have to “fight” for her? He married her.
Depp: But watching you lied to Travis… “
Heard: “That’s your problem!”
Then she runs away from that in her next sentence, by saying he finds something quote to hang onto.”
So he can’t have any complaints
He’s running away from violence, and she’s running away from taking responsibility for what she says and her violence.
Again in the tape, she acts like it was so romantic because they were fighting.
It’s very sick.
Of course, there was this: “I didn’t hit you! I punched you,” as if that’s okay.
What an arrogant bitch.
It seems like she is really trying to grind him down, and play stupid at the same time about it
He blames Depp for the reaction he has to her violence, anger and insults.
She insults him, and then fault him for feeling insulted.
She starts fights, then criticize him for not coming to her and ending it.
She must have a really thought he was pussy whipped to be so arrogant.
I couldn’t imagine ever treating a guy that way, especially if I wanted him to stick around.
She blames him for her emotional immaturity. 
I can’t believe he was that calm about it.
He asked her to promise to be respectful, and she says no, but wants him to promise he won’t leave her.
He tells her they have to separate if it gets physical, and she refuses to commit  to ending the physical abuse.
Then she immediately threatens him she’s going to leave him if he does not stay there to put up with it.

Emasculating him, calling him a hypocrite to morally bankrupt him, using various tones of contempt, it's all there. I remember how it made me feel and I can feel it here. It is the feeling of humiliation, of devaluation, and this is why the key characteristic of narcissists is the ability to erode and chip away at another person's self-esteem.

Amber said doing a lot of things for the relationship but i can say someone like Johnny wouldn’t care about so much on what you have done. He would only care something on the soul level, a soulmate. What your life has, only your soul could amaze him. 

To be more explicit, Johnny is looking for youth and charisma from another person, of course Amber has great face and figure, but going deeper, Johnny is looking for another Johnny to fall in love. You know what I mean? He is trying to find back his own youth and charima. 

So if there isn’t any attraction , naturally, either one side will slip away, so what they are saying about “trust” is gone. Because i could not feel you anymore, i am losing you, i am no more attractive to you. Yeah, it is true.

So being a woman, need to upgrade yourself continuously , your story, your horizon, your wisdom. On the other hand, increase your love to yrself, that is how charisma comes.",charlotte jaco,1,2020-02-06T11:16:20Z

5006,Ugxw_C02domREDsHwah4AaABAg,"Just an awful mess. AND I knew from Day 1 she was full of it. I would post in different places standing up for him---and have conversations with people casting fundamental doubts on her credibility---and the vitriol and toxicity lobbed by people was astounding. Convicting him, prior to due process or even evidence---and accusing anyone who would question her claims as being as much an abusive sexist sadistic monster as Johnny Depp.  It was absolutely frightening thing to see happening---all throughout the media---all the people condemning him and anyone else, by association, who would speak on his behalf or on the behalf of fairness itself. 

I'm glad this tape came out. It's very sad tho, and I just wish she would go away---she's a crap actress and seems like a borderline personality (which he tends to be drawn to, except his actual wife whom he ditched for this $%^&), and hope that that Johnny Depp can get some help and kick booze and pills and become more than a dissipated shadow of his former self eventually.

Hearing this whole thing, since I had time sitting on a flight with nothing better to do, it's clearly a very, very bad match. Partly due to age. Partly due to them finding each other when he is clearly no longer at his best or brightest--and is tired--and doesn't have the jam to be in a relationship with a highly volatile young woman--and also sounds like he definitely has some substance issues-----but at the end of the day they're just a really bad match. He no longer wants to fight----he's too tired and passive and, as he says, he's a flake and doesn't always ""show up,"" and he exits when things start to get at all unpleasant---and doesn't own the fact that repeatedly doing that is as disrespectful, hostile, and fundamentally destablizing to her as her crazed ranting and raving is to him. 

He leaves because he can't take it. She freaks because he leaves. He claims if she were only nicer about expressing displeasure he would be able to engage with her in the way she wants---that sounds like wishful thinking on his part, particularly if he's drunk---I believe her when she says that even if she says in a nice way ""It made me feel really shitty when you left and didn't text or call or tell me where you were for 5 hours"" he would just blow her off and accuse her of causing problems---he is very passive and sounds like addicts and drunks I've known (well) who can't handle ANY conflict but at the same time continually cause it by their selfish behavior. BUT, on the other hand, she is way too high strung for him, she does not know how to ""self-soothe, self-calm"" whatever else she accused him of, she DOES instigate wild over the top screaming matches and physical altercations, is not self-aware, is equally as selfish.",susaninmaine,1,2020-02-06T06:48:15Z

Mr. Depp did not ask her to leave, and most decent men in these situations would say, this is not going to work out, you need to leave now, I am not going through this anymore. But instead, he indulges in conversation and taping Amber, he shows no love towards her, just I love you, with no meaning behind those words. I think she wants to believe he loves her and is hopeful if they talk it out, thinking their relationship may have a chance. There's more to this than any of us know.

Johnny lost his role as Captain Jack Sparrow because of the lies and smear campaign launched by his ex wife Amber Heard and almost lost the role of Grindewald in Fantastic Beast 2: Crimes if Grindewald. Amber Heard has gone on to star in Aquaman which grossed over billion dollars, an endorsement deal with L’Oreal and has become an ambassador for the UN and has not suffered any of the backlash that Johnny has despite the truth coming out that she was the abuser in that 15 month marriage and she was the one using the Me too movement for her own gain and was making a mockery out of actual survivors of domestic violence.

But I realize now, it isn’t just about being innocent or guilty, it’s also about looking at everything we do and don’t know. He’s one of my greatest inspirations and was the catalyst for me deciding to become an actor and couldn’t hate myself more for turning on him like that. I was wrong to do that and regret it. 

I’ve been in a relationship like this.  You can’t do or say anything without being the bad guy or being criticized or yelled at or whatever- the point is, you can’t communicate with them, you can’t be yourself around them, you can’t even fucking exist around them. I know exactly how he felt: you’re so fucking stressed out and confused and mentally exhausted and conflicted that they drive you just as crazy as them, and you hold on to hope against hope, until eventually you just realize you have to fucking end it. He doesn’t even bother refuting what she says most of the time or arguing because he knows there isn’t a point. He honestly sounds really fucking drunk, too, but I don’t think that’s why he was so averse to arguing with her. 


Those of us who turned on him owe it to him and are obligated to make things right. You don’t just raise a bitch fit and say, “Oh, well fuck it anyway,” and drop the issue when it turns out the guy was innocent.",Michael Brooks,0,2020-02-05T10:52:30Z

I don't wanna be horrible. But this sounds like the fights I had with my ex. I was the one circling around. Being so hurt. Shouting. Talking all the time during a fight. He only stone walling me. Giving the silent treatment. And if he said one thing, which was rare, it was extremely hurtful and manipulative. So this ongoing manipulation made me push to to a point of toxicity. It's like I caught the fleas and I would be triggered cry and shout at him.
I worried that I could be borderline or narcisstic and went to a therapist. After months of therapy he would tell me I am in no way a narcisstic, rather an empath. I am just being triggered and pushed and that's why I do all the fighting. Scream and cry. Because it's painful being abandoned during a fight and the other cares zero and when he cares it's only a triggering hurtful one word reply.

So try to see this from the other side too. Of course she isn't right and she does toxic things. But we need to see the whole picture and I don't see Johnny Depp as an Saint either.

5466,UgyEfs0RhBwVfu4HoxF4AaABAg,"Good gawd.  This was painful to listen to.  Now, Scott Reich, don’t feel bad for rambling on because I apologize in advance for my new novel, here.  I thought maybe it could be fake, but that is definitely Johnny Depp getting yelled at, insulted, belittled, patronized, gaslighted, deflected on, and just plain manipulated.  And the person inflicting this abuse is clearly Amber Heard.  Either she didn’t realize this entire argument was being recorded or she really didn’t see anything wrong with her own behavior.  Listen, sweetheart (Amber), there is a LOT wrong with your behavior here.

Women are just as capable of violence as men are.  It is a serious problem.  It exists.  Women should not get a pass on being abusive simply because they are women and how dare anyone call a woman out for it after all the oppression...okay.  But it’s “equal rights”, not “special rights”.  With equal rights come equal responsibility.  This girl will not even accept responsibility for her own temper.  

Now, I don’t want anyone to think I don’t take domestic violence, child abuse, or sex crimes against women seriously or that I think all women lie about being victimized this way.  I take it very seriously and I do believe women—with proof.  There are so many women who really have been horrifically victimized.  There are also so many men who have also been horrifically victimized.  For a female to go about claiming a man did this to her but then, a recording like this surfaces in which it becomes clear that she was definitely abusive to him, that is a HUGE insult to all the women, men and children who really are victims.  One liar can unfairly cast doubt on those who are telling the truth, and take up public resources meant to help actual victims.  That is NOT okay.

Johnny Depp may have had his issues with substance abuse and he may be lousy with money, but that doesn’t give Amber Heard the right to use it against him and destroy his life by being dishonest like this.  The Xanax (nasty stuff) was an eye popper.  Whether or not Depp was drunk, stoned, exhausted or just plain calm, he doesn’t sound as if he needed Xanax.  But she gave it to him even though he said no.  I agree, Mr. Depp.  You did not need Xanax.  You needed a good divorce attorney.  

There has been a lot of discussion and debate about our right to freedom of speech.  What it is, who and what is protected, and what type of speech is not protected.  It comes down to yes, filmmakers and YouTubers fundamentally have the right to discuss the Watts case, to make movies about it and to write about it.  Provided they do not slander someone (living) in the process, like Ms. Kessinger.  Johnny Depp might just end up being an example of what freedom of speech does and doesn’t protect.  I hope I made at least some sense here.  I also hope any vindication will help Johnny Depp rebuild his life in good ways, I really do.",EmeraldKimmy,2,2020-02-04T20:58:55Z

She told me, this was just the way she was, but after a while I experienced, that she could be very normal with all of her friends or even strangers...When I needed her the most, she quickly broke off and came back later. I didnt get a hug from her when my father died...she never showed empathy for me...but cried at a movie of the story of a diseased dog....for days!

I'm just at 15:38 and I think Amber should really listen to these recordings because it seems she gets so worked up and focused on what she's saying and what she's thinking (or assuming) that she blocks out most of what Johnny says or does.  She mentioned a lot of things that Johnny ""never does"", including he never works to get to the bottom of things (something like that), but I feel as if he's doing exactly that right now but she doesn't realize it because she's too preoccupied with being able to say things she wants to say.  And Johnny tells her to listen to the tapes, but she basically says she doesn't want to...

Now at 23:19 ... Uhm... what I'm hearing is: she wants to be able to fight.  Hmm... so, did she marry him so he can be her punching bag? I'm confused...

Now at 34:00 ... Basically, she wants things done her way, and her way is 'I want to be able to fight with you'.  Also, it's like she asks a question, gets an answer, but she completely misses the answer either because she's too busy talking over it or she's not talking but her brain blocks it out... 
I've been facepalming a lot listening to this... 😥

Ok.  
Amber, when he leaves, he just wants time for you and him to calm down.  He doesn't want things to get physical.  
Problem is, I think during that 'alone time', Amber doesn't spend it calming down.  I think she spends it working herself up even more -- she describes it as being more stressful for her, the longer it takes.  
😥  She really needs to exert more effort trying to see things in a different way.

5584,UgyCH9lspFrG6pky8fd4AaABAg,"As a woman and a Domestic violence survivor, it angers me when women who advocate against domestic violence against women will NOT stand up for men or even boys in the same situation. Those people to me are not advocates just people with agenda's against men. Amber is known as having a bad temper throwing things at people etc.but people ignore that
So, Johnny leaving the situation so it does not escalate is a problem to her and others but is NEVER an issue when a woman leaves. Yet again another double standard.
Why would he talk to her when she is like this. SHE IS CLAPPING HER HANDS  OR DOING SOMETHING WITH HER HANDS LIKE WE CAN  HEAR HER DOING. intimidation tactic is what it is called.
People talk about how he is talking but when women who are in DV situations talk like this there is no problem. yet again another double standard.
Amber is trouble plain and simple. She won't even explain what she meant by He won't fight for her. he won't fight when there is a problem? She uses the word FIGHT way too much.
When he brought up her throwing pots , pans, vases, at him she immediately deflects and says that is different and it is irrelevant and wants him to go to her? She seems to be very dominant and wants him to be submissive to her. I wonder when the State will get an arrest warrant for her because we know had Johnny was saying all these cops would be knocking at his door Immediately.
A lot of women sadly are like her and think the man is a coward by walking away. When the coward is actually the woman who is the abuser. Men are called cowards if they hit a woman and they are called cowards when they walk away. More women who are DV survivors need to start standing up for everyone who is in a DV situation whether it is a man, woman or child because if you don't than you are not really fighting against domestic violence you are fighting against all men, no matter the situation.
Men rarely report DV because of the stigma so to a lot of people it does not exist.Wish people especially women could see how many men actually go to  DV groups and hear their stories some are similar to Johnny Depp's and some are a lot worse than his.Time for people to  wake up because what I always tell people what if it happened to a male in your family would you make fun of him,would you degrade him and when I ask that  question I always get silence.15 years I have asked that question and I have yet to hear one person be able to answer that question",darcyann66,3,2020-02-04T18:28:08Z

Far from me to diagnose mental illness but she sounds extremely bipolar (on top of sounding narcissistic, controlling and manipulative).

WHO says to the ""love of their life"", their ""favorite person in the universe"" things like ""I'll try not to hit you anymore,  but I cant promise""
Psychopathic succubus from hell
AND I can NOT believe that after accusing him of being a junkie and a drunk she was shoving xanax down his throat all along to keep him under control, ""the last xanax wore off here I'm giving you another one"".....what?!?!?!
This guy's career as well as his sanity were thrown down the drain because of her, taken off huge movie deals and slandered in the public's eye
I think he is owed recognition and a public apology, on top of being awarded damage interests, for financial damage AND emotional distress. That SHE is now a victim advocate, a recognized one at that, speaking at HUGE events on the subject??? Nahhhh
She makes real VICTIMS of abuse a joke. *SHAME ON YOU AMBER HEARD*
Studios should drop her for a little while so she reconsiders her life and is taught some humility.
