You have to get impartial people because her friend (many of whom ‘work’ with her or for her) will and do lie for her. Sorry you can’t hide swelling with makeup that’s why I looked at her from every angle. She has not been beaten recently. Not in the face at all.

She told everyone it was ""never about the money"" and always contended she gave it up.  Then when CHLA gave the documents that showed she lied, Amber's lawyers said wait, um, she didn't donate because litigation by Johnny.  Turns out Johnny didn't file any lawsuits until a year after he made the final payment AND Amber had no fear of lawsuits because she went public.
