11,UgwL5zHJNEx7BYMlclZ4AaABAg,The real question is her punishment... See if Depp was proven guilty his life would've been over and she would be set for life and that's not an exaggeration. Now that the tables are turned what next? Is the court going to protect her just because she is a woman? Does she get special treatment because she looks hot in make up? Will the court be too intimidated to punish her because she is such a strong outstanding bullshitting female of the human species? I really want to know what will be done because I don't see the punishment being anywhere near enough for someone like her. I've seen men be put behind bars for false accusations by women like this and it makes me sick to my core they have the audacity to flaunt their lies.,Emotional Support,0,2020-10-05T05:02:45Z

49,UgxglmpR90whq1LGwMB4AaABAg,"Quick first note, *""Riley Keough""* would make a great replacement for Aquaman 2  *""Mera""*  character. 

The gender bias is strong with Amber Heard. Had she been a man, he would of been fired ASAP. 
Wait, it did happen, the actor's name is Johnny Depp. He was dismissed/fired and lost future projects due to Amber Heard's false allegations/accusations. His reputation took a huge hit and his name was defamed to the highest degrees for a woman's greed. The fact that so many people still support Amber Heard after all the audio leaks we've heard and videos (deposition being 1 of them) totally baffles me. This is a perfect example of elitist gender bias, women must be believed at all cost because it's PC and men need to be destroyed without due process. Whatever happened about ""innocent until proven guilty?"" 

The courts need to treat Amber Heard the same way they would treat a man and send a clear message that this is totally unacceptable and there's consequences for women just as same as for men. She deserves to be fired and lose future projects just like her false accusations hurt Johnny Depp's career and loss of potential future projects he had going so therefore since she's the proven abuser and even manufactured false evidence based on her lies, so now that the truth is out, she should be treated as such and be put through the grinder just like Johnny was due to her false accusations. Amber Heard has hurt true victims of abuse and assaults because people like her using the victim card/system/powers of ""must be believed at all cost"" before any investigations is started. It takes just an accusation to destroy a man's life and career, so much so that when the evidence proves without any doubts that the man was innocent from the start and the woman played the ""victim card"" to forward her agendas, by then it's too late, the damages to the man's reputation/good name are done. 

This is why Amber Heard needs to get prosecuted to the full extent of the law in both criminal and civil courts, in order to send a clear and loud message that these kind of actions will not only be tolerated and must come with severe consequences no matter how high their ivory towers are.",S.

If WB truly follows through with reducing her role(or benching her altogether), I can't imagine Lo'Real settling for a washed up celebrity that's lost her star power amidst her own PR dumpster fire.

155,Ugwk3OIvyZbgUvZSzDd4AaABAg,"What has happened to Johnny Depp is disgusting and I pray he gets Justice and recover from this. I hope Amber gets punished for this and I’m glad that this has come about as it shows how neglected Male domestic abuse is and how easy it is for a women to ruin a man, and how Feminism fails to campaign for things to benefit men and protect them from things like this. 

What I’m about to say may not be liked by many but I understand that. In all honesty I hate Feminism because of the man-hating cult it’s become and how there is inequality in the world that is neglected by them that puts men at a disadvantage, however I share my opinion as a human, not an anti-feminist:

‪I don’t condone what Amber Heard’s done. It’s disgusting, and she should be punished. But we have to remember people can change and can redeem themselves. 

I’m glad people are seeing domestic Male abuse and how a women can ruin a man, and the inequalities of gender when it comes to the Criminal Justice System. I’m glad Johnny Depp is going to get justice and Amber Heard will pay the price. I hope this proves that Feminism isn’t as great as it thinks it is and has done a lot for women, but what’s it done for men.

But she shouldn’t lose her whole career. She’s a part of the DCEU, and based on videos online she seems nice and I loved her in Aquaman. She has made a criminal offence and I have lost some love and respect for her for that, but she is a human who just needs to be punished and taught the error of her way. 

Instead of firing her from everything just make her unable to star in anything other than what she’s contracted to for “X” number of years. Let her do an Aquaman 2 of she’s contracted to do it, but don’t let her do another if she isn’t contracted to.

Make her make a public apology to Johnny Depp and admit what she’s done, pay him a large sum of money for what she’s done to him. Then make her serve some kind of punishments like House Arrest and Community Service and have a restraining order against Johnny Depp put on her.

Make her realise that what she’s done is scummy, but give her a chance to redeem herself like we would want ourselves if we were her.

Based on what happened with Caroline Flack, we can see the damage the internet can do to someone even if they do deserve it and if we push someone to do something like that and take a life, we’ve done worse than what we’ve criticised them for.‬

Give her a chance to redeem herself. It will take a long time, and it won’t be easy, she will still be hated by some and she may not completely deserve it, but if we were her, we would want it. Punish her, but give her a chance to redeem herself. Make her realise she is a criminal, but make her realise that she can sort of comeback from this.

418,UgxdC3Qsq5j2ujbUkFd4AaABAg,"Ask for help huh... ok I'll throw this at ya. So this is way off topic but here it is. I took my kid's mother to court over 10 years ago  for custody. We have 50/50 split right down the middle. Since then, for the most part, we get along quite well. Though from time to time, she tries to go out of her way to take any time away from me that she can. I usually can take care of it my self but due to current times, she has become aware of the advantages of corona virus. 3 weeks ago she claimed she was keeping our child due to going on self quarantine (which is a two week span) for questionable reasons. I was ok with this even tho I didn't like it. Then while talking to my child on the phone I find out she was taking them into a store.... I told her that that was not doing self quarentine. She got upset and said ""if you're going to argue, just come and get them."" So I did. After this, she preceded to tell me ""I wasn't taking covid serious"". I had to explain to her and our child what self quarantine actually entails so my child wouldn't get the wrong impression about it from her. The very next week she sent our child to their Mimi's house(her mother) without batting an eye and without telling me (during my time with them). I just let it go but kept saying to myself *whatever happened to your self quarantine?* (facepalm... it had only been one week). Now this week, my state finally enacted the stay home everyone except for groceries and essential business work otherwise you can now be arrested. She told me that our child will be safe staying there at her house due to this. So I'm extremely frustrated with the notion I won't get to be with my child for a month knowing she won't enforce the same ruling on everyone else in her family most specifically her mother. If she's trying to protect our child from covid, her mother is the first person that needs to stay away from our child. Her mother is an RN who cleans up the ""messes"" at hospitals.

Males are victims too and can become one as easily as anyone else. Heard has made her bed and the truth is starting to unravel.

He's the one that'll have to spend his life recovering from her abuse and the heartache she's given him. Her?

I was a woman who when the allegations against Johnny first came out years ago, said loudly, ""something doesn't seem right and there's very little evidence. Let's not jump the gun...."" There was no pattern of abuse before amber. All of his past partners vouched for him. This marks the difference between an abusive person and someone who is reacting badly to a toxic situation. It's the difference between a serially terrible person and a good person who did a terrible thing.

Any violence committed by johnny towards amber was a reaction to being  tormented and abused by her. When a woman defends herself, we applaud her courage so why are we not applying the same understanding towards Johnny?

736,Ugx75gQXCuUyEP3404d4AaABAg,"Ok I'm going to play devil's advocate to just come and say it doesn't freaking matter if Amber Heard is a garbage person and that shouldn't affect her role in the Aquaman sequel. Look I've never been a fan of her's and to be honest never liked the actress, and my opinion of her has only lowered after I've learned all the despicable things she has done to Johnny Depp. But that been said having already seen her as Mera in both Justice League and Aquaman, I really cannot imagine anyone else portraying this character. I mean yes she is an awful person no doubt about it, but when she was on the big screen she was not playing Amber Heard but Mera, a completely different personality. And let's be honest I think even those of you calling for her character to be recast cannot deny that she is a good actress and has so far shined in her role as Mera. Now I'm not saying there should not be any repercussions for Amber Heard's actions, but whatever she's done in her personal life shouldn't compel us not to watch her movie, yet alone demand for her to be fired. The fact of the matter is she is already facing a lot of backlash from her lies and for what she put Depp through. But that is all in her personal life and has absolutely nothing to do with her professional life. Johnny Depp isn't going to suffer from us watching her ex play a fictional character in a movie he has absolutely no involvement in. People seeing Amber Heard in Aquaman 2 in theaters will not change their opinion of her, but as long as she does a good job as her prescribed character and her performance is able to enhance the movie, I am ok with her inclusion.",barbiquearea,1,2020-04-01T13:54:11Z
