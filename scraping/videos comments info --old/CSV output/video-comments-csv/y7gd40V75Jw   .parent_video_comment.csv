 went shopping at the mall for cheap silver  plated candle holders in a million plus penthouse and you really believe that I've listened to all the recordings seen all the videos the stamemts list is endless she's lied cheated used and mentally emotionally and physically abused #justiceforjohnnydepp #johnnydepp and manipulated the system and pulled shadow all who have helped pay and backhanded this her doctor and exes should be able to be called in and I ask anyone who has any information about anything that they know please come forward it very important I'm a woman surevir but I can not and will not stand back and say nothing  while the innocent johnny Depp gets to go through this nightmare I don't want my child to grow up in a world like this I want them to grow up knowing what the difference in right and wrong with dignity and respect but most of all love and compassion when do we stand up strong and say enough is enough we all have a choice about what we do at least I know that I am watching the facts and not going anywhere üíñüíûüíñüíûüòáüòáü§óü§óü§óü•áüá¨üáßüëà",Michelle Trunks (shelly),0,2021-08-02T13:44:22Z

25,UgxS7c01oUZII7LA3bh4AaABAg,"I maybe crazy but I think Amber teams wants the judge to not allow any testimony in regards to Johnny or Amber being the ambusher in the relationship. Of course Amber ambushed Johnny and treated him like dirt. 

I think their latest dismissal petition is a Hail Mary to keep the abuse part of her opinion piece out and instead focus on the part of johnny using his position as an Hollywood big wig to harm her career.  

I don‚Äôt think her legal team believes the judge would dismiss the whole case. It‚Äôs a victory for them if the trail is limit in scoop. I believe hope that the judge does not put limits on the trail. This will allow the evidence out that she faked a crime scene.",Steve Kass,5,2021-07-27T19:22:34Z

27,Ugzoe3SDGXM7s-bLqtV4AaABAg,"According to the severity of her and her witness's testimony that wine bottle should have shattered. As a result there should have been a massive and irrefutable mess of wine and glass and damage to something, a major mar that couldn't be cleaned or replaced so quickly. Adding to that there is a distinct lack of lasting damage. I just see a mess. Things on the floor. Things on a neatly made bed. Writing on a bathroom mirror. No dents or cracks or breaks sustained to anything other than the bed frame. Odd, considering the level of aggression she claims took place. Why just there? Picture frame glass is easy to break. I find it convenient they are perfectly set on the bed. I also find it convenient that the wine bottle sits perfectly next to the small wine spill, and the spill looks undisturbed running in smooth streams across the floor. Where is the room wide splatter that throwing around an open bottle would have caused? The messes we see are things that are easy to clean. Either by herself or a cleaning crew. I see nothing of value or irreplaceable (like pictures) needing to be thrown away or replaced that would have indicated true loss & violence from a drunken, drugged up, angry out-of-control person had taken place. It's all just very messy and conveniently placed and very easy to clean up. Would be mighty difficult for four officers and body cam footage to miss too had it all taken place like she said.",Kelly McCool,15,2021-07-27T19:05:26Z
