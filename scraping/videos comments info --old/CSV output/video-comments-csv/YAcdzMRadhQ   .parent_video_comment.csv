2,UgzWhd-7vDXVbvOKn_l4AaABAg,"I can agree with you about the amber heard story but given the same story rounding itself about the royal families mistreatement of Diana and the constant need to fit into high standards and restricted moulds of whats considered appropriate, Meghan's story doesnt seem invalid. Woke culture comes to be just another day of taking things to extremities instead of focusing on the original ideas, colonialism does effect the way we think, especially from an Indian point of view and trying to compare betn the mindset of our parents vs ours growing in a connected global generation. Its hard to say whats the fact but the royal family is toxic and has been for years now, so the possibilites of Meghan's story having some sort of authenticity exists",Ash D,0,2021-11-16T11:19:03Z

12,UgznMl_6V5EoFasSVqt4AaABAg,"I don't know enough to speak about the women involved, but I am sorry to say the hypothesis of the speaker is based on a misunderstanding of postmodern philosophical perspectives (which are plural, not all similar in how power is viewed, mostly not binary-based or essentialist about groups, not so clearcut on roles and relations and certainly not thinking relative truth means thinking everyone is right). Neither the women nor most of the people blamed for simply accepting their testimony will have any understanding whatsoever of the history of postmodern philosophy. The misconceptions are understandable but unfortunately derive from populist stereotypes and caricatures of postmodernism by those who for whatever reason oversimplify and distort the very subtle, nuanced and highly sophisticated views of language, truth, power, identity and gender usually involved. The culture wars spoken about are linked to postmodern philosophy only to the extent that they arise within postmodernity, which is something different. Moreover, the particular concern for victims, oppression and injustice has in some postmodern contexts increased but the form these take in the video seem like a stereotype of a certain trajectories of feminist and post-colonial thinking. Ideology is not the name for a view that is wrong for being such, it's everywhere, whatever your view. And while some philosophies that are postmodern are concerned with these things, the mixing of the ideas of different thinkers and the claim that postmodernists believe education and listening are the solution to problems sounds way too modernist.",Jaco Gericke,0,2021-11-06T19:05:26Z

16,UgwnKaCRn8En4EZDqZJ4AaABAg,"There is no ""truth""! In any story, in any conversation, in any interaction between 2 people, you have the truth from A, the truth from B and what really happened, the so called ""truth"". That is because we see the world through our eyes, our experiences, and even if we are being honest we are always biased and we can alter what really happened by simply telling our version.
So, I find correct saying ""our truth"" because that makes it clear it is not a dogma, it is just your perception what happened and it might be adjusted to your reality making it a bit different from what really happened.",mikatu,1,2021-10-31T22:06:07Z

Though for some reason, only rich people can play this sad song for themselves, but it doesn't actually help any of us actually dealing with the issue.

110,UgzrpJNH6nd0bRTL0sZ4AaABAg,"Unfortunately the automatic assignment of victim/oppressor roles regardless of the evidence is not confined to the 21st century nor the US. 

In 1997 as a senior biomedical research scientist in a department at the University of Sydney, I made a complaint about the conduct of people in the department. These people being women, the women in the the university staff and legal office knew automatically who the victims were, refusing my demand for a misconduct hearing into MY alleged behaviour after I refused a bribe and a good reference if I left quietly, resulting in me being dismissed without even a kangaroo court hearing. Being a nuisance I also ended up standing trial on false criminal charges.

When I spoke to a 'hostile' witness to these matters (people knew what happened to expect of they crossed the female powers that be) and said 'I only expect you to tell the truth', I was met with the reply 'You mean your truth'.  This person was a surgeon and Master of Science candidate under my supervision so I expected him to have some attachment to the idea of objective truth. I don't recall making a reply. Just being rendered speechless.

The miscalculation on the part of my accusers was that criminal courts hear and examine actual evidence. Acting as my own lawyer, I took the star prosecution witnesses apart on the stand and was acquitted.

All the perpetrators, including the perjurers kept their jobs until the department I complained about collapsed like a house of cards a few year later. I sent the university Vice Chancellor an email: ""You see Gavin? You see what I was trying to tell you?""

185,Ugz4Y9KFXMxZRMATzIl4AaABAg,"In this video it seems that you deny the possibility of existence of victims. so that people had a choice, people have a brain etc. What about kids who suffered from the oppressor? you are just another radical thinker. On one hand are people who think that everyone who calls him/herself a ""victim"" must be a victim; on the other hand are you who think that everyone is responsible for what is happening to him, so there could be no victims in this world, because everyone has a brain. But everyone has a different brain and people have different access to the same information, some people have no access to accurate information, thus some people need to be educated about the things they were brainwashed about (not everyone is such a natural as you and can figure out all of the psychology and guidelines to life, although I doubt that you did, you just lead yourself as if you have). It doesn't mean that everyone who calls him/herself a ""victim"" is a victim. But it doesn't mean that victims in general are a plot of imagination of postmodernist society and that victims and hence oppressors don't exist at all. On the contrary all of it proves the existence of oppressors again, by pointing out that oppressors not only exist, but they also pretend to be victims in order to avoid paying for what they have done. but it seems to me that the whole point of your video is to bring everyone to conclusion that oppressors don't exist. I guess you are one of the eloquent gaslighters and wingman of the sadists, oppressors, abusers and psychopaths of this world. Try convincing psychology specialists with this. There are psychopaths and sadists/oppressors/abusers/tyrans whatever you want to call them and thus there are innocent victims; and sometimes these oppressors manage to present themselves as victims and convince society of that, leaving the real victim damaged again. And postmodernism doesn't have anything to do with the existence or non existence of psychopaths/oppressors and their victims. They existed long before the postmodernism. I think you are one of the squad. Because you are trying to use one true argument in order to prove another absolutely false argument and mislead people, something that sadist/oppressor/psychopath is up for, exactly as shown in the video.",A M,0,2021-07-22T03:55:21Z

Second: ""speak your truth"" regards to show some erased narratives troughout the history. You pointed out well how alienating this concept can be when used for manipulation, as a justification for lying.

Third: What they do is not ""using the post modernism"". The relation between good/evil exists for centuries! They just are manipulatives trying to be supported by indentity movements. And it went wrong, as you are showing. The problem is not the ""ideology"" itself, that changed for good some epistemologicals beliefs, but How this can be some easy tool of alienation by some people becausee we don't have (as a world population) well academic backgroung formation.

saddest part for me is, its not the bashing heads together out of anger, everyone has emotions even when they are fueled by misconceptions, its the knowledge that is distributed, let me explain why: almost everyone can look up the entirety of the worlds combined knowledge at all times from hier pocket and to make it more accesible it was  cut down to only its most important parts and then redistributed, those are the parts everybody learns, yet the parts that are cut, the way this knowledge was discorvered in the first place, the mistakes that were made in its discovery that can be learnt from, are all missing. with the common misconception of needing an opinion on every matter and being able to talk about it in meaningfull ways, this soon became a problem.  half-wisdom is worse than knowing nothing.",Gollum Beutlin,1,2021-07-10T15:44:22Z

OK, now I've got your attention, its not post-modernism, its Post-Structuralism or Intersectionality. Post-modernism is a general trend in art and philosophy from the 1960s onwards to reject the mantra that all our modernist architecture and ideas is an imiprovement. I think after that came Structuralism, to reject the individual and place all these meanings as being part of some over-arching structure. Finally post-structuralism rejected even the idea of a common framework (structure) of understanding, thus rejected the very idea of a universal (and common) truth. That then birthed the idea that the processes can only be understood as struggles between power brokers and their victim groups; oppressor and oppressed. Then Intersectionality or Cultural Marxism is a sweet subset of the whole post-structuralist mindset, containing just those problematic/obnoxious ideas you are highlighting.
There are many holes in that quick summary, for example, you can trace the roots of the oppressor-oppressed analysis to Marx, over 100 years earlier. But you get the idea. If anyone has better labels, please pile in!  But calling it post-modernism is not helpful :-(",Com Func,0,2021-06-25T19:42:50Z

The problem started when NARCISSISTS like Markle appropriate some of the ideas of Postmodernism to serve their own individual agenda. In typical Narc fashion, Markle created a triangulation in which, as you rightly point out, she is a helpless victim.

After I spoke, there was a brief silence. Then another seminar member replied, with the others nodding, ""But when we speak, we can only do so using language. So all we can talk about is language.""
That was when I gave up; I was a practical theologian (cf. Aristotle's phronesis) and knew I had no way to communicate with these postmodernists.

385,Ugyx41wW6fXZm1wKOBt4AaABAg,"""Postmodernism"" isn't merely a social movement concerned with relationships of power. The word also carries meaning in architecture, the arts, and the philosophies.

If I were to boil Postmodern thought into a single phrase, the Assassin's Creed motto comes to mind: ""Nothing is True. Everything is Permitted.""

To my memory, it was created as a frustrated response to the breakdown in global culture following the World Wars. Back then when people believed whatever they believed was true, right, and just - you were born to die for your country, your particular race/culture was just and superior, etc; - and then the world saw the catastrophic damage that arrogance caused, and the survivors learned the hard way that _it really wasn't that simple._ And thus postmodernism - a rejection of the idea that there is a ""right"" or a ""true"" - took root and spread to the sciences, the arts, and the humanities. It is, at its core, a rejection of surety.

Unfortunately, this rejection of surety also extended to the surety given by empirical evidence - the scientific method, too, was considered a relic of the old world's arrogance. And now we live in an era where asking for evidence of whatever you believe and expecting it from others is racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, or whatever victimhood you want to give yourself.

391,UgxunUVelPmB10SQXCJ4AaABAg,"I partially agree with the video. I think discrimination is a factor that affects most people. There is truth to the idea that anyone can potentially succeed, however, barriers do exist. I think we as a society need to address those barriers and find ways of combatting them. Cancel culture and simplistic victim versus perpetrator type thinking is not the way to do this. Blaming white men is not the way to do this.

From what I've seen both Megan and Harry have been through a horrendous ordeal. However, it is not simply on the grounds of sexism and racism. The Royal Family is an extremely strict and rigid family that greatly limits freedom. Add to this the harassment from the media constantly bashing them and yes I believe that they have both suffered a lot. Especially Harry who was not allowed to properly grieve following his mother's death. That said, I don't think this is a simple victim versus perpetrator narrative. Both Megan and Harry have acted privileged and entitled at times. They have also displayed hypocrisy in regards to the causes they've adopted. That said, I think their treatment by the press hasn't been fair and even-handed.

I haven't seen many of your videos. Perhaps you have a more nuanced view of modern feminism, however, you do seem to reduce it to hate mobs and cancel culture. Most of the feminists I know don't subscribe to this extremist worldview. I am not convinced that the whole ""blame all white men and we're all oppressed"" mentality is as common as you make out.

With Johnny Depp, I agree it was definitely a result of the flaw of the 'believe victims of r*pe' sentiment, but ultimately that thought process does way more good than harm. With JD and AH, that's a clear outlier AND it did not take long for people to see the truth and stand with JD. He is not perceived as guilty in the public's eyes whatsoever.

And it was this disconnect which resulted in their indifference towards her and her child? Especially when the royal family has had issues with members marrying Americans in the past?

Murica it means something else, but postmodernism is actually what you are doing, calling in question a grand narrative of 'J Depp being an attacker because he's a powerful, white man', that's postmodernism... it's difficult to talk about postmodernism in simple terms, but if we have to, it can be classified as a reflective and attentive reading of generalized narratives and acknowledging that they are in fact a summary of many different sides... it's saying 'it's not all black and white, it's nuanced'... if 'modern narrative' was 'murica is number one and we all know it', postmodern attitude towards that would be 'is it though? let's look at the evidence'... I'm really surprised by these blatant lies and mis qualifications of the word postmodernism... I don't know if that's accidental, i.e. lack of education, or intentional, i.e. make actual critique of 'one story truth' into something it's actually critiquing... what may be happening in murica is that a lot of retarded people read postmodernism as 'subjectifying the truth'... i.e. my truth is that I don't feel like a man, therefore I'm a woman... but that's not postmodernism... if I call myself a right-winger and don't follow any part of the right ideology, am I a right-winger? no, I am not... postmodernism isn't subjectifying the truth in sense that you can say 'all truths are valid', postmodernism says that we must always investigate to find the truth, thoroughly... postmodernism is 'let's look at all the subjective truths that brought about this 'grand narrative' and investigating how they brought it about'... on your examples - we can say victimhood game is the combination of human psychology of protecting the weak + tribalism that together bring about the massive attacks on those who are perceived as abusers - on one hand, on the other we must acknowledge the small sized informations that are given to the public i.e. lack of actual evidence that base themselves on the emotions and so on... this is a short line of what would be a postmodernist analysis... taking different scientific practices - sociology, psychology, economy and so on... and combining them to analyze the 'grand narrative'...",ivor radmiloviƒá pavlek,1,2021-05-21T20:12:35Z

They don't merely argue that capitalism is oppression but that there are cultural superstructures that keep the oppressor class in power and the oppressed, dominated. The goal is to overthrow this system through cultural subversion.

Postmodernism is the idea that there is no objective truth, only discourse, because the way to get to the truth is tainted by language.

If you mix those two ideologies and use an ""intersectional"" framework (men oppressors, women oppressed, whites oppressors, POC oppressed etc...), you have ""wokeness"". The first woke ideology to gain mainstream acceptance was feminism (2nd wave onward). Here, men take the place of the capitalist class, women the proletariat and the cultural superstructure is the ""patriarchy"".

Maybe she is playing the victimhood card but there is a difference between what Amber Heard did and Meghan Markle's interview.

furthermore, that's why i think this counter to postmodern feminism is oftentimes flawed. the goal is to look at these hairy situations and not immediately draw a conclusion, but many hypocritically end up victim-blaming instead. 

i definitely see your point overall. we do need to think critically about these situations, but i would argue a historical lens adds context. of course, we shouldn't vilify anyone until there is a court decision or solid evidence. for example, we know that diana did not have the royal institution on her side and that she struggled with depression. we also know that harry is wary of the royal institution/ didn't really want to be a royal, and would likely have partner that didn't fit into the royal mold either. it makes sense. so with this context, but also knowing that meghan exaggerated some points, we can't really make a solid conclusion! and it's not like the royal family is truly suffering at the expense of her words. not everybody has to be a villain or oppressed. who knows what's happening with them at the end of the day. definitely not us.",hobiwankenobi,17,2021-05-21T05:31:19Z

465,Ugz2C1DCsWCe5ITyxBh4AaABAg,"While I agree with your views, they are also pretty idealistic. Being a brown woman like you, there is nothing I would like more than being judged on the basis of my personality and my skills only. But, in order for people to be able to judge in a fair manner i.e,  on the basis of your skills and competency, that can only be possible if there are equal opportunities present in the world for all. It is also only possible when there is no sexism, racism, homophobia, ableism, ageism, etc. *People can only judge other people on more practical grounds when social barriers are not hindering their objectivity and judgement, and not teaching them what to think and how to think it, even before they actually communicate with the individual concerned*. Judging people on there individuality would only be possible, if we didn't have internalized preconceived notions about a person's capabilities based on their colour, sexuality etc. - notions which are instilled in us be society. And yes, it doesn't mean that white people=bad, straight people=bad, men=bad - it just means that the oppressed communities (and we know which communities are oppressed) are mostly the ones bearing the brunt of the fact that people judge others on superficial criteria rather than real ones. *Of course, I am ashamed of people who take very real experiences and problems of the oppressed communities and use it to their advantage*. I am disgusted by it. Doesn't change the fact that poc, women, people belonging to the LGBTQIA+ communities are the ones at the receiving end of the negativity that these stereotypes generate, way more often than the oppressors.
Also, of course every individual should work hard, and not feel entitled to certain things only on the basis of the fact that they belong to an oppressed community. They should earn it. EVERYONE SHOULD EARN IT, AND PROVE THEIR POTENTIAL. It just so happens that the traditionally oppressive communities have better access to the means required to explore and prove themselves than, say, a black transgender woman. Hope I didn't offend anyone. This is just my opinion.

(P.S- I just wanna make it clear, that I am speaking in general terms, in terms of the less fortunate COMMUNITIES. Meghan may be of mixed race, but I do know that she is a beautiful, heterosexual female, with reasonably well to do background, and could afford the means required to prove her potential to the world more than the less fortunate people of colour. She may not be privileged like a white person, but when compared to other people of color, she was more privileged than many of them).",This'll do,0,2021-05-18T15:44:44Z

Playing the ""I'm a minority, so I can't possibly be at fault and anyone who disagrees with me is a bad person"" card is only going to make things worse.

It's frustrating that the people who constantly preach about equality and political correctness are too myopic to realize the hypocrisy and inanity of assuming that individuals who are white, male and straight are both the only ones capable of doing wrong and are always to blame whenever they're part of the conflict.

We finally agree that bigotry is a bad thing, but we're never going to truly evolve beyond prejudices as long as people keep submitting to the mentality that everyone who disagrees with them is wrong and deserves to suffer or die for their different viewpoint.",GoliathGrowler,0,2021-05-18T12:42:47Z

So a very old fashioned monarchy is accused of having some racism within it. Is that REALLY outside the realm of possibility? I think it would be unfair to accuse me of being a so called post modernist for thinking that.
I don't see any motive for Meghan lying about that. I know you mentioned this victim or oppressor mentality, but do you really think this mixed race woman would actually be seen as an oppressor? I personally think it takes a lot of courage to speak out when you see something wrong, especially if you are speaking out against someone so powerful. I'm shocked at the amount of people who are lashing out at her for speaking out against racism. 

Meghan was also saying things about feeling isolated and lonely. Is that a shock to lots of people? I'm sure the majority of people would agree with me that money doesn't necessarily bring you hippieness, so why would people think that this is untrue in Meghans case? 

I think that people are so obsessed with the idea of the royal family, that the thought of them not being perfect human beings conflicts with view of reality. That's why yall are lashing out.

Your whole point undercuts and downplays what she is facing and what we can all see what is happening. The way that the press in the UK portrays Megan verse how they describe kate is vastly different; they demonize Megan's every action while treating Kate as a helpless victim. For much of history, YT women have been the victims and the black women the aggressor, and anyone who says otherwise is vilified. Often those same poor YT women have to use this victimhood to justify their horrible actions of discrimination and hate or to shift their blame on another as the villain and Amber heard did, as Kate does to Megan, or as was done to the scores of people who have been in the hot seat so to speak for opposing or just existing in a pace that YT women feel they shouldn't. You have scores of people in your comments who have said a thing about how race isn't everything, and that because Megan is calling out the BS as it is that she's a narcissist, none of the people of color and all of it has an undertone of racism that is so obvious to me. Your so-called research into the whole situation about the British royal family has a level of bias and color blindness that I am not so shocked about. To say it is not about race but on Megan's Narcissism is a whole new level of denial and victim-blaming that I have ever seen. While thought out your video is, where you fall short is the denial of the racism and discrimination that Megan has and is facing.

659,Ugw6teigx4Dgq5kJabh4AaABAg,"I do think it comes from some places of logic, like it isn't really possible for the majority to ""work hard"" and then become ""successful"", successful objectively will always require some people to be not-successful, just like being rich will require a majority of people to have less money/be poor. So it's not really possible for everyone to become successful to begin with, same with rich, since it is restricted to only some. 
I do agree with some of your points, I too dislike the ""this side against that side"" narrative, the ""being judged by everything besides the contents of your character"" is probably also the biggest qualm I have with post-modernisme, it just comes across as very racists and sexistic to me.

But I will argue that there is a point in criticising a system that is inheriently unfair and doesn't support the individual, making it impossible for an individual to reach their full potential through growth, and I do disagree with the last statements, an individual making the best of their situation shouldn't really be something we should strive for either, if the ""best of their situation"" is shit, asking them to not complain to a system which is based upon these unfairnesses, and learning lessons which will do nothing besides just show them how powerless they are in this system, is to me a bit counter-intuitive. 

And successful people SHOULD feel guilty, it is seldom just 1 person that is responsible for becoming successful, why does 1 person deserve 30 million a year? what service do they themselves solely provide? If anything they were the first to ask for their buisnesses to open up again, so they could start making revinue, since they themselves don't ""make"" or ""earn"" the money anymore (few exceptions), but the fact is most ""successful"" people are successful on the basis of a lot of people's hard work, not just themselves, but since success can't be given to everyones, and money too can't be distributed equally (else inflation would make it impossible for someone to own more than someone else) the system itself facilitates this sort of unfairness. (this is mostly america fyi, but applies pretty broadly to other countries as well) But if someone could tell me what 1 person provides to society, which justifies this sort of wealth that would be great. Monarch themselves have been somewhat forced into public roles, to justify the wealth they are given, since if we do look at it, we will always see it as what it is. (unjust)

So to conclude:
My problem isn't necessarily where the people are coming from, but more where they direct these feelings towards. It isn't a class-discussiong we're having (which is definetly should if you ask me) but rather a race-sex discussion, superficial really, which doesn't do anything in actually highlighting the problem, and are so wage and frustrating in trying to grasp, because being oppressed isn't a given just because you have a specific sex/race/preference, but it has much more to do with your contents and status. 

So yes, there is oppression (unfairness), but the way of actually facilitating discussion on this subject is gone about in a wrong way, first by seperating into an american way of thinking, which is the 2 party system, either you're rep or dem, aka. either you're for or against, there is no ""discussion"" to be had at all, there isn't even an attempt at it, instead one group will directly attack another group for aestetic reasons (be they white/male/straight) and place the blame on such superficial things, forgetting that the ""class"" might very well be shared between the two parties. 

But my guess is that it's so indoctrinated in americans that you deserve what you have, and those who have more than you deserve it, so a discussion on money and wealth is often just circumvented (you're just jelouse etc.) is an easy rebuke, but it ignores the context of wealth, as I stated before, you can't be wealth if some people aren't poor. But if the discussion actually changed to be about wealth instead of ""race/gender/etc."" then actual policies could be looked at, not just ""prejudices"" which needs to be solved, and a move from trying to de-platform people because they have another opinion than you, towards a move where you can speak in open dialogue and try to convince people would in my opinion be best.

But the whole ""I'm a victim because I belong to this group of physical traits"" is a bit stupid in my book, sure there are def' cultural norms and prejudices that can and should be changed, but this is not where the problem lies, and it isn't ""fixed"" by silencing other voices just because they say something different, it's like an attempt at creating an echo-chamber on a world-wide scale, and we won't develop or improve as humans if this ever happens.

Foucault (and his ideas that gave way to postmoderism); never stated that the primary culture sought to devour/oppress the counter-cultures. They simply are; and we being products of them. The funny thing is that a counter-culture cannot survive without the primary; it will simply devour itself and fracture.

Postmodernism is a philosophy that puts an end to the great or overarching stories of the modern (until 1980's more or less) world, so it goes against philosophies like marxism. It argues that there is no one true story or knowledge and that all truth comes out from a certain cultural/social perspective. Basically the ultimate ideology of subjectivity.

But I can see others dismissing you for that early on. Post-modernism is the thing that creates the oppression/oppressor paradox you say? I wouldn't say that. While true, post-modernism is a big problem that deals with a lot of these issues, like critical race theory here, ultimately this sort of thinking came from various marxist schools of thoughts, about class warfare, and everything can be broken into these large groups vying for power. Then applied to other cultural things, like sex, gender, norms, etc, aka, cultural marxism.

Some people hate that term there, and then obfuscate that word and then try to dismiss it as some false conspiracy. But cultural marxism is no such thing, and it is a big problem. And I believe that was the word you were looking for in all of this. There are more specific ones for specific gender or race issues, but that is the overarching one. Postmodernism is related, and is perhaps a subcategory, seeking to dismiss all history and remove all objective value to things, so they can redefine them further, but that isn't the direct causal relationship here to believing the victim mentality.",The Doom From Latveria,0,2021-05-02T07:54:50Z

In fact, I'd say it's a perfect storm for a massive backlash - and not just against postmodernism/SJW/woke BS. Those movements that have latched on to it to suck power, like third wave feminism, are also going to be hit hard. 

I see this reaction growing everywhere I look - it's really about personal responsibility. Individual people looking for meaning and finding it in service to others and their communities. There are millions of us. And once we've ""cleaned up our rooms"", we start demanding better from our politicians and other leaders. 

Any system that treats Heard and Markle as innocent martyrs and helpless victims, must be near collapse for one simple reason - it can't tell the real from the unreal. And when you follow an ideology that is unconnected to actual, real world repercussions, you're going to walk over a cliff.

I hope you're not going to explain this as a post modern view of history and say India is wallowing in victimhood and being colonised by whites was the best thing that happened to India. Second, your knowledge of post modernism is pathetically flawed. It's a serious philosophy but you'll never know that will you?  You actually deride it and use it to describe Meghan or Amber Heard's narratives. The BRF is white as can be. Is it too far fetched to believe they treated Meghan differently? And I'm no fan of Meg's.  As for Amber, she played the system and it's a pity because there are so many women in abusive relationships who just can't escape. Your own world view is Neo conservatism in which people don't experience poverty or racism or misogyny. And if they do, it's their fault.

when i got a job at a law firm we got a new female manager..... she would follow me into the bathroom when i needed it and tell me if i wasn't done in 30 seconds she would be allowed her way......unfortunately she acted upon this and ....... when i told my boss she stood by my manager and i was told by the manager that if i didn't play along she would tell everyone ... i S assulted her... it was at that point i needed to start wearing a hidden camera....... a few months later she did what she said when i resisted and i was fired on the spot, the day after i got a hold of my boss and showed them the video of my entire week and all the things i went through......... my boss told me i had edited the video... when i finally convinced her i still didn't get my job back nor was the manager punished, when i went to police i got the same answer my boss gave and was told that i had already been reported to be on the watch list. thankfully a month later it was all disproven but nothing happened to the manager....... in the end i got nothing but a clean record which i would have had anyway if she hadn't done these things......... the manager got a promotion ........and to this day maintains i did...... awful things ......even though she was the one who did them to me.

Rich entitled people are never a concern of mine.  I spend my time and efforts working with those less fortunate who need a helping hand and whose names are never known.  That said, I think your assessment is a bit skewed.  Your perception of ""postmodernism"" is highly coloured by your assumption and assertion that ""fairness"" actually exists in the Western world.  It doesn't and that's a fact of both history and reality, not the idealism associated with fairness. 

In the particular case of Meghan Markle, I don't see her as a victim at all.  I see her as someone who sought to change an institution all by herself that's over 1,500 years old and could give a damn about her or what she thinks.  This also, in my view and I'm Black, is not about race in its totality as much as it was about power and the optics of having a not so white child as a part of the British Royal Family.  The British Royals have always been more concerned with power and the perception of them as an institution before anything else.

From the perspective of those who were conquered by the British Empire and live in British society as a non-white member race plays a huge factor.  In the case of Meghan Markle, she married into the family and started complaining right away when it was clear to many white Brits that this entire marriage and relationship with the Royal's was not going to go very well for her.  Google the interview with John Oliver on one of the American late-night talk shows when he was asked about the impending marriage and he provided the perfect answer. 

Simply put this entire situation is nuanced, complicated and about a number of things but fairness, as it relates to your assertion about cancel culture and postmodernism, has very little to do with this when you look deeper at the situation.

1029,Ugw7jOQltOpBBePxZ1l4AaABAg,"I learned about Postmodernism in a Worldview class while homeschooled 10 years ago, before the rise of wokeness had been fully realized. In those days, I quickly realized that Postmodernism is my natural enemy. It is the philosophy of chaos, the belief that belief is all that exists, the science of no science, the logic of no logic. Everything is relative, and therefore your narrative is just as valid than anyone else's. As a seeker of truth, a lover of logic, a boy who loved to debate, and a man of science, this philosophy represented everything that I can't accept as anything more than excuses, technicalities and semantics, and that was when they were actually doing Postmodernism right. Nowadays, Postmodernism has become an excuse for why ""your truth"" is not only just as valid, but in fact, for why it is *more* valid if you fall under certain categories. If you're female, non-white, and/or non-straight, your truth is automatically more valid than someone who has fewer of these categories regardless of logical or scientific evidence. In other words, your truth is just as valid as everyone else's... but not as valid as people who are non-binary, black, lesbian, etc. 

It reminds me of the quote from Animal Farm which was originally intended to criticize communism in practice: ""All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others."" That is what Postmodernism has become, and as a result, it's even more my natural enemy than it was before. ...And I say that as someone who happens to have a check on the ""bisexual"" box.",themesongfan,0,2021-04-19T14:30:18Z

However, i do not think that the Royal Family is entirely innocent and perfect. We also have a similar complaint coming from Princess Diana (RIP) about their cold behavior towards her mental state postpartum. To me, it is very possible that the Royal Family is at fault, too. And in fact, we do have other proof that they are not innocent but those are for another discussion (because it doesn't relate to this instance). I think the truth is somewhere in the middle. I personally do not rush to call or label Meghan Markle a narcissist or an evil person. I do not have proof for that, i do not know her personally. The fact that she lied/exaggerated when it comes to her son's title isn't necessarily an indicator of bad intentions or narcissism. She may be desperate to defend herself and show the world that the Royal Family isn't formed of saints and this prompted her to exaggerate her circumstances. It is a bad thing, a grave mistake from her part, but it isn't enough to conclude that she is evil or narcissistic. Yes, i agree that she seems to be adhering to this ""woke culture"" thing and i personally think it is toxic too.
Also, we gotta keep in mind that we do not know any member of the Royal Family on a personal level. We only know what is being shown to us, and they are very well trained for that. I always see comparisons with Kate Middleton, but the fact that she looks and behaves to perfectly in public and on camera only makes me think that she is very good at putting up an act and holding stuff in. It makes me think about my childhood experience with my cousin - she was seemingly so quiet and a good child, never complaining or crying about anything and i was very sincere and didn't hide my frustration in public - and i got compared to her and criticised because people didn't know how my cousin was actually. She was just putting up a front and when you got to know her personally, she was quite an ""evil"" child and loved to see me suffer. I remember her grinning every time people would comment how quite she was and how ""out of control"" i was just because i was crying sometimes.",Emma Popescu,0,2021-04-18T09:58:17Z

1142,UgxJkyUmT3oSj2vBSyp4AaABAg,"The claims about postmodernism in this video are either flat out wrong, or not even wrong. Postmodernism rejects the victim & oppressor binary as claimed in this video. Postmodernism wholesale rejects black & white thinking and doesn't engage in it. Postmodernism is practically the furthest thing from black & white thinking. Postmodernists are very critical of identity politics that's discussed in this video. They view organizing around an identity as a limit on how one can express themselves and that it's dangerous, as identity categories/politics forces people into preconceived notions of how a person of some identity should be in accordance with perceptions of that identity. Postmodernists view identity categories/politics as harmful and as a tool for control which limits how one expresses themselves in better ways. Postmodernism is more about tearing down these concepts of identity and binary thinking.

To put it simply. Postmodernists view identity politics as promoting a victim-mentality and that the victim-mentality is harmful. Postmodernism sees identity politics and safe spaces as an abomination that needs to be disrupted and/or stopped. It's also not really an ideology. It seems like this video got its information about postmodernism from Jordan Peterson. Peterson doesn't really understand postmodernism. The ironic thing about Peterson is he seems to be totally oblivious that he comes off as a sounding like a postmodernist half the time. 

What's being described in this video is more in line Essentialism, not postmodernism. I think it's unfortunate when postmodernism is described as something it's not. Postmodernism can be difficult to understand, but if anyone is interested in what postmodernism actually is I'd suggest checking out the book ""Postmodernism: A Very Short Introduction."" It explains the basics of postmodernism in a straightforward way.",bIametheniIe,1,2021-04-16T12:48:36Z

1149,UgxPJIY71SACX3cyqgx4AaABAg,"I think postmodernism can in many cases actually make sense when speaking purely about groups. That is probably also the intent of the original thinkers behind this philosophy. F.e., is there a power dynamic between fathers and sons? Well technically yes. Is there a power dynamic in trade relations between countries (even if both benefit)? Again, yes there is. And is there a power dynamic between different groups within a society that have clashing interests? Yes. There are countless power dynamics between individuals, social groups and entire societies/countries. 

But what do you do with this information? Does the fact that there is a power dynamic between father and son mean that parenting is literally oppression? No. It can be oppression, but a power dynamic is not inherently oppression. And to go even further, does this mean that the son, should he put on a show of victimhood, is always correct or ""his truth"" is valid without exception? Of course not. 

I feel like the general populace, who aren't philosophers, take on postmodernism without actually understanding it and apply it to just about everything. Yes, we can define many elements of society as a power dynamic. But the real question is what do we do with this information? And how do we interpret that information? Your typical woke person doesn't have a clue and they come to absolutist conclusions like ""there is a power dynamic between group X and Y, therefore all individuals within group X are oppressed by all individuals of group Y"". Reality doesn't work like that. Postmodernism is an interesting philosophy and has its merits, but some people corrupt it and take it to extreme levels.",Regis,43,2021-04-16T10:25:56Z

In its most base form, it would never do that and anyone with two brain-cells to rub together can see that.  ""Post Modernism"" exists PURELY to allow people to bully other people based upon perceived or imagined slights.  It exists PURELY to get a mob to take down your enemies for you.  It is ""policing your thoughts"" at its finest.  It is fascism at its most pure and undiluted.  ""Do what I say, or I will get the mob to destroy you"".  ""If you anger me, I will get the mob to destroy you"".  It was created as a tyranny.  A dictatorship.  It exists solely for that reason.  It exists so people in power can keep their power and so people who can't figure out how to take charge of their own lives can feel like they've won something and accomplished something.

It is also dangerous.

It is starting a trend where people are beginning to doubt every single victim.  That is, ""What did the victim do to deserve it?"" and ""Is the victim lying?"".

I do agree that there is deep connections between these awful and essentially narcissistic trends to postmodernism, but to present postmodernism as a power system by which there is one clear oppressors and a parallel clear oppressed is to attack a very caricature type of social thinking, that sadly is prominent today.

However Postmodernism shouldn‚Äôt be view as a value based worldview but as a descriptive approach towards our basic and fundamental way of looking and understanding the world. We lost the old, great and universal values. That‚Äôs just a fact. It‚Äôs not only that we are selves not believing those anymore, we have a readymade understanding for those poor souls who still allegedly do. 
These narcissistic trends comes up as way to approach that problem, unfortunately in an awful way, but depicting postmodernism like that seems to avoid the fundamental problem we should address: how to stabilize a value system when we can‚Äôt sustains definite values.

1189,Ugx0iRTET7PMd2VBdkN4AaABAg,"I agree with your analysis in this video, I'm not sure I agree with the label post-modernism. While it has some relation to the ideological characteristics you describe, in my opinion, post-modernism is more of an umbrella term that encompasses this ideology in addition to others (neo-liberalism I would also consider a post-modernist political ideology for example). The most important characteristic of post-modernism is the notion that the grand meta-narratives that governed human society in the pre-modern and modern era had finally been disrupted to the breaking point by human progress and, probably more importantly, unimaginable devastation from war. Modernity is characterized in this conception as defined by scientific and political narratives that were totalist in nature (everyone wears the same uniform, everyone adheres to a political ideology that explains and affects every aspect of human experience). Post-Modernity is the opposite, our meta-narratives are scattered around on the ground in pieces, it is up to individuals to pick those various pieces off the ground, and try to cobble together some form of meaning from them, a mosaic of narratives, some perhaps even contradictory, that can help us make sense of the world and our place in it. 

The ideology you are describing has a bit of a naming convention problem. I think the right essentially calls this ""cultural marxism,"" the idea that marxist notions of class conflict are essentially being transformed and weaponized to degrade and eventually subvert American values until that socio-political order can be overturned completely, but academics and the left tend to consider this a conspiracy theory or political narrative. The academic label commonly used for this might be neo-marxism, which is an umbrella term but basically dealt with the failings of the Stalinism and the fact that early orthodox marxism didn't have much to say on the subject of colonialism or race (although Russian thinkers like Lenin and Trotsky did develop some ideas on this issue). 

I can understand why Peterson sometimes uses the label post-modernism to describe this stuff, the term Marxism is politically loaded, it makes woke culture sound like some Cold War struggle with the Soviets or an American partisan issue, and Marxism itself is about as modernist a political ideology as it gets, so it can be confusing. But it seems to me we might need an entirely new label for this ideology aside from ""SJW, Woke, Neo-Marxist, Cultural Marxist, Post-Modern etc."" Everyone is using different terms to describe basically the same thing, and most of these terms are either too vague or too specific.",Joseph Thomason,0,2021-04-15T14:35:58Z

Postmodernists or any ideologues who do not think for themselves are brainwashed sheeple who are anything but ‚Äúwoke‚Äú.

The tabloids created so much. They as a couple were united on the mental Health issues created in their world by the racism and  the relentless British tabloids and their lies and cruelty. Yes the most powerful family in the world would not help Megan and Harry with there inability to cope.  If you actually listen to the interview the issue around their son Archie was expanded into Archie would not be titled and therefor not entitled to security.  Security was the big issue of concern as there are extreme expenses associated with security.   Amber Herd and Johnny Depp‚Äôs scenario is a he said she said situation and not at all the same for comparison. The go fund me account for Megan and Harry is completely unnecessary as the couple have money. Again Harry pronounced in the interview that his inheritance from his mother‚Äôs estate took care their home in Montecito, CA. They have money so what‚Äôs up with thego fund me account for the couple. Harry just got a job in Silicon  Valley and a Netflix deal.

1263,UgzV6wEy2XXD02nZ_ex4AaABAg,"As far as I've learnt about post modernism in my philosophy studies, Postmodernism has its place. It shifts the perspective towards oppressive structures. Postmodernism exists in the same vein as Post Colonialism. It is an epistomological strand of philosophy that offers a skeptic perspective on construct of the era of modernity. The claim that there is no objective truth is one as old as philosophy itself that nobody has been able to fully proof or debunk. Every science and so philosophy is simply trying to approximate truth and so Postmodernism has a valid claim in the assumption that truth is always relative.
Nevertheless, depending on your philosophical perspective, Postmodernism has its problems but no philosophy is without criticism.

But! As with many philosophical constructs it is easily taken the wrong way. Postmodernism as school of thinking is not the problem but rather what conclusions people made from these ideas in regards to everyday life.

We are not interested in the good of others; we are interested solely in power, pure power. What pure power means you will understand presently. We are different from the oligarchies of the past in that we know what we are doing. All the others, even those who resembled ourselves, were cowards and hypocrites. The German Nazis and the Russian Communists came very close to us in their methods, but they never had the courage to recognize their own motives. They pretended, perhaps they even believed, that they had seized power unwillingly and for a limited time, and that just around the corner there lay a paradise where human beings would be free and equal. We are not like that. We know that no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it. Power is not a means; it is an end. One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution; one makes the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship. The object of persecution is persecution.

The irony of these Markle and her husband of touting themselves as compassionate and woke is that her husband once wore a N*zi costume as a fancy dress and never apologized for it face to face with public and let his family PR handle it for him( i think the most racist or problematic thing one can accuse the institution as a whole not the individual of Royal in UK is their willingness to put problematic actions under the carpet for their image. I can believe say William and Anne are bad people but they are part of the family which protected Harry when he used slurs against his Pakistani colleagues in the army.)
 Markle also claims to be a feminist while also has no compunction to throw Kate Middleton under the bus by claiming she made her cry while also being coy about who allegedly said racist things to do her ( this is after in Finding Freedom book her husband tried to snatch Middleton's achievement about mental health awareness with her joint charity with husband William and Harry according to Omid Scobie). Americans might be believing her lies wholesale but saner people who can fact checked won't. Actual victim of suicide ideation, depression and racism do not need to embellish their ""truths"" with lies after lies because some part of them never believes that they are being smooth about their lies.

I like your content and don't want you to go down this rabbit hole of folk (armchair) ""sociologists"" with their ""postmodernism is ultimate evil"" crap. Postmodernism is not an ideology, it isn't a religion, neither it is some kind cultural structure or whatever. Just like modernism (of which POST-modernism is a critique), romanticism or classicism, it is an umbrella term of a number of philosophical and artistic views and concepts that constitute an analysis of current and prior structures and artistic movements. Humanism is a critique of classicism, modernism is a critique of realism, postmodernism is a critique of modernism.

These artistic and philosophical movements aren't something that makes someone do something, or think a certain way, or anything of the sort, it doesn't teach us anything. These concepts are not prescriptive, they're descriptive, they're created by analizing trends, not creating them. No one goes and checks if their views align with some kind of pattern postmodernism dictates, it's not how it works, if anything it's the opposite. 

Pointing fingers at these structures is like blaming economic statistics for making people poor. Society didn't recognize value of individual's personal virtues because some kind of council of humanist sages told them to. And no, ""postmodernism"" doesn't say anything about progressive stack and has no opinion on power dynamics. That's actually *modernist* perspective (see Marxism). This notion of ""victim-oppressor"" dynamic being the only possible one predates postmodernism by a hundred years at least, what changed now is that advent of free access to information allowed these purely philosophical and scientific concepts to leak out into public sphere and infect infinitely more complex issues such as interpersonal relationship. 

I know from context what you meant, but it's a slippery slope, I know it from experience. There's a very limited discourse where using terms like postmodernism is even applicable, chiefly artistic critique, it also can be used in context of sociology, but to a very limited extent. What you're describing is a social trend. I know various ""journalists"" and ""social analysts"" absolutely love throwing terms like this around - they get a chubby from using big smarty-pants words and proceed to do a wee bit of mental masturbation. After all, they got they somehow managed to half-ass their degree in some shit courses led by ""women studies"" professor and they earned the right to use these big words. But they're using it very, very wrong, and you don't really need to be a major in philosophy/artistic critique to know it, a visit to wikipedia is quite enough.

It arose from people too guilty to accept that communism killed millions of people in the 20th century. So they created this new verbal entourage to justify ideas that are essentially Marxist. Marx, who essentially saw society, history, sociology, human relationships, and virtually all of humanities as NOTHING but a powerplay between the classes. There is absolutely nothing well-intentioned in postmodernism. It is a flawed, disgusting ideology at its very core, and it has escaped the attention of the general public because of the tactics the postmodernists have used. Using art, culture, media, all the things that are usually secondary in a person's list of concerns over things like family, survival, protection from violence, etc. I can talk more about this if you want, but yes, it's generous of you to assume that any bit of post-modernism was ever well-intentioned. Since its inception, it has been nothing but a faith system to validate narcissists. The solution is reclaiming individual autonomy, national sovereignty and raising awareness among the masses about which ideology it ACTUALLY is that is playing with their minds for nothing but power, because that's all post-modernists see.",Cheshta Sagar,0,2021-04-14T08:19:54Z

I still remember my younger siblings singing ""We are all the same, two eyes, two ears"" at school's fair. I was taught to judge people on their behaviour and not on their appearance, and that's something I still do today. Behave like a complete dick, and no matter your skin colour or beliefs, don't expect me to appreciate you.

So when I see these people coming and yelling my behaviour is racist because ""You make these people's realities invisible and don't acknowledge them, you don't take their race into account"", I feel really confused....
The same people calling out racism towards ""minorities"" (I don't like this word) actually yell at white people to shut the F up, because their voices don't matter... I remember seeing a thread on Twitter with so-called ""woke"" people calling out and insulting Caucasian girls because they wore the traditional Korean hanbok to visit Gyeongbok palace in Seoul, Korea, denouncing ""those f*cking white people who do cultural appropriation""....
I'm no genius, but I was always told that saying ""You can't do/say this because you're (insert skin colour)"", that's racist...

I'm a teacher, and like any teacher in this world, I came across difficult situation involving children (violence, insults, misbehaving, not respecting adults or other kids). My job here is to punish pupils who misbehave, and I admit : I hate it when a kid I punished because of a bad behaviour calls me a racist, because he/she happens to be black/muslim/... I hate it because these kids will never learn self-reflection and understand their mistakes, they will always have this newfound excuse of ""I am punished because of my skin colour"". They will grow into adults who would think everything bad happening to them is because of their origins or religious beliefs, etc... and not because they, maybe, did something wrong...

So yeah. I'm mad at this new ""Justice League"" claiming to fight against discriminations and racism, when they actually use the same codes as ""official"" racists themselves, but reversed...

I like Harry very much, but it was extremely insensitive to launch that interview when Pricipe Philip was in the hospital ... I bet he must be very sorry!

Very disloyal ...
Meghan, at this point, must be suffering for not having gone with him to England and not having control over him while he is there ...

1356,UgyQ1Hp7qx65lbdn8mV4AaABAg,"As an 18 year old, I'm really worried about the future. I feel like post modernism is only just starting to take its roots and that things will get even worse in the future, as my generation has almost universally accepted this approach as the right way to see things and live their lives (sadly data backs that up). I've lost friends because of disagreements I'd had with them, and this is something that shouldn't happen. I should be able to befriend people who think differently than I do, but it seems like this is actively discouraged by today's society, and that only increases internal divisions and polarizes us based on mundane and often unimportant disagreements and views. People have stopped agreeing on the facts - and that's what's so dangerous. When they get their information from biased sources and don't even attempt to exert judgment or independent, critical thinking, they believe that anyone who disagrees with them must be a bad, bigoted person. But media is a whole other issue that I won't get into here. 

I'm not even a right-winger, I consider myself to be a left-leaning centrist and I have still lost friends who subscribe to the woke mob's definition of how things should be. Sometimes I think maybe I'm better off without them, but that is a wrong approach too. They aren't inherently bad people, they just think differently than me and I accept that - as long as we're basing our disagreements on the clear, true and objective facts. But that's not what happens anymore. Wokeism calls for everyone to submit to the collectivist hive mind and discourages people from voicing their actual opinions for fear of societal neglect.

1375,Ugw-NYKvVkHkVQJCv7Z4AaABAg,"Good Analysis, but I see little connection with post modernism. Yes, post modernism analyses systems of power, but that's all it does, it explicitly does not take sides because it does not believe in ""outdated"" and ""naive"" notions of ""justice"" and ""wrong"" and ""right"" or ""truth"", relegating these notions to merely be structural creations of said systems and your position in them.

Like you say, postmodernists believe that people are essentially just constructs of history and society, this means that there's no ""wrong"" or ""right"", there's just new socially constructed moulds or roles to fall into. Saying that one can ""break out"" of this ""brainwishing"" and have an objective picture of the situation, so as to be able to see the true ""right"" or ""wrong"", which is what wokism is about, is explicitly anti-postmodernist.


I think the effects of postmodernism and wokism are pretty terrible, in that they've pacified ""the left"" or misdirected growing anger, but they  very clearly have contradictory ways of doing so. Wokism may share some tenets with postmodernism, but it denies its main tenet that says that such systems of power CANNOT be broken out of. By definition, if the individual is a construction of society, then you can not ever break out of that, because there is nothing more. All you can do is play another role. Relative truth is something that directly follows from this. Anyone who truly believes in relative truth, as postmodernists do, cannot, by definition, believe that their truth is more ""right"" than another persons. So it follow then that postmodernists cannot use their truth as a basis to overrule or fight against anyone else's truth. Doing so  would be to explicitly dismiss the primary tenets of postmodernist moral relativism that create relative truth.

But honestly, I'm not surprised that you're confusing these things. I mean, Jordan Peterson is far far worse in this regard, and he's paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to talk about these topics! Perhaps the closest you could get is to say that wokism is a paradoxical version of postmodernism that is created by bringing in ideas that are entirely contradictory to postmodernism.",MassDefibrillator,0,2021-04-12T09:11:17Z

1380,UgyLJW0AXY4gmtn_1N54AaABAg,"Ok, Ms. Baggage Lady, first of all: That is NOT what postmodernism is, you are GROSSLY misrepresenting what that philosophy is in order to use it as a bludgeon against people you don't like, and to make yourself sound smart to people who don't understand it. This is blatant misinformation, meant to give people fancy-sounding words to misuse so they can feel ""educated"" because they watched a youtube video that confirms their biases. Not only are you effectively lying to your audience, but you are doing it in such a predictable way that I LITERALLY, I repeat, LITERALLY said ""this sounds like some Jordan Peterson shit, I'll bet that's what her research was"" several minutes before you showed his face on the screen. You didn't do research or seek education, you guzzled propaganda from a snake oil salesman, and it shows.

2nd of All: Stop listening to Jordan Peterson. For real. He is an intellectual fraud, a blatant liar, and overwhelmingly hated in the academic community because he spreads misinformation that ends up creating people like you who substitute a feel-good-pep-talk for an education. He is literally not qualified to speak about 80% of the things he speaks about. He is an average psychologist with decent self-help advice, and nothing more. He does not have a degree in philosophy, economics or sociology, yet he constantly portrays himself as an authority on those subjects because it attracts people who want to hear a smart-sounding person tell them what they already think in more flowery language. Every time he has been matched up against another expert on the debate floor he has been completely steamrolled by them. A philosophy 101 class is literally all it would take to know enough to realize that he is lying to you.

3rd of All: I'm not going to sit here and type out a  philosophy lesson, but in an EXTREMELY simplified sense, modernism was a belief where things were objective (or that objective truths could be discovered) and that A leads to B leads to C in science, society, history, etc, 100% of the time. Things were universal and were always true. (Marxism is a modernist philosophy, because it believed in a set-in-stone truth). Then came postmodernism, which rejected that, and believes that there are so many factors and variables to the human experience and to understanding logic that there is no universal truth, no objective reality that fits 100% of everyone in the world all the time, and devotes much of it's goals to understanding how all these variables can form different results/ideas for different people. This inherently comes with regularly criticizing power structures and hierarchies, because it is precisely those things that try to enforce the idea of ""objective"" truths. In a cuter explanation, modernists look at a blob of cookie dough and obsess over finding the perfect cookie cutter shape to make the ""correct/true"" cookie. Postmodernists just want to tear off chunks of dough and study why each cookie looks slightly different, and they inherently don't like people telling them that all the cookies should look the same, which is something only an overbearing authority figure would try to enforce. Jordan Peterson's catch phrase ""Post Modern Neo-Marxist"" is meaningless word salad. It's like calling something a vegetarian steak. You can't be modernist (marxism) and postmodernist at the same time. 

4th of All: ""Speak your truth"" is just an annoying liberal catch phrase. It has NOTHING to do with postmodernism or philosophy in general. I guarantee you that 99% of the people who use that phrase don't have a single clue what postmodernism means nor do they describe themselves as postmodernists. It's just sort of supposed to be some ""you go girl"" type of expression meant to encourage people from disenfranchised groups to speak up more. I suppose you could argue that it has a postmodernist spirit to it, but that's not at all what it's about. 

5th of All: Good god I don't give a flying shit about the royal family or any other gossip pop-drama bullshit, but a shitty woman trying to play victim (which amber heard certainly is, but I don't give a fuck about the other lady), isn't a philosophical sneaky debate tactic, it's just a shitty woman being a shitty woman. They play the victim because people are more likely to believe a woman is the victim than they are a man. This has been the case for basically all of human history, well before postmodernism was even a thing. If anything, it's an aspect of patriarchy, which constantly affirms that women are the soft and timid fairer sex that must be protected at all times, and aren't capable of things like aggressive, violent, MASCULINE behavior. It's not postmodernism they're abusing to play the victim, it's CHIVALRY, which is something I doubt you have such a problem with.

6th of All: You seem like a Hunter Avallone type, meaning probably not a grifter and I don't believe you're spreading this misinfo maliciously, you probably believe you're helping society in some way, but unfortunately you are not. You have been spoon-fed untruths by people who seek to manipulate you because they don't think you'll look behind the curtain where the tiny Wizard of Oz is hiding. JBP and the other people I'm 90% sure you also listen to do not think highly of you. They really don't. If they did they wouldn't be trying to mislead you with inaccurate information while just hoping you don't know any better to refute them. If possible, I'd be interested in talking to you. Your videos, while still incorrect, are much less vehement and bitter than people who talk about similar topics, which makes me believe you haven't quite drunken all the cool-aid yet and can still be reached.

So if anyone says it‚Äôs colonialist... Well it‚Äôs been a thing in Asia for possibly even longer. And fortunately even studies, even humanities, here in Japan haven‚Äôt felt the influence of postmodernism too much from what I‚Äôve seen.

If I had more voice in places where this philosophy is prominent, I could point out how it‚Äôs kind of abelist as a philosophy because it is inherently incomprehensible to Autistic people like me, which would hopefully be something that makes these people reflect on their doublethink.

1421,UgzQp1KN_jv3S3KLJBV4AaABAg,"I understand your overall critique and share it mostly, but I consider you are misplacing and belittling concepts that are not necessarily well defined. You are narrowing (I'd say very opportunistically) the definition of Postmodernism and equating it with Identity Politics or Victimhood Culture. Although you may include these two under the cultural logic of Postmodernism, that doesn't equate postmodernism with them. Postmodernism cultural logic is as wide and diverse as may be Modernism or any other ideological -ism (which are not monolithical), and many divergent ways of thinking emerge from within, some I consider very innovative and others rather poor (saying someone is a postmodernist says nothing about the person, it requires a context which to refer to that postmodernism). I've heard many definitions of Postmodernism throughout my career (in varying contexts and practices, because it does matter in which) and not particularly as you define it. I find it very odd to say Postmodernism is focused on analyzing power relations, and seeing power-relation inquiries as a victim/perpetrator, good/bad, ideology. But it does remind me of the definition of Neo-marxist Postmodernist of Jordan Peterson, which he totally made up and is very ill informed (and paradoxical). I rather say that this preoccupation with power relations is a fundamental base in modern social sciences, very useful and fruitful‚Äîin my discipline I am completely fascinated by its still ongoing possibilities of analysis‚Äî, and precedes Postmodernist logic by decades. That is to say,  Identity Politics and Victimhood may derive from it but often result as a shameless ill-reductionism. But someone being a liar does not make them a postmodernist.

Also, as a side-note, on this debate about my truth/the truth, I would say it also depends on context and dimension. In my country we've had one of the longest internal conflicts between state, para-state and insurgence groups, and in the peace accords signed a few years ago with the biggest guerilla, a very special and unique peace judicial institution was created for judging actors in the conflict. One of its bases is Truth Reconstruction, based on hearings of state officers, military personnel, para-military personnel, guerrilla members and civil victims; people who found themselves involved in conflict many times both as victims and perpetrators. Here, the idea of subjective truth and intersubjective truth is fundamental and very appropriate, becase the truth, if achievable, is far more nuanced and blurred as saying The Truth. This mechanism has been very fruitful and a beautiful achievement for peace construction, but it is also under constant threats and attacks by people for whom The Truth is one and evident (and theirs) and would rather see peace risked than to accept its nuances and predicaments.

Anyway, kind regards, Isaac.",aiguadrops,0,2021-04-11T13:40:11Z

I am not a postmodernist philosopher myself and frankly I disagree with te relativity it generally proposes. I even wrote a thesis denying the notion of separate truths. 
The whole notion of relative truth doesn't permit 'black an white thinking' or entrenched ideas about power relations or social justice. Post modernism is primarily about unmasking totalitarian ideologies of the modern age. It's intellectual heyday was in the context of cold war era Europe which was sandwiched between two large powers with distinct ideologies while suffering the trauma of devastation caused by a third ideology. The counter culture and activism that coincided with post modernism as an intellectual movement generally apposed notions of universal truth, sensorship, and despotism, insisting instead on freedom of expression while often purposly being politically incorrect.

In the last decade some Amaricans seem to have taken an interest in criticisms of kapitalist and liberalist ideologies that European post modern philosophers had developed years ago but had been absent within American universities during the cold war. The re√´valuation by contemporary amarican intellectuals of their own ideological heritage and the activism relating to that is not identical to the European movement 50 years prior and ought to have it's own different name.",Kees Stoffelen,0,2021-04-11T11:56:59Z

""PM"" rearranges everything into dichotomous battles, placing a strong likelihood of destruction or nihilism as a result. The Joe Jackson song ""Real Men"" line ""... and if there's war between the sexes then they'll be no people left..."" just as an example of one such battle. There are others. Even TERF's and those that could be considered standard feminist are feeling the heat in this frame. 

The 2nd issue is redemption. The PM-ists have no regard to correcting behavior or genuine apologizing (and a genuine apology is almost impossible to detect these days anyways), as it's seen as an admission of guilt and complicitness, to also be canceled and/or removed. We all have to be able to made decisions that turn out to be mistakes, learn from them, correct, proceed.

The current form of social justice mixes the ideas of postmodernism (who don't believe in objective truth) with cultural Marxism (who do believe in objective truth). You can see this in the argument of Robin DeAngelo's book 'White Fragility.'

1. Western Society is racist and built to protect white privilege (to her, this is objectively true and claimed as fact.)
2. Any disparity in outcome between races or gender is a result of the premise. (Subjective claim as  no proof is required to demonstrate the connection and the questioning of this is a display of white fragility). 

It's actually a big trap. 

Although so much of modern social justice framework is based on postmodernism, the 'scholars' in the field realized quickly that postmodernism alone was insufficient as you require an initial premise that you can claim as objectively true.

Postmodernism is not an ideology based on the desire to promote justice. You have mention the most important aspect of postmodernism in the video: relativism. There is no objective truth. Its is a school of thought that questions every metanarrative. Like religion, capitalism and comunism as well

Postmodernists dont believe every relationship are buikt on power. The dicotomy oppressor/victim is more likely to fit in postmarxism or critical theory. Nontheless your ideas seem to be explaining Foucaults conception of power. And again, you have explained some of it very well but youve missed important aspects.

 Foucault was considered a postmkdernist thinker. He argued that power is a relationship. Not a thing inherently held by someine or something. Power is not inherently held by upper classes over lower classes, or by the state over its citizens, or by men over women. Power is a thing. Its a relationship expressed by actions. It is everywhere and it is the structure of the social order. Its is present in the relationships of Megan and Amber.

1521,Ugxi_oNdoCKlB0Ys0Hx4AaABAg,"Postmodernism, like any idea in fact, can be an interesting intelectual endevour - like the making of the atomic bomb: could we do it? Oh, we could! Should we do it? NO! - shouldn't necessarily be applied in practice. Whilst most people in the western world are educated (at least until thei're 18 years old) that does not mean they're highly intelectual and literate people. The knowledge people have over subjects varies greatly in degree and on the subject. Unfortunately, I think many people who got an education might not have internalized logic and critical thinking - in part by their own lack of effort and interest, in part due to the education system not being ideal. Also, the most recent generations, including Harry and Meghan's, grew up at a time with a lot of information, some, if not a lot of it, misleading, being available when they were young and developing those fundamental tools (logic and critical thinking). So people are unable (and perhaps don't try hard enough) to learn things to the fullest and instead are given snippets of information and facts (not always conducive to actual knowledge, let alone wisdom), take them at their face value, and go on to the next trendy thing. There's no time to understand, internalize, think and question these new informations, which are often incomplete and were acquired in the wrong context.

I don't want to go on about this subject because it irritates me, but basically postmodernism, by questioning everything (which is an honorable endevour, if it's done objectively), falls into the falacy of absolute subjectivism, where the truth is personal, rather than universal. What happened, happened; just because it had different effects in different people doesn't mean it  didn't happened as it did. It therefore becomes paradoxical, because it is not so stupid as to reject everything, but ends up picking and choosing, without regard to being coherent (I'm talking, obviously, about current postmodernism, not the early one of course, that is being spoken and discussed too much in the public arena, where most of the debaters lack the knowledge and experience of academics - I'm pretty sure most academics, thinkers and scientists disagree with several of it's claims, and definately disagree with how it's being used and weaponized)",Beatriz Fernandes,0,2021-04-07T01:30:34Z
1522,UgxAwY_7TRSGxkGywSV4AaABAg,"I think the difference b/w Kate and William's engagement interview and Meghan and Harry's interview was so telling. In Kate's interview, she was not afraid to reveal her uncertain position when it came to William, her initial nervousness about being aroudn him, her unhappiness about the fact that they had split up... she just came across as real. She came across as vulnerable, because she knew she was, that she didn't have control over the situation (because she didn't have control over William). But she accepted it. Instead of painting the story and herself and all rosy, she saw no reason to hide those maybe less flattering points in their relationship and that she wasn't happy with them at the time. That's what a normal person would do. During Meghan's interview, it's all literally unbelievable. A normal person would be like, ""yeah sure, I heard about Harry. Who hasn't? I was nervous about meeting a prince and I couldn't really believe it."" It's like at every turn she needs to paint herself as utterly perfect.

In my assessment, Jacques Derrida and Michel Foucault unleashed a terrible blight upon humanity.  Post-modernism is a phantom philosophy.  It needs a grounding in a world view to survive.  Unfortunately, it took to itself Marxism.  Instead of Marxism's economic struggle, it morphed the haves and have-nots into a power dynamic.  The sad reality is I don't think there is a way out of post-modernism.  It attacks the very foundation of truth, knowledge, and reality. It's only purpose is to separate and destroy.  Sadly, there's nowhere to go from here because there is no footing that can be agreed upon.

Postmodernism is rife with these contradictions. Some believe its intentional, to stoke chaos to destabilize society in order for a power redistribution to take hold. Others see these contradictions as the fissures in the foundation that prevent the movement from long standing.

They pretend to be someone else to ensnare the victim with deception, lies, pretending to feel one way, when they feel the complete opposite. A Narcissist should not be trusted and are often toxic with an excessive need for admiration, disregard for others feelings, an inability to handle any criticism and a sense of entitlement. I used to think that love could cure anything but it only fed my narc's enormous ego. It is important to be wise when dealing with a narcissist and I‚Äôm glad that cyberhackinggenius helped cloned my husband‚Äôs phone. I got access to all his dealings both on phone and social media without touching his phone. All I did was share his phone number with Cyberhackinggenius and I was able to read both his new and deleted messages from my phone through a remote link to a programmed App containing cloned cell information. My husband was a cheating Narcissist and I‚Äôm glad to find out all his secrets and infidelity with the help of cyberhackinggenius. I‚Äôm finally going through divorce with lots of evidence against him. I read all his deleted and recent chats on Whatsapp,Facebook and Instagram. Hacker Gavin also helped me in checking if my phone number is being hacked and he secured all my numbers from unauthorized access with a very powerful encryption software. I also explained to him how I got scammed online and he helped me in recovering all my lost funds to scammers online.

I also believe there are always two sides of a story, two different perspectives/point of views, and I know these views are really interpretations of an event or an argument. It doesn't necessarily mean they are lying or making things up, this is how they chose to see it.

For example...Harry's family doesn't like Meghan, so she immediately assumes they are racist because they don't like her. But when you zoom out of her lens & look at the bigger picture, maybe the reason why they don't like her is because she has been rude to Kate, she has been disrespecting their customs & traditions, she has been bullying staff around, she acts like a diva & became an intolerable drama queen during the wedding. Maybe that is the reason why they don't like her, not because of her skin color.

I believe we should always listen to a story like a police detective, don't jump to conclusions, ask questions when things don't make sense, observe actions rather than what people are telling you, match their words to the actions, look for concrete evidence, etc.",Morning Glory,2,2021-03-31T22:20:21Z

Except I don't believe in external causation but rather, the Law of Cause and Effect. I think the world needs an evolutionary leap in consciousness, I really do. That it has come to this- using everything you have to make sure you are seen as a victim lest you have defend your character against being an oppressor- here is the thing- freedom means you can see me how ever you want and vice versa. Freedom is like what OAC talks about- it is a convo no one wants to have. No one controls me unless I let them. I believe that to be true of everyone. No one makes me cry. I cry sometimes. I blame no one for my feelings. So if you see 'oppressor' in me, my friend, it's because you see it in yourself first. Is a Law. I didn't make it up. It is just the way it is. You find what you seek.

1612,Ugx2EPwPR6E3IffiISl4AaABAg,"I think postmodernism is essentially a form of cultural Marxism. In classic Marxism, the ""oppressor"" was the ""bourgeoisie"" (rich upper and middle classes), while the ""oppressed"" were the ""workers"". Classic Marxism encouraged the ""oppressed"" workers to revolt against their upper and middle-class ""oppressors"", and the end result was Communist dictatorships in which the former ""oppressed"" became even worse oppressors than their predecessors. Forms of cultural Marxism include Critical Race Theory (which makes whites the ""oppressors"" and people of colour the ""oppressed"") and radical feminism (which makes men, termed ""The Patriarchy"", the ""oppressor"", and women, aka ""The Sisterhood"" the ""oppressed""). The result of this is to create division and unrest (as ""the oppressed"" revolt against their ""oppressors"", as we saw for instance with the riots in the US last year). It also results in much injustice, because a person in an ""oppressed"" class is automatically believed regardless of how barefaced their lies are, and a person in an ""oppressor"" class is automatically assumed to be a bad guy, no matter how much evidence there might be to the contrary. And so there is ever more bitterness, division and mutual hostility.

I'm a black woman and I have lived the experience of prejudice and racism, both overt and covert. You can't fight the world nor 'dictate' or control how people think or feel. There is a system and one works within it to achieve aims or goals that one desires. In all things education is key, intelligence and verbal eloquence give you such a head start. Giving most an undeniable leg up that any obstacle to that aim is then is deemed based on race rather than an inability to perform ones job/task/duty. 
We don't have to love the white man, we don't have to invite them to our homes. We don't have to explain our hair our style choices, our food, yet we can 'understand' the white man, even their dislike of ethnic minorities - sounds bizarre? Then you need to really have a conversation with black people! We get it, we really do.
We don't have to 'educate' them about who we are - that's what schools are for because other than biology, we look different have different cultures, language skin colour. History has not always been kind to us, but we've survived and thrived and we are here. There is nothing new under the sun and in truth nothing will really change.

1668,UgxrZRoe_DfGPb86SDR4AaABAg,"This reminds me of a twitter discussion I got into recently that ended with us agreeing to disagree. I was arguing the fact that many people online are attributing the anti-asian attacks to white supremacy. I replied that Asians aren't benefitting from ""whiteness"" at all and that using white supremacy as an excuse under an article of a black man killing an elderly asian isn't taking accountability. Racists exist in every group and providing an excuse for them gives them a free pass from accountability. The person was adamant that I was wrong, that the reason why those black people attacked asians was because of the construct that white people made in the society. While I understood their point, my point was that that should be a potential reason, but not an excuse for their actions. 

The fact that minority race = always the victim doesn't sit well with me. And I am speaking as an asian who is living in a predominantly white country. People should be accountable for their actions regardless of race. Racist people do exist but every criticism isn't solely because you are of minority race. 

I always believed no one should ever question your emotions and feelings to things that happen, but people should be allowed to be skepticism of the retelling of events. Just because she was hurt, doesn't mean that her retelling isn't a distorted form of the truth. But I am tired of voicing my opinion about MH.

But what is lost in translation is women, women of color around the world, new moms in South Asia and Asia often hear even worse comments about their newborns skin color. In some South Asian countries having a daughter with dark skin color is  ‚Äòbad‚Äô and treated as if they are a burden. Everywhere in the world women often face domestic violence from their in-laws or husband, women of color has less chance to get justice and are being killed in their homes just because. They don‚Äôt have Oprah to do an interview or a prince to defend them or support them or the option to even think about royal titles. Yet these mothers, women are building independent, confident children with all the adversities life has to put in-front of them. We often judge from our couch in stead of looking at the whole world.

It's a very good idea to watch the Meghan and Amber stories to learn how narcissists work and lure us. Because there are many of them out there.

There are many white priviledged males, who are narcs. Postmodernism victimhood wouldn't help them much - not publicly at least.
