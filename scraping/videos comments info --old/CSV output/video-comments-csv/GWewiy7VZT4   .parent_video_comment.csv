Johnny Depp was fired because Amber Heard $#!* in his bed, chopped off the end of his finger, etc, and got away with it, despite NO EVIDENCE to support her claims, by simply saying ""It wasn't me.""
Witnesses, photographic evidence and her own statements were ignored.
All victims should be listened to, regardless of gender.
The Sun 'newspaper' is  $#!*, not worth the paper it's printed on.

42,UgzVP_YoS9fQT_hPh714AaABAg,"As someone who IS a woman and was mentally abused by TWO(one of them being much older than me and should have KNOWN better) women ... women CAN be abusive.  I was gaslighted, manipulated, used and when I TRIED to leave I was threatened by a partner via suicide.  It fucked with my head and legit I don't ever want to be in a relationship again.  I can't have a normal one because the two I did have messed with my head so much.  Women CAN be just as abusive as men.  Physically, mentally and emotionally.  Though mine wasn't physical it will most likely affect me for the rest of my life.  Abuse can affect straight, gay, bi and so on.  It can affect women, men and every gender in the spectrum.  Abuse is NOT just men towards women.  That ideology NEEDS to stop.  Even as someone who is gay I was afraid to talk about my abuse for a long time.  For many reasons, but mainly as far as society seems to be concerned the kind of abuse I suffered isn't real and doesn't exist.  Yeah, I call bull shit cause it was REAL to me and still is all these years later.

Just wanted to share my story cause its scary as shit when no one believes you and you feel alone, afraid and in pain.  I got out of my situations, but there are a LOT of people who don't because society, media and the courts don't listen or give a damn.

From everything that has been released it does seem like she is the perpetrator and is manipulating the situation. It’s very common for abusers, of both genders, to initiate restraining orders against the victim. Because of the power dynamic the person being abused is often the one to seek peaceful reconciliation, most victims want the relationship to continue, they just want the abuse to stop and of course that is not within their control.
