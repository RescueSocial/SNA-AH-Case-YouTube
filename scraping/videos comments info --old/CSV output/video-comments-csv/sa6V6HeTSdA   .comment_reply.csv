43,Ugzuv5jtr0a6Pg-wnJd4AaABAg,Kirsty Fairly,"Bl MacDonald-If there was really mutual abuse between them as you claim, then how do you explain the fact that Amber can be heard on previous recordings outright mocking Johnny for leaving the room every single time she gets abusive rather then hit her back like she clearly wanted him to. Johnny even says on that recording that he does not want to fight, that there can be no more physical violence from her or else the relationship is over, and that he just wanted peace between them, which hardly sounds like something an abuser would say. 
Also abusers always have a history, and as others have already stated, Amber is the one with a history of abusing her partners while all of Johnny's ex's have said he's never once been violent towards them. Men don't just get to their 50s, after over 30 years of non violent relationships, and suddenly start abusing their partner. Also look back at photos, & video footage, of the two of them together, you'll notice Johnny very often had very visible bruising on his face, whereas Amber always looked completely uninjured & flawless. Plus there are multiple credible witnesses who saw Amber, without makeup, including Amber's own stylist, after she claims to have been brutally beaten, and they saw no injuries whatsoever, nor did these witnesses ever see Johnny attack Amber, but many of them did testify that they witnessed Amber attacking Johnny while he was always trying to get away from her, and often saw Johnny with injuries. Why is it that when a woman claims she was abused she's instantly believed and shown all the sympathy in the world, but the moment that a man admits to being a victim of abuse suddenly it's always oh well they were both at fault, or worse they mock the guy for ""letting it happen"", we really need to start taking male victims of abuse as seriously as we do female victims.",2021-02-09T18:35:04Z,0
44,UgwelYViDRoFQZzDnhd4AaABAg,Can we get 1000 Subscribers with no Videos???,"Regarding how Johnny approaches these discussions. I think he's fully aware of how she can try to destroy him if he doesn't cover his butt. She clearly has a nasty streak.  I think the he is resigned to the fact that his need to defend himself in this manner is just unfortunate.
I've experienced people like this before and for me, the clear clear message from this whole malarkey between Heard and Depp is that she is a despicable human being who is manipulating people left right and center to get what she wants.
Depp has suffered greatly due to the allegations she has made. I think he displays a remarkable amount of composition for someone in his position.",2020-04-30T16:49:40Z,1

In most cases I'd be inclined to believe the woman, but not this one.  From the beginning I had a feeling that she is the manipulative one, goes to extremes to provoke him through her own aggression and violence, and then as soon as he responds to defend themselves from her attacks or reacts badly to her abuse, he is suddenly 'victimizing' her.

You are also right ... they both have a tendency to go after arm bling and drama. Nothing wrong with that and no shade directed to either of them. They just value different things.

65,UgyxETt_bZcQQsZydMp4AaABAg,Tammie queen,"@nadia c I am guessing you have never been in an actual abusive relationship. I have and I also have worked with victims and recieved Counceling from real Reputable world known Victims of Domestic Violence Center and Mutual abuse does not exist. In fact if you look up that term on reputable Centers and or programs you will see it does not exist. You will also see that she shows every classic sign not to mention it has been established by her own admittance he avoided confrontation and fights with her. He admits to defending himself twice. Once on a plane as he could not leave and once when she threw a bottle or can slicing his finger off. That is not mutual abuse that is self defense. Oh and the moment she released the video of her filming him slamming cabinets when he found out he lost all that money due to his management and a day after his mother passed I knew then she lied. A woman who claimed to live in fear as she claimed would not be nonchalantly filming their abuser like that. In fact the moment he began slamming cabinets a real victim fearful of their life as she claimed would be scared as they would fear they would get beat. I know this all to well and if you took the time to go to your local Victims of Domestic Violence Center and heard the stories of victims you would know too. The point here is she started this all by claiming to fear for her life and in the end she is an abuser. That is a fact by her own admission she hit, threw vases pots pans and sliced off his finger all while he tried to ""split"" and ""run away"" as she said because according to her he Is ""not brave"" a ""coward""- for leaving when she got violent. Not to mention she gave him xanax and I imagine how we all looked on wondering why he changed so much while with her.

As to civil litigation, the plaintiff still has the burden of proof, but a lower standard ""preponderance of the evidence"" approximately 51% or more likely than not.

100,UgwEZa6xm9Fnk0XbWDx4AaABAg,John Rew,@Jared Ferguson My own personal policy is that as long as someone is not violent with me I will not be violent with them. Once they have committed violence against me they have removed that protection. I may under the particular circumstances  decide that violence on my part is counter productive but there is no guarantee of that. That applies to both men and women. In any case if a woman threw a cup at me I wouldn't just let it go. I certainly can't imagine continuing a relationship with such a person. I like myself and I reject the notion that men should simply absorb violence.  The worst mistake to make in a relationship is to give the other party a reason to believe that abuse will be tolerated.

You say she's moving on to her next ""victim"" but it isn't as Machiavellian as all that. She's just an immature and vaguely mentally ill bitch, it happens all of the time. The most truly damaging things that she did to Johnny Depp were certainly not physical. Going back, you say we've removed the ""natural consequences"" for domestic abuse perpetrated by females, and that now they can operate with impunity, but what exactly is your solution? Should I flatten some chick because she threw a cup at me? How does that work in your head exactly? I don't want to narrow down all domestic abuse by females to, say, throwing a cup, that would probably be sexist against both men and women, but we should be really clear about what it usually means when women get physical with their man in a relationship.

""Oh wow you've read Greenberg too? Damn you really did do your research.""


Haven't read anything but her quora answers, really. But I've don't some, yes.


""I will say that idk if you're scared of her telling more ppl you're ""abusive""


Indeed, I am. Today, people accept a woman's word for just about everything. 


""but I can tell you I've seen this with partners of Borderlines, Narcissists, & even CPTSD.""


Two of which she's been diagnosed with.


""The only thing I know that works is validating their feelings. You basically have to forget about any apologies or any admission of wrongdoing and focus entirely on their feelings to not be the bad guy anymore.""


I was hardly ever the bad guy. Only thing I did was yell at her, because she was so overbearing, and just wouldn't leave. I, too, have issues. But hers are so consuming nothing can penetrate her views, and I wish I could have been stoic, but she manipulated me into many things I regret. Provoking me into yelling at her a couple times was the worst. I should have left, but the nagging, and the never ceasing drama. It turned me into a mess. 




""They will eventually find someone else to blame for their misery. Oftentimes they shift back to Idealizing the ex they once demonized.""


Oh, she's probably going after her dad, as there's an online court hearing I read about. She's always going after someone to make look bad.  


""But don't worry. She can present her distorted victim perceptions to therapists all she wants. Therapists will validate feelings and show empathy but that doesn't mean they believe the clients perspective reflects reality.""


Oh, I understand this. Problem with her is, she talks to a lot of them. I drove her to other counties to talk with more than just one therapist, because between sessions she needed her supply. I didn't know what was going on until after. When I finally decided to add a word into the BPD category, as in vindictive BPD, I was sent to vulnerable narcissism, though I found the other term much more related to her.


""No therapist automatically believes a client's claims because most have some distorted perceptions. To find out if a client's claims are realistic they ask questions such as ""What does him manipulating you look like?"" ""Can you explain more?"" Etc Because some people perceive manipulation where there is actually just a misunderstanding etc.""


Yes, I understand this as well. Hopefully she'll end up getting someone who can treat her in a way needed so they can get something into her to help, but I don't see her future being bright in terms of her drama/attention seeking.


 

""But eventually therapists will challenge the client's victim mentality and this is when Narcissists angrily leave and consider suing the therapist for ""abuse"". üôÑ""


Oh, the therapist she used when I first met her...? She left that one, claiming things I cannot recall at the moment regarding something about abuse.

""With PDs usually it's not lying, it's distorted perceptions. They do lie when they feel they ""have to"" though. But they can distort their own memories and can selectively remember/forget certain details. This is what occurs during Splitting. It's wild. There's research on this. Such Cognitive Distortions occur below the level of consciousness.""


Oh, I've been through much of it. I have great long term memory. I remember most everyone, even that which is distant; I just have to dig a bit, and I know some of what I might remember could be distorted because memory loses its reality along the way, this is when I'll say, ""If I remember correctly,"" but even she has said I have a great memory.

""Even if she were to get a diagnosis she would probably be dx'd with Borderline since Vulnerable Narcissism isn't a diagnosis.""


Not a diagnosis, but it's good to know when someone has such a disorder. Them being both on the same cluster spectrum, I would think if one isn't, the other can't be. Diagnoses, I mean.




 ""There is still about 40% of those with dx'd BPD who are highly resistant to therapy and will drop out after only like 2 months. Arguably these might be more Vulnerable Narcissist types idk.""


Some times I think I might be able to be a worthwhile therapist, but if I had to deal with her type day in and day out, I think I would be the party who walks out :)",2020-02-16T07:33:57Z,0

I can tell she's co-morbid, but there are times I have witnessed what she actually believes and doesn't. Manipulation, cold-hearted manipulation is her game. Plenty of times she played many different fields, and it took many months of thinking about it for me to come to this conclusion. 


She lovebombed me hard. Told me it was her past guardians who made her mean, and now she's nice. Went on to lie about her dad abusing her, moved in with me. Then went and claimed I abused her. She craves attention. A deceptive attention seeker if there ever was one. She changes her stories in order to calm people down. A friend of hers supposedly watched her being raped, then she said this friend wasn't even in the same room, and she was confused. The details were very thick, and when she changed her mind because she wanted to be friends with this person again, if I mentioned anything to do with what supposedly happened, she'd go into a rage. Blames everyone else for her sorrows. Will only confess to wrong doing if only to get you off her back, then will blame you again later for her own gain.


I observed a lot, and I should have gotten away earlier, but I thought she was truly BPD and had a chance to recover, but every time she went to therapy she'd go onto play the victim, and would leave truth behind.",2020-02-16T05:05:02Z,1
142,UgwSZ_zWpXin0ht8vud4AaABAg,Lance Lust,"@Anarcho Frills The only reason my ex-girlfriend/ex-abuser went to therapy was sympathy. Plus, therapists can be very bad at spotting this. She's a covert, so it's extremely difficult. Thought she was BPD, but the traits of the covert narcissist fit better. All she ever does is lie about her current details, puts in the childhood trauma, and gains so much narcissistic supply. Only if you're around her for a longer period of time will you realize. She was caught once when I went to therapy with her in 2016. Lied about me and her therapist said she was throwing me under the bus. She went silent for more than 15 minutes being caught. It was very awkward. 


It's a constant struggle knowing someone like this. If you're in love with one, getting out is dire. I don't know if I am completely out, because I fear running into her. I wouldn't ever want to see her again, so you'd think ignoring her would work, just walk the other way. It's detrimental to do so with these people, because they are vindictive, thus walking away could have its consequences.",2020-02-16T03:59:18Z,0

Not only for the money though, because as we learned she ""stole"" the story of her assistant being raped in Brazil to tell it as her own, she was going for the feminist ""I'm a victim"" shtick. She thought coming out from an alleged abusive marriage, was a good PR for her carrier, even became ambassador for abused women in the UN or something.

Also let's not forget that Johnny has the wealth to get away from the situation. No matter how you look at it they BOTH are at fault.,2021-09-25T02:37:44Z,0
213,UgydOUcm16WbLgzcAIx4AaABAg,Ldydi5954,To be fair both Amber & Johnny know they are being recorded. I know this is going to sound somewhat shocking but they both are on their best behavior. Also I am sure each one is trying to make themselves seem better on the recording. It doesn't matter who is at fault at this point because they both are. It takes two to tango. Johnny should have left the marriage long ago. In fact neither should have gotten married in the first place. Unfortunately Johnny is guilty by association in a lot of people's eyes.,2021-09-25T02:15:41Z,0
214,UgydOUcm16WbLgzcAIx4AaABAg,G W,"It's true. I disagree with Dr. Grande as well in a respectful way. Amber is female and beautiful. She doesn't get suspected because society believes that men don't get abused. That men don't get battered. Part of being a feminist is recognizing when a man is being abused and truly needs help. I don't trust Amber. Never did, never will. The key to all of this is Elon Musk. I'm sure he won't talk because he was manipulated by her as well. It also wouldn't frame him in a good light.

240,UgyxtXydeFgBRRF-ZBx4AaABAg,Laura Fulmer,"Anarcho Frills you give an example of JD‚Äôs supposed emotional abuse of AH is when he claims she never loved him.  Correct?  When does she claim to love him?  I never heard her say that about him.  He says he loves her, more than once.  All I hear from her is how she is being negatively effected and how he must stop ‚Äúdefending‚Äù himself.   She also quickly excuses her own attacking behavior as justified because she was ‚Äúdefending ‚Äú herself.  Please explain to me how AH is entitled to defend herself legally but JD is not?  That sounds like manipulation and an attempt to use the fact that she knows JD loves her and doesn‚Äôt want to hurt her but she has no problem hurting him or his children by falsely claiming he physically attacked her to the public.  How is this showing her love for him?  He is offering to be reasonable and work things out privately.  She has zero interest in this but only wants him to agree to her demands.  AH also tried to manipulate JD by claiming his attorneys are lying to him and ‚Äú don‚Äôt let them lie to you‚Äù.  That is extremely manipulative and abuse.  JD engages in none of this.  Sorry.  I don‚Äôt hear any love coming from AH in these recording.  The only one who shows love in these audios is JD.  But you see things how ever you choose.

242,UgzkMRBNrWy7LGSQiSd4AaABAg,Lance Lust,"@Anarcho Frills I completely understand believing isn't earned up front. You'll likely never hear her side directly from her, although I could give you the gist of her complaints. She would accuse me of screaming when I used a normal voice, although I did scream a couple times; she was good at pushing buttons and knew which ones to push. I feel terrible about it; being around her, getting to know her, almost everyone ended up being provoked into feeling this way. Her attitude was very upsetting, and the complexities of her ever changing stories could make me very confused and unstable, which is a reason for yelling. I now know I should have parted ways with her, but she would apologize for her behavior, as would I when I behaved badly. I wasn't entirely innocent in our relationship, however I didn't do anything criminal, unlike herself.


She'd claim I instigated fights. I would question her opinions, but she would think I was attacking her, thus claim I was arguing, not simply asking. Most of the time, if I didn't agree with her, she'd accuse me of arguing, thus a fight would occur. I tried my best to keep volume to a low, but without being able to get much across through my words, it was like talking to a brick wall. Yet one with an incredible sense of spirit.


She accused me of hitting her a couple times, though she was the person who actually hit. I never hit her back; I took the abuse, because I loved her, which is a stupid form of love. She also accused me of stealing her money, which I ended up finding because she wouldn't help look for it because she wanted to keep the front of me being a thief, and once I found the money, she accused me of hiding it.


She claimed I forced her to sign a protective order on her dad, which I was actually against, and then put one on me. This was two weeks after I had talked her out of putting one on him. In fact, while at the courthouse as she wanted to end the guardianship with her dad, while the court assistant went to get paper for her to write on, I tried to get her to see reason by not putting an order on him. When the court assistant came back, I told the lady my girlfriend had just threatened to put a protective order on me because if I wasn't with her, I was against her. 


I agreed to the one she placed one me, because it was a good way to get away from the abuse from her. A month after, a friend of hers said she was causing drama, so I looked on a court website and saw that she placed another protective order on her father. I followed it to see what happened and she ended up taking it off...again. Then her friend told me she was living with her dad again. Just the other day I went back on the court website. Her record read she had another protection order against her dad. It's never ending.


She paints everyone the picture of her being wholely innocent. I am not entirely innocent because I couldn't keep my volume down when in arguments, and the fact I got into arguments.The fact I didn't break up with her for more than a couple days makes me guilty of enabling her. I didn't realize what was wrong until after our relationship ended and I was recalling the skirmishes. I had an idea, and wanted out, but I was afraid she would try her best to put me in jail, which she actually tried doing in spite of my efforts to keep her happy. So, no, I am not a complete victim. I could have gotten away many times. However, I loved her and believed we could survive. I was wrong. About everything.

In fact I believe he did everything he could to get himself out of the situation as soon as possible with Amber physically trying to prevent him leaving!

JD tells her he wants no part of physical fights but she insisted he must remain in the situation to supposedly ‚Äúfight‚Äù for her!  She wants him to engage with her.  I believe it was a goal of hers to push him into these physical altercations in order to get evidence that could be presented in court or to blackmail him with.  Finally I think she just manufactured her bruises in the 2 photos I have seen.  On the other hand there are multiple photos of JD horrific injuries that AD is responsible for!
