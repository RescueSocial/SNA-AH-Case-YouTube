I think hundreds of thousands or quite possible a millions crowd of hate behind your movie looks much much much more uglier than, to not supporting ""abuse victim"". If you get rid of Amber, think of how much of hate they are getting rid of, how much money do they cash in. Because people who want Amber out (for a reason) would award that action and would see the movie. Getting rid of Amber wouldn`t be judged so easily, because people behind this story are very very aware of things whats been going on. If Amber stays in the movie, the movie will take a huuuuuuuge hit, a huge and that is a fact.

She‚Äôs having a VERY hard time getting bonded...due to the allegations surrounding her plus pending court cases slated to start around the time filming starts on AM2.  There r clauses in movie contracts that state actors can be let go bc of dubious behavior & other things.  (Like if that actor is being sued and/or investigated.  (She might be seen as a victim in some peoples eyes, but there‚Äôs still the dog thing in Oz, the lying to Homeland Security, Depp suing her & past DV charges)
Let‚Äôs not forget that AM2 is being filmed in Oz.  Australian authorities re-opened the dog smuggling case, so it wouldn‚Äôt be a good idea for Turd to travel to Oz.  
But...time will tell, so we shall see. 
(She‚Äôs also going after Disney pretty hard, so she can forget ever working for them)

Disney and Marvel Studios are both apparently making Jennifer Lawrence play the M.C.U. version of Susan Storm-Richards. 

I really hope not because she is a terrible actress and a very conceited, and stuck-up person in real life. She sucked as young Mystique in the X-Men movies from 20th Century Fox, and just because she is a white woman with blonde hair that doesn't mean that she is good for the role of the Invisible Woman.

Also I may take a break again due to some comments that where made by some of JD fans I do not wish to repeat here I am very disapointed in some of JD's supporters or so they say are his supporters  I  have been called ""Childish""  I need to get therepy all cause I spoke out THE TRUTH i saw the abuse done by the two of them and i have no intentions on lying about such serious and more importantly very detailed memorys that come with remebering his abuse from AH and also I am more hurt his ""fans"" if they where even his fans would say such hateful and spitful things to someone who is only trying to help spread awarness of AH behavior I am not saying all of you fans are like that. But this one fan was very burtal to me today and I need time off and thanks again trist for your kindness to me you always belived in me or so I hope you did  I grew up admiring JD'S fans but I never knew how some of his fans can go to being sweet and understanding to just toxic and voilent behavior and expecaily to someone who is willing to come out and speak out about the abuse to JD and AH for those who do belive in me thank you and I apoligize I need to take a break but I am very deeply hurt by what was said to me and I wish you all a good rest of your week take care. and also I am stating this very clear again I AM  A WITNESS YET TO COME FORWARD I will speak out my side. #justiceforjohnny",Wild Heart's Can't Be Tamed,6,2021-02-23T02:01:57Z
