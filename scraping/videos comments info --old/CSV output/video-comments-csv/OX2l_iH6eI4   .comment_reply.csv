11,UgxnivoupYR0FiABxtV4AaABAg,michelle annor,"What's wrong with that? Heterosexual men are attracted to youth and beauty. 

Attraction qualities in genders is not reciprocal. What women like in men isn't what men like in women.

High value men don't care about a woman's successful career in hedge fund management or dentistry. They don't primarily care about a woman's PhD in computer science or engineering degree; or about her sense of humour. They don't care about whether a woman has climbed mount Kilimanjaro or run Boston Marathon in a personal best time.

Is she hot (fit body and beautiful face)? Is she young and fertile. These are the questions men ask when seeking a woman. Anything on top eg personality, humour, education is just to differentiate between X and Y young hot woman.

Naturally high value men like Depp will ditch old women for younger women. It's inevitable. This is why women should be in relationshis with older men. Marry a man the same age, then when you get to 35 he'll begin sniffing around 22 yo women. Because high value men can. Ex F1 racing boss Bernie Ecclestone (billionaire) turned 90yo last year. He's married to a 36 to. Guess what he had a baby last summer. Why? Well because men can.",2021-01-20T07:30:14Z,1

The video did not conclude if Depp was empath or a person neither empath nor narcissist. (I am aware some have said Depp is empath, but this is not clinical diagnosis and he might just be a nice person.)
