7,UgwQqqg2Gzwq1ef3S094AaABAg,Judy Tullos,"A Wright Listen to one of them until you hear him ask her if he can have the recordings. This a huge moment, but she is so angry and sure of her being the brains, she says yes, ‚Äú but you won‚Äôt like what you hear‚Äù. For that fleeting smirky remark, she does not want him to think she would think she has anything to worry about. It was brilliant on his part. Check! Then he is quite    calm. They are making the most preliminary plans for her to leave and it is toward their last recording. He did record a phone call, in which she discusses who should file first. She presses him not to file because of publicity and says her name in the paperwork would not get the media attention. She continues to use her methods to tell him not to listen to his own legal team. Because Johnny is finally out it is a much more enjoyable recording than the others. Deep down maybe a small notion that the recordings were marital property; and the therapist knew about them might have entered into her letting him have them. Good question!",2020-09-23T01:42:28Z,0

JD showed the signs of trauma, whereas she did not. I hope at the end of this she will be exposed for the liar she is and JD fully vindicated.

As a moderately successful actress, she targeted Johnny Depp and won the jackpot when he proposed to her. Predictably, the marriage was over after 2 years. But Amber had got what she wanted from it - publicity, and the opportunity to play 'saint' to a top Hollywood movie star's 'villain'.
