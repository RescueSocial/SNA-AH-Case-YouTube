0,UgzI9tTDpnCAnlf8ydl4AaABAg,Wallart pops,"@Serendipity Did I at any time say I knew Johnny Depp on a personal level? No I did not. Nor did I ever imply that I was a genius. That was something you came up with all by yourself. For what reason I have no idea. Maybe you just get off on insulting people you don't know. But yeah, I actually think it's funny that you were unable to correctly interpret what was a fairly straightforward comment. I said that it was pretty clear that he is a gentleman because he could easily have thrown shade at AH after all the horrible lies she told about him but instead he chose not to do that. The fact that he didn't, is indicative of the kind of person he is and you don't need to know or talk to him to understand that. Unless of course you're the kind of person that finds it really difficult to judge a person's character simply by observing them and their behaviour? That may explain your comment. But just because YOU'RE unable to judge what a person is like by the way they behave doesn't mean other people can't. And you say he is an alcoholic? So what if he is? Doesn't fundamentally change who he is as a person. Plenty of people struggle with substance abuse and addiction. It doesn't automatically make them a bad person so you should try being a little less judgemental in future.",2021-07-15T12:21:17Z,0
1,UgzI9tTDpnCAnlf8ydl4AaABAg,Serendipity,"Lol it‚Äôs funny that u think YOU know JD. 
you don‚Äôt have to be a genius to tell JD is and alcoholic who has never met u. I‚Äôm not saying he did or didn‚Äôt do anything, but u are the furthest thing from a genius if u think u know anything about the situation.",2021-07-15T11:15:49Z,0

7,UgyxN6ihfAUCacxSUwp4AaABAg,Nana A. Lartey,My thoughts exactly. I honestly feel she would have never said that if Amber was truly the victim. Sad all around.,2021-07-12T18:39:00Z,1
8,UgyxN6ihfAUCacxSUwp4AaABAg,Inri,"@Heidi Medel the hell does your experience have to do with someone else‚Äôs? Talk about projection, clearly you‚Äôre not understanding the situation, but let me reiterate it for you, you don‚Äôt know them, they don‚Äôt know you, who they do know, is each other because they are actually close, assuming there is a different meaning or hiding behind something else is your own perverted view on fact and fiction, if she claims there is something more than i‚Äôm sure there is more to the story than we know, it is amber‚Äôs fault for abuse, but like she stated 2 to tango, so it is also his blame for sticking around, in any relationship especially one like his, people can leave, and if there is any type or form of violence, they can go to the police, people need to stop playing victim and deal with their own problems, it‚Äôs fucked what happened, but fool me once shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me, that is how the saying goes and it shall remain",2021-07-12T17:53:25Z,0
9,UgyxN6ihfAUCacxSUwp4AaABAg,Heidi Medel,"I don't know what ""truth"" you think hurts. But there's a huge difference between having disagreements and being in an abusive relationship.
I have nothing against any real truths. I'm fine with pain. Been used to for 4 decades now. So that's some projection coming from the Peanut Gallery trying to tell me I can't face a truth.
JD and AH relationship has been on full public display. You don't have a single clue what the hell I've experienced or witnessed in my years on this spinning rock.

10,UgyxN6ihfAUCacxSUwp4AaABAg,Inri,"No it is true, just because the truth hurts doesn‚Äôt mean it is bad, in a normal relationship 2 people do fight and we dont know whats going on, and seeing as she knew them more than you know Johnny depp i would more likely agree with her lol",2021-07-12T16:02:26Z,0
11,UgyxN6ihfAUCacxSUwp4AaABAg,Cnm bnm,Maybe she spoke from her personal experience? Maybe she and ozzy were both abusive towards each other but that doesn‚Äôt give her right to claim that it takes 2 to tango. Johnny is the sweetest man on earth. The only mistake in his relationship with amber turd is that he didn‚Äôt kicked her after the first time she abused him. Love is blind‚Ä¶,2021-07-12T15:17:17Z,3
