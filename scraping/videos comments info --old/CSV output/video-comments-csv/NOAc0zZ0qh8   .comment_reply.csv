All these issues in the world that need your attention and help and you have a problem with my OPINION on a subject and famous people who don't really matter.

Just like Warner Bros did with Katie Holmes's character, 'Rachel Dawes' in Batman Begins who was replaced by Maggie Gyllenhaal in The Dark Knight.
Still, the storyline of that particular character was going on so well... within the movie.

Lets just let woman abusers loose since some men abusers are not in jail. Is that what your saying? Are you saying that she was a victim? And Depp wasn't?
There are multiple cases of both men and women not be believed and that should stop. Men, cause the idea that a ""man"" abused is not possible or simply if they say anything is seen as weak and their ostrasize for it. If their rape victims, some think they wanted it because their MEN and ""men likes sex"". Not like woman don't either. Woman are not believed because their a woman and blamed for things abusers do. Both are different but the same time similar. Lets blame the victims, not the justice system or the people behind it. 
Secondly Johnny Depp was not seen as a victim at all and everyone believed Amber regardless of evidence. (I'm not saying not to believe her but simply not to condone a person a crime that was not proven true with evidence. Innocent until proven guilty not guilty until proven innocent.
