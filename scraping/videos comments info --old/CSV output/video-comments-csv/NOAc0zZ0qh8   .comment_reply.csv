Just like Warner Bros did with Katie Holmes's character, 'Rachel Dawes' in Batman Begins who was replaced by Maggie Gyllenhaal in The Dark Knight.
Still, the storyline of that particular character was going on so well... within the movie.

87,UgxOy4CdvAPj5BQ-ZHV4AaABAg,Jax Ry,"@Nico F Wrong.  Disney was going to reboot Pirates ANYWAY (between the box office receipts and the reviews of the later films they were rebooting it) - on top of that Johnny was at the end of his CONTRACT and Disney does not like bad press of any kind (which is why they initially fired James Gunn) so they parted ways with Depp.  
Whatever Heard is saying on tape is for a LEGAL COURT to decide (not the court of public opinion) and Heard is also WITHIN A CONTRACT with WB.  That is literally apples and oranges between Disney/Depp and WB/Heard.  Details...something people don't seem to pay attenton to.",2020-08-13T23:18:24Z,0
88,UgxOy4CdvAPj5BQ-ZHV4AaABAg,Nico F,Negative press is all they need as an argument.

There are multiple cases of both men and women not be believed and that should stop. Men, cause the idea that a ""man"" abused is not possible or simply if they say anything is seen as weak and their ostrasize for it. If their rape victims, some think they wanted it because their MEN and ""men likes sex"". Not like woman don't either. Woman are not believed because their a woman and blamed for things abusers do.

169,UgzKO_YFkj-_bmLXGTZ4AaABAg,Olivia Rogers,"@MMFY if someone beats the hell out of someone, chances are they're not going to be so forgiving. If it's serious enough (like beating them into near unconsciousness) and the victim is still reluctant for some reason, the victim can be declared incompetent to make that choice and the cops can make the call to arrest the assailant whether the victim likes it or not. But if they're not even hurt, then no, it's not up to us to decide it was serious enough to involve law enforcement. The exception is children.",2020-08-14T00:35:29Z,0
170,UgzKO_YFkj-_bmLXGTZ4AaABAg,MMFY,"@Olivia Rogers What a weird thing to say. So someone could beat the hell out of someone (not claiming that's what Ezra did), and you're saying we shouldn't decide something simply because the victim didn't want to press charges? You're an abuser's dream.",2020-08-14T00:30:25Z,0
