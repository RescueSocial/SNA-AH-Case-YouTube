3,UgycQqKPi6mEl3InhTZ4AaABAg,wwozanewmusical,"this why the metro movement is also toxic for our society and she has proven it, along with Meia Ferra and her daughter and her son, along with the fact that when the men came out about being sexually abused or groped by kevin spacey, he abused Anthoiney App, and Richard Drifts son and so many other mae film assistants and lighting people and yet he's getting another gig and not being help responsible. this culture really sucks when it comes to the me too moment and believing both real victims aka JD and not doing enough for male victims of abuse and sexual abuse as well.

I need to check that. Also, people keep saying that Amber was believed from the start, which is bull, there was so much hate for her and the world lit up in defence of Johnny for no good reason, other than they are his fans.",2021-06-15T05:26:57Z,0
34,UgzgmMXGg4vZtFCIodV4AaABAg,wwozanewmusical,"@Secretluvchild because the cases that talked about his drinking show that he gets tired and passive, and nt every person who gets drunk is an abusive drunk and the same goes for drugs, these things effect people differently its not cut and dry. And he has never been accused of being so drunk that he's attacked beaton or cut off some ones pinky, same with the drugs. and Amber has a large history of being abusive to her girlfriends and boyfriends. and she was arrested for it twice i believe.  and i'm a victim of abuse and i am saying the people who are using the me too movement like Amber are not always the victims and should be heard without finding out the proof, there is a reason for the word innocent till proven guilty. And just cause a women says it doesn't make it the truth everyone lies, and men should be believed just like women, they want equality then men can be victims of physical, verbal, and sexual abuse as well as women can.",2021-06-15T02:00:28Z,1

One of the biggest traits amongst abusers is that they are often popular, life of the party type men that no one suspects. This is one of the reasons women have been scared in the past to speak up. Saying that, I think these 2 were in a toxic relationship, I don't think either were innocent.

38,UgwxxL1cKuaJCpYD-cd4AaABAg,Secretluvchild,"@Wallflower most women are, myself included. I'm pretty sensitive right now because my brother in law is accusing my sister of dv, along with assault, intimidation and threatening him. He got into a shit load of debt for no reason, my sister paid for 80% of everything. And now he's forcing the sale of the house, and torturing her and their daughter. He's so mild mannered, works for the police, and honestly, I would have trouble believing my sister if I hadn't seen it myself. It's such an awful situation. I have 2 other sisters, who have been in much worse situations than myself as well. I just hate that people have already made up their minds based on his previous behaviour. Like it's not possible for someone to just flip and do a complete 180. I literally just witnessed this happen 3 months ago, so I'm sceptical. Much love to you. Hope you are in a better place.

56,UgzQiTBGRBuZRVvMlhZ4AaABAg,Radical Dreamer 1029,"@yashna choudhury 48 Erin Pizzey, the founder of the world‚Äôs very first domestic violence shelter, was picketed by feminists, sent death threats and bomb threats by feminists, and it even went as far as her dog being killed and her being forced to flee the UK‚Ä¶ all because she knew that women were just as likely to be the violent one in the relationship as men and agitated for male victims to get services and support as well.

The Violence Against Women Act is a gender discriminatory law which replaced a gender neutral law, the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act, at the behest of feminist lobbyists. Primary aggressor policies, which I mentioned in my previous reply, were ALSO lobbied for by feminists.

The Duluth Model of feminist creation is a method of dealing with domestic violence which posits that domestic violence is a gendered phenomenon (despite MOUNTAINS of evidence to the contrary) that men do to women in order to subjugate and control them‚Ä¶ ignoring such factors as family history, substance abuse, mental illness, etc. It is the most widely used model in the world, to the point where it is used in the training of law enforcement officers the world over.

Hey, didja know that if you look at the CDC‚Äôs National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Surveys of recent decades and compare the number of female victims of rape within the previous 12 months with the number of male victims of‚Ä¶ well, um‚Ä¶ *_‚Äùmade to penetrate‚Äù_* within the same time frame, those numbers are actually extremely close? It‚Äôs too bad the CDC doesn‚Äôt seem to consider it rape when a man is forced into vaginal intercourse against his will. But legal statutes in every single nation, and I do mean *_unanimously,_* seem to agree with them. Anyway, in Israel there was at one point in time a proposed piece of legislation that would have expanded the definition of rape to include ‚Äúmade to penetrate.‚Äù That was defeated, however, by feminist groups. A similar thing happened in India. To this day, those two pieces of legislation have been the ONLY ones IN HISTORY pertaining to male victims forced into vaginal intercourse that have even been discussed, and BOTH times they were soundly and thoroughly shut down. By feminist groups.

A question for you: if none of this is enough, what _would_ be? How far would be too far before you finally said ‚Äúenough is enough,‚Äù hm?",2021-07-17T11:43:01Z,0
