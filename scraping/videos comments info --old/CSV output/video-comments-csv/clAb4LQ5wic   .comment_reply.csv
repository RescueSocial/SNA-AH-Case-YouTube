I chose not to condemn him right away because of my experience in family court.

Every time a woman did not get what she wanted from a judge, the  man was suddenly
an abuser. So many false claims of abuse are made in family court that none are taken at face value. 
It really makes me angry that people make false claims. It makes it very difficult for true victims to get justice.",2021-08-07T15:21:55Z,0

Johnny is not the one who is nuts and neither is he guilty - it‚Äôs all Amber. He was the victim. She‚Äôs a manipulative liar, abuser and probably a sociopath. This is a woman‚Äôs who threw pots and wine bottles at Johnny, punched him in the face, and also severed the tip of his finger. Any side effect of the abuse Johnny suffered from her might have outwardly seemed like he was going ‚Äúnuts‚Äù eg. that video that Amber set up where she recorded him slamming kitchen cabinets. But that was her triggering him on purpose - his mother had just died and she was continuously prodding him to try and get an angry reaction. Same with how he drinks etc - a lot of that was probably him trying to cope with being abused and turning to alcohol. Victims of abuse can seem like they are ‚Äúnuts‚Äù but it is actually due to their abuse, they are usually being continuously mistreated and gaslit by their abuser, and so they try to find coping strategies",2021-07-31T22:39:04Z,1

83,UgwsCf7ACpHqf2F5JGh4AaABAg,karen berg,"@Mania I have seen the photos of Amber with bruises. I have also see actual black eyes and broken noses caused by flying objects. When you are hit in the face by an object that is thrown, especially in a ""wind up, like a baseball pitcher throw"", your face swells up. If Amber was hit by a phone, hard enough to cause a ""broken nose"" as she claims, she would have been barely recognizable. The photos would show a women with a swollen nose and two black eyes, swollen almost shut. If she was hit on only one side of the face, that side of her face would hugely bruised and swollen. She would not have let a makeup artist get anywhere near her due to the pain. There is no way she would have allowed herself to be seen that way on James Corden. 
 Instead, Amber looks pretty. Pathetic because she's trying too, but pretty. The Hollywood version of a starlet whose face they don't want to muck up too bad because it will ruin her appeal in the movie.
Do you really think that Amber Heard could have resisted a photo of herself black, blue and swollen beyond easy recognition, if she thought it would get her more money in the divorce settlement? But that photo doesn't exist.
Further, a woman who has been hit in the face by an object that her husband has  ""wound up like a baseball pitcher"" invites the police in to take photos. If she is hesitant, the police strongly encourage her to allow them to take photos and a statement. Immediately. While she is still in a heightened emotional state. Before she begins to blame herself for the incident and refuses to cooperate. Amber was visited twice by police. Once right after the alleged incident and once a couple of hours later. Neither team felt it necessary to take photos or a statement. This is highly indicative of there being no injuries, no signs of a physical altercation.
I don't agree with your assumption of emotional and verbal abuse. It is very damaging, but even in a highly emotional state, which Amber recorded, Johnny did not call Amber names. He did not belittle her, he did not threaten her physically.  He did slam cupboards, refill a wine glass and attempt to turn off her phone. Note that he did not push her away from the phone and he did not grab it out of her hands. And rather than being intimidated by the incident, Amber smirked and  laughed, (also caught on the unedited version of her recording). It appears she had a plan for that recording.",2021-08-07T15:01:21Z,0
84,UgwsCf7ACpHqf2F5JGh4AaABAg,Mania,"@karen berg look im not telling you she was innocent. I'm telling you both were at fault. For you to really think a drug addict is stable is crazy. You act like one day they woke up and she comes in with a bat and starts beating him. Depp was emotionally abusing her......have you heard her tapes? Have you see her bruises? Hearing stories of him having his hands around her neck and depp being unable to deny it. Now so I think stars should lose careers over it....no. Are guys being treated worse for domestic violence.....sure. Yes there is double standards...and there should be. Guys know and are even taught not to hit or even argue with women out of respect. So when I hear stories like this, and me being a guy, I can't jump on the man side. They were a couple that fought and one or the other or both took it over the top. But im just saying ive noticed hate for women recently that's crazy. From Hillary to kamala to kathleen kennedy, to brie larson to amber. Its like a trend of any woman that publicly align themselves with the left is now this man hating lying sleeze thats out for money and to destroy respectable men careers. It sounds like propaganda. It mostly comes from white males. Not all but 90%. And yes women do lie...  Look at the bill Cosby case, but the difference is that actual respectable lawyers said cosby had an unfair case. Now with johnny, nobody says that but fans. Its gonna take more than a YouTube conspiracy vid convince me he's innocent.",2021-08-04T21:24:41Z,0

She may have a shitty family background but that is NO excuse!!!! Especially to someone as kind as Johnny. She‚Äôs also an opportunistic and plain fraud as she used connections from big and shallow companies where she licked their dicks to get where she is.
