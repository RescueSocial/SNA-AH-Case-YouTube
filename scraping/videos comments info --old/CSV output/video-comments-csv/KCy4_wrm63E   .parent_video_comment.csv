There are multiple connections to judge Nichol, Amber Heard, and Rupert Murdoch at the end of the day. Likewise Justice Nichol‚Äôs son works for talk radio UK, which is Murdoch owned. So is the tabloid that Johnny was suing. Suffice to say there are enough connections there to lend itself towards bias, and he should‚Äôve recused himself. There is a much better video covering all of this here:

I'm a survivor and once you've been through it you can spot it pretty clearly. Funny you said ""middle school child"". Narcissists don't mature past a 5 year old level. I support him because it's the right thing to do, period. I do believe that when this comes to Virginia (my home state) a jury will have no problem seeing the truth. She does not behave like a victim of dv. She is very aggressive towards him, she never tries to get away from him. You totally hit it on the head!

It's frustrating to see feminism and other important movements take shape in a totalitarian way that makes asinine and unwarranted actions, too often lashing abusive fronts against sovereignty.

I think we are all getting wise to this, and tired of pandering to overreaching requests. I hope that we can not throw the baby out with the bathwater here and give appreciation to the better parts of these movements, while defending them from parties who would take advantage of the platform they provide. Defending the good-hearted and reasonable people standing within. Also defending them from those that do this on purpose in an attempt to dissuade us from listening and making positive change.

104,Ugzbg4h-fGeK3cG24mF4AaABAg,"Thank you! Thank you for standing up for feminism as it should be! Thank you for being the kind of feminist that the early men's movement were allies to, but who were lost somewhere on the way! As a boy growing up in the 70ies, becoming a strong supporter of feminism, the focus on justice was what I loved.

Along the way, my observations began to tell me that justice mattered to feminists when women benefited, but not otherwise. I saw injustice done with feminists being willfully ignorant, willing to condone it, or even supporters of it. That gradually alienated me, and eventually broke me away from feminism, entirely. I'm still enthusiastically in favor of gender equality, but no longer think it can be achieved through feminism, or what feminism has become.

This video gives me hope, on behalf of feminism, and on behalf of everyone, women and men. Justice for men won't undermine justice for women. It'll strengthen it. The more people support justice for all, the more people support justice for women. Knowing that no one is ignored, no one will suspiciously restrain their support for any good cause.

That's the thing about Black Lives Matter and ""All Lives Matter"". There is no conflict, except in the minds of some few fringe extremists and a big bunch of idiots. All lives do matter, which is why it's not a problem to say that Black Lives Matter (or shouldn't be).

Anyway, thank you for the breath of fresh air!

At 6:18 you say, ""anybody who knows anything about domestic violence, knows there is no such thing as mutual abuse""... You could not have made a more factually incorrect statement about domestic violence. If you care about this issue, please do more research. You can start by reading the free research paper by the late Prof. Murray Strauss, ""Thirty Years of Denying the Evidence on Gender Symmetry in Partner Violence: Implications for Prevention and Treatment"". Murray Strauss is THE pioneer in the academic domestic violence field. He considered himself to be a feminist until his death. Fortunately his feminist bias did not impeded his scientific rigour.

That being said, it is clear that Johnny's relationship with Amber was not one of 'mutual violence'. Heard was and is a violent POS, who deserves all of the hatred she receives. Hopefully, justice will eventually prevail.",Jon Chalkley,0,2020-11-29T00:36:34Z

But didn‚Äôt AH give all the recordings to them and they pulled out the one‚Äôs to use or did AH only give them a few? I feel (my opinion only) is Johnny Depp should have won against THE SUN and then THE SUN could have sued her for feeding them lies. I hope Johnny Depp wins in the appeal.
I was in an abusive relationship and knew something was off since day one. In all the years that JOHNNY DEPP has been famous, never a bad word has been said about him and never a scandalous breakup. In fact you could tell that he never seemed to enjoy any of the breakups. It was like you could see the pain he was recovering from. The saddest was with Winona Ryder..... he seemed to be extremely heartbroken. They only broke up because of their careers were taking off and had no time together. In fact, even Amber Turds own private investigator couldn‚Äôt find one person worldwide that was either an acquaintance or worked with him that had a bad word to say about Johnny Depp. Can‚Äôt say the same about Amber Turd.

The last incident she‚Äôd had with him before she went into a nursing home they were in our truck during an argument that she started. Like multiple times before, she‚Äôd threatened to kick him out or divorce him, so he pulled the truck over near the homeless shelter and got out of the truck to go into the homeless shelter. Before he could get away, she‚Äôd pulled his jacket off while it was cold, she‚Äôd torn his shirt trying to get it off of him, and lastly jabbed him in the arm with a screwdriver.

There were witnesses outside the building when all that happened too and people came out and told them to leave or they‚Äôd call the cops. 

I know if that was him doing that to her, they probably wouldn‚Äôt have warned them they‚Äôd call the cops if they didn‚Äôt leave, they probably would have done it without even a second thought.",Mitsurugi Chiba,1,2020-11-23T03:01:45Z

Yes, true, women are more often the victim but that doesn't mean it can't also happen to men. I recall Johnny had a somewhat bad reputation back then in the late 80s and 90s. Yeah he got physical at times and smashed stuff but NEVER was he accused of having hurt a person! Especially not his girls. She thinks she only needs to put out the blame and that's it for him. He's done and his career is over. Well I sure hope and pray the judge and jury in Virginia will teach her otherwise! And don't get me started in that p... In the UK! Amber doesn't like

201,UgxYfEVl-1_5I-snHdN4AaABAg,"I like this video and I like her approach to this situation. The part where she explains that 1 in 9 women suffer domestic abuse in their lifetime is absolutely staggering. It lead me to realize that we can't even begin to come up with a statistic for men in these situations because we are so far behind in understanding how deep this problem goes. I endured a 10 year long relationship with a woman who cheated chronically, physically and emotionally abused me daily, and also ruined my reputation by telling everyone that either of us knew that she was abused by me. And that last part is a huge part of why we can't know how many men this is really happening to, because even when we are willing to come forward, we find that not only are we not believed, but we get ostracized for the allegations our abusers level at us, and they do get believed first because they are women, that happens, I've been going through it myself and have seen how easy it is for her to make me out to be a monster. Its come to the point where I no longer like to leave my own home because I don't feel safe anywhere, I'm always worried about who I might run into, what kind of scene will take place, will I be attacked, that sort of thing. I've almost been stabbed before because of her allegations, she gave my phone number and Facebook info to other men so they could harass me while we were still together. And worst of all, she took our son, whom she has also abused, and I haven't seen him in a year now, I'm still trying to get my day in court. Domestic abuse is terrible, but its even worse when coming forward only hurts you.

My brother has it even worse than me, and has a hard time getting out.

At least two of my male friends has been victim to ""parental alienation"". The mothers has influenced their children to a degree where they don't care for or want to meet their fathers. And they are among the kindest souls I know.

Abuse can go both ways. A real feminist like you can see this and doesn't support it in whatever way it goes. Sadly the radical ""feminists"" that finds faults with everything men do whatever way they do it are the ones making themselves heard most of the time.

232,UgzE3JuOPXoxsF9x50h4AaABAg,"Hi Tiffany C I've subscribed recently to your Channel because of your view on this situation.  I saw the word feminist in your handle & was like OH OK let's watch this for a laugh at the very least it will be interesting.  I bet she will not have a favorable view of Johnny Depp, but you proved me Catastrophically wrong.  I was like WOW. Anyway I'm from the U.K & I'd argue to be part of the movement for this Justice for Johnny.  I engage in YouTube video's / Chat's with other people fighting in J.D.s corner including Stevie J Raw / Leslee of S.E.C / Lost Beyond Pluto / Entertainment Star wars / Shelby Soup / Tug, Umbrella guy / Incredibly Average. I'm sure there's more I've forgotten and they all mostly have done shared live streams.  But you as a feminist have actually done one of the best solitary reviews on this subject you should be proud of you're Moral stance, and you've raised quite a few excellent points that I didn't even think of along with a few that I did but have not heard anywhere else.  I'm sure your channel was mentioned by a member of the public in one of these streams too.  They may even reach out to you, I'll certainly mention your channel to them again.  Plus you have a relevant skillset & experience in this area.  I look forward to you're un-biased & balanced view point of video's on this topic, please keep up the good work & research.
 
My final points about this and the abuse not being equal or having both sides participating is that if Johnny had ever hit Amber she would have jumped all over it at the time & I think you actually said she would have had the cameras ready.  I think the whole time she was trying to goad Johnny into hitting her.  Quite a lot of people take the view that both sides are to blame, which is the ignorant un-informed viewpoint but it doesn't take much investigating to find out that's not the case.  I think over time more & more people will come to realize this, cause the true information is all over the internet.  Also like you said Amber has weaponized all of these Johnny Depp supporters on her own with her web of lies & B.S.  I'm not a J.D. Fan in fact I think I've seen more current films that have Amber in them, rather than Johnny. However being an abuser is one thing, but to then flip that & then say she was abused is a whole other level of debauchery which is what I think has aggravated most people after they have done a little investigating.",Alan Lubin,1,2020-11-21T23:38:54Z
233,UgyPEuG5lsbhOGLfPYd4AaABAg,"3:24 re Amber Heard lying. The audio tapes are pretty damning. The couple times that Depp actually DID get aggressive with her it was a reaction to a physical attack initiated from Heard.

Any woman who's been abused should be repulsed by Heard trying to manipulate the pound-me-too movement by making false claims.

The judge also was connected to Amber, just like Heard is paying the expenses for the ""neutral"" witnesses that testified on her bahalf. The UK trial was a sham with the judge weighting her claims heavily and Depp's actual evidence very lightly.",Tx240,0,2020-11-21T20:09:51Z

Johnnys black eyes, his finger and all this was clearly the result of violence. Did he ever touch her? Who knows? But if he touched her it was in self defence. If I was beaten up by Amber, I probably would defend myself. But I am a woman, I am probably ""allowed"" to defend myself. Johnny obviously would not be allowed to do so. Amber admits on the audio tapes that she was the agressor and she blames Johnny for escaping every fight. EVERY fight. Not almost every fight, but every fight.

If you're a 1st/2nd wave feminist than you are perfectly fine, because what you stand for is the continuation of the rights that have already been afforded women, the right to vote, own property, work, equal pay. These are all bills you can look up right this minute and see that they have already been passed and enforced by congress and the states.

3rd/4th wave feminists have nothing to complain about other than sexist air conditioning, and making up stats about unequal pay which is of course already illegal. 
If the pay was already unequal and women were cheaper to hire than men, capitalists today in our late-stage capitalist system, would hire ONLY WOMEN for every job!

Having followed the Johnny Depp and Amber Heard case, listening to the audio etc, I was disappointed with the outcome of the libel trial.  As a person who was in a  relationship with a person with a lot of narcissistic traits for many years (It took along time to realise what actually was happening as it was like a slow dripping tap and because you love them)  the only saving grace was it was never physical.  That person didn't need to be physical.  The mind games, the gaslighting, the underlying threats, the isolation from friends and family - any one gone through it will know you become almost brain washed with the conflicting actions and words of this type of person.  Only acting that way with you, when on your own, no one else to claim - yes they did say that.  Then push and push you until in the end you can't stand the spiteful bullying and you have an outburst - usually in public. ""Look what I have to deal with, I told you didn't I!  Little do you realise that that the smear campaign started long ago.    

For me it is over.  My best friend who is a man is going through this sort of thing, I keep telling him it will not get better with this type of person, only worse.  What keeps him in that relationship?  Fear of what the abuser will say, what they will accuse you of, fear of turning family against you forever - he is a gentle person.   He is male, he is strong physically, thinks he is mentally as well.  I see myself in him when I was going through it.  

I support him as I do Johnny.  As for Johnny drinking and drug taking,  If you have had a traumatic relationship I think both you and  I can understand those actions, its almost soul destroying.

318,UgwwC6AkAMdSr9lhGw14AaABAg,"Why do people have a bad view of feminist and feminism? This case is the perfect example of it. It's not that a woman lied, it's not that people are propping her up as a hero/victim, it's that most feminists are silent about the problems with Heard's contradictions. This case is so blatant with information that she's lying so it's easy to see...but still there are people silent and even still supporting her who call themselves feminists. 

This has been going on for years. Men's Rights activist are demonized for talking about cases like this, or cases of fathers (good fathers) not being allowed to see their children, or men paying child support for children that are proven to not be theirs. Years of this constantly happening, and years of silence from feminists on it, causes resentment. # Kill all men was a thing....how are men supposed to feel about things like that? Respected? Accepted? Valued? 

Feminism's response to these complaints, that I've seen, is essentially when we fix our problems then we'll look into your problems. Modern feminism seems to keep finding new problems though...like air conditioning being sexist, or a man asked a woman out to a cup of coffee while they were in an elevator and she acted as if assaulted her, or a man who whispered to a friend at a seminar that he thought the word dongle sounded funny and a woman who was eavesdropping got upset and complained. How about the case where a man was trying to get custody of his daughter. The mother was going to lose that case so she and her new boyfriend killed the daughter. Look these up if you don't believe me.... All of this, and more, builds resentment and I'm truly sorry to all the true feminists, but the loud ones have been speaking for you for years.

""You never ever punish the victim. You never shame the victim. I don't care what the gender is of the victim. Enough is enough.""

""It doesn't matter how strong he is, it doesn't matter how big he is. What matters is whether or not he was willing. . . . and domestic violence is a pattern of behavior. Nobody wakes up in their 50's and starts beating their wife when they never beat anybody before. If the MeToo movement taught us anything at all, it's that when a survivor first speaks up about a powerful man, you can just about count down on your fingers when more victims will start stepping up and speaking out. And that hasn't happened here. So, it bears repeating, it's a pattern of behavior. And if it was actually a thing, and something he actually had done, we would have heard about it way before now. And all of his partners, Vanessa Paradis, Winona Ryder, Kate Moss, Lorianne Alison, all of them. Given time, distance and safety, would not defend him if any of this absolute garbage was true."" 
*
""... see his severed finger. Because of the two of them, he's the one with medical records, and she's the one with arrest records."" 
*
""And if you want to take into consideration the little video that she took of him you have to consider the biased nature of everything that she's said so far, exactly how much her word amounts to, and you also have to take into account the body language in that too, because he was moving away and was not really attending to her. Slamming cabinets and everything that he was doing, pouring his drink and whatever in his redneck sippy cup and the context there is atrocious when you think about it. When you look at it as psychological abuse. Because again, she's filming a private moment. He had just found out that he had lost hundreds of millions of dollars over the course of his career and his mother was terminal, with cancer at that time and she died very shortly before or after that video was taken. And that is what his loving darling wife chose to do.""

335,Ugyrf_zVTFfu4N6xMw54AaABAg,"Thank you for posting this. Anyone who has seen her deposition or heard the audio tapes knows Heard clearly abused Depp. She admits she was enraged when Depp would walk away (in order to lessen the possibility of violence) and would ""lose it"" when he did this. 
In reality there is no hard evidence that Depp abused Heard, no photos, no audio or video, no even witnesses except Heard's sister.
Yet on those audio tapes Heard admits to hitting Depp, and like you point out, tries to argue that she didn't ""punch"" Depp, she ""hit"" him. 
Heard also laughs in Depp's face when he suggests he would accuse her of abuse. She says basically, ""go public and see who believes you Johnny, see who believes that a 115 lb woman abused you, they will laugh at you"". 
It's just sad. 
He lost a civil trial in England true, where the standard is that of a civil trial and Heard wasn't even the defendant. There has been a lot of talk about the judges objectivity, I'm not sure what happened there other than she proved to an old man in a wig that in his opinion it was 51% more likely than not he abused Heard. 
The bottom line is that false accusers like Heard damage the argument for the real domestic abuse victims out there. 
She has used this for a career boost, for attention. 
Off topic but she's been trumpeting her 7 million donation to the LA Children's Hospital and it turns out she donated a fraction of that and is fighting the release of the LACH financial records.

365,UgxtcQX7sAfRg4hSAYt4AaABAg,"Well said, you hit the nail on the head. DV hits everyone (no pun attended), male on male, female on female, female on male and male on female. Yes it might happen to females by males more but then its documented more, men don't feel like they can admit to being abused by their wives or girlfriends and that needs to change. I thank-you for having the courage to do this vid Tiffany C, it was very brave of you. I am a DV survivor and i will say that AH doesn't speak for me. I survived it by my own strength and will to get through, it took a long time but im still here and trying to fight against the injustice for male DV survivors.  I hope and pray every day that JD wins his deformation case in VA against AH and that everyone who backed her finally sees her for what she truely is.  She seriously needs help.",Silver Willow,6,2020-11-18T01:00:54Z

but truth is other types are fake feminism's cause they go against actual feminism (like gender is social construct and we are born without gender sudo science ideology this 2 go against feminism also the types that want to get rid of whites and men from series and movie industry by hiding behind the word feminism but that's not equality byt kicking out 1 to let in another equality is u give equal chance to both) there is just 1 type and its first wave feminism but sins they call themselves feminists so do ppl and that causes misunderstanding specially among new ppl new to this topics

The statistics of female abusers is severely skewed. It's far more prevalent and insidious because regular women can play the system like AH does without repercussions. She has gotten away with everything so far, and these are famous people. Average abused men usually face persecution, humiliation, plus financial ruin, so they don't, won't, or feel supported enough that they could speak up at all.
As a survivor myself, feminists are more often dismissive, gender-blaming, and overall indifferent/insensitive if I share my experiences. They added relentless years to my suffering. This is why I feel you just gave me a breath of fresh air with your video, and I'm grateful you've finally addressed it the way I've hoped a woman would.

It also shows how many lies she told. He was already angry, he stubbs his toe while she's setting up the camera and I know for a fact, I swear and slam stuff when I do that. Then she keeps saying, this morning, the clock on the wall shows 1:30pm and it doesn't just go black, he walks away and she smirks and chuckles as she follows him:- https://www.nickwallis.com/depp-trial-evidence",Julie Holland Devenport,1,2020-11-17T14:33:12Z
383,Ugw03YXtgeNsTzpkVjF4AaABAg,"I think another thing to note regarding the video she took of him slamming cupboards is that not only was he understandably upset and agitated given what was going on in his life at the time, but abusers don't destroy their own property; they almost always destroy the victim's property. That video was taken in his apartment. He wasn't directing his anger towards her or her property (except when he realised she was secretly filming him), but she kept asking him what she had done, like she was baiting him to turn on her. If your partner was angry and abusive and you feared for your safety, you wouldn't wait for him in his apartment, then hang around while he's in a foul mood with the door open. You would get out of there as soon as you could. This isn't even to mention her smirking at the camera AFTER he leaves the room to get space. She set him up.

And this is from someone who barely even watches movies or TV and so isn't really a fan. Instead, I'm someone who's grown up and been in abusive environments, and has done the work to recognise them. Amber Heard is an abuser, not a spokesperson for survivors.",S Y,1,2020-11-17T14:00:40Z

Here's the thing---
I'm a feminist as well, and absolutely do *not* feel as tho I should support AH in some type of misguided  ""female unity"". 
Footage shows AH in  multiple romantic liasons ---whilst her husband was away working --- in her husband's home ;  testimony submitted to the court  relates an incident where she came onto a guy delivering her refurbished Mustang, she recounted a horrific physical and sexual attack SUPPOSEDLY perpetrated by JD, which turned out to actually be a horrifying attack that happened to her *assistant* --- at every turn she has proven to be a vile creature.
She has associations with hugely connected and moneyed people and organizations that to all appearances seem to be actually funding and supporting her.
She seems to be machinating or bullying people to *lie* in depositions or testimony, under oath, in an attempt to bolster *her* narratives.

And thank you for mentioning how every time Amber became violent, he left the room & that this is what anybody should do. As for the way so many media and political figures took pleasure attacking Johnny for years, they did so because of his name. Because to them crushing down a very popular figure when it is the trend can help build their careers and their political agenda. And that the whole world is defending Johnny Depp since November 2 and even more so after he got fired from Fantastic Beasts is something Heard and her team did not expect. And neither did Warner Bros, who is now seeing each of its PR attempts and communication services bombarded with messages of love from Johnny Depp from all over the world. That the petitions defending Johnny and denouncing Amber have reached the big numbers is a strong message that is terrifying the media as well. They know the world doesn't embark into their games and is ready to denounce them. Thank you for making this video.  #JusticeforJohnnyDepp",Simon Barr√©-Brisebois,2,2020-11-16T16:48:53Z

Here's more, she has medical notes from seeing doctors and nurses on that day and NONE of them ever commented on the injuries she was supposed to have. Judge Nicol himself wrote in his judgement that he noticed the lack of comments from MULTIPLE doctors she met that day regarding her injuries and even wrote ""apparently her nose doesn't seem to be broken"" yet he still accepted that her narratives were true.

While I think all men and women should be believed about abuse, I think that belief only goes so far as to warrant an investigation, not a final verdict.

508,UgwTlUxpUBOkZj_tFFR4AaABAg,At least this has highlighted how men can be victims of domestic abuse... which has never really been discussed so publicly. The problem now is that a man being a victim of domestic abuse is not recognised by the courts. The process has also shown that the idea of getting 'justice' via a court case is fundamentally flawed. It's an expensive game of Russian Roulette. Who has the best lawyer? That's what it comes down to... I wish that they'd used a physician to explain exactly what happens when you get 'beaten'.. to show that her stories don't add up to the photos she presented.,MarathonH,6,2020-11-14T15:55:05Z
509,UgxZdQsqewS2hponbHl4AaABAg,"Thank you so much for this clear explanation. Just to add.. if a woman attacks a man violently...and the man can't run away quick enough, it's instinctive to push the person away or pin their arms down. In that  defensive action, a woman could end up bruised.  All JD has to do is push her away and she falls on something. If he pins her arms down to stop her, she can end up bruised. If you look at the photos in the UK court case, she has bruising on her arms, which would match up with someone holding her by the arms. That's not indicative of someone 'beating' a woman. But she parades these photographs of evidence of abuse.  If there is any physical mark on a woman the immediate assumption is that they are being abused. People don't take the time to think it through..to understand. We are so brainwashed.... There was also CCTV camera footage in the lift where someone pretends to punch her and they all laugh. When there's a lot at stake, I think for sure a woman is capable of getting someone to slap/hit her...and it's also possible to punch yourself. You can take any object and hit yourself... it's not difficult to create false evidence if you want to.",MarathonH,1,2020-11-14T15:26:24Z

I am in the UK and followed the case only to find out the connections between her and the judge, so many people were involved with her from a legal side. I am a survivor and could see through her with the edited vid and the full one. All recordings heard her berate him, very sad, if people can not see all the corruption in this case in the Uk, well I really do not know.",Ashley Jones,2,2020-11-14T12:23:15Z
512,UgwCsSOaLPHVHJguJ114AaABAg,"It is nice to see that  feminists still exist that actually want equality rather than superiority.  The greedy  American female soccer team are typical of most feminists you hear about these days. A sad case a while back was a men's DV shelter that was shut down by feminists, the founder committing suicide as a result of their actions. 

Your analysis of the case is spot on, most people though realise she was abusive but as you say, believe Johnny must have been equally abusive simply because  he was accused, the youtube channel The Quartering being one such example.

Amber championing domestic violence is a wolf amongst the sheep. Johnny wasn't her first victim and won't be the last. Elon looks like he got a shiner aswell from her.",James Stewart,14,2020-11-14T11:14:43Z

524,UgxQTOLS96-nOnGjnHF4AaABAg,"Thank you for posting this video. excellent that people are now seeing AH for the manipulative, selfish vindictive, callous woman she truly is. 
Anyways, around 6 minutes in to this video, talking about her deposition, the bathroom incidence, you have some information a little mixed up, the toe grazing incidence. Johnny scraps her toes trying to keep her out the room, but as he bends down to check her foot she forces her way in & hits him in the head with the door, then when he complains she punches his jaw. She mocks him during the deposition saying ""he was always so dramatic, he call's everything a clock or a cold clock"". But the thing is, we know a clock or cold clock means a hard punch. Yet she tries to water this down to almost mean nothing. She apologised to him, saying she didn't mean to hit him with the door but definitely meant to punch him in the jaw.
In regards to the UK trial, Johnny didn't stand a chance winning that case it was all bias corruption from the very beginning. And the public are more than aware of this, which is why there has been such uproar. After the injustice from the judges ruling to Warner Brothers demanding his resignation. Johnny has been poorly treated, yet anyone who has read the court documents & listened to those audio tapes knows fine well HE is the victim & SHE is the perpetrator. Lets also bare in mind she's denying 1,2 million peoples signatures on a petition to have her removed from Aquaman, most of which are genuine victims/survivors that she has called bots or people who have been paid to sign against her.",LM-JohnnyDeppfan,10,2020-11-13T19:50:43Z

Frankly, my faith in the British Judicial System is at an all-time low after the recent judgement where I was truly shocked at the result. As a survivor of DV myself I am disgusted at the antics of Ms Heard and identify with JD especially over some of the incidents described on tape where he shut himself in a bathroom to get away from her and the repeated pleas from him to be left alone and attempting to escape when things got physical. This is a pattern that survivors know all too well and this is how I ultimately realised the truth of the relationship between them. He probably stuck around thinking it would get better hence the marriage counselling tapes and working on the relationship. A warning to all... it doesn't get any better, only worse and you lose a piece of yourself each time it happens... so just leave, get out and run as fast as you can away from the situation or you may not be alive to tell the tale.",Pisgah,20,2020-11-13T15:56:31Z

I think we need to be careful that we don't just lazily slide into the belief that they were both as bad as the other...because we find that easier to believe. The evidence points towards her being the abuser and Johnny defending himself. The outcome of this first trial is so wrong. I admire you for speaking about this.

I have worked with many men who have been accused of this type of stuff. My heart went out for them. They were destroyed. No way for them to prove their innocence.

All footage back when they were together show bruises and swelling on him and she is loving having her photo taken, and the more the crowd call out Johnny she looks so pissed off.

And I think that she was the abuser all along, when her victim escaped her she retaliated by smearing her victim by claiming that he did to her what she had done to him.

581,Ugzn1LkslZtWHj_s6dJ4AaABAg,"I do like that there is a growing community of people whose only interest is the truth. I am also not a JD Fan, although I think he‚Äôs a great actor I don‚Äôt get obsessed with him as a person. My heart goes to anyone who is living in fear of when they are next going to be beaten to a pulp by the person they go home to.
Thank you for pointing out the huge difference in what a beaten face would look like, I have been plainly shocked that people have been fooled by this the whole time, considering the amount of chunky rings he wears.
It‚Äôs a bit like the tale of the emperors new clothes.

The other big sign for me was that he allowed all her friends to live rent free in the adjoining penthouses. Which seemed odd as victims are usually manipulated into becoming isolated from friends and family, as indicated in the audio when he was chatting to his neighbour, Isaac for too long, and he got it in the neck!

Great video! üòäüëçüèº",Mrs M,187,2020-11-11T22:42:04Z

583,UgyGeMMlTWMZberM-B94AaABAg,"Thanks so much! I have nothing to add to this with what you said ad what is in the comment section! I agree! The Judge's ruling is ridiculous! It is indeed gender biased. Thank you for making perfect sense. I am hoping the Judge in Virginia isn't corrupt like the other, something just isn't right. He either just doesn't like Johnny Depp or there is more than meets the eye to this. His ruling just doesn't make sense. #justiceforjohnnydepp",Stacey Renee,17,2020-11-11T22:11:24Z
584,UgyndXTiVdEtfksfAwN4AaABAg,"I was cringing at your title but so relieved that you noticed what I had. As she testified on this, I picked up on the same thing. She said she was escaping him when HE was the one locked in the bathroom and she was trying to force her way in. Even emphasizing the word escaping multiple times. She smirked throughout her testimony, taunts that man when he‚Äôs being passive, AND argues with him non stop that he consistently ‚Äúspilts‚Äù when they fight. If you were a TRUE victim and he was the constant abuser you lived in fear of, why would you ever fight him leaving in arguments?! Wouldn‚Äôt that be a blessing?! Wouldn‚Äôt that be a relief that he leaves fights with a history like that. I do believe he‚Äôs gotten violent because I think she has no doubt been an aggressor and taunter for the entirety of that relationship, no matter how passive that man is, I‚Äôm sure he did loose his shit now and again. Which is unacceptable! But that woman was the violent one and he was passive in an extremely toxic relationship, period. And she has completely flipped that narrative on him. Disgusting.",Stephanie Yee,93,2020-11-11T21:21:59Z

You are 100% on point! 
I am a 3x DV Survivor and I am appalled at her claims against him. 
It absolutely makes me sick to my stomach with this so called ""her truth"" bullshit!! 
Nothing but lies as far as the eye can see. Just listening to the recordings, churns my stomach! 
I can only hope and pray that Johnny shows ALL his evidence during the VA. trial and shows the world who she truly is and that is, she is a Domestic Abuser..",OneToughLove2010,0,2020-11-11T20:33:50Z

You¬¥ve gained a subscriber and I¬¥ve gained someone I can recommend when people want information about what this is all about -  or when they offer up this ""they were both toxic, it takes two to tango"" crap.

589,UgzKA1GzjdePkBNStU94AaABAg,"THANK YOU so much for this video! It's so important that also people speak up to this matter who are not primarily hardcore-fans of Johnny Depp. (Of course, I know you're a fan too; you surely know what I mean.) I can't understand why she is still allowed to speak up on women's marches and human rights organisations. I wonder if the MeToo-movement did meanwhile distance themselves from her? If not, they are digging their own grave. Then they are responsible when people won't believe women anymore who say they have been or are still abused. Instead, they should include ALL victims - true victims! - into this movement, male, nonbinary, transgender ect.  I don't say they should believe everyone blindly. I say they should bury this stereotype-thinking and finally face the truth. So far, abused men and all other persons don't have any voice who speaks for them. Stand by them, MeToo! You should see this as your responsibility!",NoNickname,12,2020-11-11T19:14:49Z

I see so many similarities with Michael Jackson, even though he ""only"" suffered the horrible accusations and wasn¬¥t a victim of VB by these attentionseeking and/or gold diggin fake accusers I pray that JOHNNY WILL GET HIS NAME CLEARED. I think U said it the best way on the whole of internet! I¬¥m a fan of U two now! love it!! I hate injustice and when MEDIA JUST CAN¬¥T TELL THE TRUTH.

596,UgzSkkUPLUgnLzlnRid4AaABAg,"Thank you for this video.  For your thoughtful, rational, and clearly presented take on this situation. Truthfully I cried watching this.  I don't know why some people can't see it.  They think her behaviour is normal or something.  That he must be a terrible person because he has a drug and alcohol problem and extrapolate that he must be capable of domestic violence because of that. It's just an insane bias.  Thank you for also mentioning the text as well, I see people still posting about it on twitter.  But they conveniently forget an excellent example of a female venting her spleen in a revenge fantasy on twitter, Rose McGowan about Harvey Weinstein.  But because he's a man they refuse to apply the same principles to it.   Thank you again. I hope this video spreads across all of Twitter :)",S K,25,2020-11-11T02:24:42Z

Surely a jury of impartial everyday people will see through her lies. Johnny never wanted this. He begged her not to take it that far, but when she continued to spew her lies and vilify him to anyone who would pay her a little attention, he no longer had a choice. Here's hoping justice prevails. He may never recover from this personally or professionally, which in itself is a tragedy, but he's standing up for the truth. And that makes him something she sarcastically pointed out --- NOBLE.",Deb Anderson,71,2020-11-10T23:29:02Z
