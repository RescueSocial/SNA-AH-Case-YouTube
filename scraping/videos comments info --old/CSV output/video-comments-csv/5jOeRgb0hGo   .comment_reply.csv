253,UgxqpWGHJ46P70rIn0l4AaABAg,Janet Sorenson,@LaraCroftEyes1 Believe that if you like but unfortunately Johnny's mother also was abusive  towards him and still loved her and took care of until she died. In one final dig she had cut him out of her will. I believe even though AH has been miserable to him. Because he still has feelings for her and she abuses it. It is how she has been able to do so much damage to him. Unfortunately it is a repeat pattern of people been abused in their past. They tend to search for a mate that is just like the abusive parent. They do this over and until realize they cannot change what happened with them but can forgive them and themselves. Then they are able move on. Johnny has been very lucky in his past relationships. Let's hope that he can move on after all this settles and find someone to love the wonderful person that he is.,2021-03-12T20:57:04Z,0

264,Ugyq_T1cnTfX9hMKQT14AaABAg,kathy willett,"@Michael Keaton I'm just not all over social media like most people but it is obviously your profession so... I try not to join too many platforms and I wouldn't be able to PM you there. What I can say is that I'm so proud of you that you are getting out much earlier than I did from a relationship just like that. To me that speaks volumes about your self worth being pretty strong to start with and that's a lot for anybody in this day and age, let alone being one of the most brilliant unique and well-loved actors for quite some time now it must be really hard for you to stay grounded. That's exactly the type of person who needs to be vigilant at remaining strong and rooted as there are so many people on the other side of the spectrum such as your ex who are black belt level destroyers of the human spirit. 
We all know how intelligent and intuitively brilliant you are just by the rules you play and how you play them as well as what a kind person everybody has said you are. I'm not in the business myself I'm not a typical fan girl but I do recognize and appreciate a top notch level artist as well as people who march to their own drum so to speak so I'm very glad that she didn't break your spirit. That is clearly what her objective was. I'm not sure why but I'm definitely sure of the what. Well there's many reasons why.  Most of them stem from the deep sense of shame and insecurity in the attacker that is so ingrained that they must tear other people down in order to always look better in a comparison test. That sounds so juvenile but it's almost life or death to the abuser, who feels that if they don't gain everybody's acceptance and control the narrative and control what everybody believes about them that they will literally just explode or die or be so insignificant or hated that they wouldn't know how to cope. The main thing that I picked up after 13 long years can you believe that? I have to say I heard so much of myself in you on the conversations and my heart just went out to you, but after 13 years of asking the same question of myself and everybody over and over I just got sick of it. And my question was is this person evil on purpose or is it just a survival skill that they feel they have to go through in order to breathe and survive? For some reason I thought the answer to that question was extremely important because I would want to respond to any human being in a morally compassionate manner in other words if you corner an animal who is scared to death it's going to attack you but you can't blame the animal for being evil it's just doing what it knows to survive. And I kept wanting to find the answer that everything he did was premeditated and that way I could leave with a clear conscience. Lol hahaha. 
So I don't know why I held on to that fallacy of reasoning for 13 long years but it was a big portion of my life that was such a waste. I have compassion for him because he does not have a soul he does not know who he is he thinks she needs to perform all the time for everybody or else he just will cease to exist. I don't know how that happened to him but within 5 minutes of meeting somebody he can figure them out and he can put on the correct persona the correct dialogue the correct appearance everything in order to be acceptable to that person he just met and desirable even just as a friend or as a lover or whatever. He's extremely adept at that because it's for some reason the only way he exists he can only exist when he sees himself through other people's eyes he can't see himself through his own eyes and that's why it's so terrifying because he doesn't know who he is because he's never been anything but what he thinks everybody else wants him to be. 9 out of 10 people don't even know he's going through the struggle and wouldn't care who he was you know people are easy going most of them. As long as humans are true to their heart and just who they are and they're not complete jerks they're going to get along with most people. 
Amber is just clearly hysterical clearly narcissistic I know you've heard that word probably a billion times and I didn't bring it up once because it's been overused but that goes without saying.

I don't even get into gossip magazines or anything like that but I stumbled across this because I am very experienced and adapt and I just have a heart for victims of narcissistic abuse.  That's how I started to follow the story and I was blown away.
I'm sure everybody's told you that it's going to take some time for you to find your stasis again. Or is it homeostasis I can never remember. Your balance.

After the whole battle is over and you're just quietly by yourself that's when the heartache hits because there's no doubt you love this woman more than you even knew was possible. And you're going to be brokenhearted when you realize it was such a fallacy and that you probably won't ever be able to fall in love like that again. It's kind of like a mourning. But try to remember that when it gets really heartbreaking like that it wasn't real anyways. That'll bring on another level of hurt but at least it gives you hope that maybe that time it wasn't real but it was real for you and so now you know how beautiful it could feel to really really love somebody that much. 
After all this I watched a few interviews and you just seem like the most humble open generous sincere extremely witty and despite being Johnny Depp you still seem very down to earth. I'm so sorry you went through this. 
And my politeness just walked out the door so my last parting thought is that crazy broad really needs to be put away somewhere until she can work out her issues and not harm anybody else. But if I was a betting girl I would have to bet that she's never even going to acknowledge or try to understand that anything was her fault. Am I right is everything always everybody else's fault does she ever say she's sorry unless it's just something that she knows she has to say to get through the current roadblock that she's facing?

I'm sorry I could go on forever. I'm just blown away because at the level that you two must have reached with this dynamic it must have been one for the history books the psychiatry books maybe one day for the Oscars.
God bless you take care of yourself and your family and isn't that wonderful how your family stood by you. You must really be a hell of a guy. I wish you all the best most sincerely everyday I wish you all the best.",2021-04-15T18:37:18Z,0

I honestly think she sees men as beneth her, and can't understand how women can side against her. She doesn't see her actions (beating him, throwing various items at him, causing gbh like his finger, all the verbal and emotional abuse and manipulation) as abuse. It's how she shows her ""passionate love"". But Johnny wanting to leave when it gets physical or asking her to remove a painting her ex did is considered the worst of abuse to her. Not to mention whatever she's accusing him of that we the public are not privy to. One can only speculate, but given what she's already said we can assume 3 things. 1) they are completely untrue 2) they are probably very horrifying and shocking allegations (probably amongst the sexual variety) and 3) it's likely more projection of her actions against him but reframing the narrative as to HER being the victim and HE the abuser",2021-04-02T00:27:54Z,1

Can you imagine how much he would have to pay at his level of wealth? I think that's why Gerard Depardieu left France for Russia. They were killing him in taxes alone!

Anyway, I think I read somewhere that JD didn't need a piece of paper. I hear that argument all the time and I don't buy it. What's wrong with making things legal and official? So many people are afraid of formalizing anything anymore. Perhaps it would have complicated matters more in the legal sense, who knows. 

I agree that AH ""Loved Bombed"" him SO much that she convinced him to marry him as well. But think about it...by becoming his wife, she has easier access to his wealth. She's not dumb and knew exactly what she was doing. Girlfriends don't get much of a say if things went south. 

And yes. Johnny has always been a romantic! I've lost count the number of times he has been engaged. I just think he rushes into things way too fast. He doesn't take the time to get to know the woman's character. Oh my is this critical! It's not just about looks, Johnny! In this sense the poor guy still acts impulsively like a teenager.

I HONESTLY think that JD didn‚Äôt really want to marry Amber. she probably pressured him and finessed him into believing she was the perfect wife material.

But to Johnny's credit he did stay for his kids. Another thing that was revealing about his relationship with Vanessa. A fan told him that he was a great husband and father.

She would smash me in the knees with shoes (expensive ones she used my money to pay for) while I slept, so I couldn‚Äôt walk for 2 days and had to tell people I‚Äôd had a ‚Äòtraining accident‚Äô. She once tried to pour a pan of boiling water on me and I had to spend 2 hours with a professional make up artist to go to my uncles birthday party because I had 2 black eyes. I stuck it to keep my family together and she drove me to say and do things no other woman could. Amber Heard is exactly the same kind of woman as my ex wife, the only difference is he‚Äôs clearly given her a jab or two back and she‚Äôs using the tiny innocent woman routine to further her career. She‚Äôs the vile catalyst and he‚Äôs acted like any bloke pushed to the edge would.

He doesn‚Äôt deny half the accusations she throws at him on the tapes either, which would suggest ‚Äòunadulterated‚Äô innocence if he were to, but is only going that avenue in court. Why not flatly deny that when there‚Äôs only supposed to be the 2 of you taking? I don‚Äôt deny she‚Äôs a vile manipulative aggressive woman, but don‚Äôt for one second think she hasn‚Äôt driven him to aggression - slam doors in her face, throw things back, defend himself etc. They‚Äôve most likely knocked 10 bells of shit out of each other and she‚Äôs very much the instigator of it all and he wouldn‚Äôt react that way with anyone else outside of that terrible chemistry.

The one she recorded of Johnny in the kitchen and leaked to TMZ just shows her setting him up to record him during a bad moment where he is taking out his frustration on his kitchen cabinets. He lost millions of dollars to his financial management company that day.  I would be upset too!  He doesn‚Äôt take it out on her though.  What really is disturbing is how she is secretly positioning the recording device and is trying to appear like a super sweet person concerned about him(fake) and the whole time she is setting him up by asking him questions and pointing out his drinking.

It seems like she's using his feelings for her against him...he obviously loved her, he knows in court he would be able to destroy her whole life and he's clearly trying to warn her because he loved her.

They are incapable of love but trap others through charm into a co-dependenct relationship. This ex-friend of mine spread terrible rumours about me when I eventually walked away. Unfortunately, I think many would have believed the rumours because of the hold this monster has over them.

And no, I am not projecting.  I know for a fact that being happily married does not protect one from a Narcissist.  Marriage is complecancy.  She was a shiny, new toy & he bought into what she was selling.  Thank you for your commentary, but it doesn't change my opinion.",2020-02-08T17:37:32Z,0
758,UgzbMh5yZPfyfqVAQgx4AaABAg,Dehzee,"@seriouslyjoking2 He was married to her for a couple years, he was with Vanessa 14 years, where this didn't happen. You may have to consider if you are projecting. He was a 50 year old man who left his family for an extremely beautiful 21 year old, who he dumped when he realized the crazy would be an ongoing situation. Yeah, his bad childhood meant he tried a year and 11 months longer than he should have, but at 50, he did not have a history of violence or violent relationships. . You don't all of sudden start playing out childhood dramas at 50. His pattern was to drink and drug, not do violence with women. If it were his pattern, he would not have left. 
He would have stuck it out till her pretty ran out. 
Who better to play that game with? She is gorgeous. 

If she were not as beautiful, physically, as she is, Johnny wouldn't have dumped Vanessa and his family for her. He allowed himself to mesmerized by youthful beauty. And he is not the first man to pay the price for that. 

If he had had a good mother, she would have warned him about women like that, as mothers used to do. 

There has been a great cultural shift I would say from the mid 80s to the present. Women used to be valued for virtuous traits, and having a respectable wife was very important to a man. If she had a shady past, forget it, he was taught by his parents not to marry that girl. 

I think the beginning of that culturally, was with grease, the movie, the beginning of media pushing the acceptance and invitation to the good girl gone bad. At that juncture, shit changed, and it was the beginning of changing the values they saw as attractive in a wife. Dressing slutty, being promiscuous, having an in depth past, sexually, all of that was good, as long as she was sexy. 

Her looks became far more important than her character, the phrase;'you can't marry a girl like that' was lost from our collective vernacular. 

Women, encouraged by media to be tarts, became single moms, and they were not about to warn thweir warn their sons to stay away from women like they, themselves, were. Unless the guy is listening to music from the 50s, 60s, 70s, he won't be warned about a woman like that. 

I know about trauma bonding, but I don't see that as the case. If it were, he would likely have stayed with her a few more years to fight it out. He would also have a history of being with narcissistic women. Vanessa says she had 14 wonderful years with Johnny. She remarried since he dumped her, and she remains loyal to him. It doesn't fit your mold. 

Again, it is easy to glance and project, particularly if you have dealt with a narcissist. But in this situation, from the whining and carrying on, if either of them has an attachment disorder, it's her. He is the one that walked, first from their fights, then from her. Yes, there are patterned behaviours in life. 

But your pattern isn't necessarily his pattern. Seeing two similarities doesn't imply 10 similarities. He did not have a life long pattern of this behaviour. 
Women respond primarily to audio, which is why ugly rock stars get laid by the most beautiful women, men respond primarily to visual, which can leave them vulnerable to the beauty of which sex they are attracted to. 

Obviously Johnny wasn't skooled as a youth about wicked city women, and we see him paying the price.",2020-02-08T17:17:52Z,0
759,UgzbMh5yZPfyfqVAQgx4AaABAg,seriouslyjoking2,"@Dehzee I understand what you are saying & it sounds reasonable.  But these type of relationships are dysfunctional.  They are attracted to each other to re-create the childhood trauma & to resolve it.  He does recognize that he made her up...when he says that ""I love you, even if you are not real.""  What we agree on is that he made her up in his head...or tunnel-visioned her assets & ignored her liabilities.  It is difficult to understand why someone would remain with her when you have not had the experience of trauma bonding.  He was in a trauma bond.  Addicted to the highs & lows of the relationship.  He began to drink.  He has issues that are unresolved from his childhood.  Who else would choose such a nut job for a partner?",2020-02-08T11:18:41Z,0
760,UgzbMh5yZPfyfqVAQgx4AaABAg,Dehzee,"‚Äã@seriouslyjoking2Yeah, but after 14 years? That Vanessa refers to as wonderful? He dumped her for a hot 21 year old, imagined her amazing because of her looks. Lots of men do that. I mean, there is a term 'trophy wives', nobody says trophy husbands. 

They say gold digger. Young women know men will dump aging wives for them, the wife often worked while her husband went to school,  then she has children with him when he gets a job, then he finally becomes successful, he dumps her for someone 20 or 25 years younger. The younger woman is happy to reap the benefits, be the gold digger. 

Johnny doesn't seem willing to play 'let's break things' with her, he leaves. He isn't looking for drama. He wants all  the wonderful traits he imagined must accompany such beauty. But he realizes too late he made it all up in his head, she was only a worthwhile person in his imagination, so he finally walked.",2020-02-08T08:19:27Z,0

By all accounts he has always been an incredibly kind & caring guy who constantly goes out of his way to help even complete strangers if he sees that they need help, & is known to often be too trusting for his own good. That being said he of course is not perfect, as you said he has struggled with addiction for years, but at least unlike AH he has always been honest about that & has been consistently seeking treatment to deal with his addiction for years. He truly loved AH, despite the fact that she nearly killed him multiple times with her treatment of him, & he tried so hard to make that relationship work, he even let her friends live next door to him & AH rent free in the penthouses that he owned for years.",2021-09-05T16:24:49Z,0

With her, it seems like she drags him down, his issues get amplified and he‚Äôs got no chance of recovery because he‚Äôs too busy dealing with an emotionally damaged abuser who insists her gender means it‚Äôs all about her. Really they bring the worst out in each other but the difference is, looks like anyone brings out the worst in her while he seems to be able to have stable, healthy relationships with a variety of people. I don‚Äôt think she would care if he did kill himself. She would just use the opportunity to say he abused her and he wouldn‚Äôt be around to fight back.
