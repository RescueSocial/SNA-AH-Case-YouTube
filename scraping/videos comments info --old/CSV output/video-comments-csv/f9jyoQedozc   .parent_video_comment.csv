He spoke to her in that 30 min convo like she was a mental patient. Because she should be. Anything Johnny said privately to a friend were just words. I don't know how he listened to her so calmly for as long as he did plus being physically abused by her. I wanted to clock her the second she raised her voice to him, my heart broke for him when he realized she never loved him, his version of her was never real. She really needs help, maybe he thought he could help her. When you love someone, it's supposed to be flaws and all. Maybe he thought loving her was how he would fix her and she saw her chance to jump more into fame - she'll be infamous for all this now! CANNOT WAIT",Lisa Hyde,6,2020-03-04T04:02:23Z

Besides, to me, Johnny's texts were also just merely him venting his frustrations that already piled up to the brim - who would not do that after having to undergo such a crappy relationship?

Also, how is it a threat if Scambuser didn’t even hear those words?",jcarlario,30,2020-02-28T12:50:51Z
101,Ugwe7kg9iixR1BJEqW14AaABAg,"*sigh* One of the steps towards healing, is to acknowledge that you are a victim. That what has been done to you is not right. I wrote something similar about my abusive ex, and just getting it out there was a BIG step. Now, 10 years later, I don't really think about it anymore. His ghost stopped haunting me years ago. Johnny was healing. He reached out to a friend to get recognition and who can blame him for his anger? One might say, he's not really talking about Amber as a person, but her career......Drown and burn her reputation so she will never come back. But that's just my take :)",Crazy Rat Lady,20,2020-02-28T12:35:48Z

Private text between 2 friends. Johnny venting..against his abuser. Can't and won't hurt Amber and even said he loved her. Johnny is an open book. We are all aware of his dark side. But he has no history of abuse. His exes defend him.his kids defend him. It's Amber who DID THE ACTUAL ABUSE! Not Johnny.",Eulogia Jean Rojas - Vocalist,34,2020-02-28T12:32:36Z
