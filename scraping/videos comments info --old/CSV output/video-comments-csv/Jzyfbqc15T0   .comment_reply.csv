Also, police body cam footage and police statements after 911 calls to Johnny‚Äôs penthouse prove that Amber lied.

12,UgzRYyZBleA-CPXOAn54AaABAg,Rock Candy,for me it's a lesson learned.  You can't just believe someone (unless it's close friend or family member) - you need to have more information to understand the truth because woman or man could be lying.,2021-07-22T14:34:39Z,0
13,UgyeII38RJlKUaZsSft4AaABAg,NoHighlife,"@Marcel Mendez  There are differences and probably always will be. At least biologically. And right now due to society as well.

A movement is focused on a subject. Of course it can't include every other subject. Just like BLM isn't focused on other races who also have more difficulties, it doesn't mean they ignore that. It just means the focus is on something else. Create your own movement. If it gets a lot of followers, it's probably needed and important. Or at least reveals a lot of pain.",2021-08-11T10:37:07Z,0
14,UgyeII38RJlKUaZsSft4AaABAg,Marcel Mendez,"@NoHighlife - There is no difference between each gender, this is well known by the public. 

However the media isn‚Äôt necessarily interested in covering opposing sides. People who are susceptible towards extreme ideas could be trigger by the rhetoric.
