-Captain America: 2nd WW, plot is about siding with North America and help them win war. He doesnt learn new culture/moral (no character growth, despite Steve being great already). And identity is well known acrosss all world. He doesnt really need help from others. The romance with Carter was great, despite her being support character.

Both movies are great superhero movies (Cpt america is one of the few i find good from MCU), but they only have in common a World War as background (not even the same WW, and the difference between them are huuuge)",2020-08-02T20:12:07Z,0
