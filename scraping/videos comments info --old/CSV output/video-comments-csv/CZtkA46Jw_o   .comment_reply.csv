5,Ugxqky-RtFNycKaVF1J4AaABAg,Trinity Haasenritter,"@eHacker you'd be pleasantly surprised; like Fairfax is within Fairfax county it's not too far from prince William county; I've seen a lady get slammed into a police cruiser for slapping a dude infront of a bar.
So maybe not perfect, but the Jude currently is showing that they are not taking bullshit ATM. 
HOWEVER.....IT REALLY ALL DEPENDS; for men it's substantially harder to prove or even speak out....but seeing how AH is trying so damn hard to get this case thrown out and how hard she's not providing document or pretty much anything; like there's no photos of her black eyes bruised ribs, slip lip and when you look at what johnny had NO PROBLEM submitting there's an up hand...
I would like to beleive my mother State won't fail me.... Fairfax is legit 10 mins away from me. 
In saying all this I think to be extremely honest....any court in any state in any country is going to be skeptical regardless because men don't usually come forward with this kind of stuff; a Shame really because the ratio is probably hella higher then we think of men getting ABUSED because of the stereotypical stigma of ( omg I can't believe I'm actually typing this ) "" WOMEN CANNOT DO ANY WRONG OR VIOLENCE"" total bullshit! 
YES WOMEN MAY BE SMALLER AND OR FRAIL but sadly we can be vicious and cruel!
In ways that most people wouldn't want to admit.....I know I've gotten so mad at my own husband and gone off on him when he did something incredibly stupid and it left him in tears....and this was verbal only....not my proudest moment however when I saw the tears I felt like utter garbage and Apologize profusely! 
But yeah; men think they are alone, prideful,stronger, it's something everyone frowns upon of saying "" oh just tough it out, get over it, omg don't be such a wussy!"" All of those piss me off because like no absolutely not!
Plus chew has been doing a fabulous job of representing him! So....I hope and I pray that Justice will be served! ( It just has to; or I'm moving out of this state so fast it won't be funny, how's Tokyo? ) 
And my man I've been subbed for a while! 
I'm just shy about speaking out.....",2021-06-20T01:40:28Z,1
