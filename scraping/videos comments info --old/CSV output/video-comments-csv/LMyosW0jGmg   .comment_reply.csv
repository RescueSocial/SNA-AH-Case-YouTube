Examples of good movies getting bad reviews are The Sandlot, Top Gun, Home Alone...

Never listen to rotten tomatoes. You want to be 100% certain if a movie is good or not, read audience reviews...also, decide for yourself. I’ve seen some good movies that received bad reviews. Some of them turned out to be my favorite movies.. just see the movie for yourself and you decide. That’s the best way in my opinion.",2018-07-27T01:54:47Z,6

I don't think you're making the point you're think you're making. Also they keep talking about how he's worthy and he keeps saying he's not in the trailer so maybe cut out the bs when defending the fish talking superhero.

236,UgzYnXaI5ySZ6Fg9yr94AaABAg,S P,"V A The ""supervillain"" doesn't ""attack his city with an army"". The villain of the movie is Aquaman's half-brother Orm, who rules over Atlantis, and is the pureblood descendent of Queen Atlanta. He wants to attack the surface world, not ""Aquaman's land"". Orm isn't even a supervillain. Also, Aquaman isn't king because he ""isn't interested in royalty"", he's not king because he's half-Atlantean and Orm has better claim over the throne of Atlantis.

243,UgzshB65lAxmolazjLF4AaABAg,Runner High,"DCEU had more diversity in 3 movies than MCU in 10 years worth of movies.

Then came Wonder Woman, the first good female lead superhero movie, directed by a woman.

Now Aquaman, starring the first brown superhero and directed by an asian man. 

We're about the get Birds of Prey, directed by an asian woman and starring many women, including an asian character (Cassandra Cain) and an italian one (Huntress). 

Later New Gods, directed by a black woman, most likely starring a female character (since Big Barda his the director's favourite superhero) 

My point is, while the MCU is nothing short of impressive, there is simply no debate as to which cinematic universe has more diversity. DCEU wins this easily.",2018-07-25T06:16:24Z,4
