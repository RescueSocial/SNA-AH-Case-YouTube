137,UgwhWmTeRJj6rzgHtA94AaABAg,Beautiful Perception,If you look at the numbers between the various petitions to remove her - it's reached into the millions now.  The movie will flop.  They are just wasting their budget on a movie that's going to go straight from theaters to the penny racks to buy.  And it will flop all around.  They will be lucky to sell a couple hundred thousand copies.  That is my prediction.,2020-03-22T16:38:55Z,3
