Thinking this will change what people think of her. Well surprise it didn't change a thing and her using this baby made it worse. The world hates you amber and that will never change.

Hope the nannies will always be the real carers, she won‚Äôt do the hard work involved with a baby in any case. She‚Äôll use this child  for publicity and as a prop. She will get bored of the or little one soon and the baby will interfere will her daily barrel of wine she drinks and her drug taking.
