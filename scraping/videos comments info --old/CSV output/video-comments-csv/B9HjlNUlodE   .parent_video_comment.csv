24,UgyIf5ETwf5UxXdYBWV4AaABAg,"And though it‚Äôs just likely just stupid unlikely speculation on my part, maybe reading too deep. I‚Äôd say some of the the pictures of Amber with Jason and his wife seem sort of sexual if you ask me, the way Amber is making faces, and the way she caresses Lisa is kinda suspect of you ask me.

I thought of those pics more after hearing about the possibility she had that ‚Äúmoment‚Äù with Delevingne and Musk. I could be totally wrong about Amber on that one, and I‚Äôm not saying they necessarily did anything together between the 3, but I do partly think she wanted to bring it to that level at the least if nothing happened between them yet.",LpsGlamourGirl 298,0,2020-09-18T03:49:11Z
25,UgzPV_YPC78rCQB3fPN4AaABAg,"You know what, despite her shenanigans and transgressions. I‚Äôm not gonna hold this against her that much though as being exactly an insult. She was clearly using dry humor, everything she said was reversed in the actual meaning for the most part. She meant Jason was good looking, and he‚Äôs obviously the opposite of poor, definitely ain‚Äôt a small dude in stature and she even acted self deprecating for a moment, which was surprising to see really given her notable lack of empathy in other situations, clearly.

The self deprecating part was when she said the stuff about strong kickass woman part, then pretends to whisper the part ‚ÄúI just play one.‚Äù

She basically breaks the fourth wall of her joke at one point too to say he‚Äôd have everyone laughing if he were here. She even in the vein of the joke says she suffers for her work, meaning: I am privileged to have worked with him. She was being honest about his wild side though that she thinks can be a bit much, but ultimately saying she likes the wild child person that is Mamoa.

She may be even hitting on him a whole country away, and given her sexual appetite, she‚Äôs might misses his ways, and may be being passive aggressive that he didn‚Äôt make it to the event with her, even telling the crowd they would‚Äôve had a good time had he showed up. I think Amber is quite narcissistic, but maybe not full blown completely to a point where she is at least very receptive to the ways of some people. She clearly doesn‚Äôt like wall flowers much like Johnny for the most part whom are usually subtle and delicate in their mannerisms, and how they greet others. She was saying he always split, she wanted him to in part dominate her to give her entertainment and thrill her and make her feel validated in a way that makes her feel present in the relationship.

She wanted him to change who he was. He‚Äôs a rockstar type of guy only in image for the most part, and music world he‚Äôs involved in, and maybe in his drug and substance abuse habit binging ways unfortunately as it comes with the culture of the Hollywood and music scene he‚Äôs apart of. Bit despite all that, he is usually known to be very low key in his demeanor, suave yet not cocky, and in fact more outwardly cordial. 

Johnny‚Äôs ‚Äúsplitting‚Äù she hated because it showed in the immediate sense, he‚Äôd never fight back mostly in the way she wanted him to do so. She may not have wanted to only use him, and lie about him to the public. I think it‚Äôs more of she realized he would leave her eventually as he didn‚Äôt give her the narcissistic supply she wanted, and figured she could at least retain the higher status she got from being with him, if she took his away and supplemented it like a funnel to herself. Amber is likely one of those crazies that partly believed what she says in terms of feelings somewhat genuinely in an odd unconventional way. She might even love her sister, and likely still beat on her for years. 

Amber just has sick love to give and wants others to share in it. She‚Äôs so twisted, that I‚Äôd bet if he did beat on her a little, she probably wouldn‚Äôt have told a soul before getting to a point when she figured she could frame him. His aversion for her violence showed he couldn‚Äôt accept her ways, and she refused to change, in hopes he‚Äôd give in and give her what she wanted of him.",LpsGlamourGirl 298,0,2020-09-18T02:47:22Z
