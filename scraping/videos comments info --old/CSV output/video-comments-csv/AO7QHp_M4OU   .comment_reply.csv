Her testimony includes serious injuries (broken nose, broken ribs, teeth, etc.). Her testimony also mentions she visited medical doctors. This document gives JD team access to those doctor's records of Amber's visits. Problem is, I doubt there were actual visits, as there likely were no injuries.",2020-08-13T03:45:35Z,0

12,UgxYsuQXmMTcwHw9jjd4AaABAg,Bev's Fry Bread Wisdom,"It can go that way for sure.  It depends on whether the notes were ""collaborative"" or not, but yes, I have had that happen in court too.  Therapists professional opinions in the matter is what holds a large amount of the weight for the court's decision, so it's a big responsibility.   That's why I am so very curious about why the psychiatrist and the psychiatric nurse were not subpoenaed in this case.  I have never had anyone read my notes in court without my being present because that seems like a chance for my notes to be misinterpreted, and yet this lawyer was allowed to read the mental health notes without the author of the notes present.   Very, very curious.  Of course, like I said, I have never been in a court case in the UK so maybe the laws read differently there?

14,UgxYsuQXmMTcwHw9jjd4AaABAg,Bev's Fry Bread Wisdom,"@Lavish Lane Nope.  It is part of the intake process that the client signs an agreement that if the case goes to court then the therapist/doctor/psychiatrist must obey the subpoena.  I've been doing this for years and I can't count the number of times that I have had to go to court.  There are two types of subpoenas for the medical field.  One is a subpoena (no records) and the other is subpoena duces tecum (must bring sealed records).   The medical professional has the right to read only from the  records if they choose, but they must honor a subpoena or a subpoena duces tecum or they will go to jail.",2020-08-12T07:08:13Z,2

16,UgxYsuQXmMTcwHw9jjd4AaABAg,Lavish Lane,"Beverly Jo you‚Äôre wrong. Look it up: 
Physician‚Äìpatient privilege is a legal concept, related to medical confidentiality, that protects communications between a patient and their doctor from being used against the patient in court. It is a part of the rules of evidence in many common law jurisdictions. Almost every jurisdiction that recognizes physician‚Äìpatient privilege not to testify in court, either by statute or through case law, limits the privilege to knowledge acquired during the course of providing medical services. In some jurisdictions, conversations between a patient and physician may be privileged in both criminal and civil courts.",2020-08-11T23:06:31Z,0

 I truly believe the VA case will DESTROY her!! Judge White is ALREADY disgusted with AH, in his Opinion Letter he says she broke the NDA "" on a GLOBAL SCALE""!! Probably referring to her UN Ambassador for Violence against Women. 
 The UK Judge treated AH like she was a fragile flower...she will NOT get that treatment from Judge White...lying to the Australian authorities, lying to HS, committing perjury on 3 Continents...both Judges had this info, the UK Judge still made rulings in NGN's favor. 
 He let AH testify privately because he was "" satisfied""...i.e. he believed her story had some validity or is corrupt...DEFINITELY protecting Elon Musk!!! Much love‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏èüåéüåé",2020-08-11T23:50:43Z,4

91,Ugw_G1eQ8xDgMSXzZj14AaABAg,Eva GS,"@Anna I think, if one witness is not proven a reliable witness, that person will not have the same weight as the other parts witness. 

One is proven unreliable when they're inconsistent or found to have made fake allegations or unlawful actions in the past or something like that.  In fact, lost beyond pluto explained how this works in one of her witness statements review video. 

Plus, if the only evidence you have is that of what AH told the witness vs what JD witness saw first hand, obviously what has more weight is what a witness saw first hand. Not what they got told, in this case, by AH.",2020-08-11T14:19:27Z,2

99,UgztzpEKm5yD8SIFzD94AaABAg,Donald Dolan,"@Krystal Rowan agreed! She will utilize anything she can think of to draw attention away from herself while also causing Johnny Depp more trouble, that's why I believe she concocted the stories of Johnny being so extremely jealous of her and her co-stars.. and specifically named Leonardo DiCapprio as one of them, and now.. according to other online vlogs, he wants to go after Johnny (of all people) for dragging him into this, when it was Amber all along! Smoke and mirrors and misdirection are her tools of choice! Anything to throw the spotlight elsewhere..and off of her. She ahould have been an illusionist.  Fortunately, neither she, her sister or friends are that good an actress.. nor illusionists to be able to pull this off. 

I would assume you've seen the tape her deposition, and her smirking, stalling by eating trail mix during her testimony etc..! It's just amazing! Her arrogance is as  blatant as her lies! It's truly off the charts!",2020-08-13T05:02:02Z,1
100,UgztzpEKm5yD8SIFzD94AaABAg,Krystal Rowan,"@Donald Dolan I hope so, evidence strongly supports that she is an abuser (including audio and her case video recordings, she smirked with the audio of her confessing to hitting Johnny) and Johnny got fired from Pirates from the Caribbean simply from her allegations and sporting what appears to be a make up mock 'bruise'. There needs to be consequences for her abuse and lying, no doubt about it. 

Aquaman 2 has a chance of being successful without her in it, I mean anyone with a moral compass will refuse to watch it if she resumes as Mera.

I read today how a couple or more weeks ago Amber claimed that Johnny pushed Kate Moss down the stairs (well that she heard a rumour she says), it's pretty convenient that he supposedly attempted to that to Whitney and Amber just so happened to assault him ""in defense"" of her, it's like she has utilised rumours to craft abuse stories to make then appear ""true"", she has also utilised addiction stigma (not all people battling addiction are violent). I'm so so disgusted by her.",2020-08-13T04:33:33Z,3
