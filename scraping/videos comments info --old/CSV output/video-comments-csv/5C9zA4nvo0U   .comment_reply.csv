Then there's the actual time and money required to search for a different actress, that might end up costing more than faking her height (no idea what that'd cost).

Back in the early days of Hollywood, the lead actor was shorter than the lead actress most of the time, so they had them stand on a box.  Its not like they were a lot shorter or something, probably because of high heels.  But there's that perception that the man should be taller and stronger than the woman.

nothing really to do with politics, it's a legal affair, not political and once again.... i will say this and i will capitolize it so it can be easily read by you once more, and may it sink in or you show your lack of education.....

I MADE NO MENTION IN MY ORIGINAL COMMENT WHAT SOO EVER OF POLITICS. I SAID ""when it comes to movies, among other forms of employment.... if you don't meet the physical requirements for a job... you're out."" THAT WAS THE ONLY POINT I MADE ABOUT IT NOT BEING FAT SHAMING..... THERE WAS NO POLITICAL AGENDA, NO MENTION OF PEOPLE GETTING SHAFTED, OR TRYING TO SHAFT COMPANIES ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. JUST THAT IF THEY SIGN A CONTRACT/AGREEMENT TO MAINTAIN A WEIGHT, PHYSIQUE, PUBLIC IMAGE OR WHATEVER, AND FAIL TO DO SO, THEY VIOLATED THEIR TERMS OF EMPLOYMENT.

THE ONLY PERSON RAISING POLITICAL AGENDAS HERE IS YOU.

now if you don't understand that, which you clearly don't considering you're still blathering on like a child who got their toy taken away....... in your own words.... ""stfu!""

we're not talking politics, we're talking about people not following the guidelines of the contractual obligations they violated after signing. get with the topic or get lost kiddo...

Have you really not been paying attention to what has been happening?! Open your damn eyes, or stfu!",2021-02-28T21:59:23Z,0
104,UgwvffKXb60wM77IRgJ4AaABAg,DEATH111183,"@glprime2814 ok, lemme break it down for you. because apparently you know little, if not nothing.

1- there have been requirements for physical capabilities, and weights in the armed services since multiple decades prior to the obama administration. yeah anyone can sign up for armed services.... but once you sign up, you sign an agreement to reach a minimum weight after basic training, and maintain said weight for X years of your tour of service, then when you re-enlist in service, you basically renegotiate that requirement a bit....i've never been in the armed services, but i am related to, know, and have known multiple(well over 600 people and counting) that have verified these facts for me.

2- the same argument about political figures who haven't done the thing, owned the thing, or whatever, and are trying to change it, has been going on since far longer than you and i have been alive.... hell there are some amendments to how things are done in the armed services, gun control, and civil services that are done now that weren't even dreamed up back in the day, but some of the things being debated now are bullshit to say the least.
you keep bringing up obama like he was the worst president ever..... lemme explain how politics works since evidentally you know diddly squat.... obama night not have done good for this country in the long and short of it(which he actually did and i will explain) but every thing he said he would do when elected he did it.... he might not have had the impact he thought he would, he still did every single thing he said he would do.....
then we have trump.... only thing he did was build a wall and show how much of a jackass he was for all the american public to see and people still buy the shit he farts out..... and truth be told.... the majority of the stuff that went right in this country was the results of the previous administrations efforts, not trump.... like obama's positive effects on this country didn't take effect right away, but it did by the time when trump came to office..... all trump did was build a damn wall, didn't even finish the damn thing, and the parts that are finished have massive gaps in it you could roll building through.... how's that supposed to keep out illegals again??

3- finally.... when i first posted a comment on how it's not shaming for some jobs, be it acting, singing, military service.... it's them demanding a requirement for employment.... like you have to be able to stand on your feet for 10+ hours while working, lift more than 50lbs from floor level to shoulder height unassisted and so on.... if it's in a contract/employment agreement that you have to be a specific physical figure for employment, then you have to do it, or you're fired. end of story....

NOT ONE DAMNED HINT OF POLITICAL AGENDA. JUST A LEGALLY BINDING CONTRACT.

and you raised political stances here where it's not needed.... so again, take it somewhere else, it's not what we were talking about....

hell given what you've displayed here, i have high doubts you're of legal age to vote, let alone have enough savvy logic to input any political ideologies on here to start, considering NO ONE WAS TALKING ABOUT POLITICS ON MY COMMENT TILL YOU GOT HERE.

But because they're so childish and they have the media with them, it will create a nightmare for whoever hires her. I'm not saying it's right, I'm not saying she deserves it but there would definitely be pr fallout if WB hired her. They even got crap for okaying the snyder cut",2021-03-01T05:02:08Z,0

It isn't. They're trying to get Rosario Dawson fired now, and she's one of them.
It doesn't matter who it is or what they do, anytime somebody does something that doesn't advance the leftist agenda, some part of the Cancel Culture freaks are going to do just that - freak.

She's got a fantastic sense of humor, and seems really down to Earth, despite her richness. There's a reason that she, and Jason Mamoa, get along together so great. They're two peas in the same pod.

And Clarke is just naturally f*cking beautiful... whereas Amber Heard seemingly needs metric TONS of makeup, onscreen, to look attractive herself. But that's just my opinion...",2021-03-01T06:02:11Z,3

It's very expensive to use CGI to correct for weight, and the thing is it's only slightly harder and slightly more expensive when a person is super overweight compared to a bit overweight, so it makes no real difference in cost and time if you are 5kg overweight or 30kg overweight.
