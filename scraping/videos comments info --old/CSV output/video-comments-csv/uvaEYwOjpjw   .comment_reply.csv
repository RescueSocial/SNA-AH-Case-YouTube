Whatever is happening between Amber and Johnny is not changing my life, so I don't care.

Nothing you wrote in that paragraph above is going to change my life, so I don't care.

Believe me, friend. If the lives of Amber and Johnny were consequential to my life in any way, I would have done all the research, I would know all the facts, but... It just doesn't matter.

Also, I have a feeling a lot of people here in the comments saying they will boycott were not gonna watch it even If she wasn't in it lol and judging by Depp's box office track in the last few years, I don't think most people care about him that much either.

You can't be an activist, be for the sake of the planet and everything and ignore things like that. Men can be abused too. If he thinks otherwise that truly means that he's really an impostor. I started to notice a few months ago that it looks like he got some kinda resentment towards Johnny Depp but I didn't fully understand why. I mean yes, Amber Heard may be his friend but I didn't know they were that close. On the contrary, they didn't look close at all but hey, maybe it was just in front of cameras. But the way he threw the card when he saw the name and the face of Johnny Depp's daughter on it when he was kinda promoted the movie ""Voyagers"" cause the guy that played his son in ""See"" plays in it, even I knew that there were something wrong.

Johnny says: There can be NO PHYSICAL VI OLENCE. And Amber's complaining : You DON'T FIGHT! 
That last statement exonerates him.  And the audio is hours upon hours (feels like days) of her berating johnny about running away from every fight when she gets angry....get's angry cause she's HUMAN.  hmmm maybe she's lying about that human part.",2021-06-12T16:12:55Z,0

It will not impact the actors, but WB and investors. And hopefully they will all admit what was obvious to everyone beforehand, that AH was a financial liability in a film. As said in the video, that she is more likely to drive potential audiences away than attract them, so much so that it will be a noticeable drop in profits.
So each and every person NOT going to see this movie, not PAYING in any way to see this movie (pirating is fine :D) will hurt WB's profit margin and hopefully send them the message that nobody wants a movie with AH.
I also agree with what was said at the start of the video, WB started this by firing JD preemptively but not AH. If their messy personal issues are such that WB can't separate personal from professional, well then we the audience have a right to show where our judgment goes.",2021-06-13T16:49:57Z,2

196,UgyHiVMpjbzRcEKbI9p4AaABAg,Wendy H,"Yes! That’s exactly how I feel as well. The whole “cancel culture” thing is frankly…well, dangerous really. But I also can’t stand hypocrisy. 

I’ve been a staunch defender of Johnny since all this first hit - I’m a survivor of severe DV myself; first husband was a closet drunk - I didn’t even know he was an alcoholic before our marriage (back in the 80’s) but he never once raised a hand to me until after we were married…then he didn’t stop - running away from him only made it so much worse, but eventually I did finally manage to get my babies and I away for good after I’d run to a women’s shelter, and then moved to another town after the shelter helped me get an RO in place.

It took him a while to find us, but he walked through that RO (those are a total joke btw), broke into my house late one night and beat me so severely that i had more bones broken than not, leaving me in a coma for 3 months. What he didn’t know was a young friend of mine had been watching the kids for me & had spent the night in their room with them as I had to work at 5:30 the next day (I was working two jobs at the time). Thank God she didn’t try to intervene, (she was even smaller than I am!) but she DID call 911 and the RCMP & EMS rushed over (small town). That young woman saved my life that night, so believe me when I say I now KNOW how a survivor of DV acts, as well being able to spot an abuser from 100 miles away. (Although I wasn’t sure when the news first broke if she was the abuser or just a lying sack of dog crap, but it sure didn’t take long to figure it out!!). I DID know right from the get-go with 100% certainty that JD wasn’t an abuser, and I have been just horrified at how so many people instantly went for him.

She’s lost absolutely NOTHING except her mask…and now that it’s off and the whole world can clearly see what a psychotic mongrel she is, it’s absolutely revolting and utterly tone deaf for the WB to have anything to do with her. But then, is anyone really surprised? The WB have been problematic for a VERY long time now. 

I really like Momoa, but I absolutely cannot and will not support ANYTHING with that feral mongrel “Turd” in it. Guess the only option now is to boycott it & hit them in the only place that’ll hurt - their wallets!",2021-06-14T18:36:30Z,6

When AH first falsely accused Johnny Depp back in 2016 she was instantly believed while he was instantly branded guilty despite there being no proof that he did anything to harm her. The cancel culture mob all but started a witch hunt against him causing him to lose work, & the media were more then happy to help AH keep kicking him while he was down by writing hitpieces against him while praising her, but when the evidence came out that AH was in fact the one who abused him throughout their relationship & not JD, she suffered no consequences for it. She still has her role in Aquaman while JD is basically blacklisted, and the media & her fans continue to outright ignore all the evidence against her. And what's happened to JD isn't a rare occurrence, there are thousands of men around the world who suffer from abuse or find themselves wrongly accused & there's no support out there for them, instead they're the ones who lose everything due to being disbelieved while the women who commit abuse & make false claims against their partner see no repercussions whatsoever.",2021-06-11T22:21:17Z,1

249,UgxNZ6_ZtWq7YSIFX9p4AaABAg,Etacas,Parents will take their  kids.  Some people may look past it and see it once.  WB is expecting another billion  dollars.   The film won't get that.  People will stay away.  It will make money but not as much as they thought.,2021-07-09T12:17:02Z,1

251,UgxNZ6_ZtWq7YSIFX9p4AaABAg,INNOCENT GAMING,"@Nathan b i am from England and people here isn't interested at all whether who is right and who is not 
Even my colleagues says that they both are just ruining there career nthg else 
But i would say that Ah won the case twice and looks like she is going to win at Virginia tooo but i just want all thing right again for both .
I am supporter of both 
And both are victims of each other 
We cannot deny this fact !!!!!",2021-06-30T15:33:31Z,1
252,UgxNZ6_ZtWq7YSIFX9p4AaABAg,INNOCENT GAMING,"@Nathan b another thing is that why  
Its not about johnny depp (he is my favourite ) even though i love watching amber heard
Why to interfare or compare them with  each other 
And about boycotting aquaman 2 it ain't 
Just bcoz johnny was asked to resign from fantastic beats 
I don't think there is any logic that we are hating amber heard just bcoz of her depp left the role 
 isn't it

255,Ugyg9QUva5MeYFQ6Qjx4AaABAg,Vannee242,Naw I’ve haven’t really cared for these films Joker for example a fantastic film showing you don’t need all the graphics all the money all the CGI to create a good film. These movies have terrible stories the only one I truly enjoyed was Guardians of the Galaxy the others are crap. Just my opinion. It is great to see the support. This woman is a snake and cancel culture apparently it’s the canceling her evidence and facts have come out against her. #justiceforjohnnydepp,2021-06-11T17:24:49Z,1
