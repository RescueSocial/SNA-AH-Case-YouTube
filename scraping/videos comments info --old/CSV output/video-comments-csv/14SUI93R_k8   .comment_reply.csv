In this instance, they came in with a joke or sarcasm to suggest amber is unstable enough of a person to be a perspective enlightening experience by maybe pooping in his bed or cutting off an appendage.

Only in bizarro land where political correctness is more important than common logic. If you want to talk about morality, you could just it‚Äôs wrong for anyone to hit anyone. However, out of all the possible scenarios of one gender hitting another, the scenario that is likely more dangerous is a man hitting a woman. Men even accidentally kill other men on occasion but it is that much more likely to happen if a man is to use his full strength on a woman or a child. That is why, if you are bigger and stronger than a woman and can restrain them, it‚Äôs usually a safer option.

You are delusional and extremely sexist. You're pressenting one type of scenario as if its the only way things can happen. A woman may not always be able to defend herself but as far as our legal system goes when a woman assaults a man he isn't allowed to try to defend himself.

93,UgzYqXcsGcfZw-gm4wF4AaABAg,Shifting Mercury,"@Ash Amber grabbed her gf‚Äôs arm. Her gf has gone on record to say Amber didn‚Äôt hit her and never hit her or was abusive. She said she was an amazing person. The same as Johnny‚Äôs ex said about him. But clearly shit went down. We do know that Johnny gets in fights when he‚Äôs drunk. That alone wouldn‚Äôt be a big deal but combined with him saying ‚Äòwe both were physical with each other‚Äô, and the photos of the bruises, Amber‚Äôs claims, her sisters testimony claiming she witnessed Johnny hit Amber, among all the other stuff, makes it look like Johnny had been violent at some point. What is interesting about her sisters testimony is that she also claimed that she witnessed Amber hit Johnny on the stairs. Amber said she was worried Johnny was going to push her sister. It really shouldn‚Äôt be about picking a side. Just figuring out what happened. Amber admitted to hitting Johnny on two occasions. Johnny has yet to admit to violence. It just seems like he is taking responsibility for the role he played in it. If he did, I think there would be a lot of people who would respect that. He could have been open and honest and admitted that his addiction was out of control and his jealousy and temper turned him into another person. I think people know enough about Johnny Depp to know he isn‚Äôt a complete monster. I don‚Äôt think he realizes that and thinks he had to do it this way.",2021-04-21T02:43:57Z,0
94,UgzYqXcsGcfZw-gm4wF4AaABAg,Ash,@Shifting Mercury as much there's evidedence of seep just defending himself. Depp didn't have any past abusive case that got to police like amber had,2021-04-20T11:36:24Z,0
95,UgzYqXcsGcfZw-gm4wF4AaABAg,Shifting Mercury,"@Smita Johnny shouldn‚Äôt be hitting Amber either. There are many more incidents of Johnny being abusive to Amber than of her being abusive to Johnny. There were two incidents where she hit him and Johnny never discussed more than that. Besides the bottle throwing accusation where he was throwing bottles also. We don‚Äôt know how that went down really. But there were something like 13 or was it 15 accusations of him being violent towards her? Which he admitted in the recording when he said ‚Äòwe have been physical towards each other‚Äô. Johnny needs to own up to his role in this. Amber even withdrew the restraining order and in the UK, you have to go to court if a restraining order is requested so he didn‚Äôt have to face domestic abuse charges. He said in the statement that she didn‚Äôt lied. He admitted to it without directly saying it. Then he changed his mind after his career was severely affected. Because people like you insisted on him being innocent. 

It‚Äôs not supporting someone if you are basing everything on their innocence when they very well might be guilty. He had to say he was innocent because that‚Äôs what society wants. Innocent or canceled. Nobody seemed concerned by what they learned about his behavior and his addiction. Nobody supported him getting help. That is doing Johnny a great disservice. And throwing Amber under the bus like that and claiming all the witnesses are lying and all the evidence is fake  is bullshit. There is no proof of any of that. It‚Äôs just what you have to believe because you have to believe he‚Äôs innocent. As if there is no other option than for him to be completely innocent or be a monster. It‚Äôs crazy the lack of insight people have into how this kind of stuff plays out. For some people, drugs and alcohol are toxic. For an addict who is going downhill, with a ton of money and a ton of drugs and alcohol in his system, who becomes volatile while intoxicated, they don‚Äôt have to be a monster to become violent. But nobody wants to go there. It‚Äôs just easier to throw Amber under the bus.",2021-04-20T07:27:06Z,0
96,UgzYqXcsGcfZw-gm4wF4AaABAg,Shifting Mercury,@Smita Her dad sent Johnny a text saying the hitting has to stop. He said it has to stop between both of them. He understood as he used to be abusive to Amber‚Äôs mom. Her mother died last year. Her father supports her. Amber met Johnny because she was his costar. Not because she was a nobody who Johnny made famous. Her career was already on the rise. She did dump Elon. It‚Äôs not about who you support. It‚Äôs about what you believe the truth is. I want Johnny to get help for his addiction and emotional issues. I wish them both healing and the ability to move forward.,2021-04-20T07:11:42Z,0

100,UgwBH4yG9gVs7VaJpzx4AaABAg,Just Another Happy Humanist,"Nora A. Oh, and finally, if you knew anything about abuse, then you would know that simply being strong enough to leave does not necessarily make one able to do so. There are so many different ways that an abuser can make it difficult for a victim to leave a relationship - especially, in this case, if that victim is a man who doesn‚Äôt want to set a hand on their female abuser in their attempt to get away. Combine that with all the extremely manipulative threats and psychological tactics that abusers use, and that were used in this case (and that, if you knew anything about abuse, you would know abusers use to even greater effect than violence), and you‚Äôll see that being able to physically overpower an abuser can be the least of a victim‚Äôs worries - and yet, that doesn‚Äôt make them any less of a victim.",2021-03-19T19:08:07Z,6
101,UgwBH4yG9gVs7VaJpzx4AaABAg,Nora A.,"@Just Another Happy Humanist -- Johnny literally said that he wants to set her on fire. In a world where literally several rabid, emotional sick males have done that to some women and girls, it is insane that you or anyone would support him. Legally, when someone makes threatening comments, they deserve prison time. So he should be in prison for those texts alone. I never said she is perfectly innocent, but you're in denial if you won't admit that if he disliked her or her company, he simply could have broken up with her. It's that simple since physically he is stronger than her so she's not going to be able to stop him from leaving her. But for him to stick around, and make such threatening comments about her, etc., then no, he should be in prison.",2021-03-19T18:36:50Z,0
