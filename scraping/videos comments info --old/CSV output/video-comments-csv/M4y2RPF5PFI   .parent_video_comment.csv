3,UgwG1OcTzmOg1b_lsbN4AaABAg,"See, l'oreal doesn't mind that you were a stripper, so what you danced on a bar taking your clothes off in front of drunk guys. Maybe she didn't finish school or thought she wasn't cut out for learning, which would explain the alcohol abuse, drug abuse or just plain abuse, hay didn't she just buy a baby?!? Umm...
I mean, L'oreal is a reputable company who apparently caters to women whom poop in beds and call it...a joke!? I mean, huh, they cater to women who pretend to be victims of domestic violence...! What? 
Ok, so L'oreal caters to women who steal $7 million dollars from sick children...wait a minute...is this a joks?
So if you have young, unsuspecting, naive daughters, this is the make up for you. Just think of all the guys just having eyes for your daughter.
