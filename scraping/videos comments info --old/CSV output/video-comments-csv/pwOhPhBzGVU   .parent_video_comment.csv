JD is well received but also is in various Marilyn Manson music videos which show his talent and range as a guitarist but again give a dimension most are unaware of. Divorce tends to divide most into sides and further divide people in ideologies. I wish both of them the best and hope the public can put aside the pettiness and consume the entertainment as it comes out respectively because most have limited scope on the success of any artform tv plays and movies we are talking 100s of jobs, a team effort from assistants to caterers to actors, editors ect. It should be valued as a work more thought out than any youtube or tiktok video because without these bigger works the content would not be present for most creators to comment on.

When I checked the movie on Box Office Mojo, it was only listed on their daily charts for 7 days after that first week it vanished from the charts. It debuted on the dailies at 19 and stayed around the general area (but no higher that 17), but for the week it only charted at 23rd out of a list of 43 movies - the following week it was completely gone from that weeks list of 40 movies.

To TUG: On Box Office Mojo they record that it was 100 theaters that ran the movie.
