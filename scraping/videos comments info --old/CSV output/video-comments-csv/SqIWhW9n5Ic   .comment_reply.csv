42,UgwD5dxcxp0RIkZRc9p4AaABAg,Eline Margot,"@Jay A Errington He is not toxic. She is. Drinking is okay. Slamming doors och throwing things is ok. Throwing things AT someone is not, and if you do it repeatedly it's toxic behavior.",2021-01-13T22:23:13Z,4
43,UgwD5dxcxp0RIkZRc9p4AaABAg,Jay A Errington,"@Eline Margot but then if you have dealt with that behaviour for years im sure you have days where you just lose it. I have under an 
Abuser...didn't end well but frustration and anger at someone throwing things at me...I think knowing this is all there is...because she certainly would have said it if there was!! Makes me feel bad for the guy...I mean I already did but 
She fights back and people praise her bravery...he throws a soda can and is toxic and partially to blame is very sexist once again...
It needs challenging...what made him toxic? If I drink a bottle of wine am I toxic? X",2021-01-11T02:40:56Z,5
44,UgwD5dxcxp0RIkZRc9p4AaABAg,Eline Margot,Agree. From what I can tell he admitted to pushing her off him while she was abusing him and he threw a soda can at her after she had thrown them at him.,2021-01-10T14:58:22Z,3

47,UgzMhRpari_J2yMBQAJ4AaABAg,Eline Margot,"Deleting the text would delete evidence, so It's no wonder Paige was doing it and begging Johnny to do it too. She is telling him to break the restraining order, and delete the evidence of her saying it's what Amber wants. :(",2021-01-10T14:54:39Z,2
