I don't think I have ever tried to explain those experiences to anyone. I know my abuser separated me from any support, while creating a false narrative to others. When I finally spoke out, I was the one who looked bad due to the stories that were spread about me. 

I get very frustrated when people say that both people in an abusive relationship are equally abusive. Context is everything. Responding to abuse in desperation, fear and learned helplessness is not being an equal abuser in the relationship.",karen berg,0,2021-08-19T15:21:22Z

26,Ugy73pCru9XiT84kLQ14AaABAg,"I remember when the first allegations against Johnny Depp came out, I was in the supermarket w my partner looking at the tabloids, and I said, ""I know, you're supposed to believe victims, but his ex-wife has come out and said this doesn't sound like him, and yeah, she might be doing that for alimony or something, but like... It feels like someone has been set up. I don't know, but I don't like it."" The cashier and the customer ahead of me overheard this (I have some hearing damage and am naturally always louder than I think I am) and they made eye contact with each other, and rolled their eyes as if to say 'this dumb fangirling broad,' and I hadn't heard the story had shifted since then. I feel weirdly vindicated? But this is so awful, I can't be pleased to discover I might be right, it's terrible whatever the truth is. The stories Rachel tells are very sad as well, and I am glad Rachel is shot of this horrible man, it pains me to hear the sadness and self-doubt in her voice. She did nothing to provoke the abuse from this...man...she was with. Hang in there Rachel, we're all pulling for you (and yes, I'm late to this video, and I've seen what Rachel has said about the guy she was w recently, she's still lucky to be shot of him)!

39,UgzTTS2x0n5NccMHXap4AaABAg,"Their relashionship was toxic, but what I hate was when more came out about Amber abusing Depp, he still lost alot of work, he was treated like the abuser when theres more against her then him, but Amber kept everything, when both where in the wrong, because hes the man he looses jobs and sponsers. 

Amber came across in her court hearings as narssassitic and very up herself. She was so smug and it seemed the more it went on, the more she was just out to spite him. 

Again, I dont belive their relashionship was healthy i just dont think punishments where equail. She shoild of lost just as much as him, and curtanly not be an advocate when she herself was abusing Depp. 

But of corse, men cant get abused can they (sarcasim) and he should of won the Sun Appeal, again  both as bad as each other, but it disgusts me she got the sympathy because shes a woman, and that urks me, especialy as a woman myself",Theifys Nightmare,0,2021-05-24T12:12:01Z

He and Amber were toxic for each other. Amber Heard definitely seems to be the worse of the 2. Johnny has struggled a lot with depression, substance abuse, horrible financial management, and the loss of his mother. That doesn‚Äôt excuse any of his inappropriate behavior, but I think it does shed some light on the root of the problem. Amber Heard, on the other hand, did victims of DV a disservice by lying about what happened and used Johnny for his greater fame.

Second off, I do find it very interesting that some of the first people to start seeing through Amber Heard and believing Johnny Depp were actual survivors of abuse. Even though they  were generally women, they recognized the patterns of behavior between the two of them and identified more with Johnny's position than Amber's. And who believed Amber Heard?

When Amber is caught lying, that means her whole case must be a lie. When Johnny is caught lying, it's largely ignored. 
I'm not saying I'm a huge Amber Heard fan or that I find her completely innocent, but I do have trouble with the idea that Johnny depp is older than her by a lot, richer, more famous, and has been found guilty of beating her multiple times in more than one court of law, has had other lawsuits alleging his violence against other people, and people still refuse to believe he is an abuser himself.",Laura B,0,2021-03-29T15:23:19Z

61,Ugz42kdPW-fn2_Wo0aJ4AaABAg,"At one point in this video you actually got me a little bit teary eyed. It was when you said that feminists need to recognize that just as often women can be abusers and men can be victims. 

As a man who has dealt with abusive relationships before (only one where I was physically abused but others where I had to deal with other forms of abuse like gaslighting and manipulation like you talk about) it felt good to hear you acknowledge that.  When you're a man who has been abused you're so often told  that you don't exist pretty much. That only men can be abusers. Someone once told me to my face that they didn't understand what the big deal about my former fiance hitting me was because in her words ""she couldn't hurt me"". 

I'm just glad that there are people and especially women out there who validate what I've been through and tell me that my gender doesn't make me any less of a victim.",Daniel Lunt,4,2021-03-20T14:15:21Z

72,Ugxb8QZ2Hjp3VuwcEwp4AaABAg,"My mom used to always shift the blame away from her as well. Me, my sister or my father would do something wrong: our fault and we should apologize (fair enough)
She would do anything wrong to us and we dared to ask her to change/hinted that there was a problem: she would cry, say how EVERYTHING she did was wrong, that we were never satisfied, then she would kind of shun us for a while until we gave in and apologized to her (Ôæâ‚óï„ÉÆ‚óï)Ôæâ*:ÔΩ•Ôæü‚úß
One of the worst examples of this is that she ended up revealing that she didn't want to have me (second kid) and that she wasn't in the mood during the night I was conceived either :D (I don't remember exactly what made her say this, but obviously it was to hurt me).
After that I got upset and retreated to be alone for a while, she came to ask what the problem was, I answered it, and then she was like ""oh, it's in the past, I just told it as a trivia fact"" etc etc not apologizing once

I think it was when I decided to never again apologize to her for anything, unless it was something I screwed up really bad",alnklar,0,2021-03-07T05:55:15Z

I'm also a survivor of abuse myself so I had a lot of elevated feelings around the situation that may have contributed to my wanting to believe her. Because of course we want to believe someone when they say they were hurt. Most people ARE being honest when they say that. Its...all really disheartening and I worry people are going to use it to not believe others in high profile cases like this where its so easy to dismiss as drama or whatnot.

Do I believe they had a very toxic relationship where both of them behaved badly & were caught in a cycle of reactions? Yes, absolutely, there is absolutely no way you can be in a relationship with someone who is in hardcore active addiction & not have it be toxic af. I was in a similar toxic relationship with an active addict. He was lovely & charming & all the things...right up until he‚Äôd get loaded & then he became an entirely diff person. 

And yes, down the road of that in some of our fights I would get physical as well. I weighed 120 lb & 5‚Äô5‚Äù, he was 6ft 180 lbs. my violence was in response to all of the psychological & emotional & physical abuse/trauma I was dealing with, abuse & trauma he instigated & perpetuated in our relationship. My violence did very little to no physical harm him in anyway. He was always in physical control of the situation & he was not ever scared of me or any physical harm that I could do to him. However, I was absolutely scared of him & I would do almost anything to get him to show me he loved me, showed me he cared. He would disappear on me for days, I would be an absolute vibrating anxiety-filled mess until he got back so I would do whatever i could to not have that happen. 
Johnny was sober while he was with Vanessa & Winona. Notice who didn‚Äôt come forward - Kate moss.

135,UgzLbtRUtfzMs2Q_BrJ4AaABAg,"Good for you. I understand where you are coming from and due to me too movement Amber appears to be winning regardless. I see the signs in amber of the abuser having been in a toxic relationship. I almost think she wanted to get actually hit so she could do what she is doing now and the worst she could get out of him was some slammed cupboards and possibly a phone thrown at her. I made excuses for my partner as well because their good at making excuses about their own behaviour. My mother was terrible to me and my father let her be terrible thus i can't help myself.

 Unfortunately my mother died only six months after i was born. She wouldn't take treatment for cancer till after i was born which in the late 50's probably didn't make a difference. As a child growing up you deal with certain things and process them to make a bad situation ok. I internalised it and blamed myself for my mothers death so i said to myself you don't deserve a good relationship so i stayed way longer than sanity dictates. In all the years of abuse i took i only once hit back after nearly 36 hrs without sleep due to working two jobs at the time and someone not turning up for their shift meaning i worked two 12 hour shifts straight after finishing my regular day job. I still regret hitting back even though it was basically a backhand slap which ended up being a quarter strength hit because in my overtired state i did react but in the time it took to start the hit by the time it reached it's target i had nearly not made contact. I almost think in today's environment that would be enough to get you abuser status regardless of all the punches hits kicks you may have received yourself. I say this as a male of course.

148,UgwNGuD8wfsBVc_OOK94AaABAg,"I wonder why we so easily say that Johnny was probably as toxic as Amber and basically deserved what he got. He almost died after she injured his finger. She literally almost caused his death, but most are still out here claiming that he was toxic as well. Why do we excuse the perpetrator's behaviour? Cuz she's a woman? It's absolutely ridiculous. And to put that TMZ video into context where Johnny was smashing the cabinet doors in the kitchen: he had just found out that he had lost hundreds of millions of dollars. He didn't have a fight with Amber prior to this. The behaviour was a result of the bad news he got. Amber tried to act all innocent in the recording and the leaked version of this video didn't include the end where Johnny walked out. They left it to the public to imagine what he could've done after throwing the phone in the trash. Just to pain a bad picture of Johnny. He literally left the room. Doesn't exactly paint a picture of an abusive violent person. I wonder why you didn't include the ending of this video where you could see Amber's face and she's smirking cuz she got the video she wanted. Johnny said in court that he might smash things, but would never hurt a woman, especially someone he loves!
When making a video on such a sensitive topic then it's best to do as much research as possible. There are so many court documents and evidence out there that shows how Johnny was set up and made to look like the abuser. He is the victim and has said that only once did she react to the violence in a physical way, by PUSHING Amber away from him. He says in the audio recording that they have to be apart. He has to leave when their fights escalate so that he doesn't end up harming Amber when he's completely pushed into a corner.
I don't know if anyone will even read such a long comment, but I cannot stand the idea of people saying he was toxic as well. You can be toxic, but not physically harm someone. He was assaulted on multiple occasions. Even while laying down in their marital bed was he punched in the face. Like seriously. Stop making excuses for Amber's behaviour. Johnny is a victim of domestic violence and has had his reputation completely ruined by rumours. He has provided tons of evidence for the court only for the judge to completely ignore the evidence and side with Amber cuz ""she was under oath and was compelled to say the truth. And since her story didn't resemble the story being told of her by witnesses on Johnny's side, then she was telling the truth still cuz you know, under oath..."". 
Please people go over to Incredibly Average channel by Brian, then Lost Beyond Pluto and then Stevie J Raw AND also theUmbrellaGuy. They have covered this topic extensively. There are many others I didn't name, but for the name of truth, don't just believe the media narrative and do your own research. And yes, Johnny could've possibly been toxic with his abuse of alcohol and drugs, but he did not deserve to be physically abused and his reputation completely savaged. 
Okay, I'm going to shut up now and send strength to you Rachel. What you went through was absolutely horrible and you didn't deserve to be treated that way.

In my experience that was something that connected to being gaslit into thinking that every relationship is abusive in some way, like every couple fight, throws things, yell, insult each other, or any other list of abuse behaviors. Those comments cemented the idea that no matter who a relationship is with, these elements are always part of it. So, to me when she says she wants him to fight for it, it reminds me strongly of the times when horribly abusive things would happen to my family and we were supposed to brush it off and come back to someone who had just shown how cruel he could be.",Brenna Class-Welch,97,2021-01-18T04:34:35Z

In my personal experience, whenever I tell detailed stories about my trauma and it's a really bad one, I usually start crying just before the ""worst part"", because I'm thinking about the events leading up to it.

People usually think before they speak, so if they're trying to tell you about a traumatic event in as much detail as possible, they're thinking ahead about their story, and usually that's the part when they cry.
I do it, I've seen my friends and family do it, Rachel even does it herself in this very video.

I'm not a body language analyst or anything, but it just seems really suspicious.
Like she's thinking ""oh this is the most traumatic part of the story, so this is where my voice *should* be cracking, right?"".

214,UgzLJgXhDW7GztnXood4AaABAg,"why is it so hard to grasp that in some cases both people in a relationship can be abusive? Depp had long-term severe substance abuse issues of all kinds. Pam Anderson had severe blue bruises all over both her upper arms after she ended the relationship with Depp. he clearly was agressive, disrespectful. and there are reasons he was divorced from his former wife who he has kids with. not bc he is oh so perfect husband material. he leaked secret recordings he did of Amber to the public where he manipulated the convo very obviously. but of course woman haters and bashers gladly ignore the obvious. at 21:10 you're telling a blatant lie and show how uneducated you are about the topic. no, women aren't abusers just as often. statistics significantly show that. and as a real feminist you wouldn't jump on the one case where a woman is still definitely not the only abuser out of 1000s of cases where men are the severely violent, criminal rapey abusers. look at your own case and at the comments, it resembles clearly the official statistics that men are the main abusers in severety and numbers. sad that you claim to be a feminist while spreading clear lies about women and the reality we sadly live in.",jiop kijo,2,2021-01-17T15:29:28Z

Also, she was not crying, she tried to squeeze out some tears and it didn't work, instead she yells at the end. She also doesn't often directly answer questions, instead distracts by telling stories about how she was the victim. 
And she doesn't remember if he slapped her or grabbed her face, or moved her face? Really? So she does remember things in detail but also does not at all?

Edit: when I wrote that I hadn't finished watching this video... but I can't wait to see how this case will play out, she's been outed as the abuser, I hope Johnny Depp can get his money back from her, after he was ordered to give it to her... I think Amber Heard has been claiming Johnny Depp has done this, this and this so much that she even believes it herself...

266,UgxmncGVAUMSxQEdvhF4AaABAg,"I recently got out of a terrible relationship and it wasn't until after I found a few Instagram pages on narcissistic abuse and that sort of thing that the gravity of what happened really hit me because I never talked to friends about it, I was ashamed of myself for ""letting"" those things happen to me. I still find myself having those moments where I start to fall into the cognitive dissonance of the ""kind"" person he showed me when I started pulling away and the abuser he really was. I think back at times and try to unravel the gaslighting. I remember when we'd discuss his behavior and how it was affecting me when things had gotten particularly bad and he was being distant and I felt that he was keeping things from me, I have a hard time expressing my feelings when it comes to those situations and he knew this, and so I asked him if I could write things out, even if i then read it aloud or something, and he told me that was annoying. Then when I attempted to just talk about it through tears and had a hard time getting through a single thought, let alone try to remember specific events, he said obviously I didn't actually have any reason to think he was being distant and I was just overreacting. This time stands out to me because it was such blatant gaslighting and a lot of my fears ended up being true, so I had beat myself up a lot for staying (or moreso, stayed for a little while, left, and then got sucked back into the relationship shortly after, which I now know actually happens a lot in these types of relationships) after I did finally leave and got clarity. I can now more confidently believe that none of what happened was my fault, I was just being abused and manipulated and thats why I didn't think to leave or get help.

There is usually a difference in someone recounting a story while being interrupted by their emotions and when someone is making up a story on the spot.  One thing with liars when they tell a story about an incident the story gets more detailed over time, because the more they tell it the more they feel they have to make it more believable with details.",Sean J,12,2021-01-16T21:57:41Z

I had to flee a relationship from an abusive ex, with my child. I had SO many scary fights and instances during my relationship with him and one thing the police had said was that I should have reported them. I got my restraining order because he continued to harass amd threaten me, but I learned that it is SO important to make a report every time I felt unsafe so when it escalated I would have a case against him. It helped me get my order, keep my fiance and I safe, and best of, get custody of my son.

The second I screamed she was there. I still love that dog more than anything. She's so protective), it was mostly emotionally abusive. We were just bad for each other, but he bullied me into believing that I was too needy to be loved. I began the relationship I'm currently in a month after our messy breakup. I've been with him for over six years now, so I guess I wasn't too needy (This also included 3 years of long-distance in college).

Now that I know you are, I won‚Äôt overly concern myself further. But Christ, I can‚Äôt recall ever feeling so helpless about someone I don‚Äôt know personally.

If it explains any... I‚Äôve never had (and have rarely have even seen) a relationship that didn‚Äôt turn toxic. This sorta situation triggers a fight or flight response, every time. Not my battle, sorry if that oversteps boundaries.

Don‚Äôt take any more shite, girl in any event; you got this.

Edit:

1:12 into the video, this is getting painful; ‚Äú...You don‚Äôt fight for me, you stand up for, you always run away...‚Äù

How‚Äôd she not see he was right there? Where did she think he was then?? Seems to me like he was willing to meet her halfway, but when handling a person with insecurities it‚Äôs not possible to actually deal with the person themselves in any real, effective way.

I knew this was a thing, it‚Äôs major headlines after all; I saw the airing of dirty laundry all over it ages ago & knew neither party was in the clear here. There‚Äôs no reason this should have gone on for as long as it has. Depp‚Äôs career is now in ruins, Heard damaged all her own credibility; its just tragic for both parties.

Being with a narcissist who love bombs you then start flipping is extremely difficult. I stayed in both relationships far too long. It definitely damaged me and now I'm far more quickly defensive and don't trust anyone. I'm glad you didn't stay too long. If you address your feelings and have support, get therapy if you need it, you will get through. You're story is one I 100% relate to as well as Johnny's.what u said about abuse victims reacting badly, you're so right.

I told myself that the issues I was having weren't that big a deal and that I could handle it because ""that's what a good girlfriend does. She compromises."" But, no.

Watching further and hearing more about your ex and Amber's behavior, I'm reminded of my dad when he was married to my mom, and I'm also reminded of my former step-mother as well. My dad has grown up a lot and he's acknowledged his wrongs somewhat (he grew up in a broken household so while it doesn't excuse his actions it explains why he took so long to change). His second wife was the abuser. I don't know if she abused my dad but she abused me and she abused my brother. It was mostly verbal. Idk how I managed to live to 21 tbh. Also I am so upset about your ex's behavior when it came to driving under the influence.
