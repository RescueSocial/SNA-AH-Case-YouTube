Not even fucking close. He kowtows to that gold digging, home wrecking, skank right in front of his own wife Lisa Bonet and rubs into Lisa, and Ms. Turd and her Herd can't decide if they perfer the kalbasa or the peach. The trip down is twice as fast coming down as it is going up. And that prank about him ripping the pages of the last book out of the book, the jokes on all of us, neither can read, and one more thing, for Big Jay, quit the American Indian acting roles, you're embarrassing us, we protect our women, respect them and most of all love them, I really can't say what I'm seeing when you're on it. Oh... can you get me a wild berry herbal tea while you're up for Amburger Turd's celery juice with a squeeze of lemon juice, boy?",clacoose007vibes,0,2021-07-13T18:42:38Z

Many of the supporters of #fireAmberHeard are not even fans of Johnny Depp but are affected by Amber's lies because it triggers their own trauma of abusers gaslighting, minimizing, and projecting lies onto the victim. In this case, the victim is Johnny Depp.",Vadzim Arzamasau,2,2021-07-09T19:05:42Z
