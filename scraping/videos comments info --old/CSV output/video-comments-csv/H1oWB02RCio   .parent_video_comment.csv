She became popular bc of JD, NOT bc she is a decent actress! I never saw Aquaman, and I wouldn‚Äôt ever pay to see the other one! She probably blackmailed someone at Warner Brothers to keep the job!!

33,Ugx-Gl7Lu-V1A7vp1414AaABAg,"Not a very wise decision.  She has been proven to be a psychopath and continuous liar but let's keep giving her roles and blacklist Johnny Depp who I believe did nothing wrong except marry a crazy gold digger.  I guess as long as the studio realizes most people will not watch any movie she is in it's their stupid decision to make.

34,UgyhJL63Pi89ORvv9GF4AaABAg,WB will ditch Amber Heard but not based on her toxicity. They will drop her because she is ageing out badly. She is nearly 35 and not looking good for it. L'Oreal will drop her for the same reason. Karma is hitting her.,Kid Charlemagne,2,2020-08-20T16:20:06Z

50,Ugwx5zElqjaXTKPI2Ol4AaABAg,"Um. It wasn't a great performance. It was a decent performance. Fans like the character of Mera in general and were thrilled to see her portrayed on the big screen. Mere was decently written, decently cast, and decently played. It wasn't bad, but you make it sound outstanding and that the fans watched for the actress. Maybe Amber Heard fans, but most people were comic book fans, DCU fans, Mamoa fans, or just movie goers who don't really can.
