1,Ugx-cTbGlt6m3v7Vv5N4AaABAg,Still a Mitch in my book,I had to dislike the video because of that,2021-02-14T18:14:56Z,1
2,UgzihlpIU2CW6BsWCjh4AaABAg,Quizzly Bear,I'm pretty sure it's Emilia Clarke that is replacing her not Margot Robie.,2021-02-14T05:32:57Z,1
3,UgzihlpIU2CW6BsWCjh4AaABAg,Madame Feast,Who cares. Anyone in the world other than Amber Heard,2021-02-13T20:16:56Z,6
4,UgzihlpIU2CW6BsWCjh4AaABAg,Erin Frazier,Better than amber heard playing it though,2021-02-13T19:28:15Z,7
5,Ugwml4uH_JcNUrrXzuB4AaABAg,Joanna Slawecka,"@Just Josh Yeah I think so too. I also think that casting Emilia Clarke would be super confusing for the viewer. As much as I liked Momoa+Clarke duo in Game of Thrones, I think that's exactly the reason why they shouldn't/ they won't go for that option.",2021-02-14T20:02:01Z,0
6,Ugwml4uH_JcNUrrXzuB4AaABAg,Just Josh,@Joanna Slawecka true but she is playing Harley so I don‚Äôt think they can have her play both roles,2021-02-14T14:12:17Z,0

8,UgzSAZVe73Dk7rcKKcB4AaABAg,brittany parks,Yeah I got that my opinion is that anyone would be better than the psychotic narcissist but given that February's half over they're not likely to replace her.,2021-02-14T18:05:35Z,0

17,Ugzn2CEMPKMOncH0vYl4AaABAg,Kat Reno,"She's a known domestic abuser! She was physically and emotionally abusive to her former girlfriend... then Johnny, and probably others as well. Once an abuser, always an abuser (unless they have sought help, and are actively working on themselves). And it takes a very BRAVE man to admit that he was abused, let alone by a women. Our society are terrible to MEN who are abused and admit to it. The stigma that only women get abused needs to stop. He was literally pleading with people to listen, and believe him. Bless his ‚ù§
Oh, and she lied about the 7 million dollars that she received from the divorce, that she pledged to ""donate to charity""! She NEVER DID! There's a special place in hell for those who LIE to dying children! Disgusting, deplorable, despicable said so wrong!

28,UgwT7JnbsAkzkYX06st4AaABAg,Sandra Cervantes,@Madison Rudloff no ik that i ment if she's being replaced cuz I've been hearing of how she is getting more roles and when johnny got taken off his which isn't fair since he is the victim,2021-02-13T21:39:06Z,0
