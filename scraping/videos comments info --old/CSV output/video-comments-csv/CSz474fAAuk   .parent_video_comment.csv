I know this business, people are not fired for what they let you think they were, you might push them say something you'll regret one day, if you keep pretending you know how all this works.  Bad publicity doesn't play into hiring and firing, because it doesn't exist. Firings can lead from bad set behavior to petty personal issues, but nothing related to public relations.  Any press works.  Now age can play a part in how much they tolerate, how pretty you are.  She's got 5 years before her best before date pops off, it dies out before men.

Because generalizing the movie industry is a little inefective, if you call people out for double standards when they're just trying to avoid cancel culture by behaving how we'd want them to with johnny in the first place. Just because its with someone we don't like... idk.

I'm a little dubious. Obviously every part of me wants karma, for her to lose her entire career and to end up homeless and all that crap. But if we don't hold to our own principles then are we not also guilty of double standards?

I said it in another video, I'll say it again:

""You know, Dean Martin boycotted when the studio fired Marilyn Monroe from her last film... he said, if she wasn't in it, they could forget about him.  Imagine if Jason Momoa and/or Nicole Kidman break their silence on the matter and stand up against the stigma that domestic violence is only a man hurting a woman; what if they say, ""well wait a minute, we don't condone this.""  

Marilyn Monroe ended up getting rehired thanks to Dean but unfortunately, she passed before the film was finished.  It was called, ""Something's Got to Give.""  Dean stood up for his friend.  It'd be great if Jason, who's an advocate against bullying, stood up for men.""

There is no DOUBLE STANDARD if DIFFERENT COMPANIES behave in different ways.  Disney fired Johnny from Pirates, yes, but Warner Brothers decided not to care about personal life BS and him on for Fantastic Beasts, as they did keep Amber Heard for Aquaman.  Warner Brothers is behaving EXACTLY HOW YOU SAY YOU WANT THEM TO but you're making a big stink about it because Disney let Johnny go.  Warner Brothers have no control over what Disney did.  But you're demanding that they fire Amber because Disney fired Johnny.  Those are some SJW level logic contortions, there, judging ALL OF HOLLYWOOD as one group that where somehow all companies are responsible for what one company did.
If WB fires Amber, as you demand, then they have to fire Johnny, too, or they are not being fair, and the whole of cancel culture escalates yet again.  I have no respect for your ""cancel culture for thee, but not for me"" stance, here.  I am very disappointed.",Darkwater,0,2020-09-02T19:44:38Z

""You know, Dean Martin boycotted when the studio fired Marilyn Monroe from her last film... he said, if she wasn't in it, they could forget about him.  Imagine if Jason Momoa and/or Nicole Kidman break their silence on the matter and stand up against the stigma that domestic violence is only a man hurting a woman; what if they say, ""well wait a minute, we don't condone this.""  

Marilyn Monroe ended up getting rehired thanks to Dean but unfortunately, she passed before the film was finished.  It was called, ""Something's Got to Give.""  Dean stood up for his friend.  It'd be great if Jason, who's an advocate against bullying, stood up for men.""

And, dude, the only way we're going to change the world for the better and stop abusers is to STOP SILENCING and START üëè holding üëè abusers üëè accountable üëè",fragmentarybutterfly,182,2020-09-02T19:36:18Z
