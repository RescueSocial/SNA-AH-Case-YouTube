My Childrens father is a narcissistic abusive piece of crap (although thankfully not upheld in society the way johnny is) & i was USUALLY the one all worked up & crazy sounding & struggling to think straight while he remained calm.... i also said things that i wouldve never said under even unimaginable stress because of the years of abuse,.. i hate to admit it but living with that kind of abuse while trying to continue to protect that person for years will eventually lead to at least a few instances of “reactive abuse”, at least emotionally,. As in you hold it all in (to avoid conflict & aboud hurting the abuser) for as long as you can & then you finally say something hateful & nasty & that often makes you look bad,.. what she said just happened to be something that triggers even other abuse victims,.. the “no one will believe you because you’re the man”,.. that could easily be because he had been manipulating her & threatening her into feeling like no one would believe her because of his fame & because he’s better at making people believe what he has to say,... its so hard to read them because they truly believe a lot of the craziness that comes out of their mouths,... their father did A LOT of the things amber says & we can see that johnny did,..acted in many similar ways from what ove already seen,. Was much much much worse when he was on drugs or alcohol,..i just wish people knew how manipulative these narcissists can be & what it does to the other person,.. everyone expects the abuse victim to be an ANGEL that never once tried to fight back or took the low road & said something to hurt them back eventually.... i heard a lot of people saying it looks like theyre both in the wrong & its super messed up to lose all sympathy for someone because they didnt react how you THINK you would be able to react in every single moment of the abuse.... im autistic & im a people pleaser & have basically zero self worth- & for a hundred other reasons, am the last person that wouldve ever been nasty in response to abuse,.. but after so long & when you can’t get away (im also co-dependent, struggle to see or understand ill intent, & have an overdeveloped sense of empathy that makes it hard to “abandon” someone”) - anyone will eventually respond in nastier ways than they ever thought they would.. & a lot of that is because they can’t imagine how horrible the abuse is or what it does to you- especially the fact that they can manipulate people around them into believing theyre in the right while they do it all,.. ive seen them even triangulate the familys victim against the victim & get them to believe them instead....",2021-08-04T08:16:35Z,1

26,UgyCrDd-_eFB0r0VD254AaABAg,Shifting Mercury,"I totally agree with everything you said. Here is the thing. People can’t get over the fact that someone could be a likable and loving person AND be capable of violence. But they don’t understand what addiction and mental health issues can do to the brain. Johnny isn’t a psychopath. He is lost. That doesn’t mean is actions shouldn’t be harshly condemned. They should be. But it explains why it’s so difficult for people to digest. I’ve seen drugs and alcohol make the sweetest people turn into maniacs and lash out. I think it’s important to look at this situation honestly and talk about how someone in that situation should address it. They should take responsibility and they should face their own demons. Not run from them. Johnny knows that it is the substance abuse and the jealousy and emotional issues that take him over the edge. He can gain control over this by focusing on taking his recovery serious and seeking therapy. That is what he should do. But I think he’s surrounded by a bunch of yes men who won’t tell him the truth. Amber said he drives those people away. It’s sad because I don’t see this ending well for him if he doesn’t confront his demons. 

I feel terrible for Amber. What a brave, bold woman she is. I hope she realizes that there are those out there who believe her and support her. People love putting her into this category of some sort of manipulative, money hungry, femme fatale. As they have done to so many women who speak out against powerful men. It’s this default template they force every woman into who the public doesn’t want to hear. When they pretend that this is about male victims not being heard, it really annoys me too. Johnny didn’t claim to be a victim until he had to defend himself. It’s a defense strategy. They are dismissing the actual victims testimony and dismissing all witnesses that support her story without any proof of deception. They are the ones hurting domestic abuse victims. Men aren’t always taken seriously but neither are women. Look at all the people who voted for Trump even though all those women came forward. Because it was inconvenient to them. They couldn’t acknowledge the truth. People are so easily open to the powers of suggestion too.  They hear what the defense says and start pretending that it is established truth. It’s ridiculous. I’m glad there are still reasonable people out there who aren’t letting bias rule over truth. :)",2021-04-02T22:49:13Z,3

CBS4 talked to Carleigh inside her hospital room where she's recovering from one of the darkest nights of her life.

“And he tried to rip my tongue out with his bare fingers from here all the way up to here and he succeeded, half way. He got the right side halfway. He got it halfway ripped out,” Carleigh said.

Talking through the pain of having her tongue reconstructed and bruises and bite marks all over her body, Carleigh recalled the traumatizing episode with her mother by her side. She says she and her now ex-boyfriend Ryan Cameron, 26, returned home from a wedding Saturday night with some friends. After launching a verbal assault things got physical.

“He locked our friends outside of our house and ran to the bathroom and locked us in the bathroom,” Carleigh said.

That's where she says he  beat her until she passed out. She tells us Ryan locked the group of friends out of the home during the attack. Those friends called police, a move The Julian Center CEO, Catherine O'Connor says may have saved Carleigh's life.

""Those people intervened. They did what they could to stop the situation and they called the police to make sure something happened to protect this victim and that’s exactly what should happen,” O'Connor said.

Carleigh's mother says she didn't see any warning signs, but these visible signs won't define her baby girl.

""But because she’s such a beautiful person inside and out. Her strength and beauty is inside and the scars will heal and in time so will her heart and I’m incredibly proud of you,” mom Amy Ballard said.

Carleigh says after a loving, two-year relationship the mental, verbal and physical abuse just started a month ago. The 25-year-old nursing assistant says she wants this story to warn others not to ignore the signs and know this is not what love looks like.""
Hard to find the story online, but I did here: https://cbs4indy.com/news/victim-of-brutal-attack-says-ex-boyfriend-tried-to-rip-her-tongue-out/

Again, just because parents are not watching the relationship closely, doesn't mean abuse isn't there. That's why the judge kept the situation in mind when he said 12 out of 14 assaults on Amber Heard were proven.

The abuse escalated in her relationship quickly, but maybe control happened earlier. The others around called to intervene FOR her.",2021-01-23T09:17:33Z,1

39,UgwsZ_jvYe-EHXF3z6F4AaABAg,Motivator Network,"Exactly. Amber Heard won in the UK because of extensive evidence. Here's more evidence:
""Witnesses saw Amber’s injuries and her evidence:

Josh Drew: December 2015, Los Angeles — Rocky told me that something wasn’t right and sent me home while she looked for Amber. About 10–15 minutes later I received a message from Rocky saying something like “he beat the sh** out of her again” and told me she was looking after her. I remember being told that they had reached out to a nurse to do a concussion check. 16. Rocky told me that there was a big fight and Johnny had head butted Amber, ripped out pieces of her hair and smothered her and that they had to call Dr Kipper’s office to get Amber a concussion check. I also talked to Amber about it. 17. I saw Amber that night and the next day saw her injuries: she had bruising around both eyes which extended down the bridge of her nose and her forehead was red…
21 May 2016, Los Angeles: I met Jerry downstairs and gave him the phone. He took a few steps to walk away and then turned and asked me ·Is she okay?”. I said something like, “Are you f** kidding me? He beat the sh** out of her again and you guys stood by and watched it”

Melanie Inglessis: “I remember numerous conversations in which Amber would tell me that Johnny had abused her. Just about every conversation alternated between her love for him and the problem of his abuse. These conversations took place well before she divorced Johnny and got a restraining order against him.7.The first time I saw the physical evidence of Johnny’s abuse was before Amber was scheduled to appear on the Late Show with James Corden. Amber and I were supposed to go bowling the night before, but Amber told me that she could not join because she had been in a bad fight with Johnny. I came over to the Eastern Building to apply makeup before her TV appearance, and as I walked into her kitchen, I saw writing on the countertop in gold marker. Attached hereto as Exhibit 1 is a true and correct copy of a picture that depicts the writing I saw that night. I also saw that a number of Amber’s possessions had been smashed or destroyed.”

IO Tillet: “The reports of violence started with a kick on a private plane, then it was shoves and the occasional punch, until finally, in December, she described an all-out assault and she woke up with her pillow covered in blood. I know this because I went to their house. I saw the pillow with my own eyes. I saw the busted lip and the clumps of hair on the floor. I got the phone call immediately after it happened, her screaming and crying, a stoic woman reduced to sobs.”

In 70,000 texts: “Depp adds, “Let’s drown her before we burn her!!! I will f** her burnt corpse afterwards to make sure she’s dead.”

Sources say he paid his first wife, Lori Anne Allison, $1.25 million to keep quiet after he allegedly left a long ranting message in which he repeatedly used the N-word. The previously unreported settlement was accomplished using fictitious names to avoid scrutiny, with Richard Green serving as the stand-in for Johnny Depp.

Photos, audios, texts, witnesses, and data proved Amber Heard is a victim of domestic abuse.

Amber is a spokesperson for the ACLU, Cyber Civil Rights Initiative, World Identity Network, and United Nations Gender Equality SDG5.""
