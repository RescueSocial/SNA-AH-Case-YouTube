Legally they have a contract with her to abide to, and they knew this and was approached several times by scarletts team, to come to an agreement, but disney didnt give it any thought and released it on streaming. its not about being greedy but about princible, if they had approached they could have gotten together for a new better deal for both sides of the story.",2021-08-21T05:13:28Z,0

But I'll answer. I never believed a word she said, even when this all started, her story never felt right for me. For context, I was in an abusive relationship, and her retelling of the situation just didn't add up for me. 
Her lying about being a victim of abuse takes credibility away from real victims because people will then question whether the next person to come out against domestic abuse will be speaking the truth or ""pulling an Amber Heard"".
