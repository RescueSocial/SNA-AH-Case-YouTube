8,UgwZjkTjZ7oFA_seY4R4AaABAg,"Moral of the story: Men, be VERY CAREFUL of the woman you choose to be with.

As such, as men, we need to move carefully around women. If a woman shows interest in you, play your cards right and find out her intentions before fully diving in‚Ä¶ no pun intended‚Ä¶ 

Don‚Äôt wanna end up with an Amber Heard in your bed. Some women out here may look beautiful but are crazy on the inside. Do not base your choice in women on looks alone.

Plus wasn‚Äôt the case in the UK only about the article that was written about Johnny being an abuser? Everyday we hear more news about AH lying or fabricating evidence and we have even literally heard her admit to hitting Johnny and admitting that when AH gets angry she hits him that he walks away. Her own family has backed Johnny oh and what about the video proof from the police cam that doesn‚Äôt show and violence that AH said Johnny did. I used to watch these guys now i refuse to listen to them and yes I will not be watching anything Warner bros. Puts out and especially anything AH is in.

I've been a fan of her ever since she starred in the short lived Hidden Palms series and followed her rising career ever since.  This notions that she was just some gold digger are moronic because she was doing quite well for herself before Depp came along. Yes she hasn't had many roles in top A listed movies but she's also been around for about 30 years less then Johnny and has many years ahead of her.  His career was already slowly dwindling, and this really just seems like a sad attempt for him to remain relevant. Yes he's also a great actor and done many great movies.

NO, they did not look at all the evidence, in fact, they ignored tons of them as stated in their own filing. They also ignored the Police cameras. WB's investigation means NOTHING, and I know that as an ex-WB employee on the film side, I know how they operate. It's simple as this. WB made a huge mistake in their decision, they regretted pushing Johnny out as all their decision were based on what the mainstream media said, and at that time they were all in AH's favour. What they didn't take into account was how the mainstream media were manipulated and biased from the start due to tons of reasons.
Oh yes, you say the ""you and I wasn't there"" argument  - that's garbage. The court wasn't there either! At the end of the day, everyone should and are taking the information that AH and Deep have given us and that information is the same ones that are given to the courts. We analysed each piece of evidence, each statement and decide for ourselves, and the vast majority that done this end up siding with Johnny. Why? Not strictly from his evidence but actually from AH's insane levels of contradictions. You should try it rather than dismissing the world that they are idiots for researching on Google.

The newspaper claimed that their statement was true, and libel places the burden of proof on Johnny as the plaintiff to prove the accusations were false. He failed to do so, so the newspaper is presumed to be truthful and the libel claim thrown out. WB is talking out the side of its mouth on who it decides to ""protect"" and why, but I do support pushing against social media canceling.

235,UgxOE49RFj8eSYKgzw54AaABAg,"What it has to do with Aquaman 2 is that Johnny Depp was fired based on accustations. Before any court rulings came down he was fired.

*EDIT: Johnny left Fantastic Beast after he lost his libel case. It was stated in one report he decided to leave the project but was paid his full salary*

Over time it came out that Amber herself was abusive to Johnny yet there where/are no reprocussions for her actions thus proving a double standard mentality when it comes to abuse victims regarding men and women.
Now I am not saying I want Amber fired or forced from anything, I actually enjoyed her in Aquaman as Mera but if both parties are accusing each other and there is more legitimate evidence that Amber was abusive to Johnny then why was he fired over accusations and she suffers no penalty?",Fact Based Opinion,11,2021-07-30T21:03:10Z

First of all, there is statements of his ex wife that claims that it is unusual behavior for Johny and she had not witnessed such behavior. Second there is leaked audio where Amber says very danming things relating to the case. Amyhow, it was rushed decision from WB because North American case is main one and based on its decision can be grounds for appeal in UK.
