Rumours of Amber Heard being fired from the Aquaman franchise have emerged again, but they are reportedly not true

Several reports of Amber Heard being fired from Aquaman 2 have emerged online, leading the actress to trend on social media. The reports have been debunked by The Hollywood Reporter staff writer Ryan Parker, who took to social media to state he’s been told by a “reliable source"" that the reports of Heard’s alleged firing are “inaccurate.""

Following the emergence of the reports on Sunday, Parker tweeted, “Told by a reliable source that reports of Amber Heard being fired off ‘Aquaman 2’ are inaccurate.""

Amber Heard Strongly Reacts to 'Paid Campaign' for Her Removal from Aquaman 2


Johnny Depp Wants Defamation Trial Against Amber Heard Postponed As It Clashes With 'Fantastic Beasts 3' Shoot

This is not the first time rumours of the actress being fired have spread, seemingly stemming from her public legal battle with ex-husband Johnny Depp. Both Depp and Heard have contested the other was physically and verbally abusive during their relationship.


Depp has already been fired from Warner Bros.’ Fantastic Beasts franchise, which also caused some to wonder why Heard wasn’t receiving the same fate, reported 

Heard plays Xebellian princess Mera in the DCEU, ever since her first appearance in 2017’s Justice League. She went on to have a prominent role in 2018’s Aquaman and will reprise the part next month for Zack Snyder’s Justice League.",Devendra _Bhopi,1,2021-05-03T18:29:01Z

When you see a blockbuster movie do you run a background check on everyone involved? You wouldn't want to ever watch another blockbuster film again based on your findings. Same goes with almost anything you watch. The relationship sounded toxic to me. Was Johnny Depp abusive? I don't think so, but only the two of them know that. I think it's funny how people overreact to pots and pans being thrown. I've known people who have stabbed, cut off limbs, struck someone's head with a hammer, and done far worse things.

13,Ugy7h0XGfQN6Jd2HWHJ4AaABAg,"Hey guys - #1.  Where is that petition as I do want to sign I???.  #2 I agree with your whole outlook on this farce of a situation.  After reading and researching plus all of the legal evidence shown that she was by no means a victim.  No way.  She had a plan and that was from the beginning to use J.D.  She is not an actress of any calibre specially when you look at what happened with Katie Holmes (now this is a woman who paid her dues and grew the talent that was already there in the first place); Warner Bros. is in hot waters because it seems their main goal is to use people and capitalize on what they can get out of them.  They deserve all the hardship their actions from the past up til now has gotten them..  JD has been raked over the coals and dropped without shame (ok so they had to pay him a great amount and I believe he deserved whatever he got) and, he deserves to be granted a public apology and to be reinstated.  Now we all know he made a BAD decision with his choice and has been paying dearly for it.  Enough is enough.  When I think of all of the other actresses past and presently who have been real victims, who have had to suffer real ndignities from the powers that be; makes me want to puke.  Finally something is being done to form a movement that is now strong enough to hold people accountable and this person has the gall to do and act in a manner so demeaning of JD and of all these other women as well as the rest of us females is really Unacceptable.  She will continue being a selfish, self-centered person that she is until something happens where it will devastate her so totally, that maybe, just maybe she'll learn how to really become a decent human being.

really sad and disappointing that politics play a role in every aspect of life. 
Especially the things that we enjoy. I understand that both Johnny Depp, and 
Amber Heard have both done not so good things in their personal lives. Depp had his Pirates of the Caribbean contract canceled and Heard is about to be kicked out of the DC universe. But I believe that if you are a true comic fan then go watch the movies for that reason. Let the court system sort out the Depp and 
Heard personal issues.
For those of you wanting to boycott Aquaman 2. Think about all of the workers behind the scenes who depend on the successes of the movie for their livelihood. Also if you are a true comic book fan like me then please support the industry. Too many actors and actresses have been canned because of petty politics. Megan Fox was kicked out of the transformer franchise, 
Andrew Garfield was kicked out of Marvel for saying unflattering words about the president of Sony, Netflix's Luke Cage was canceled because Mike Colter spoke his mind on social media. Gal Gadot as wonder woman was almost canned just because she is an Israeli, The list goes on and on. Please support an industry that makes life more fun and enjoyable.

If I boycotted every celebrity that did or said something stupid, I'd never be able to watch a movie or TV show ever again. Why so many people get so involved in the matters of celebrities is beyond me.

Not a single one of you idiots(not necessarily the two hosts, people in general) taking sides in this whole mess has a clue what went on. You haven't seen hardly any of the evidence. You saw a video that painted her in a bad light. That video does nothing to exonerate Depp. I suspect they were both abusive, and Depp obviously has alcohol and drug problems which doesn't help him in this situation either. Most people take Depp's side because he's the far more famous one. Either way, I won't take sides. I hope justice, whatever that is, is served. I also wish both well.

259,UgxtTBoPT-fq4wETXnt4AaABAg,"People get frustrated by is the use of toxic relationship is because there is zero evidence of johnny depp being verbally abusive, mentally abusive or unfaithful to Amber heard.  This narrative or categorizing of the relationship as mutually toxic has only risen out of the pushing by her team about his substance abuse problems. So it all get swirled together - her abusive behaviour( hitting, pushing, throwing things at him, verbally demeaning him, putting his appearance and career down, cheating on him and gaslighting, moving numerous friends into his property so he's essentially outnumbered and isolated) and his addict behaviour (drinking or doing drugs, nothing to do or towards her, his is self damaging behaviour not abuse to his partner). It's false equivalancy and does not a toxic relationship make. This is the strategy she used in court, he does drugs therefore anything she does that there are numerous witnesses to is irrelevant because he gets messed up so that's as bad as abusing your partner. Its buying into a narrative she pushed that is flawed at best and dangerous at worst.  Also, would you label it as toxic if there was so much evidence of a man behaving the way amber does towards a woman? A woman with addiction problems with zero evidence, a woman has done nothing other than harm herself? No. i suspect the man would be labelled as a predator and abuser. Someone who targeted somebody vulnerable for personal gain.  A toxic relationship is a couple who poison each other mutually, cheat on each other, lie to each other, don't physically respect each others boundaries, put each other down - as bad as each other are detrimental to each others lives, equally and similarly.  The only person doing any of those things towards her partner was Amber, this is backed up by numerous witnesses, changing stories and evidence.  An addiction does not make you as bad as an abuser, nor being a woman does not negated or reduce being an abuser. This is what i feel is happening when this gets labelled as toxic.  It minimises her dangerous and highly disturbing behaviour towards someone who may not be perfect, but only ever defended themselves and left arguments/ fights whenever they started (as she herself berates him for in tapes), repeatedly tried to repear the relationship, give her what she wanted to stop her unreasonable behaviour,  even going as far as in the midst of this taking a role in a film he knew was awful that she was in (London fields) to try and help her career.

311,UgxXTy3E6h4rgbqF22p4AaABAg,"This does sort of bring up an interesting question that is somewhat related to this. Can you still like an actor's performance from a past movie after said actor has been disgraced? For example, we now know some pretty dark and damning stuff about Kevin Spacey. But does that affect how we can view some of his past performances in films such as ""American Beauty"" or in ""Baby Driver""? Just to name a couple of his more well known films. 

Also, this is probably the most interesting case that involves Hollywood actors and doing things that are clearly wrong. Let me clarify a bit because I probably said that weird. Whenever you hear allegations being brought forth to an actor (like sexual assault) it most likely ends with people now being against that actor. BUT that really isn't the case here. I can't speak to Depp and Heard's relationship, but based on what I have heard it does sound like they are both guilty when it comes to verbal and emotional abuse to some extent. Sometimes people are just in a relationship where neither one of them are the clear cut good or bad guy. They let the other person get in their head and allow themselves to behave and do things that they normally wouldn't do in any other relationship (a comedic fictional example is Ron & Tammy from ""Parks & Rec"". Obviously fictional and exaggerated, but you get the idea).

But I think this is the only major example where the hate and damnation is aimed not at the one being accused but at the accuser. Again, I have come across the same stuff most of you probably have and chances are there is a lot no one has seen yet. And it is clear this is far from over. But I think this might end up having bigger influence on a bunch of things we don't normally think about. After the Weinstein accusations and the Me Too movement, will society go back to scrutinizing people accusing others of abuse and sexual assault? Will this push society to fully recognize that men can be actual victims of abuse just as much as women? How will Hollywood react to further incidents like this (depending on how this Heard and Depp situation eventually resolves) and how will that reflect how we see Hollywood going further? How will this affect how we deal with every case of abuse and sexual assault going further into the future?",Dr. Cinema,0,2020-11-13T00:59:15Z

Even if I got pissed at the wife, and even if I was stupid enough to stay around if it was toxic, if I were.......in a relationship that I wouldn't give up on, I would probably just leave and avoid conflict, even verbal ones that aren't productive.

364,UgylPBDhk5oiNzezHmN4AaABAg,"Here comes a littlebit diffrent opinion about this nonsense..... We are talking here about the ""Fanstastic Beast"" franchise / ""Harry Potter""  universe..... Did everyone here SAW the last ....ehhh... (sort of) film?  Fanstastic Beast 2 (The Crimes Of Grindelwald) is by far the worst movie in the whole Harry Potter universe with a horrible 'plot' and a trainwreck of script AND a Johnny Depp who didn't tried to pretend that he cares about his role. Seriously, is this really about whether JD continues to play the role? For me, the whole hysterics about the casting decision is purely academic because this film series is dying anyway. 
A lot of people here confuse actor J.D. with the private person. He is/was a good actor. J.D. has a not so glorious history over the decades as far as his life partners are concerned. He himself once admitted in an interview that he never cared about his first wife, not even on the day he married her. What does that say about him and his character? But I don't want to take sides with A.H. either. She doesn't seem like someone I want to be with in private either. It's a war of roses with both of them. There is only one difference between the two. JD has now lost a lawsuit.",DoktorPerryCox,0,2020-11-12T23:14:26Z

He admitted to pushing her to get away. He admitted they accidentally knocked heads when he was trying to restrain her from hitting Him. She claimed it was a head butt.

379,UgwzbaTvj5dc9bUtB5J4AaABAg,"Can someone give me a brief explanation of why this is? My understanding of the situation is that Heard accused Depp of abuse, he, in turn, accused her of the same. Depp then filed a suit against Sun in UK claiming that their reporting that he was guilty of abusing Heard was libel, a judge ruled that the reports in Sun were accurate and the judge seems to have gone out of their way to state that 12 of the allegations against Depp were true. Why is there so much hatred for Heard if a court has ruled that her allegations were true?

I've found a lot of time that people in the YT comment section, most especially at the height of the metoo movement, were very much advocating for an ""innocent until proven guilty"" approach, but that seems antithetical to the approach I see being taken now.",Your Name Here,0,2020-11-12T22:56:58Z

They are both way too toxic for the billón dollar brands which are part of and will distract attention from the movies. Even if they replace do Johnny with Mads Mikkelson the press will still ask about it which isn’t fair to the cast and crew. Frankly I’d make the 3rd Fantastic  Beasts the last one instead of doing the planned 5 movies. It hasn’t done too well commercially especially crimes of Grindlewald, JK Rowling’s horrific comments, the video of Ezra Miller which has died down and now this whole thing with Johnny Depp. Cut your losses and let it go. 

And in terms of Aquaman again Mera is a huge part of the Aquaman mythos it’s also the DCEU’s first billion dollar movie that’s  in some connected universe. The character and mythos is greater than the actor who plays them.

The verdict just doesn't make any sense. If it was that they were both violent fine. But painting Heard as a totally innocent victim while she's on tape admitting it numerous times and while there are texts mentioning her violence against him is absolutely frustrating. The judge basically took her word over everything else, even over impartial witnesses and concrete evidence. Even though some incidents were not proven, he said he accepts that they happened just because. He said her tone was sarcastic in the tapes and didn't take them into consideration. He said that it's irrelevant if she assaulted him. Cmon it's crazy. She and her witnesses fell into so many contradictions, yet he believed all of them while he dismissed the ones from Johnny's side for no particular reason. He said he believes Amber cause she was under oath, even though everyone is under oath in court. The situation is crazy and Johnny Depp is losing his career because of one very obviously biased judge, who even implied that drugs and alcohol equal domestic abuse. On the freaking tape she's telling him ""You can't run away every fight"" how is he a wife beater? She's mocking him for leaving their fights, what kind of scared victim would mock their abuser for leaving the fights?",athinamjd,253,2020-11-12T22:44:50Z
