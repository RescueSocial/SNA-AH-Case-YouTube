61,Ugx97lEe1DWTcQPItGt4AaABAg,BIG Daddio John Bamford,"@scary cupcakes I LUV Margot Robbie as an actress, and LUVD her in Suicide Squad. Her n Will Smith really MADE that film. As far as the character Harley Quinn goes  I LUVD hert in the batman animated series, ESP the Gotham Sirens epidoe with poison Ivy.

I ALSO luv the Harley Quinn Animated Series....if you want the story of Harley Quinn after she leaves the Joker, id HIGHLY recommend dat

But yeah I CANT support ANYHING dat pushes Feminist n SJW agenda. Political movies just arent dat good, dats not necessarily the actors fault, as actors like Margot Robbie n Ewan McGreggor are STILL GREAT regardless. Both did good jobs in BOP, but the film itself was TERRIBLE!",2020-04-04T03:48:09Z,0
