227,UgwLnmnrWqhCUPmOzFN4AaABAg,Tara Walsh-Arpaia,"He lost, as I say elsewhere here, because he was badly advised by money hungry vultures (lawyers-which in the UK come in two varieties: solicitors and barristers and he would have had to have both). I haven't read the case, as a lawyer, but I would not be surprised if the ending reads something to the effect that insufficient concrete evidence was adduced on the central issue by either side, hence the judge could not actually judge either way. That would mean he did not lose but he didn't win either. See, badly advised by bad lawyers. Never touch a defamation case unless you can demonstrably and concretely prove (not argue) that it is false. Even then, the UK papers can say almost whatever they like. Hence, I would have advised him to use his PR machine wisely and stay out of Court for this reason. Not to mention, what did he end up paying for that!",2021-06-20T17:58:32Z,2

I’ve never behaved anywhere close to how she has. In the entertainment industry, you must be a super hero to try and find someone normal, IMO. It seems like every other celebrity has really loose wiring in their heads. As much as the financial security would be nice, especially with health issues, if I was a celebrity, I’d never even think about trying to date. It’s hard enough out here in the normal world.
