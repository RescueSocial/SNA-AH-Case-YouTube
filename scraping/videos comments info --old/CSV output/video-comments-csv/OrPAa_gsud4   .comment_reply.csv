10,Ugxo6EQrz3m1bWYEKSJ4AaABAg,Michael Keller,"@Purpura Draco well my Ex was diagnosed - yet rejected every help that was offered to her. As I came to know several victims of BPD-persons, I came to the conclusion that for them, the diagnose an easy excuse for them to be as evil as they want...


Education is needed; especially for ""the right to set boundaries"", and that if partner rejects that, it's time to go appart...


I btw enjoyed a video series here on YT made by Tom Golden and ""the guy that shouldn't be mentioned publicly"" about Borderline - they focused on what it is causing and doing from a ""partners point of view""...",2020-04-12T13:43:07Z,1
11,Ugxo6EQrz3m1bWYEKSJ4AaABAg,Purpura Draco,"@Michael Keller Well yeah, that's just it, man, spotting the signs isn't easy. It takes a professional to diagnose it, like any other serious mental condition, but good luck getting a woman with it to a psychiatrist. I did find the lecture I watched extremely helpful though. I was at a point I'd never trust a woman ever again but it helped me see past that somewhat, gave me a good indication of signs to look for instead.


Wish I could recall a link, must still be out there, but it was too long ago now. I seem to recall this guy usually lectures women about the condition. He goes through all the key signs to look for, presumably to give women who might have it a clue to perhaps seek help, and they have to have several of the symptoms/signs to even consider they might have the condition.


That your ex was diagnosed sounds either hopeful or lucky, not sure which, but that'd never happen in the UK, not in my experience. Mental health is in the dark ages and a woman with BPD, well, is she sick or just a really great feminazi? Either way, why would the feminists want to lose her.",2020-04-12T13:17:38Z,1
12,Ugxo6EQrz3m1bWYEKSJ4AaABAg,Michael Keller,"@Purpura Draco Yeah, heard a lot about feminist courts ehm family courts in the UK (nothing good, that is)... Your story's terrible... That she even went after the kids... No words man....


But - READING about BPD doesn't help; she was diagnosed before I was in a relationship with her; she even gave me books... The moment you felt into the ""love-trap"" of a BPD - it's over. Logic no longer works within the brains (big and little one-eyed-one)... 


Educating kids to see ""red lines"" though, this might work; today, it's all about the woman. Men are allowed to set boundaries, but don't do it - they get educated to ""do whatever pleases the woman""... They're made into servants. ...a little change of education like ""men are humans, too"" could already do the trick; bc. if one sets a boundarie to a BPD-person, you pretty fast see the true face of the enemey - and with a little self councious given by the ""hey you're a human too"" - one can escape before it's too late...",2020-04-12T11:53:25Z,1
13,Ugxo6EQrz3m1bWYEKSJ4AaABAg,Purpura Draco,"I watched a lecture on it by a psychology prof and my ex exhibits many of the signs. Not that she's diagnosed, she got away with ruining my life and my kids lives using zero evidence.


She'd didn't even have to prove what could be easily proven because if she had presented things like her medical records they'd have proved me right, not her, but the court simply took her word rather than demanding the paperwork. And her word changed significantly in many areas over just a few weeks as her story adapted and changed while my story was consistent throughout, it being the truth. Her lies have changed many times since as she's enlisted court appointed feminists to also abuse my kids so now my oldest has anxiety so bad he gets physical pain through it. He could only get a diagnosis when he could finally escape her and move in with me, once the family court no had jurisdiction to order him to stay with his abusive mother (16 here in the UK), because his mother lied to the doctors too and family court appointees aided and abetted in it, diagnosing him for her when they are not qualified to do so.


Same bigoted woman even insisted I see a criminal psychologist to prove to a family court I wasn't paranoid delusional so I did, proving I wasn't once and for all (I suffer anxiety and depression, small wonder after how she ruined me, and already had several a professional diagnoses, having been moved from one medical professional to another) because she decided to diagnose me without qualification or any medical information, after only a half hour of meeting me - she'd simply sooner believe that I was seriously mentally ill, without any evidence to even suggest it, quite the contrary, than believe my ex was an abusive liar. But that's feminism for you. Same woman even had the gall to tell me that my guilt over every single allegation my ex ever made or will make can be assumed because I was found guilty of one isolated incident of gently cupping the cheeks of the woman I'd been intimate with for 20 years. Even when I was charged with strangling her, instead of finding me not guilty, they swapped it out right at the end to find me guilty of assault for cheek touching, so determined was the feminism infested court to find me guilty of something, anything.


You're right though, knowing about BPD and borderline sociopathy makes a difference. More men should look it up, it's eye-opening and if you can spot the signs it might just save you from hell, your kids too if you have any and you might because they are really good at make-believe while they manipulate and abuse you, often very subtly and cleverly, until you know no different and might not even see it.",2020-04-12T11:36:13Z,1

125,UgwA52TWH2sDjFSp6h54AaABAg,Politically Correct Redskin,"Sorry,, but no. As long as men receive on average four times as long sentences for the same crimes there will be no equality. And don't kid yourself, they do. All across the western world. I read an article about a woman who smashed a glass into a man's face in London, permanently disfiguring him. There was a trial and an assault charge. And then she got off without so much as a fine because she was a woman and he was a man. Had a man done the exact same thing he would have been locked up for years and would be lucky to even get a trial first. Had he done it to a woman his name would be permanently ruined AND he would have been locked up for years.
Equality is a lie, and it always has been. Men are treated by the state as responsible adults expected to face up to the consequences of their actions. Women are treated like misbehaving children.",2020-04-08T23:38:52Z,4
