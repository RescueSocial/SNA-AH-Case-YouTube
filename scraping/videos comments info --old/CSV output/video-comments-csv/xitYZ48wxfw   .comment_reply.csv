She seems too unstable for sociopathy. Narcissists typically ""love bomb"" people no matter who it is and change their behaviour to get what they want from that person. They're the be everything that person wants and nothing at the same time. And when they don't get what they want, they go postal. Covert Narcissists are the most tricky to spot because they appear benevolent to others, but once you get to ""know"" the person that kindness is just in service of themselves. Combine that with a mood disorder and recreational drug use and it's a recipe for disaster. She's clearly a very unstable woman.",2020-10-18T12:48:07Z,2

Beauty is the weapon, “Because I’m Worth It.” To the arrogant, everyone is stupid and the world full of idiots meant to be bent and manipulated because we’re dumb and ugly. Her sister wasn’t as pretty, so she got hit by her and she had to take it, because no one believed her. That’s how a sense of entitlement works. Welcome to your mid thirties - now you get to be just like the rest of the world. The sense of invincibility only lasts in your twenties, when you think the world bends its knees towards your feet.

Angry when confronted and flat out denies everything. This whole thing makes her feel out of control. (Ironically, her sister looks rather happy. It’s as if finally, the tables of injustice have turned. This girl got away with a lot of things in the past because she was ‘pretty’ and no one believed she could be bad.
