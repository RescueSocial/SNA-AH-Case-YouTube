11,UgzdIbY5Ma5KijhAStR4AaABAg,NightOwl 10203,Whenever they get into a fight he is always the first one to walk away. She calls him a coward for wanting both of them to calm down. He calls his security on her and she begs him to fight her. An abused person would never deliberately get into the fighting cage with their abuser. They‚Äôd try to get away at every chance they got. She also supposedly has abandonment issues,2021-11-18T18:50:11Z,0

They know when things look like they are about to be exposed to act preemptively and start preparing for their smear campaign.
