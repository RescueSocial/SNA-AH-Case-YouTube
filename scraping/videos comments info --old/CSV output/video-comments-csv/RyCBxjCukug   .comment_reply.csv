I have notice movies like Sleepy hollow and what's eating gilbert grape would be there one month and then gone the next.. and then back again.. sleepy hollow i notice was on netflix at the beginning of the year then it was gone, then it came back in october then it left last month.. and so on..",2020-12-24T21:35:46Z,2

I’m not sure why you want it to seem like all companies are out to get him. If anything it’s hurting Johnny to boycott companies, who are still showcasing his movies.

The whole story and the stories of her friends sound like people who think they're much more clever than they actually are. She uses a large vocabulary, but she mispronounces and incorrectly uses a lot of words. She dropped out of a private school at the high school level and then claimed she was there on a scholarship.
