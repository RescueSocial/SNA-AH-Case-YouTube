2,Ugw32FBPJ9i2RanZTL54AaABAg,Janelle Selems,"I feel that it is wrong, what is happening to Johnny Depp. He has been ousted from the FB series & from Pirates of the Carribbean series. Amber Heard gets to continue acting in Aquaman. All on the basis of one libel case against a trashy newspaper that couldn't even get it's facts right. Poor Johnny is being treated as though he is a leper when she is clearly lying. You wanted opinions, you got em. PS, love all your channels Top 10 keep up to good work.",2020-11-28T16:10:26Z,4

5,Ugyf6mJFvBxXPcL-YTl4AaABAg,Nikita Alita,"Respect your personal opinion however my personal opinion is they depend on, love, and respect our support when stuff like this happens. I truly believe Johnny needs to know his fans will support him for the intirety of his career.  That's all were doing.",2020-11-30T07:48:07Z,2
6,UgyNQpTpRo-1dczmc5B4AaABAg,Louise Crisp,"@Joshua Hallett Sorry, I didn't mean to snap. It sounded like you were having a go at him and as we know, there's been enough of that over the last few years. Yes you're right about that. The way he's being treated is diabolical and the amount of people that believe he's guilty because of that farce of a ruling makes me wonder what kind of people they really are.  If he was guilty of anything that heinous, she would have a hospital record as long as my arm. Also the T.R.O would not have been dismissed with prejudice. I'm sure if the courts thought there was truth to any of this, they would have prosecuted anyway but it begs the question, why didn't she criminally prosecute him? Because there was absolutely NO proof despite her saying this would be the worst case of DV they've ever seen. Hell, she can't even show receipts for her charity donations. The same stuff comes out of her mouth as she left in their bed! Sorry, rant over. It wasn't exactly directed at you though.",2021-01-01T07:39:57Z,1

10,UgyxjWU3mtZTsE6bSt14AaABAg,Louise Crisp,She is definitely lying. There is no proof whatsoever of him abusing her but lots of her lying & even admitting to abusing him. The judge said whether she did or not was of no consequence. That's the kind of man that dealt that inept judgement out.,2020-12-31T12:04:45Z,1
11,UgxaUPOPwKed73ekKG14AaABAg,lil k r,"He could write his own script about his life with her kinda like a biography , living with a narrcist is hell on earth plus outing these evil soul suckers because no body really understands narcissistic abuse unless you've lived it it's such a subtle yet life destroying abuse for the survivor of this and being a female it's probably worse if your a male victim Amber is a rotten evil earth demon, love you Johnny",2020-11-28T07:01:38Z,1

14,Ugyt4xXxeuPxUnHzykp4AaABAg,Louise Crisp,"Well thank goodness he now has applied to. His lawyer put a great skeleton argument together which reflected everything we all have been thinking & feeling. I'm guessing you've read that too though. That was, as Nick Wallis said, a great early Christmas present.",2020-12-31T12:02:06Z,1
