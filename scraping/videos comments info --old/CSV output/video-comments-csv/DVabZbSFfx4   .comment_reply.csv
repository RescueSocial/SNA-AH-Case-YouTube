First, name me one couple, famous or not, that doesn't verbally argue from time to time, so who starts raising his/her voice (I think still her) is irrelevant. The point here is who is physically abusive towards the other, and according to all the evidence we have it's her. Second, in the episode you're referring to Johnny wasn't initially angry at her, he was angry at the people who caused his loss of 650 million dollars due to their incompetence (again, watch Brian's videos). Then she tried to manipulate him into going after her and started a video, but he caught her and split, like he always would do in situations like this. And that's why she was so angry and disappointed, because she wouldn't succeed in getting him so out of control to not being able to go away. This meant that she had to fabricate all the story and create the marks artificially. Sorry for the english, it's not my first language.",2020-11-15T19:00:38Z,4
99,UgytIva0_gdnX3FxYBB4AaABAg,Jade Green,"Maybe I should clarify on the both ways. First I  just wanna make clear that I don't support Amber Heard in any way and  when I say both ways I mostly mean that it's clear that they had arguments/fights and regardless of who started it (probably AH) they both took part. I feel like Amber likely egged him on a lot and was a lot more abusive but like I said I wasn't there, none of us were so we can't say for sure who said what who pushed who, or what was going on when things weren't being recorded and so forth.  The video and audio that we have in my opinion shows AH trying to catch JD doing something bad and even tho he's yelling and  Upset and throwing things we have no idea what she did before she started reccording to get him to act that way so like I said she's manipulative.  We're all capable of doing things we wouldn't normally do out of anger and I think it's pretty clear she drove him crazy, she'd drive anybody out of their mind.",2020-11-15T18:36:32Z,2
