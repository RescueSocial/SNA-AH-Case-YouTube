36,UgylH_01HhGB-eqxzkJ4AaABAg,Customer Service,@Rose Harvey Yes she did. Read it again because you got it wrong the first time. She never said he wouldn‚Äôt let her drive. Not even close. There is a huge difference between having access to a car that someone else owns and having your own vehicle in terms of the independence it allows you. He was trying to isolate her being removing those freedoms or complicating her access. He also had his staff watching her which is beyond disturbing. And some of you have the nerve to make claims about her mental state? You‚Äôre unbelievable hypocrites. Enjoy watching him lose in Va. I know I will.,2021-05-13T22:20:13Z,0
37,UgylH_01HhGB-eqxzkJ4AaABAg,Rose Harvey,"@Customer Service no that is not what she said. She didn't even mention the refurbishment of her car by the TV programme, she said she he didn't let her drive. She never mentioned the land rovers he put her on the insurance. Everything for her was that he was controlling her and she didn't have her freedom. It was a bit like when she accused MUSK of bugging the Tesla he gave her. Those cars are full of cameras and artificial intelligence. She wants everything to be given to her but then says she is being controlled. In reality she doesn't have to accept gifts from her husband or boyfriend, she can pay her own way and then she would not have to be worried about losing her independence.",2021-05-13T22:14:01Z,2

52,Ugx-6mCk8okdW2h3ncx4AaABAg,Elisa Rivas,"@Bonnie B I love them and show it by treating them kindly, but I don't cope well much, either. I'm a pretty negative person who has trust issues who lives as a hermit and doesn't keep in contact often enough to close friends because of what I've been through. I still have friends and a boyfriend, but very few (5 excluding my boyfriend and my grandmother, who I live with, and one of those friends is my little sister, but I contact these friends a few times a year. I just always have the thought in my head, ""my own mother backstabbed me, how do I know my best friend won't."" I know it's irrational, but the thoughts come every so often.) I lend a helping hand and I'll be a shoulder for them (abusers and those who have hurt me) to cry on, I may even be a slight part of their lives every so often, but I'll close up to them when it's about myself. Thank you. I wish you well and I'm sorry for what you've had to go through as well. Life brings shit that we must grossly dig our way through.",2020-11-17T20:14:15Z,3
53,Ugx-6mCk8okdW2h3ncx4AaABAg,Bonnie B,"@Elisa Rivas I'm sorry to hear you went through all of that & I certainly understand from a position of circumstances, in my case my brain has refused to allow it in, really in. So I have no frame of reference to feel very much. I guess it's a coping mechanism & I have just started work on (as my therapist puts it) ""unburdening what you are carrying around"" I know a lot happened but it's a different person to me. A dissociative experience. A refusal of my brain to even go there. Of course I'm talking to you now about it peripherally but still it's like it's not me I'm speaking of. Very strange how we deal with things. 
I'm inspired by the things I hear and you have been  so strong in going this far with dignity & love. 
I worry I may not I suppose. I certainly haven't in the past by using substances &  really not giving thoughts as to why?  Now, luckily that has been dealt with & I'm moving forward with opening up the gates I've locked. 
Kind regards to you.",2020-11-17T19:35:11Z,2
54,Ugx-6mCk8okdW2h3ncx4AaABAg,Elisa Rivas,"@Bonnie B That is true. Love and forgiveness for an abuser is so difficult. I forgave and love, but if I hadn't been taught from my friends, some peers, teachers and my little sister, I don't think I would've been so nice to my abusers (I've had three; two family members by blood and a man who married my mother; I've been through every kind of abuse except sexual, thank God I never had that scar, but the worst of all was watching them hurt my sister to get to me. Any normal person would hate these people. I had to go through a lot to not hate them and I can say it's not easy to do. I understand why Johnny vented to his friends sometimes.
