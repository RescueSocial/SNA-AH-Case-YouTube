9,UgyCqek0j7FsQ6rtJi14AaABAg,Amber turds using a baby for sympathy.. Why wait nearly 3 months to let the publics know... Is this a publicity stunt as she will need to have nannies and others to raise the baby.. Amber turd is unstable and violent and shouldn't be left alone with a baby,Diane Thomson,0,2021-07-06T12:53:12Z
10,Ugy2hbzHxDO6lpS9fap4AaABAg,"What‚Äôs messed up is I‚Äôm sure he HAD to say something. Like I mentioned when I talked about Mads, they all work for Warner Bros & are going to be working on new projects, one of those projects involves Princess Mierda. Jason did this because he‚Äôs forced to work with her. I‚Äôm sure he didn‚Äôt want to but because he‚Äôs gotta make that money & is under contract, they were like, ‚ÄúYou have to support your Co-Star‚Äù which sucks because there‚Äôs a lot of people who are going to take this as him actually supporting her but the simple way that he did it was definitely telling of the fact that he did it not because he wanted to but because his hand was forced.

As it is, I‚Äôm sure (besides his disapproval of how horrible she was to Johnny Depp) he hates her because he knows that because of her, his movie where he is the star is going to bomb which will cause him to lose money & credibility in Hollywood. If it were me, I wouldn‚Äôt have put the heart but for all I know, someone wrote that FOR him & sent it on his behalf.",Akasha Eyre,0,2021-07-06T03:40:38Z

18,UgxkEzwKQFiei3dqqp54AaABAg,"I think most likely he had to. Or at least felt like he had.  Although Momoa's been acting for a long time now he's still ""new"" and probably doesn't want to rock the boat. Bc he really hasn't given her much support otherwise.
He was good in GOT but I first saw him in Stargate Atlantis... the role had him as strong but dumb & that was my first impression of him. I wouldn't have liked that role but probably would have took it to make that kind of money lol.

22,Ugwv_ZZxTkyddE6Mv1R4AaABAg,"Irish name pronounced Oona.....   Is this true? She's told some whoppers in the past that have been proven false.  So I have to take the same stance. Everything she has claimed in the past has been proven to be false or the reverse. WTF!   - I've just looked her up after posting this comment and read the media reports - Of course, by surrogate, 'because she couldn't carry one herself' and making statements such as 'I wanted to a have a child 4 years ago' and 'I hope we arrive at a point in which it's normalised to not want a ring in order to have a crib.'  I haven't heard one instance where this fucking woman has sounded intelligent! Another publicity stunt. My condolences to the poor child. I also wonder if that gives any bearing on the possibility of her being evicted from JD's penthouse? Or is it about Elon Musk. There's going to be a good reason behind and it won't be about motherhood.",Paula Teetree,0,2021-07-05T15:42:05Z

1. The picture with that baby.... It was unnatural, you don't put the kid of that age the way it was put on a mother's chest. I see all the preparation for the picture in my head. It was made to manipulate the public. 
2. The timing.
3. The mystery with the man who supposedly fathered that child.
All this is very strange.
Another thing.... it seems to me that the guys with üí∞ are stupid because after seeing what she did to Johnny, they still get involved with her. I can only imagine how she's going to suck the money out of supposed child's  father. That will be a new chapter!!!!!
As for Momoa.... I think  he made a big mistake by congratulating her publicly because that woman made a lot of people angry, including me. ü§¨

88,Ugw0j1D15Bn-sI1W0YJ4AaABAg,"I totally agree that it's a bare minimum, perfunctory response, that he would have felt obligated to post. 

That being the case though, I actually think that his choosing to post only that, says quite a bit more than not posting at all would have. No response says nothing either way; an unknown variable. An enthusiastic response would obviously indicate support. But this, this is about as far as you can go to from support without crossing into outright condemnation. 

While I agree that he has the clout to comment at will, maybe things like WB firing even big names like JD, might make him second guess that fact. I don't like it, and I've condemned his silence before. But this isn't silence. In fact, in its own way, it's a rebellion, his way of chafing against WB's muzzle. What isn't included, what isn't said, conveys a whole hell of a lot. 

And one irrefutable thing about Mamoa, is that he values family immensely. And, if I can see that her choosing to bring a child into this toxic mess in absolutely no way considers what would be best or even healthy for a child; you can bet he sees that too. I would go so far as to guess (and it is just a guess) that, even if he had believed her, or even just accepted all her other mistakes until now, etc., he'd see this one quite differently. In making this choice, she has given away the narcissism we've all already known about by showing everyone else her true disregard for the well-being of others, including, in particular, the well-being of innocent children.

Note: Oonagh = [oon] as in "" *moon* "", and [a] as in "" *Uh* , wait. What do you mean someone allowed "" *a* "" proven, confessed, narcissistic, and serial,  domestic violence perpetrator  to take ""possession"" (because you know that's how she sees it) of an innocent child?""",Darklyn Stormember,2,2021-07-05T00:58:02Z

110,UgwJWbb1YMr0cnbNLSx4AaABAg,I hold Momoa responsible for his choice to congratulate a know abuser.  Saying nothing would have been better than saying this.  My opinion of Momoa is now one of.....a man who is so morally weak that he congratulates an abusive liar on reproducing.....no explanation is sufficient for this behaviour.  She is gross and evil and anyone that supports her or congratulates her on holding a vulnerable human hostage.....is doing themselves a great disservice.  I believed Momoa to be morally stronger than this....I am wrong.  I really thought he would be a better man.,Ruby Sultra,0,2021-07-05T00:23:45Z
