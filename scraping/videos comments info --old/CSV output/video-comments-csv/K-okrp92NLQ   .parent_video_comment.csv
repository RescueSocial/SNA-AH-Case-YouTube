357,UgzLgxSJASbFrqvVZs54AaABAg,The problem with removing amber from auquaman 2 is that I don‚Äôt think Warner Bros can until she loses the case against her. Her contract may be too good to fire her. The only reason Johnny was asked to step down was because his loss in the previous case therefore Warner Bros was then able to ask him to step down. And to be fair at that time I don‚Äôt think Warner Bros made a horrible decision.

What she did to JD is every bit as bad as when a man does it to a woman. Anyone can be an abuser and it should never be taken lightly. As someone who grew up with a physically abusive father and a mother who stood by and let it happen and even lied after he was dead that it never happened I know what it can do to your life. Nobody should have to go through that! JD lived through it with his mother, and still took care of her until she died. I just don't see him being that way, and everything I have heard from people close to him or who had relationships with him shows me he isn't that kind of guy. I was lucky that I left home when I was 14 and learned from many Native elders how to deal with my feelings. I have a beautiful wife and 5 daughters from 13 to 26 years old.
