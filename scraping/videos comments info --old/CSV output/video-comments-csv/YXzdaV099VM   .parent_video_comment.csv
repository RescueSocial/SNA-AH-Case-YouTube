Not to mention toxic, irrational, enabling, real, sad, unfortunate, I could go on & on. I've been in a terribly toxic relationship before myself. It does break my heart any time I see/hear of this with others. Because the truth is, its painful for both. For whatever reasons, each feel wronged in some way. Slighted, shorted,or cheated by their partner in some way. Im sure there is validity to both, because you cannot tell someone their feelings or opinions about something are wrong. Perception is a funny thing. The mental state, background, upbringing, understanding of social interactions, relationships, etc. Are ultimately what will determine the way they take things. Its neither right, nor wrong. All you can do is look at what one says they got from what the other said & make your own decisions. I hope that awareness is raised & more people understand how real this issue is, & moreover that similar to any major life altering issues, it does not discriminate or follow invisible boundary lines. From the most affluent, rich, powerful, famous, to those with multiple problems, unemployment, poverty, addiction plagued, simple, pain lifestyles...Its another truly tragic, harmful reality that can occur when gas meets fire...even more when the real feelings, love, emotions are genuine and strong, & have existed from early on. Its hard to let those go, if not impossible. Clouding what's best, reality of a changed situation, or what ascribe should actually be taken for the best of each person ultimately. You feel like its only so bad in those moments because you do care/love them so much. But what is harder to see, is the resentments you've developed & how they further drive the toxicity. Healthy actions can only occur once you have at least a small amount of clarity to the truth & reality of what is goin on inside the bubble you & your partner/ your relationship exists in. I wish anyone dealing with such a horrible, painful, situation all the best, and so much love, understanding, & hope you find clarity for your own wellbeing! üíúüñ§ü§ç",Anna Tully,2,2021-03-10T07:23:41Z
6,Ugw4qlAmQRfTNvCsmPZ4AaABAg,"That not very smart elon still with that  üí© amber. The movie director should not put Johnny and amber in the movie and if they did not act together in the movie, Johnny won't date and marry her and won't had so much problem. I bet she already do that director and get the movie role and flim with Johnny and then seduce him and then make him marry her.  Poo amber need to go to prison for the rest of her life and oh with no toilet bowl in prison ü§£",kk.,2,2021-03-10T04:52:04Z
