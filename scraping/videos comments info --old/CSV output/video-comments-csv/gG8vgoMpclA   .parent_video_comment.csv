Now that the REAL truth has come out, I don't see a beautiful, talented actress; I just see a manipulative, cruel monster of a person. It's such a shame she chose to take this route, but she DID choose it, all on her own. She threw away her whole career, just to try to hurt a person she once claimed to love.

19,Ugw1aV8fMw0HVvwu0Ix4AaABAg,"OMG, the irony of her saying those who want her to pay are sexist! I wouldn't be surprised if they don't remove her, because we live in an unfair world. This just solidified for me that the double standard for DV is a major problem. As a woman who believes in actual equality, I want to see her held accountable, lose her sponsorships, and get jail time.

Women have been fighting for equality and she just set us back horrendously. As a woman I feel that she should suffer some consequence for what she has done.

Why hasn't a single one of them said something with all the evidence flying over the internet ? They refuse to admit that women are and can be equally as abusive and victimising as men period.  It is hypocrisy of the feminist movement if nothing is said about this. This entire episode is toxic femininity at its best.",Èlètíòbád,6,2020-02-26T09:13:15Z
28,Ugzapv_Yu4lQRKgZlj94AaABAg,"Amber Heard WEAPONIZED ""Cancel Culture"" in order to destroy Mr. Depp. BEFORE ANY ACCUSATIONS, Ms. Heard had her lawyer send Mr. Depp a letter demanding: $50,000 per month support, the Range Rover (Mr. Depp to cover all costs), three Penthouse Apartments worth $13,000,000 (Mr. Depp to cover utilities and fees), $100,000 lawyer fees, $25,000 forensic accounting, and an undisclosed Divorce settlement. WHEN Mr. Depp refused, THEN she accused him of abuse. She SOLD her ""evidence"" to the tabloids for cash, but when she was required to turn it over to the court for disclosure and testing--SHE DROPPED HER ALLEGATIONS. The Judge dismissed Ms. Heard's abuse case WITH PREJUDICE. It means that Ms. Heard cannot bring another abuse case against Mr. Depp. Ms. Heard used the case to destroy Mr. Depp WITH NO EVIDENCE. Mr. Depp has waited over three years, until Ms. Heard gave him a legal avenue to FORCE her into court with her ""evidence"" against his evidence, which by the list, is formidable. The case is defamation, but the crimes that Ms. Heard committed in attempting to frame Mr. Depp are: fabricating ""evidence"" and selling it for personal gain, tampering with ""evidence"" and selling it for personal gain, making a video of Mr. Depp without his knowledge or consent, and selling it for personal gain, tampering with witnesses, extortion, Domestic Abuse causing bodily harm, perjury in the abuse deposition, perjury in the divorce deposition, perjury in the defamation deposition, and defamation. Can you imagine waiting for years, watching your ABUSER be rewarded with movies (Yes, I mean you, Aquaman), receive lucrative contracts (Yes, I mean you L'Oreal), and held up as an hero (Yes, I mean you, United Nations), knowing you almost died (the multiple surgeries to his finger resulted in 3 serious MRSA infections) as a result of her abuse? You can't make a movie when you are in jail. She should be going to jail for a good, long time.",NIBS,2,2020-02-26T07:23:14Z

32,Ugyup8GXntCcBLIDQDZ4AaABAg,I get you on the cancel culture thing. I personally think she needs a taste of her own medicine but that's not up for me to decide. But as far as not going to see the movie that's fine I don't have a problem with not seeing the movie in theaters. The movie company only makes money from the movie theaters. I get a ton of Redbox codes and watch most of my movies for free anyway. I don't think the movie companies get much revenue off of rentals. so I'll just rent it for free when it comes out on DVD.,Stoney Vowell,1,2020-02-25T23:05:48Z
