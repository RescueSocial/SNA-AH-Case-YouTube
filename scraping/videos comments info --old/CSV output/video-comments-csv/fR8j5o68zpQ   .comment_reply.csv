1,Ugx0UQZS6ntpHvTsKmt4AaABAg,EndorTV,I can‚Äôt speak for everyone but to me i care more about the fact that he got released and she didn‚Äôt that in no way shape or form is that okay,2021-07-31T16:57:02Z,0
2,Ugx0UQZS6ntpHvTsKmt4AaABAg,Rayhaan,"@Alexsander Ivan ü§£ü§£ü§£ Johnny Deep ruined his own reputation by his  alcoholism and him participating in that toxic relationship. Know one told him to hit Amber back he choose to, this is what happens when he choose to marry a women half his age and clearly was a gold digger. Hopefully he can learn from this incident",2021-07-31T04:16:54Z,0
3,Ugx0UQZS6ntpHvTsKmt4AaABAg,Alexsander Ivan,"Yeah, sure, and the fact that the justice system in both USA and UK screwed his reputation despite valid evidence supporting his innocence is 100% a-okay, while the likely true abuser can keep her job just fine",2021-07-31T03:22:08Z,0

5,UgxfVv3X8cI6vTyurR54AaABAg,Podcast Now,I have talked about Ezra Miller many times in these videos. What he did was disgusting and it's laughable that he gets to do it and everybody just forgets. WB doesn't care. I think it's incredible in the worst way possible. But yeah I've brought him up many times.,2021-08-03T14:31:13Z,1
6,UgxfVv3X8cI6vTyurR54AaABAg,devinghost1,@Puckaluck It could be a look alike to give Ezra Miller a bad image in the public cause people like him already did it to Justin Bieber so the next time I read something like this I always think it's a look alike cause there are plenty that has done it before or he took it the wrong way of what the person was doing.,2021-07-31T11:07:44Z,0

8,UgxfVv3X8cI6vTyurR54AaABAg,devinghost1,@Puckaluck What other situation is there to talk about? He talked about this one cause it's still going on and cause he wants to get people that had already signed the petition to not watched the movie.,2021-07-31T00:30:21Z,0

11,Ugy9SPjRDEMwQOMjyiZ4AaABAg,Pizza Time,You do realize amber heard is an abuser right?,2021-07-31T01:40:20Z,0
12,Ugy9SPjRDEMwQOMjyiZ4AaABAg,Podcast Now,I'll be flat out honest with you. Nothing you say ever makes an impact on me or the channel which includes future content I do. You spend 90% of the time just blindly hating on me to do it. I truly don't care. I've never shadowbanned you because you're respectful 1 out of 20 comments. I ignore you the rest of the time.,2021-07-30T18:08:32Z,4
13,Ugzk4wBdPq1OyIb_bw14AaABAg,Jar Jar Skywalker,"@Pizza Time I couldn't care less about what goes on her personal as long as she fulfils her part as Mera in the movies. If she leaves after Aquaman 2, I'm all good bro",2021-08-01T02:05:55Z,0
14,Ugzk4wBdPq1OyIb_bw14AaABAg,Pizza Time,"@Jar Jar Skywalker So abusing someone isn't sad and pathetic? Why would you want an abuser to be one of the main roles in the movie? Also all they need to do is recast her, it's been done many times in movies. Stop simping for her bro",2021-08-01T01:50:14Z,1
15,Ugzk4wBdPq1OyIb_bw14AaABAg,Jar Jar Skywalker,"@Pizza Time  regardless who started what, if Amber decides to leave that's on her. But to try to get WB to Fire her is just sad and pathetic. Let her finish the damn movie, so I can watch the damn film.",2021-07-31T02:04:07Z,0
16,Ugzk4wBdPq1OyIb_bw14AaABAg,Pizza Time,"@Jar Jar Skywalker so abusing someone isn't  selfish at all? I bet if jason momoa abused someone, you would be trying to boycott the movie, but since it's a girl now it's all fine",2021-07-31T01:42:50Z,1
17,Ugzk4wBdPq1OyIb_bw14AaABAg,Jar Jar Skywalker,"@Kirsty Fairly all I'm saying is for actors to keep their personal shit out of my entertainment. If they wanna get rid of her after her contract is finished, then I'm cool with that. But WB need to leave the movie alone. Recasting Mera is pretty selfish. Her problems are not my problems. Just let me enjoy my Aquaman 2",2021-07-31T00:49:56Z,0
18,UgxArN_hCKaI2JnFPih4AaABAg,devinghost1,@Giannis MP96 That's a lie the number of people that signed the petition isn't gonna watched the movie and petitions doesn't make the films even more popular and more money.,2021-07-30T19:01:05Z,1
