If they actually charge her, put out a warrant, and seek to extradite her, she will most likely make a plea deal through her attorneys, while never setting foot on Australian soil. She will blame Mr. Depp, Kevin Murphy, Kate James, her friends, her sister, the media, etc. She'll pay a fine, but she won't go to jail. It would be a wonderful, sweet turn of justice if she did, but I highly doubt it. And frankly, it pisses me off!! Celebrity shouldn't excuse illegal behavior!

I think you are confusing things. the possible 14 year sentence has nothing to do with that it is only for lying under oath regarding the dogs. The abuse is a separate case altogether and not what this video is about specifically but it does paint a picture that makes AH far less credible in court.

It could help Johnny win and there is a small chance if the judge sends her to join he could also possibly make her do the sentence for perjury too?

One of the biggest recent examples are all those Me 2 cases in where it turned out after the fact the women lied just to get the guy in trouble.

Even if they come up with proof it was a lie, that the guy never raped them or that they admit they lied in court... nothing. Maybe 2-5 years for a crime that ruined a guys life and had him in jail for years while the trials were going on.",2020-12-21T00:53:22Z,0

The reason why it‚Äôs illegal, and rightfully should be, is cause the whole point of court is to fairly resolve a conflict and give each side a chance to tell their piece and to ultimately prove with evidence the events that are involved. So if you lie and you‚Äôre in the wrong then you get punished. Cause the whole point is just as they say in the video, what‚Äôs the point of having laws if you don‚Äôt follow through with being punished for them. And if you lie about it to get away with it.",2021-01-19T21:32:51Z,0

The Government is the combined power of all it's inhabitants and as such should be the highest instance of power and judgment. I see lying in court as lying to all the people of your country. And as such should the government have an option to punish people who do just that. Well that's my opinion.",2021-01-15T21:52:16Z,0
224,Ugyi1xfp7nJbe_r34ml4AaABAg,The Obsesed Anime Freaks,"@Tekoim Ming ‚Äã I'm an idealist far right wing libertarian where I have a strict definition of where force is appropriate and when it is not. I believe people will always act in their best interest, and work to protect themselves and they shouldn't be punished for doing so. Arrests shouldn't be easy, and you shouldn't be jailed for lying to a court or government entity. You have every right to do what you see fit to defend yourself from any entity period, including lying. Government needs to earn respect by convincing people to do what they ask through non-violent non-coercive means. The only time the government is allowed to use force or jail anyone is when that individual physically harms someone else or their property. All other cases are a matter of free will. If someone does something to indirectly harm you, typically financially or physically through methods such as a bad product or through indirect means such as pollution or otherwise, only then should civil liability play a roll. What you say and how you express yourself should not be punished legally speaking. Physically Harming someone else is the only preclusion on any free speech you might have, but then it is a matter of direct harm that can be traced back directly to your actions that you should be punished for, rather then some nebulous issue with process or otherwise. What you say and do always has social consequences, lying under oath has significant reputational harm that should be preferenced over any ""jail time"" for such actions.",2021-01-15T17:58:01Z,0
