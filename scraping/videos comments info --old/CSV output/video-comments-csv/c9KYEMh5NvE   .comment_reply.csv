Free speech is about saying your opinion without worrying that you will go to jail or die.

When you are talking about someone else's life, and especially about such a serious subject, you owe to be responsible. Also freedom of speech is one of the most important rights we have and we should use it without making it an excuse for everything that comes out of our mouths.

Sucker Punch does have a bit more under its belt, with Infamous, GoS, Sly.

93,UgyUQOZe55xzox2Nnwd4AaABAg,PureSparkles22,Amber Heard is a huge nobody. Hollywood can easily blacklist her and no one will notice.,2021-01-14T08:54:17Z,4
94,UgyeDv37Ac4tLuti8GJ4AaABAg,HMW,"As long as Amber Heard doesn't point her gun to WB, I doubt she will get Ray Fisher's treatment. WB is more tolerant than other studios. Disney will fire both Deep and Heard without a blink just like what they did to James Gunn years ago. For WB, Amber Heard and Depp are still just actors who work under them . Their drama is exhausting but it still doesn't affect the core of Warner Bros's management. Ray Fisher's problem is he directly touched the beef of WB. He is very stupid and ignorant to be driven by his misguided sense of justice. Fairly speaking, Amber Heard knows the rule of the game much better than Ray Fisher. It's Hollywood, no matter what you do, you can't break the rule of the game otherwise you will be the first to be kicked out. You can manipulate it, change it in a limited range, but you really just can't break it.",2021-01-15T16:08:06Z,0
95,UgyeDv37Ac4tLuti8GJ4AaABAg,Dj Genius,@J x it wasn't HER article... It was AN article... Do it research... SHE wasn't the one sued for libel... Secondly the judge who saw EVERY piece of evidence and not comments on YouTube said it he DID hit her so it wasn't libel... This isn't a question as to whether or not she hit him... It's a question as to whether or not he hit her... And that question has been answered,2021-01-15T00:19:07Z,0

The judge sided with Heard because, unfortunately, there is a bias in the courts in favor of women. There is this pervasive notion that women cannot be criminals, and cannot be abusers. They are given lighter and lesser sentences, and more leniency overall.",2021-01-14T23:41:23Z,4
