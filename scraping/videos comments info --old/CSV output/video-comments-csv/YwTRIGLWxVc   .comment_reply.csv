Drinking a lot (or even a little) can at times cause mental health to deteriate (sorry can't spell).  The same can go for substance abuse. The problem about mental health is that its a vast range of things. What makes 1 person bad could make another person better. When you start to bring in alcohol and/or substances then it needs to be approached by a different angle.  AH is already on mental health medication (Antipsycotic) .

When should righteous indignation at the exploits of a malignant narcissist be given closure?

You might as well ask her when she intends to stop pretending to be a victim while leaving a tsunami like wake of destruction behind her.

Malignant narcissists don't change.
They don't learn from their misdeeds and they don't grow emotionally.
Everything is always somebody else's fault and they are always entitled to everything they want, no matter the cost to others.

The only recourse is to remove them from your midst, shut the door on them and don't allow them to poison your life again.

The answer to your question might be, ""when she ceases to demand our attention.""",2021-03-07T02:24:01Z,2

There really doesn't seem to be any evidence that he abused her in any way.
I agree in principle that both of them should be left to move forward in their lives and careers, but with two caveats. 
She wrecked Depp's career.
She did it maliciously.
Sharing the consequences she imposed upon him seems appropriate.

She's entitled to be left to her career, but she is not entitled to the popularity that goes hand in hand with A-list status.
She poisoned her own reputation and made herself completely unlikable.
She isn't entitled to being liked.

If WB wants to keep her on, that's fine, but that would spoil anything she was in for me.
Enough people are expressing similar levels of disgust for her that WB, which should be gaging the impact of her reputation on her viability as a screen asset might want to choose a different actor with higher market appeal simply because it will affect the market value of their production properties.

While she is entitled to work without outside interference with her job, she isn't entitled to magically be more valuable to her employer than the weight of her expected box office draw.
Star status requires an actor to have and maintain a fan appeal that Heard no longer commands.
She did that to herself.",2021-03-04T05:15:06Z,1
136,UgzMyktpK9U275AK3SJ4AaABAg,Shauna H.,"@Shifting Mercury here I am again sorry lol. In regards to their professional careers, when this all happened in 2016 people like me initially beleived her. Everyone supported ending his career since he was labeled a ""wife-beater"" and it would have gone exactly that way without all the evidence he provided. Why should someone who abuses her partners, lies constantly, and steals money from sick kids she was legally obligated to donate deserve any support at this point? So again I ask if Elon, her sister, or her friend iO who have been subpoenaed end up admitting she orchestrated this how would you feel after defending her on so many threads? Regardless she isn't this innocent battered woman she has portrayed herself to be, that image/persona cannot be re-attained. Actors lives and earnings are all about their abilities and likeability otherwise people wouldn't watch them. She tried using us to obtain empathy/support in destroying his life and Im a full beleiver in reaping what you sew and karma.

140,Ugzr8qjuLYDWJeaPuZl4AaABAg,Lunalovania,"@Shifting Mercury whew that's a lot! Lol. Its okay i read everything. Yeah I meant to ask about kate moss. Im not saying johnny is innocent in all of this, but she has a history of abuse. On police record. Regardless, what she said while she was being secretly recorded was truly vile. She talked about how she was going to get her makeup and hair done up to look like he hit her. Idk if the recorded convo is still on youtube but im sure we can find it if you wanna give it another hear. Me personally, I have no doubt that there probably was some abuse on both sides. Remember the video where johnny was screaming MF(mother fker) over and over while he was punching his kitchen cabinets? He definitely has some depression going on. He did a shit ton of drugs too back in the day when he was hanging out with Hunter S. Thompson. Great author but man did he have a messed up life. I think think that we will never know what really happened between them. If this teaches us anything, it should be that men AND women can be abusers. This stigma of believe all women is nonsense and quite frankly a little dumb. It seems that most of society has just accepted that women don't lie when it comes to serious accusations. It really shocks me. Of course women lie! Women lie just like men do! Now im not saying amber is a liar in regards to her statements about Johnny being abusive.  my point is that maybe people will not just blindly believe their words without any evidence or without more victims coming forward in the future. We are all human, therefore we can all be the same things. Murderers, rapists, kidnappers, you name it and both men and women have done it.
