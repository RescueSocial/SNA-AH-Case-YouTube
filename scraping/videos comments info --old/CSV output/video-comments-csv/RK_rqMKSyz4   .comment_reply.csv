Now days actors don't get as much as they used to in the 80s, 90s and 2000's. Some actors still get payed millions but rare few. The normal salary these days is anywhere between $250,000 to $650,000 per movie today in 2019. Then you gotta take into account taxes that half your salary by as much as 55%. You only end up with half that amount in your bank account. Then you have to account for daily and yearly expenses living paying rent, food and other bills which can rack up to $10,000 per month which gets payed from that upfront lump sum deal you get from the movie studio. Just how much money do you think they have left in the bank? 

Let's say you're a typical actor who has to pay $7 million in divorce fees, you'd have to make maybe 5 to 8 movies to cover that cost. Johny Depp has been broke for awhile.

Some of us are here for truth as such a phenomenal outrage of woman who had been manipulated , abused and exploited in their lives is opening up to punish and expose their abusers. But it is true that some women are exploiting this. So let the evidence speak for themselves. Ms. Heard and her legal team so far is only making accusations and not providing evidences in court and rather publish ""edited"" videos to media thus fooling the public and making them unworthy as a court evidence. So far her behaviour is fishy, and that is the reason many of us are here, to learn the truth, not because some of us follow the rule ""women are innocent angels and men are evil incarnated"".

198,UgyzFmI-apzrP8NXZEx4AaABAg,Julie Lea,"@jjd jj Absolutely with you I'm happy he's standing up for himself. 146 tapes showing her abusing him!
 It's not true the most attractive women are the worst. They APPEAR attractive because of the way manipulate people. Most guys like Heard because they think she's Bi (she identified as Gay for 6 yrs prior to Depp & left her gf for him...to exploit him). And she made a movie where she played a gay girl.
 Heard is actually pretty average. She doesn't exactly stand out in a crowd in jeans & T-shirt. She doesn't have a good body & her cellulite butt sags at 28? In a photo I saw of her by a pool.
 She got better looking with Depp's money, as anyone would.
 His X wife was the one who didn't believe in marriage, Depp has been married, & engaged countless times. She is SOOO much more attractive than Heard. She's just a bit older now. Check out her modeling & you'll see what I mean, the cheekbones, eyes, body, etc. Chanel for one. She's also a talented singer, very famous in France.
 Heard never modeled anything to my knowledge, in spite of having a photographer for a gf? She knows lots of make-up artists to paint that bruise on....that's what they do, make bruises, etc look REAL on camera for TV & movies.
 If she was anything special, she would have made it already.....in Hollywood if you haven't made it by 30, you won't. She's so ""blah"" I didn't remember her from Pineapple Express....saw it many times. 
 1st time I saw Kristen Stewart (Into the Wild),  Kate Hudson (Blue  Desert), Julia Roberts (Mystic Pizza), Charlize Theron (2 Days in the Valley), Gwyneth Paltrow (in a TV movie, & movie she played Ginny), etc they had small roles & I KNEW they would be famous. I'd be so rich if I signed those people! Lol, but Heard....nothing. 
 She can't act & she has no ""star quality"" or presence.
 Not just my opinion, it's fact. She was NOT famous after all those girlfriend roles"" & she NEVER would have been in Aquaman (upgraded to wife, haha), if not for Depp.
 She couldn't make it on her looks & DEFINITELY not acting, she sucks. 
 Proof is she would have made it after a decade a trying.
 As for you, I'll tell you a secret. Men are stupid. Beauty makes them really dumb. And ANYONE can be beautiful. Confidence, put it across. Demand you're treated well without being a bytch. You're beautiful! Act like you are! You will be. People will always treat you the way you tell/allow them to.
 Before Heard married Depp, she tested his boundaries. His self-esteem. How much abuse would he tolerate? (All abusive types do this). 
 He was vulnerable from his recent break up from Paradis, he has weak boundaries & C-PTSD, & low self-esteem. Perfect.
 And when she changed from fawning over him to treating him like dirt, he was committed to her & the marriage. He took ALL the heat for smuggling dogs that weren't his & he had NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. 
 People like me who didn't even know Depp had married....KNEW HER!!!! Exploiting his loyalty. Making INTERNATIONAL NEWS! Haven't read about Depp in the press since the 90's Kate Moss incident! 2016 & THAT makes International news. 
 She has a personality disorder. No empathy, entitlement, superiority complex & highly manipulative. Fits of rage. Like pooping in his bed when he was late to her B-day party....that's when HE had enough. 
 Cluster B. Probably NPD with psychopathic tendencies....if not full blown Psychopath, look it up.
 Take care beautiful ‚ô•Ô∏è

199,UgyzFmI-apzrP8NXZEx4AaABAg,jjd jj,"Not all women are like that. The most beautiful ones are the worst. But guys dont go for down to earth girls, only the pretty stuck up ones that stab you in the back like amber did to johnny. Im not that kind of person, but i dont get any attention because i was never pretty.  Men go after looks. They need to look at the inside. Looks dont matter as much as how you are as a person. Im very glad johnny is defending himself finally. I think he should have married the mother of his children. Shes not as pretty, but i bet shes a much better person. He was with her for 14 years and she had his children. That should tell you something.",2019-03-08T05:56:04Z,0
200,UgyzFmI-apzrP8NXZEx4AaABAg,Julie Lea,"@Miss S. People with Anti-Social Personality Disorder or Sociopath's lie so well because they feel so entitled. They are EXTREMELY motivated while being manipulative. 
 The markers of these personality disorders are lack of empathy (cruelty), entitlement (feeling you DESERVE it), and highly manipulative. 
 They target people who identify as empath's, sensitive, poor boundaries, & vulnerable.
 The fact she identified as Gay & not Bi, left her partner of 6 yrs for Depp, & has admitted to being abusive prior to Depp "" I'll go all trailer park on you"" is telling.
 Australia incident-entitlement.
 Photos of her with Depp, her chin is high & turned away from him (red carpet). 
 There's footage of her dragging him away from fans or convos (shows the jealousy threatening the fragile ego). 
 His mom was dying of cancer for a long time, the fact she waited until 2 days after her death shows she wanted to inflict as much damage as possible. Also, he's a famously private person, she very deliberately went public with photos of her bruised face. She's photographed leaving the courthouse with a friend with her head thrown back in elated laughter.
 I could go on & on.
 Whoever is the sad depressed QUIET one....is the abused. Male or female.
 The media has repeatedly crucified Depp for various reasons, ( He has NEVER cooperated with them ....giving them info, stories, etc she has)  every story is twisted towards Heard. 
 But her behavior is so clear. Depp has mental issues. Abusing, manipulating, & entitlement are things he's severely lacking. 
 The Cluster B is a fragile ego that puts up a wall of superiority, but certain things send them into a RAGE when they feel threatened. 
 Depp suffers from C-PTSD in childhood, has eternally low self-esteem, has anger issues that usually manifest in broken furniture, rarely towards another person, & never towards a female. He says women are complex & infinitely more intelligent than men ....who are basically simpletons (Oprah Winfrey with Kate Winslet).  This says a lot psychologically, won't bore you.
  He's more complex, she's boring textbook 101. Look up Cluster B personality disorders. She's literally by the book.
 I noticed it in the video she shot of him upset. He found out he lost about 40 Mill to his ""team"". And she wasn't there.
 Listen to the dialogue. This is textbook gaslighting, she's trying to get him worked up & more upset while acting passive. 
 Her words make no sense. She's trying to say he's mad at her, but HE is saying different.
 She is calm. Another sign of psychopathy. They get the victim upset, & the more upset, the more in control they feel, thus, more calm.",2019-03-07T18:25:02Z,5
