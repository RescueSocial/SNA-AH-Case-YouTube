8,UgwS7z0Q-0IGbNqysUF4AaABAg,MrGhostBoxer,"@eHacker it's crazy how that works. I mean why does YT do it when the information is freely available and there to find?

Why not try some interviews with people regarding the stories you report?

Maybe a  video about yourself, your motivation, your inspirations in life, your preparation/routine and what not.",2020-05-10T12:29:36Z,0

14,Ugx4-6nuYOJlKkwzt_p4AaABAg,Kimber Blue,"You make some very good points, NIBS. On the flip side of that coin, however, she could just be too upset over her mother's death (as unlikely as that sounds) to care about responding. Not having anything to say would likely be a first for her of course and, I am rather curious as to why? she hasn't responded. Hmm, maybe the truth has finally started to take its toll on her. Does anyone know if she's even posting anything at all?",2020-05-11T05:51:03Z,0

30,Ugy7BR3C4-jZ2QSTl294AaABAg,runninginsept,"No, they ""leak"" stuff to test the waters, see audience reactions. Like the birthday tweet - that was likely testing the waters lol

In this case, because there has been almost zero news coverage, this was not that kind of leak and possibly just insider chatter. If her source works at WB, it's a 50% chance it holds up, but for me, it doesn't happen until the fat lady sings.",2020-05-09T19:52:35Z,0

37,UgzPO0j8QLhXEZkkmYl4AaABAg,Guy Mercier,"Knowing some lawyers... and in your case not knowing any... might a positive value : ) More seriously, maybe ask if one  of your readers would have some expertise or degree in law as to make a prediction of the outcom... in all cases it's just for fun.   By the way I have an old joke about lawyers... It seems in laboratory research they are thinking of replacing laboratory rats with lawyers... there seem to be 3 reasons: 1) there are more lawyers than rats 2) with time, it seems laboratory personnel do get attached to rats and 3) there are some things that for moral questions rats would not do : )  By the way some of my best friends are lawyers but don‚Äôt seem to like the joke : )",2020-05-09T16:33:44Z,3
