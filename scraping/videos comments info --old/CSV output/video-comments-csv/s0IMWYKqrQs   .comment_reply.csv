The whole way through, Heard's talking like a classic abuser. She presents herself being violent as irrelevant to Depp walking away from conflict. She says that her throwing heavy objects at him shouldn't stop him coming to talk to her about their problems. In her head, her violence isn't the problem, it's a consequence of the problem, and the problem is him.

Yes, of course every case of abuse is different, but there are common patterns, and the most common of those is ""I wouldn't hit you if you were a better person"", and Heard is really leaning dangerously close to that throughout the conversation.",2020-07-29T07:08:01Z,3
