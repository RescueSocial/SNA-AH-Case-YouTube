Their is one problem Amber went further and said Johnny had his followers threaten her life. She further went on to say Johnny used his influence to keep her from work. Those statement makes the case different it is about Johnny using his power to harm her career. This can easily proved to be incorrect and makes this case so different from what happen in England. 

Either way the case will go on even if the judge should agree Johnny was an abuser as Amber brought up an entirely different issue. What is wrong with her legal team?? Could they not see this??

Or is Amber behind the curtain and her destructive wish to see Johnny be proven as an abuser
