If he was as  cunning and manipulative as this AH person, I would have been screwed! So not withstanding that he is a rational mature adult‚Ä¶ he was already in her thrall. Then they got married.

2,Ugw-yEz-fFIzasG0b-Z4AaABAg,The fact that she said they married because she wanted safety and security and he corrected her by saying he married her because he loved her speaks volumes. She‚Äôs a manipulative gold digger plain and simple. She‚Äôs only around cause she‚Äôs tryna collect that check. She just said it. I don‚Äôt know how she was raised but disagreements that lead into arguments that lead into physical altercations are not ‚Äúfighting for each other.‚Äù She asks him what‚Äôs changed? I don‚Äôt fucking know maybe the man doesn‚Äôt want to fight anymore! It‚Äôs exhausting to argue with someone so much to the point of repentance! What a backwards person.

She will poison it. I was looking forward to seeing the sequel, big fan. Because of my personal experience, I  won't subject my self to this awful known narcissist on the screen in any movie, tv program, commercial s etc, that she would be in. She needs to take that 7m settlement and spend the rest of her days getting therapy. If she doesn't, she's only going to get worse with age. Narcissist don't age well and they like it even less.

I came across it while looking at some videos of johnnys case against AH. It really adds great perspective on how AH manipulates and gaslights Johnny.  Also I believe the reason she is SO desperate to get Johnny to stay during these horrible arguments is because she WANTS so bad to push him into hitting her.

170,UgwhmVFEgRh_U1Pg_tN4AaABAg,"I'm only 37 minutes in and I can really get a great feel of what is happening here. Please note that this is just my analysis of listening to the audio recording, I don't know either person except that I have watched the Rum Diary, it's a movie I'm going to watch again, I get a feeling that the loves scenes in that movie was not only acting but they actually fell in love which makes it even more interesting. 

Please note, I'm not trying to take sides, I think there is two broken people trying to fill a void and things has gone wrong. 

Johnny: It appears that he got ADHD as he is taking Adderall. 
Amber: She appear to have some childhood trauma (CPTSD, BPD Traits, anger, mood swings, fear abonnement, unstable sense of self etc) that caused her to fixate on Johnny running away. 
She appear to get upset and angry and push him into running away and then she feels like yeah I knew it he would run away. She appear low on the narcissistic scale 
Johnny: When you have ADHD you tend to lose interest in things and also in romantic partners. So he will slowly lose interest in Amber and will trigger the 'Dance In A Burning Room' that John Mayer (He also have been in this type of relationship and also appear medium to high on the narcistic scale) sings about in that song. He is losing interest, it triggers ambers fears of rejection and then the dance is started. Johnny's ADHD is what makes him a really good actor, as he has that desire for newness, that is probably why he cheated on his ex with Amber, chasing the newness. He appear to me medium to high on the narcistic scale. 

The longer this dance occur the more it will corrode the relationship.",Mikael Hansson,0,2021-03-23T10:45:16Z

180,Ugy1wBFdTnys7juEEsZ4AaABAg,"What is this?! What kind of love is that?! AH say's she loves him? Speaking from someone who has experience domestic abuse, been mentally, physically abused and raped, I'm extremely familiar with being endlessly badgered, talked over, manipulated as AH does in this audio to JD. She's very controlling. Throughout this whole audio she's asking him to change for her, but she has no intention of taking responsibility for her actions, let alone trying to consider to change herself. JD keeps trying to come up with solutions to make that relationship change for the positive and yet she doesn't even come up with anything herself. She keeps asking the same fucking questions. JD keeps answering her questions, but she doesn't answer most of his questions. In fact she straight up avoids them. I like how she said ""one of the adjectives that the people closet to her would describe her as being ""Honest""...... ""Honest"".....??? Unfucking believable! If a fight gets to heated, there is nothing wrong with separating for however long it takes to calm down and asses in a safe environment; take a few hours, a day, 3 days, a week, or even year if need be. This is shameful, insulting, and disrespectful to both women and men who have suffered because of abuse. The way she keeps acting like a victim makes me sick. I can't stop my tears. I suffer from PTSD, social anxiety and major depression. I sometimes go without eating for 3 days in a row without leaving my bed, unless to use the restroom.  I have nightmares that my abuser will come back, but I can't bring myself to hate him. There are times when I have felt all alone, worthless as if my existence is a waste of space to the point I want to die. I am currently getting professional help from my doctor, therapist, and support groups. Those are effects of being abused, so don't pretend to be a victim. I just want JD to know this was not his fault. There is only so much you can do when you get stuck in that kind of situation.  JD you are not at fault. I'm sure you made mistakes in your relationship, but no one deserves what happened to you. You are worthy, loved, and you are not alone. Take time to cry, work out your emotions, and do what's best for you. Surround yourself with your friends and family. Your braver than me. You stood up for yourself. I couldn't do that.

He acts so calm, like he's so willing while gaslighting and being extremely calculated, IMO he's a nasty narcissist I've been there done that mind fuck before.  He doesn't want her to say too much and trys to shut her up each time she does and honestly she seems very intelligent and quite logical as she trys to work thru their issues which are CLEARLY both their faults.

She should be groveling on her hands and knees to him, explaining all the ways she is going to change, not sat there telling him what he should be doing for her in the relationship and how he needs to change,  the things she expecting are ridiculous to it sounds like she is asking him to stay and fight her or to just stand there whilst she uses him as a punching bag, it's actually insane!!!!",Miss Engineer,0,2020-12-20T18:16:00Z

338,UgwRwT56gVCgBk1KaIB4AaABAg,"Yep, that was very triggering (deep breathes)  but needed to be listened to in full. Johnny is a saint ‚ù§ bless his beautiful heart  ‚ù§ Johnny remains so calm in the face of such a brutal and astonishingly twisted, deliberate , cruel cruel words.   Listening to that woman was like riding a roller coaster of manipulation, narcissism, cruelty, totally twisted mentality, volatile, psychotic and so much more.   When  AH says that "" one does not negate the other""  in response to Johnny, (who is trying to bundle the violence and abuse she has inflicted on him into the most calmest and non aggressive way possible to discuss), that response from AH is BS.  One DOES negate the other because its all spewing out of her.  She is in a never ending vicious abusive onslaught, both physically and mentally., turns all sweet, and lashes Johnny again and again.  All of AH's actions, words negate every thing she does and says. Its one big picture, not a thousand little pictures  that she would like to manipulate Johnny and the world into thinking.   AH does not want to see that, or refuses to acknowledge the true depth of her vile behaviour, or cant see it because she's so sick.  She wants Johnny to jump when she says jump, she wants Johnny to do everything that she says, and she shows the crystal clear techniques that a narcissist uses to isolate their target. Every time Johnny has a point she deflects and avoids the truth.  Given the right isolation and control, this woman is capable of driving a person to think of themselves as worthless which could lead into a very dark place.  AH is in a fight club, she beats people up, laughs at friends who beat up each other.  Johnny is a saint.  I thank god, the universe , the angels and all love and light that protected Johnny enough to keep him strong  to walk away, and now he stands strong, and now she finally see's this brave man fight for his right to not be abused by her in anyway, anymore.  #JusticeforJohnnyDepp forever ‚ù§",Flying Without Fear,10,2020-12-18T07:48:24Z

You can clearly hear who the voice of reason is in this. All I constantly hear from Amber is ""I"", ""me"", ""we, but..."". No admission that she has to change. When, a ""but"" is following. Still it is all his fault. And yes he is admirable for running away. I am not sure that I could have done it. She makes me so angry and I cannot even stand to hear her voice anymore. Besides, I am fortunately no victim and it is hard to listen.",Claudia B.,12,2020-12-17T11:44:22Z
384,Ugx_FNmsvvmRU7EEix14AaABAg,"To be fair, Amber does seem genuinely upset and needy. But her needs are unhealthy and selfish. She needs to have the security of having control over Depp and not the security of being in a loving relationship with him. I don't think she is capable of love, she has learned to feign love to gain control of her partner. She is a parasite on her partner, a good one because she knows that a smart parasite doesn't damage it's host utterly. It knows that it is better for the parasite to give it's host hope so that they are not dumped by it's host. But Amber lost control of herself, and indulged herself too far feeding on Depp so he eventually did dump her.
 Then she was so enraged at the insult of being dumped she went for revenge, she is incredibly toxic.",Kate Gould,7,2020-12-17T11:18:22Z
385,Ugw1hKHBg8RwjDVChap4AaABAg,"These audio clips need to be put out there, they are so revealing of who the abuser really was in the marriage.
Hearing Amber talking is so depressing but we need to hear her. She so quickly moves to being contemptuous and mocking in her compulsive need to control and to attempt to take the superior position over Depp. But she can not control herself, very quickly she loses self control and gets very nasty. Nobody should be talked to like Amber talks to Depp. It's not even productive except for her in her insane need to abuse Depp because she is so sick in the head.
What a bitch really is what I am saying.
As for Depp, he put up with far too much from her. It's probably due to his childhood with his mum he was always going to be a perfect target for an abusive partner (from an interview he did with GQ magazine he said that his mum could be angry and he grew up learning to soothe her). But he finally got out of the marriage with Amber, and she continued her abuse with her crazy smear campaign that was actually successful for a long time.
I am backing him all the way in clearing his name, for him and all the other unfortunate people out there abused the same way. Plus, the way Amber has used compassion for DV victims and survivors for her own selfish ends I find absolutely disgusting. Amber should be ashamed of herself, as should all of the people who support her.",Kate Gould,24,2020-12-17T11:07:19Z

She's skeptical, and I would understand it, if he was really at fault here and really was running away from any kind of verbal confrontation of their issues and just was this ""leave me alone woman, I want my peace, stop yapping"" kind of guy. but from everything we see, she was just unbearable and then actually violent with him. if a man wants to give that relationship another chance, then yeah, starting from basics makes some sense.",Viqala,21,2020-12-17T07:36:21Z

First of all, the impression I get is that SHE made the most recordings (depp even tells her to send him the tapes, meaning SHE has them for sure), so she doesnt have them anymore and he has all of them? Meaning she actually sent them all to him at some point or that he made some of them too?
Does she not have any other recordings anymore? If she had, I'd imagine she would provide them herself (if they were good for her), but if they're bad for her, then why is she demanding that depp provides them? They sent that email to his side before depp's deposition, saying he should provide these recordings before it so they can prepare their questions about them, and i think depp's side responded that they will keep providing discovery evidence continuously as they find it and dont have the obligation to provide everything immediately(?).
