18,UgyfVkvyH4QIhVew5Qd4AaABAg,"Great stuff! I've just discovered your channel and binging it since I'm in quarantine with corona at the moment. I'm very late to the discussion about this relationship and recognized many facets of my own past relationships. I think Amber Heard is very good at this. she's really putting the pressure on JD. I was fascinated by the moment he's telling her that he told her he loves her (paraphrasing) and she reacts with: ""loved""! The I rewound, and discovered he did say loved. But he was speaking in the past tense because he was referring to an earlier moment: ""by saying because I loved you, and you're my wife I wanted you to be my wife..."" So he didn't use the past tense because his love was over, as she implies. I think that's rather shrewd. 
Alas, this reminds me of a (then) very important girlfriend, who used to put pressure on me in a similar manner. We broke up after a year of these kind of conversations. We never got into physical fights, but I did experience extreme stress during that period, until I was afraid that she would burn my house down in her anger.",antspace,0,2021-09-29T13:22:39Z
19,UgwAYIEizMZKlc4rJox4AaABAg,"Johnny Depp has a long history of abusive behavior and he had all the power.  

So, while I find her behavior toxic and repulsive, it seems like reactive abuse when looking at the whole.

20,UgyLaiQNe3zO3_uiok54AaABAg,"I think they are both narcissistic. She is definitely the explosive one, but I think he does provoke her. Not justifying her behavior by any means, but she says while arguing that he told her to hit him..then complains to her and a friend that she punched him and uses that as evidence of how shes the crazy one. I think they are both toxic, her more than him, she is definitely a violent, angry person, but he seems to be a passive aggressive type, the kind of person who will push buttons to get a reaction and then use that against you. And let me tell ya, living with someone like that can be infuriating..not that it makes her blameless for her own craziness, just saying it seems to me there was plenty of crazy on his side, too, just a different kind.  That's why so many people disagree on who was at fault for the toxicity in their relationship, because they both are toxic people. Again, not excusing her physical and mental abuse, just saying it went both ways even if he never was physical",Keri Carlson,0,2021-09-22T19:08:54Z

24,UgxPWHpqimIE2-UWNdB4AaABAg,"I have had people say that both abused each other, they seem to think that this is a very clever conclusion to come to in lieu of hearing these audios and consideration of how some people are capable of lying and manipulation. These same people are the ones that enable abusers by saying things like ""oh that's just how are"" and ""don't take them seriously"" when I call out abusive people.

If it was, she would have gone into details because we can hear CLEARLY, THATS WHAT SHE DOES! Toronto incident.... The same. But she mentions Toronto threw out, anyway. Never fights for me? WTF? In my opinion, she WANTS him to STAY in fights so she can take him to a level to where he loses control and hits her really badly so she can run to the police and ruin him thus making ALOT of money. She doesn't answer his questions because she's IN THE WRONG, NOT BECUSE SHE DOESNT WANT TO FIGHT WITH HIM, WHEN THATS EXACTLY WHAT SHE WANTS IN THE FIRST PLACE. The ""loved"" argument by her was the most ridiculous thing I've heard but it DOES VALIDATE the fact that she's just wants to manipulate THE WHOLE CONVERSATION. Herd: ""I'm not saying choose fight"" WTF? She has said ""a million"" times she WANTS HIM TO STAY AND FIGHT AND NOT RUN AWAY! He sounds very tired. I can hear him sigh sometimes, like when your just so tired of things going nowhere. She insults him (he asked her not to) by saying he's not used to the word ""no"" when that has NEVER been seen in Jhonny Depp. Go jerk him off? (not accepting she did lie) I did not punch you, I only hit you? Your just a baby? WHEN HAS HE ACTED LIKE A BABY? The lady is not well mentally, AT ALL. BUT SHE DOES KNOW EXACTLY WHATVSHES DOING.

The most amazing thing with being the favourite person that the borderline can go through a tough day just barely make it and then she will save it all for her 'favourite person' 

When she says she really loves you, she means 'I really need you'. Borderlines are not capable of attach and they don't understand how empathy works as they don't feel it, they think everyone feels the way they do. 

You can test their empathy by asking 'When I got really upset about x do you understand why?' her 'yes' and then you ask her to explain and often get it wrong, they just don't understand it.",Mikael Hansson,0,2021-05-12T10:34:09Z

The most I ever did in return was push her away from me, which she would then blow up about, like I was a physically abusive husband. I would frequently leave the room and many times would have to lock myself in the bathroom or worse, hide. She suffered from alcoholism which when she drank made the fights ten times more violent.

If she was upset by something he did , she couldnt come to him and talk because he took it as a criticism, so he would  leave. she said that in part 2.   In a marriage you have to communicate.   She is saying that there is no communication and for their marriage  to succeed she is asking him to stop doing that.

There is no context as to how these explosive arguments start. I can almost guarantee he has said or done something especially triggering to her that can only be returned with violence. Some narcississtic emotional abuse is so vile that's the only way to fight back. Rather than soothe her, he walks away because he's too angry. Yes. A rational reason albeit, but a covert form of stonewalling, especially if he caused the disagreement. This would be exploiting her fear of abandonment. Covert narcs are not like grandiose, their entire make up is that they are the victim, they will maintain their composure, they will have a lot of rationality in their responses, but it's to torment. He has her at a point in which she looks like the abuser but may not be completely. She may be responding physically because she can not do what he does psychologically. We are far into the relationship, so he has her at a breaking point when he records this. She won't let him speak, yea narcississtic, but perhaps she's heard him speak enough and wants to be heard (irony) but in her already dysfunctional mindset it sounds far more dysfunctional and far more abusive. I don't buy that he wasn't abusive, but, I know few covert narcs. If you do not record them as well, and get them when their face is showing you will NEVER catch them. They are the hardest to catch in bad behavior. He was able to return her smear with proof, because he knew her smear was coming. This was calculated.

I understand that need and that frustration when someone gives you the silent treatment during a confrontation in a relationship or when they walk away or respond in very short, empty sentences. 
Maybe Johnny is guilty of responding that way to her. However, her instability and obvious narcissism in addressing her own needs and properly conveying it to Johnny leaves him confused. Even though, he puts up a decent and logical defense despite her gaslighting. Very different from the way Kaitlin responds to James when he gaslights her in that confronting way. 
So, there seems to be such a fine line because I'm sure many people can identify with Amber in not feeling fought for during an argument with their spouse. And can see how that can lead to intense frustration and possibly anger as she exhibits. But the disconnect between her and people who can relate to her is her rage. Her rage that probably contributes to her distorted perception of the reason that Johnny tries to present in his own defense. It is very sad to listen to this conversation. Because her disorder has confused him so much that he is unable to see the actions that probably fuel her rage. And also see, that she is so erratic that even if he were to see that his ""splitting"" makes her feel so incredible insecure about their marriage, she would be incapable of coming to resolution together about it. 
It's looks like a very complex situation. And Johnny's splitting, which in this case is the best decision he makes during their confrontations, seems to be a coping mechanism that he's developed as a result of his life experience. 
I make this observation soley based on the fact that I can relate to this situation and I choose to confront rather than split. I have some self-destructive impulse, maybe, where I confront and challenge the rageful outburts. And my response must be a coping mechanism I developed as a result of my life experience. 
I guess my ultimate point is that Amber feels hurt by Johnny and Johnny feels hurt by Amber and they both feel this and respond to this in relation to their own developed coping mechanisms that is based on their individual life experience.
Still, it seems that in this case, Johnny is being buldozed by Amber's disorder and it would be best for them to separate and work on their issues separately. We should all aspire towards continual self growth and reflection because the answers the find will always be evolving. 
And Johnny seems like he's more aware of wanting to grow than she is. She doesn't seem to be there yet.",NoWa Clark,0,2020-09-10T14:57:45Z

That alone explains the difference in energy and why she goes from 0 to 100 and starts talking so fast her words slur together. But apart from that, it was common knowledge that he has had substance abuse issues and it made me wonder how long she's been using that to control him. I have a theory that she was pushing on his addiction in hopes of it either consuming him completely, leaving her to inherit his money or at least keeping him agreeable enough to continue treating him however she pleases.... and that's why she was so upset when he brought up a post-nup in Australia (and ended up cutting his finger off).",imlikeheroin,1,2020-07-29T15:56:37Z

I also heard in the video where his butler was searching for JDs finger after she chopped it off and they talk about giving AH an antipsychotic to calm her down and convince her to fly home from Australia during the filming of POTC. She should have been sued by the producers of POTC to wake Johnny up and get him away from her.

Having a temper or even slapping a guy, does not mean the guy can not physically abuse you. 3 Ellen BArkin and Kate Moss implied Depp was abusive 4. Depp trashed hotel rooms with women in them and made death threats to them and to himself. Heard has not history of property damage and unruly behavior 5. A lot of supporting testimony came from Depps 'paid' assistants. Amber has witnesses, her sister, Elon Musk, James Franco, 'not' on her payroll 6. The assistant said Heard copied her rape story, but never said which parts Heard copied. The assistant is not the only woman in the word to have been raped.

This is the exact same ploy Oscar Pistorius used in his trial (plus copious tears) to try and gloss over the ludicrous inconsistencies in his story.

She wants a fight. Frustrated when he removes himself to stop the escalation.  She is needy for attention and thinks that fighting is providing the intensity she needs. Also she does not see that she is responsible for this type of interaction.
It is difficult to listen to this because somehow I feel she needs all consuming closeness, the nearest she identifies that is with is fighting. 
Instead of the closeness she craves, she pushes him away by her behaviour.

Is it possible that JD is a covert narcissist and has been abusing her prior to that? For example, giving her silent treatment, not empathizing, gaslighting her, etc. Can't stop but thinking of Chris Watts, a calm and silent good boy... JD knew that he was recording, so maybe he just wants to portray himself as a good guy and her as a crazy one. That is why he is ''listening to her'' and says almost nothing. I almost believe that this is the first conversation after a long time of giving her a silent treatment. Sorry, but it sounds like her feelings have not been respected and heard, and she desperately tries to make him hear her and pay attention to what she feels. The silent treatment and other narcissistic abuse can drive one insane, and then the narcissist pulls out the camera to portray his victim as an abuser..... So I don't buy this recording... It sounds like he isn't there when she needs him, and she can't trust him, and she doesn't feel safe around him. Yes, it does come out in a very aggressive way. But still.

393,UgwBUFfdstSQSlY_BqV4AaABAg,"*In all the attempts Amber has made of her secret recordings of him reacting to her its clearly obvious she was goading him into a fight so she had some ammunition as she also had planned and been thinking through a plan to make him look bad which means she new she didnt want to be with him and maybe this was her plan all along? But she seams a little unstable at times with all her swearing and screaming at him and she seams bored by his responses of the way he deals with her which is to go into another room for a quiet life and until she has calmed down, i do feel sorry for him even all her domestic violence accusations were disturbing i dont think he could say boo to a goose he just doesnt have it in him and he even tells her he married her because he loved her which sends her crazy as she took that as past tense which he didnt mean, but she is a very calculated sneaky manipulating young woman and i bet hes so happy shes out of his life but i hope everything is sorted for him soon and all cleared up after this court mess, but she has admitted to hitting him and throwing cups,plates and pots and pans at him saying hes a baby and stand up for yourself, which truely shows she was the abuser not him and yes he did admit to head butting her but he said it was in defense of her attacking him and he did it to get away, i think everyone is on his side and all know she crazy and odd, he probably never wants to marry ever again and she probably put him off for life*",Liverbird 55,0,2020-07-11T08:41:39Z

I have the bad misfortune of having a loved one held hostage by a BPD, it would be much easier if she was not a woman. Yes we have had loved ones abused by their men, but we have had at least some help or outlets but with a woman its much harder and you feel helpless. And this is a common thing he keeps running away from her, and no matter where he goes she will not respect boundaries, he runs to his sisters house, she marches in at 6am straight into the house walking around looking for him, 
Goes to his daughters same thing. Goes overseas to live with relatives, who have unlisted numbers somehow tracks down the number, relatives tell her not to call she calls several times a day. She lies to everyone in his wider group of friends, extended famijly, peers anyone who knows him just ot get information on him. She then gets a job on the isolated island he ran away to, and finally wears him down via guilt because he married her. She has launched distortion campaigns agaist his close family, like going to 100s of people trying to builds lies about them and turn people against them, very malicious lies to police that have led to court cases and everything. The only good thing is the large extended family know each other and can see through her lies but not all the police and anti domestic abuse groups. She is a woman and cannot be at fault. 
I fear if he ever manages to leave her and stay away she will kill him if she cannot hurt him enough indirectly via lies and this also might extend to his close friends and relatives. She is so sick she get jealous of his children, nieces and nephews, grandchildren, grand nieces and nephews especially the female ones its so sick. His granddaughter got married, granddaughter hates her, her mother hates her she was not invited to the wedding in yet another country and she follows him and gate crashes it to keep an eye on him. IF she was a man the family would physically throw her out. And its annoying because he said he could isolate her from the rest of us, have a life with us without including her because he knows how damaging she is but its an illusion. Some people have had to sever their relationships with him, to protect themselves from her, she will only be satisfied once she has 100% isolated him from his loved ones, family and friends.",Thomas Neale,0,2020-06-03T09:02:57Z

I have being diagnosed with BPD, and trying my best to control my behaviour. If there is a fight between me and a partner,  the rage is so intense but I am aware that is the BPD and I try to control my tone of voice,  breaking things etc. From the partner perspective I think he cant see that in a fight I gain a bit of control, cuz trust me all I feel in those moments is to scream,  cry,  kicking stuff but I also feel the need of him hugging me telling me I love you, everything will be ok. The above was just an example as I am single. I am really afraid of being with someone,  first is because I feel unwanted by anyone and then I'm like how will I be able to find someone who will try to understand all my crap. Is not fair.

She seems to see chaos/fights and even physical encounters to be a way for her to get attention....and she wants to fight (until he does something bad enough she can blame him for) then the ideal result would be him pleading, professing his love to her and ‚Äúproving‚Äù how much he loves her in doing so? I think that is what she means by ‚Äúfighting for her‚Äù she means she wants him to feel like he has lost her and then ‚Äúfight‚Äù to get her back. Maybe that was how the beginning of their relationship was. Now he just walks away and it drives her mad.

She feels like she needs that to feel loved and wanted. 

I do believe he abused her....she may have provoked and pushed him to it but that does not excuse him physically hurting her. Ever. Period. We have no idea what he is like intoxicated either. 

But clearly, she seems to have a very unhealthy way of wanting to feel loved; testing him to see if he ‚Äúabandons‚Äù her or stays. And by provoking him; hitting him, throwing things, can not be excused either. They are both abusers.",Sbesch 17,0,2020-03-11T05:46:32Z

You can show them texts they sent and they will say I don‚Äôt remember that. They even pretend that I haven‚Äôt cut them off aside from holidays and birthdays.

She needs help... But she's a true borderline. Understand the core content of a borderline is nothing like someone's with narc traits at all. She clings to him and she needs him to not leave her in the middle of fights and she needs him to talk to her or she gets anxiety.... Those are borderline issues steming from her fear of him leaving her in an argument. So she doesn't know how to emotionally react properly and it triggers her fears. She's a Borderline.

605,UgwvvL3aHRfzbC_UjMp4AaABAg,"I grew up in a very abusive home with a drunk father. I would be woken up by finding myself being slammed against a wall then thrown to the floor because I did not do my chores. I would be chased down the street, and when i returned home my bed would be slashed with a knife because my father could not catch me. I (and the rest of the family) would be forced to flee the house as my father was on drunken insane rampage smashing windows and furniture. I was kicked between the legs when he was wearing steel capped boots, and I guess I was lucky it hit my upper inner thigh instead of otherwise, but it still hurt like hell and made it difficult for me to walk for days. I also had to stand in front of him, whilst he sat on the couch and lectured me on all my faults and why I was terrible. Then answer his questions. If I answered ""yes"" to his question of did I agree with his judgement of me, I would get in trouble and he would say I was just agreeing with him, if I answered ""no, I did not agree"", I would get in trouble for disagreeing with him, if I said nothing I would get in trouble for saying nothing. I would constantly try to run away often in the middle of the night when they did not even know I was gone, (first time  I did so I was around 6), but I felt there was nowhere to go so before dawn I would return and they often did not even know I had gone.


Now as an adult, I am a large guy, guys very rarely want to get physical with me. I have not been in a physical altercation since I left the home of my father as a teen. BUT plenty of girls I know (often just ""friends"" not girlfriends"") feel comfortable in just hitting me, punching me in the arm or similar. Not in a angry violent manner, just in a friendly manner. It bothers me immensely because I really do not like getting hit, even in fun. BUT because I dislike hitting others even more, I guess I come across as rather passive, so girls seem to feel comfortable in hitting me even when I have asked them not to. I believe there is this expectation that men, are just supposed to stoically take being hit by a woman. And if you do not like it, you are a ""pussy"". So it ends uip situations that you would not accept from another male, you end up accepting from a female just because a) society expects you to  and b) because you know if you retaliate there is a power imbalance and you truely just do not want to hurt them. So you are stuck with running away or grin and bearing it. You are trapped.",Glen Be,0,2020-02-15T00:55:26Z

616,UgwtalBtnprePNi2MSh4AaABAg,I absolutely hate this.  As a woman who has experienced extreme violence from a partner  the fact she accused him of abuse when she was the abuser  is her literally doing extreme damage to real victims all over the world.  And we don‚Äôt need more people to doubt our experiences. We have enough already.  Domestic abuse is such a sore topic because so many man ( some women yes but mostly men ) do abuse their partners and of course feel they can‚Äôt be honest about their actions without being seen as a monster so of course so many lie. Putting all the emphasis on the women to prove not only have you been abused but they their partner is lying.  Because of how common it is to find a man that has abused a partner sadly. Men who have  usually are the loudest sceptic of her truth. Out of anger due to his own situation      I got a rude awakening of how common it truly is. When I thought I was ready to date again  I can tell you more times then not. The men I met had their own ‚Äústory‚Äù of being ‚Äúfalsely‚Äù accused from a lying ex. ü•∫ü•∫ü§®.   There is no way. That percentage of men have been falsely accused of physically abusing their partners   Not possible. I can say. I decided then. I wasn‚Äôt ready.  I found I either didn‚Äôt want to cause any tension or I felt I was actually trying to talk myself into believing him  thinking he must be telling me the truth to have told me this information so quickly in our relationship. It‚Äôs been 5 years and I still feel I‚Äôm not ready or I don‚Äôt want to have to relive my past by spending any amount of time questioning if I‚Äôm safe with this person.,Amy v,1,2020-02-14T18:50:45Z

She exhibited many of the EXACT same behaviors, tone of voice, point of arguments, and everything. She would always deflect. It was always somebody else's fault that she was in a bad mood or reacted the way she did (often in a negative way). Never taking any responsibility for her own actions. She would often resort to hitting me when I've done nothing to justify that type of reaction. Never got physical with her, never ONCE raised my voice at her, never spoke in an aggressive tone, never said anything out of line, never lied, never cheated.....nothing. Yet we had literally never gone more than 2 days without an argument or her feeling some type of way about something anybody did that day (we dated for 6 months to put that into perspective). And a lot of that had to do with her insecurities and that same fear of abandonment. Constantly projecting that on to me got so exhausting. I'm a really mellow guy. I'm never the type to feel stressed out or have anxiety. But I noticed at one point that's exactly what I was feeling whenever I had to deal with her. And that was extremely out of character for me. I didn't feel like the same person anymore. It was at that moment I decided to leave, no matter what she said or how she felt (of course she attempted to make me feel bad about it). I'm responsible for my own happiness and she was causing me the opposite. Despite that, I actually don't see her as a bad person. She's actually really sweet, bubbly, and adorable.

Also can one be less abusive and one more but both are technically abusive to each other but the one who is more abusive does more serious levels if abuse and more serious injury then the other and should the physical capacity for harm of each be factored in eg one partner being physically stronger and bigger then the other, should age differences if significant like with Amber and johnny( 20years age difference). Should it also be considered that over forms of abuse and the more impulsive emotionally reactive and volatile maybe appear more abusive then more covert/ or emotionally controlled and premeditated forms/ styles of abuse can appear less abusive but maybe not be. For example abuse that is not emotionally charged and impulsive and also physical could seem more abusive then say a intentional emotionally calm and quiet and that say is emotional abuse like withholding attention/ affection eg an absent long silent treatment or withholding all physical contact including sex . The absence of meeting the other partners needs and dismissal of their feelings and rights and opinions could seem less abusive then a physically aggressive yelling emotionally volatile , verbally abusive style of abuse but it could actually be they are equally abusive .Just questions I have, not saying one way or the other . To play devils advocate could Amber be a borderline with antisocial traits or a malignant narcissist and Jonny could be a quiet borderline or covert narcissist introverted but emotionally withholding and detached ? The first impression I get is Amber could be a Malignant Borderline and maybe Jonny has substance abuse issues and social anxiety and deppression more on the neurotic side .I havnt had a thorough listen to this video or the audio recordings yet so I really probably shouldn‚Äôt be commenting on this.

The crimes Amber Heard committed, namely battery and perjury, both of which went unpunished, are not anomalies. They are common occurrences. My own mother did it to my father. And some of my personal friends have suffered it as well. Despite this we have social justice movements that demonize men, particularly if they're white, and victimize women, which only exacerbates this problem.

I am not saying Depp is necessary 100% innocent, but it does bring into question what she has said and her claims could ultimately damage the cause. I have seen some people claim that Depp's behaviour in THIS video is abusive because he is silent and distant.

When the partner had enough and threaten to leave, she then would threaten with killing herself, and when that didnt work the thrash talking and physical violence with kick in. She went through many many partners  while I knew her. She never had any  friends and would do a lot of gaslighting, even with me. She  never took accountability for her actions or behavior and became vindictive. This explains her not having friends, no one could tolerate her.

Had you have told me five years ago that somebody could be like this, I never would‚Äôve believed it....My sister has first-hand experience what it‚Äôs like to be with a borderline. It‚Äôs been absolute hell and she still is trying to recover from the abuse. As soon as I heard the tapes, I instantly knew that this was borderline based on what Amber was saying and doing. My sisters ex would literally do the exact same stuff. She would get unbelievably scary and start self harming herself and throwing stuff and going into an absolute rage. My sister would get scared and leave the relationship or leave the place that this was happening. Then the abuser would say the exact same stuff about needing safety from my sister that she wasn‚Äôt going to leave when times got ‚Äúbad ‚Äú. She also blamed my sister for all of her scary behavior. They literally made threats was always completely volatile and explosive and would threaten suicide when my sister would want to leave the relationship... but the way that Amber sat there and talked about needing ‚Äúsafety‚Äù from Johnny Depp and that it didn‚Äôt matter how scary they got, that it was completely irrelevant, is literally Word for Word what my sister went through....then on top of it, after it was over for good...this person got online and did an unbelievable smear campaign on my sister and said that they went through the stuff that my sister actually went through. It‚Äôs evil and sinister!!!! That particular person is on Facebook acting as if they were the ones who were abused.

To me, he's behaving in a passive and evasive way and not interested in meeting her half way.  It's easier for him to leave a room or mumble through a conversation than to take her seriously and deal with root issues in their marriage.   At 21:24 she says he takes her for granted and his response is about throwing pots and pans.  Huh??  Wrongly, the focus here is that he's leaving a room when pots are flying but the greater point is being missed. (No one is going to stay in a room when something is being thrown at them!)  She's saying he leaves the room when anything gets too hard.  She is fighting for her relationship and is coming off as the bad guy.

I wonder if he is empathic or at least very, very deep and loving. Narcissists prey on people like that. I can relate to being in his position. 

Another thing I find interesting is how quick the media was to get behind Amber with these allegations.

And really, if you are in a relationship with someone and they never give you a chance to speak because they are leaving all the time, when you do speak... probably you would sound crazy like this.

He was an alcoholic and a narcissist and I had serious abandonment issues. I stayed in therapy to work through the childhood trauma and codependency and I feel like I‚Äôm in a much healthier place mentally. But he quickly dropped out of therapy and went back to his coping mechanisms. I read so many books on narcissism and how to live with one, but it didn‚Äôt help. Setting boundaries and not playing into the codependent cycle didn‚Äôt help the relationship. He eventually devalued and discarded me.

I think he's likely being nicer to her knowing he's on tape but ultimately we are seeing a window into how it  was between them. Her perpetually accusatory, waiting for any sort of misstep (in her minds eye) and him getting overwhelmed over and over and trying escape her tirades.  It definitely reminded me of how he physically seemed very bedraggled while they were together- the photos in the press and whatnot. What a sad relationship for them both. I sort of hope he drops his lawsuit now though as I think these recordings are evidence enough of character malignment,  no need to financially ruin the poor women.

934,Ugwi3Ox8QfreAlydAtd4AaABAg,"Brilliant analysis! One of your best ones in my humble opinion. I enjoyed this one a lot although it was rather uncomfortable to listen to (not you, I mean the recording).
What occurs to me, that I find somewhat frightening, is that, one has to take into account how important it was that Johnny Depp actually recorded the conversation. In today's environment of the ME-TOO culture, if Johnny Depp had not had any  recorded evidence of the state of their relationship the chances are the media would have believed her word over his. Since this recording has come out, virtually all of Johnny Depp's previous relationships have come out and defended his ""calm"" and ""gentleman"" nature. Even so, without this tape, the chance are it would be bad for him.¬†
The other thing that bothers about this recording (the first time I have listened to it actually) is the aggressive manner in which Amber Heard behaves. Raising her voice every second sentence. That made me feel very uncomfortable. And yet this seems to be seen as OK. But again, if this behaviour was reversed, and it was Johnny Depp who was raising his voice that way, he would have been immediately accused as abuse. 
I am not saying in the least that the ME:TOO movement has not done any good. It has. No one can say against that. But it suggests that perhaps we are heading into an uncertain future in which couples, people in relationships, will have to have a recording device on 24 hours a day.",RED Knight,13,2020-02-12T14:19:43Z

I had perceived it, from only losely following their case in the press, that Depp was the agreesor in the relationship and that he had thrown a mobile phone at Heard's face at some point in their marriage - an inexcusable act unless it were a life or death situation where she was coming at him with a knife or something. In this recording Depp is not getting triggered by any of Heard's manipulative and out of control behaviour. I guess he got abusive with that phone of his at a later time then, and so this recording shows at they both ended up being abusive, and should have divorced earlier than they did.

I have an in-law who seems to have a personality disorder and narcissism. Their behaviour has been very painful for our family, but we have tried to forgive and be kind and loving. We've tried to understand them and show that we care, but it makes no difference - they see us as a threat and they seek to damage relationships. They are so desperate for affirmation, acceptance, etc. but their behaviour is so bad that they push people away, and also cut themselves off from people .

979,Ugyoeb-79-_7S8iqBqJ4AaABAg,"I would like to comment that not all people with bpd act in the same way as Amber Heard did in this conversation, although she is showing mannerisms and use of language that is common with impulsive type bpd (we are unaware of any diagnosis). I have bpd (borderline type) and am in constant therapy for more self awareness for this, also with borderline personality disorder (also known as emotionally unstable personality disorder) there are two types, impulsive type: which is more quick tempered and violent in nature, often synonymous with being abusive and emotionally manipulative, often with the inability to control feelings of anger in the same way a neurotypical person would be able to and borderline type: which is more vulnerable and passive, often with the inability to control feelings of sadness, so pretty much would never act like this, and likely cannot even naturally fall into this behaviour due to being suppressed, often in childhood and therefore lacking that neural pathway. So I guess my point is: please don‚Äôt assume all of us with bpd are going to be abusive and violent and that you should never get into a relationship with anyone with bpd, some of us (granted mostly people with borderline type) are able to have healthy relationships and are not going to be manipulative and abusive

Edit: also I do not mean this as criticism to you and your analysis of this situation, more to spread the awareness that bpd isn‚Äôt always how Amber heard is :)

I think they both have issues. She comes across as having a fear of being abandoned and of being shamed, and he sounds emotionally detached. I was married to someone who was emotionally detached and very manipulative. He deliberately pushed my buttons and actually admitted he loved to get me angry and to look like the innocent victim in front of the children. It's passive abuse. He really screwed with my head with his mind games.

This is a woman who had previously abused another ex before she met him I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs a given that she would have abused again but listening to her taunting manipulative behaviour by trying to goad him into literally hitting back is hideous . The photos of his injuries to his face and the chopped off finger are heartbreaking.
It‚Äôs so important to raise awareness that men are abused too ,it‚Äôs just sadly still hard in society for men to come forward .
She is a vile woman people say she‚Äôs beautiful personally I think the ugly of her nature shines through .always have .

Nothing he will try and do or say will ever work he shows enormous restraint. 
When someone like this is in your life they are in your face literally following you phoning you tearing you down constantly. Speaking from experience.

The media blame on Johnny Depp was hideous he was fired from Disney and she has continued to try to control even now they are divorced .
She‚Äôs like a cat playing with a mouse . 
These people are indeed ‚Äòmad making ‚Äò they make you question everything about yourself to the point you lose yourself.
There‚Äôs some interesting clips when they were together and photos and He looks actually afraid of her .
People forget just because he‚Äôs famous he‚Äôs still a human being .

Interesting isn‚Äôt it that his ex wife /partner girlfriends friends colleagues staff have made statement after statement what a kind gentle soul he is he‚Äôs not perfect who is but his restraint against her pure white hot manipulative anger is incredible.

I‚Äôm sad he has been through this but he maybe by airing these tapes which were done apparently as part of their marriage therapy and consented to by both , will raise awareness that men can be abused to the point of suicide .

Amber needs serious help .

1042,UgwXjIsrZKf6r4j5OpF4AaABAg,"There are two issues with reality because in another tape Depp says ""You're not here, you're in my head, you're something in my head"" and it's a breaking point in the conversation, just before he tells ""ok we go to court"". Amber Heart lives in her crazy world, it's obvious, but how Johnny Depp had succeed to manage all these logic bombs and absurd angers and gaslighting and violence etc and always wanted to marry her ?! He continues to say ""I love you"" even if her words are complete non sense and she's abusing him non stop ! So Depp is the coolest man on earth but he has a problem with reality too. Perhaps there is something like the narc mask for the victims ? Like ""the victim lens"" which isn't built by the narc. I don't know which expression to use but there is something, a sick thirst for illusion, in the victim mind. EDIT : ""the rose-coloured glasses of the victim"" ?",Marc Molk,60,2020-02-12T08:57:29Z

I'm only 1/5th in but.....I know that it is VERY hard to call who is the abuser when a conversation is taken out of context. Yes, she sounds like the problem here, blaming him etc. Beating him down with words really. But I've myself sounded like a crazy person when I just couldn't get through to the other person after many, many, many attempts.

I know some women in particular may get desperate in a relationship with egotistical, uncaring men, and when having the opportunity they lash out, all they have are words, but the men hold the power in the relationship (money, not really caring about the woman, too egocentric, walking away leaving the woman with the emotional load etc).

1051,Ugyoto5n4Y_6-3Z0sWJ4AaABAg,"I've been in a long term relationship with a girl like this and it's an impossible situation. The situation would get heated, I used to drive away for solace, then I got bombarded with phone calls til I returned, then there was no resolution to the argument when I did return. Often the argument wasn't even directly about something I did wrong, she was just angry and projecting it onto me. I felt there was nowhere to turn, because I didn't want to tell my parents because it was so embarrassing. Anyone who has been in this situation will understand how awful it is, especially if that person is completely financially reliant on you, no parental support of her own to fall back on. You develop a guilt complex, being torn to leave or not. I used to get heart pains, chest pains, couldn't sleep, I'd tell her this, but she didn't care how I felt about it all. Things could only be happy when she was happy. The conversation with Depp walking through the problems with her and hitting brick walls, no solution to her grievances under any circumstances, going round in circles all the time, rings so many bells to me. If anyone is in this situation with a male or female, get out as soon as you can, if the warning signs are there don't financially commit yourself because it will make it even harder to remove yourself from the situation. Don't ignore your instincts, it will only lead to a life of resentment and unhappiness.",karl bristow,336,2020-02-12T08:43:41Z

He centering on that and he is acting ignorant of what and why they are fighting and keeps bringing up the stuff he knows is not what they are dealing with. 
He is being condescending and you can tell he is repeating what she normally says. It is even stated this is the only time he has actually talked to her. And he only doing it to get all her wrongs on tape .  He leaves = her throw pan
Not 
She throws = him leave

And she tried so hard to manipulate him mentally just to find a button that just isnt there. And that's the common thread of their conversations. Because of that Amber was self destrucing with every statetment she made
P.s. and that's a good example of how to stand your ground with a narcissist. You hold to your values and dont give in. 
Amber would destroy that man if he in any moment lost his guard and love for her. If she had even a fiber of evidence against Depp she would have destroyed him. She almost did :(",Zeljka Strbat,460,2020-02-12T08:12:47Z
