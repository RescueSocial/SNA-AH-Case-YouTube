Just because you assert something as a fact does not make it so. We have jurisprudence specifically to resolve complex legal arguments to deal with conflicting laws, legal practices, and precedents for the exact reason that the law is often conflicting and dependent upon the circumstances of a particular case. 
I stated quite clearly that there is no jury to prejudice. No refutation. I stated that the video about Heard was already publicly available. Thus, reporting about already publicly available information cannot prejudice the legal proceedings in question... That would be true even if there was a jury in this case... which there is not. 
I stated that the BBC reported on the grooming trial that you presented as proof of your assertion and that none of the individuals at the BBC were arrested for reporting in the case. Thus, proving that the case against TR was a case of selective prosecution and an example of state persecution. No refutation.",2020-07-08T01:20:07Z,2

It's a well-trodden path to attack the man when you cannot attack the argument. 
When I was younger, I reflexively believed the hype about TR. That he was racist and an Islamophobe, etc. Then, I started doing some research into the matter and found those allegations not to be true. 
I'd tell you more about myself but I'd prefer it if you peddled more absurd assumptions about me so that I can trash them the same way I trashed your legal argument.",2020-07-08T01:00:01Z,1
70,Ugxms8aVdpn5waI6UXB4AaABAg,Adam Martin,"@Chris Potts Everyone knows the case against Tommy Robinson was bogus. 
The facts he reported about the grooming case in question were already reported on by the BBC. Was anyone at the BBC arrested for reporting on that same grooming case? 
Anyone who knows anything about TR knows that the state has an agenda against him because he refused to work for British intelligence as an informant. 
If what you're saying is true (and it's not... these laws are, by their very nature, selectively enforced and imposed upon the weak by the powerful and not upon the powerful themselves), then I and anyone else who talks about a publicly available video that has already been reported on by honest actors is liable for arrest and prosecution. That is clearly not the case. 
Moreover, as juries are no longer a part of judicial proceedings in civil cases (although legally they still can be) and all the important matters in civil proceedings such as this are determined by the judge hearing the case (who already has all of the evidence available to him), reporting/documenting a clearly observable, known, and publicly available fact about the nature of the relationship between Depp/Heard could not possibly affect the outcome of the case in any way.",2020-07-07T23:58:30Z,2

That doesn't mean everything is fake to me lol, that just means if you are going to believe something, you need to see the story from every side you can. Everybody is paid these days if they have a platform. You just need to look at WHY they are being paid and determine whether you can ethically support that reason.

To Force people using Draconian methods ie Threat of Legal action with Letters and Intimidating Enforcement officers visiting peoples homes in a threatening manner is against a person's  freedom of choice and personal liberties.
