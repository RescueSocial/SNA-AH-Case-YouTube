A lot of it stemmed from his own war-related ptsd (not to make excuses) but also from our relationship cuz we‚Äôve been through some shit. And I have my own childhood trauma. But I used to put hands on him and i am so fucking lucky he didn‚Äôt return that shit. I‚Äôll never forgive myself for it. That‚Äôs disgusting behavior and it‚Äôs never validated (I mean unless you are really defending yourself). Physical violence is never okay and it can get you killed. 
So while he may be the shittiest cunt around- he still doesn‚Äôt deserve to be hit, especially by a woman. That shit ain‚Äôt fair, IDGAF what you say. If I, as a woman, put hands up to a man, I fully expect equal rights to be served. 

And I highly fucking doubt he really hit her, ever. Because she‚Äôd definitely not be talking to him like that and still hitting him if she had really been hit like a man. IDGAF what you say lol she‚Äôd be acting a little less vindicated. I have actually been hit by a man ‚Äúon accident‚Äù lol (I shoved my friend off a couch when we were black out drunk & startled himüòÖ) and I had the nastiest black eye/fucked up face. And he was in his 20s - no where near old man strength lmao.
