As was mentioned in a previous comment, why was AH's father not gunning for JD over the supposed DV?  Because it obviously didn't happen.  It is hardly a surprise that AH is the way she is, judging by her father's actions.  Mr. Heard wears a Stetson but this is not the wild west.  In the absence of intelligence, people resort to violence and threats of violence.  JD is the polar opposite - he is like a latter day hippy.

Opinions

Amber Heard: I spoke up against sexual violence ‚Äî and faced our culture‚Äôs wrath. That has to change.





Amber Heard arrives at the premiere of ""Aquaman"" on Dec. 12 in Los Angeles. (Jordan Strauss//Invision/AP)

By Amber Heard¬†

Dec. 18, 2018 at 3:58 p.m. MST

Amber Heard is an actress and ambassador on women‚Äôs rights at the American Civil Liberties Union.

I was exposed to abuse at a very young age. I knew certain things early on, without ever having to be told. I knew that men have the power ‚Äî physically, socially and financially ‚Äî and that a lot of institutions support that arrangement. I knew this long before I had the words to articulate it, and I bet you learned it young, too.

Like many women, I had been harassed and sexually assaulted by the time I was of college age. But I kept quiet ‚Äî I did not expect filing complaints to bring justice. And I didn‚Äôt see myself as a victim.

Then two years ago, I became a public figure representing domestic abuse, and I felt the full force of our culture‚Äôs wrath for women who speak out.



Friends and advisers told me I would never again work as an actress ‚Äî that I would be blacklisted. A movie I was attached to recast my role. I had just shot a two-year campaign as the face of a global fashion brand, and the company dropped me. Questions arose as to whether I would be able to keep my role of Mera in the movies ‚ÄúJustice League‚Äù and ‚ÄúAquaman.‚Äù





I had the rare vantage point of seeing, in real time, how institutions protect men accused of abuse.

Imagine a powerful man as a ship, like the Titanic. That ship is a huge enterprise. When it strikes an iceberg, there are a lot of people on board desperate to patch up holes ‚Äî not because they believe in or even care about the ship, but because their own fates depend on the enterprise.



In recent years, the #MeToo movement has taught us about how power like this works, not just in Hollywood but in all kinds of institutions ‚Äî workplaces, places of worship or simply in particular communities. In every walk of life, women are confronting these men who are buoyed by social, economic and cultural power. And these institutions are beginning to change.

We are in a transformative political moment. The president of our country has been accused by more than a dozen women of sexual misconduct, including assault and harassment. Outrage over his statements and behavior has energized a female-led opposition. #MeToo started a conversation about just how profoundly sexual violence affects women in every area of our lives. And last month, more women were elected to Congress than ever in our history, with a mandate to take women‚Äôs issues seriously. Women‚Äôs rage and determination to end sexual violence are turning into a political force.





We have an opening now to bolster and build institutions protective of women. For starters, Congress can reauthorize and strengthen the Violence Against Women Act. First passed in 1994, the act is one of the most effective pieces of legislation enacted to fight domestic violence and sexual assault. It creates support systems for people who report abuse, and provides funding for rape crisis centers, legal assistance programs and other critical services. It improves responses by law enforcement, and it prohibits discrimination against LGBTQ survivors. Funding for the act expired in September and has only been temporarily extended.



We should continue to fight sexual assault on college campuses, while simultaneously insisting on fair processes for adjudicating complaints. Last month, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos proposed changes to Title IX rules governing the treatment of sexual harassment and assault in schools. While some changes would make the process for handling complaints more fair, others would weaken protections for sexual assault survivors. For example, the new rules would require schools to investigate only the most extreme complaints, and then only when they are made to designated officials. Women on campuses already have trouble coming forward about sexual violence ‚Äî why would we allow institutions to scale back supports?

I write this as a woman who had to change my phone number weekly because I was getting death threats. For months, I rarely left my apartment, and when I did, I was pursued by camera drones and photographers on foot, on motorcycles and in cars. Tabloid outlets that posted pictures of me spun them in a negative light. I felt as though I was on trial in the court of public opinion ‚Äî and my life and livelihood depended on myriad judgments far beyond my control.





I want to ensure that women who come forward to talk about violence receive more support. We are electing representatives who know how deeply we care about these issues. We can work together to demand changes to laws and rules and social norms ‚Äî and to right the imbalances that have shaped our lives.",Asshats Love Johnny Depp!!

     You'll enjoy this, it's the first text from David Clinton Heard that Mr. Depp received, on 5/27/2016, AFTER Ms. Heard filed for a restraining order  ""I can only imagine how you feel I wish I could be there so I could step in but she's listening to a lawyer because somebody told her that she had to be at house in 30 days with no where to go or something and I sure hope you don't mention to her that we talked it after we had that good talk to you and I had that long talk that same day is when you went over there this afternoon and I got a message from her that if I ever talk to you again should never talk to me again I don't know I don't know if maybe you said something to her that made her think that I told you something that I shouldn't have or said something I shouldn't have , I don't know but the anger that she had to me when I talk to her and she told me I couldn't tell her anything she told me to f**k off and I can't I couldn't believe she say that to me and she's been talking a lot to her lawyer is the one who said if she didn't file then she could be locked out of the apartment and it is f****d up as it sounds if there was anyway anyway did you guys could talk if One text message without so much anger you know I know the anger in your current text to me just now shows me how angry you are with every right to be but if y'all could just talk it out and you know you could talk her into withdrawing all bad maybe I don't know I don't know how it's going to come back from this but it's possible. I still love you man
     Mr. Depp replied: ""I love you too, brother, always will. I never said s thing to amber about ANYTHING WE'VE EVER SPOKEN ABOUT!!! i do not throw people under the bus. She can have her life now...whatever she wants.
     To which Mr. Heard says:""Yeah I think she grabbed your phone while you're not looking and looks it to messages At the messages and notes out she knew that you and I messaged each other that day before we talked , There's got to be away around that restraining order in the sense it may be through your lawyer and her lawyer and or something you know and and try to get over it I know it's a lot to get over
     Is it just me, or does Mr. Depp type (supposedly, according to Ms. Heard, who lies) better drunk than Mr. Heard Types sober?
     If you think THESE texts DO NOT SOUND like a father who has just found out his daughter was being abused...WAIT until you read Ms. Heard's MOTHER'S texts. Full of ""I love you, I want to adopt you, I want to continue having a friendship with you, the lawyers are making her lie, you two can work this out, DON'T tell Amber we texted.""

65,UgykBV53MlmPofaRzWF4AaABAg,"What had happen, Amber and Johnny were either already separated or already divorced. She took her mustang to the same mechanic johnny used, or the same mechanic Johnny  took Amber‚Äôs mustang to in the past when they were together. WELL, the work was done, and AMBER wanted Johnny to pay for the car getting worked on. Well, Johnny said NO. And the mechanic was not going to release Amber‚Äôs car until the bill got paid. 

Amber freaked out on the mechanic. She told her dad. Her dad freaked out on the mechanic. Amber was creating some boohoo story saying she needed her car to work or something (most studios will provide transportation, major news outlets, networks of interview shows can provide transportation as part of a rider agreement), her lawyers can provide transportation to and from their offices. 

She made money from her work, why couldn‚Äôt she pay for a car repair. If it was after the divorce, she had the divorce settlement. THERE IS NO PAPER TRAI OR PROOF, that she donated all 6-7 million dollars like she promised and told people she was going to donate if she win that in her divorce settlement. I have only found that she donated $1,350,000, not the 6-7 million she promised, BUT SHE TOLD MANY OUTLETS SHE DID DONATED THAT.

It just boggles my mind that she expected Johnny to pay for it!!!!! It seems SHE WAS DEFINITELY BELIEVING JOHNNY WOULD PAY FOR IT!!!!! Due to the fact that she took it there, left it, work was done, and somehow told the car mechanic place to charge Johnny. They probably contacted Johnny and he said no.

I fix, you pay...and if you can't pay, the car stays.""

Texas dads are always full of piss and vinegar when it concerns their kids (and money), and like to brag A LOT...fortunately, for the rest of the country, their threats carry no weight outside their home state, and other state's jails are chock plumb full of Texans who forgot where they were when they broke the laws. The added caveat of former president George Bush Jr.'s (one of Texas's own) ""homeland security"" laws makes threats like Mr. Heards and act of ""terroristic threatening"" punishable by prison time and heavy fines.

The father and the daughter wanting to exploit Johnny, it‚Äôs all just awful, and the mother enabling it.
Even when she is talking to Johnny, and she denies any of this is Amber‚Äôs fault, by saying, ‚Äúit is the attorneys.‚Äù
And pretending the narrative that Amber wants to, that she is not intentionally doing something horrific to Johnny, she is forced to, in order to keep his penthouse.
Even though Johnny told her she could have the damn thing for four months or whatever length of time she needed, so it was just a fake excuse to do all of this terrible stuff to Johnny.
