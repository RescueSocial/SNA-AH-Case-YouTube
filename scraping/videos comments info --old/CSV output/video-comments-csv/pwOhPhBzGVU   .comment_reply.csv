Even if Johnny decides to take a shit üí© and take photos of it and post it on some website where most klicks will be from Germanyüá©üá™ anyway (I'm from there btw.), I would still support him, by watching/rating, and even pay good money üí∂ for it.

129,UgyYha_5VaaPU-sgWoR4AaABAg,iSlippery Fellow,@#JohnnyDeppIsARapist!! #JohnnyDeppesracista So a superhero movie which had her starring in a supporting role made money because of her and not the superhero who is the titular character. Most people who went to see aquaman did not even know of the existence of character that she played. People went to see Potc because of Captain Jack Sparrow. Johnny depp himself has been paid more money to do cameos in films than what Amber was payed to star in a supporting role in a big budget superhero movie.,2021-06-24T17:18:54Z,4
