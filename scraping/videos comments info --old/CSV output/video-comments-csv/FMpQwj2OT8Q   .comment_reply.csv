Either they are just cutting ties with SnyderVerse, or they are intentionally pissing fans off so that they can swoop back in later and be the good guys again for green lighting it as they did for ZS cut JL.

My personal take is that they are desperately trying to emulate the comedy infused cookie cutter formula success of the MCU.

The problem with that is that the new TV shows on Disney+ show that they are already moving towards darker storylines.

I think DC are going to get caught with their pants down with no irons in the fire and Disney firing on all cylinders.

Yet again.
