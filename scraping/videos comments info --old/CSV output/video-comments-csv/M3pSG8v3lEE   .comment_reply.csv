65,UgzbhZVHgoof4or26Gp4AaABAg,Caren Clarke,"I usually don't follow celebrity breakups, I have more important things waiting to be delt with. This case hit a visceral nerve and Depp is my husband's favorite actor. I can't diagnose, although;.after hearing some of AH tapes all over social media, her interviews, fake make-up for bruises confirmed and/or alleged by people who worked with her during the height of her alleged abuse. In addition defacating on their bed? If this is true it appears she is mentally ill. We need to remove the stigma of mental illness, although; irrelevant if AH may or may not have mental illness, seen as a beautiful woman, famous, (I have not seen much of her work to know if she is talented,) does not give AH a special pass. She does not get special privileges either. I pick up that she thinks the world owes her showing diva like behavior. She comes across as an arrogant absorbed young lady. I read the people who have worked with her say she is a pathological liar.¬†

Perhaps Depp was not a complete angel himself, but past behavior is the best indication of future behavior. I have read in reputable magazines, newspapers, online that his ex wives, ex girlfriends, long partners deny abuse by JD and some have conveyed that he was a generous partner.¬† His children claim they were never abused by Depp and and call him a great father. His mother of his children in a 14 -16? long term relationship with Vanessa (sp?) ended by JD falling in love with another woman, with AH. I have reason to believe that there were or could have been more hurt feelings from his long term relationship with Venessa, however; she also made it abundantly clear that Depp was never abusive to her and treated her well.¬†

AH appears to have little regard for others and threw JD ""under the bus."" any chance she got.¬† What gets me is that AH is making it harder for authentic domestic abuse to be taken more seriously and relevant. Does she care about this? Probably not because it's all about ""her."" AH cares about AH period. I hope she gets the right kind of help and I really don't know what happened for sure. Of course, I don't know either of them but hearing both sides from the tapes, again is very telling.¬†

What i mean to say is that Nick had it coming and that Amy wasnt as much of a psycho if you analyze the film on a deeper level.

96,UgxNG3i5iTpue7itx-F4AaABAg,Unplugged 05030922,Amber Heard doesn't know what feminism is. Don't project her malicious behavior into the rest of us. There's so many women out there speaking against her abuse of Johnny and the courts. It was a woman who started the petition to have her removed from Aquaman and it now has over a million signatures. So I'm not sure who broke your heart but don't just make a statement about all women when so many of us have avidly followed this case and find her actions just as upsetting as you do. She abused a movement that had given us a voice. Don't think we're complicit and shrug it off as if all women act this way so 'oh well.' I hope you reconsider your outlook rather than limit yourself to such a small view of the world.,2021-07-24T07:24:34Z,1

However, they broke up, she couldn‚Äôt leverage the financial benefits from Elon. The eggs were frozen, and Amber wanted to file a lawsuit for her to get the rights of the eggs. I think she finally got it after blackmailing Elon but Elon is a smart man and she agreed to his terms, because of how desperate she has become.

That doesn't mean that I don't understand children. Children often say the most embarrassing things but does that make it okay?",2021-11-09T17:26:23Z,0
184,Ugz8uk2oJIMv8y2Adbx4AaABAg,Luminatrix FanFiction,"@Melody ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ The fact you're even asking that question means you don't understand children or never had a child before.

Children don't know any better. They are wonderful bundles of joy but they can be naive and cruel at times without understanding right from wrong. You can be sure there will at least be one bully bullying another kid over their strange sounding names because that bully doesn't know any better.",2021-11-08T03:17:17Z,0

There's also the fact that, the kid could be in danger. Her foster mother whom you know is notorious for abusing girlfriends and spouses. I'm honestly worried for the poor child.",2021-11-07T18:25:04Z,0

187,Ugy-u_p_DLMukes276x4AaABAg,Jesus is God,"To whom shall I speak, and give warning, that they may hear? He that has ears to hear, let him hear.

Are you saved? Where will you go when you die? Heaven or hell? 

The Gospel, which means the Good News is the news that God Almighty, the Creator came in the flesh as Jesus Christ to take away the sin of the world. The one God is a trinity of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. The Son came and laid down his own life to save ours.  His sacrifice on the cross paid the price for our redemption with his own blood. On the third day he rose from dead and offers the gift of salvation and forgiveness to those that repent and trust in him. Although God's creation was created perfect, having no death, sickness and disease, the creation became corrupted through Adam and Eve in them disobeying God. In this rebellion the creation became fallen through the curse of sin and mankind became separated from God. This world is fallen, but God offers reconciliation to him through his provision at the cross. Ultimately God will restore his creation to perfection when he returns but those that who reject his offer of redemption will remain condemned by their sins and go to hell.
