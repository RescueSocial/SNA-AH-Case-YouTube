1,UgwbkCkOV2dA5JTuvIR4AaABAg,cliffbreezy20,@Miss Lana P Ford majority of the time the courts get it wrong because of a bias. Whenever there is a battle going on between a man and a woman 9/10 times the man gets the short end of the stick and the woman walks. The womans word over a mans word always hold more weight in a courtroom she gets believed and the man does not and he has to deal with the consequences.....this happens alot and not just in hollywood this is one of the reasons why no one trusts the system. There is hard evidence out there showing that she is not as innocent as she seems to make herself out to be that she actually has been lying and that shes done some crazy things to johnny but......the system....,2020-09-27T07:28:18Z,0

And looking at her filmography on Wikipedia, she was never in a Disney movie! The only thing connecting Heard to Disney is one episode of Criminal Minds in 2006. The hypocrisy argument only works if it's the same people firing Depp and keeping Heard and I'm pretty sure the two studios would be run by different people. But if WB fires Johnny Depp from Grindelwald but keeps Ezra Miller, that's legitimately unfair and you can't really use the sexism excuse with Ezra.",2020-09-21T21:53:52Z,0

What Disney does with Pirates doesn't matter to WB because Disney is just the competition. And termination from Fantastic Beasts 3 is still not confirmed yet and it looks like the studio is divided on whether or not to keep Depp as Grindelwald.
