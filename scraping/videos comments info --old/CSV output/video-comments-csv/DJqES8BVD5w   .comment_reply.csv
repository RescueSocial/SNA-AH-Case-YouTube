13,UgyU-NT906BLBaqXp3N4AaABAg,emily cheetham,"@Jay Dubs as to the pain killers myself and my mother were put on heavy duty pain killers after our car accident. But it was still agony. Pain killers decrease the pain but for something like a broken rib or internal bleeding they do not remove the pain. No way could she be doing the things she was in the beach pictures if she had a broken rib. It disgusts me that she can even get people to believe her lies. Especially since she has been charged with DV in the past, illegally brought her dogs into Australia, committed purgery. She is a lying good for nothing narcissist.",2021-04-11T11:30:46Z,4
14,UgyU-NT906BLBaqXp3N4AaABAg,Jay Dubs,"Emily Cheetham unless she was on major amounts of ""painkillers"", which she is no stranger to. You think? You are correct on not being able to breathe. I have fought in boxing, and martial arts, and have broken my opponents ribs...and an immediate sign is that they start to breathe from their mouth...very labored. She's a narcissistic liar!!",2021-04-11T11:20:19Z,0
