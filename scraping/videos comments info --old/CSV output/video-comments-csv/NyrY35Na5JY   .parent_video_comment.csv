32,UgwKffzp_ejMo6ZXdxt4AaABAg,"Disney makes a lot money out of Americam audiences- I am also sure that Disney wasn't happy with Depp's salary +. This was a chance to not have to pay his salary.
Disney is making a huge mistake. The character was created by Johnny Depp. The first Pirates of the Caribbean without that character would have just been another pirate movie.
We are dealing with 'woke' cancel culture and l can only wish these studios playing this game will realize  their fortunes depend on a public that won't be bullied in subtle ways.
To find someone guilty without looking into the situation is not professional. Warner has the same exact problems. They took out Johnny but had to pay him anyway, and 2nd film has not done that well. Johnny Debb is a draw and l believe a bigger one since all this happened. 
Now MGM is not releasing a  film that will probably be nominated for a foreign film Oscar nomination. Again this is just about cancel culture and ridiculous. MGM is making a big mistake. These days audiences want what they want and don't like to be messed with and definitely not be ignored. Over one million signatures against Amber means over at least a million people will not view the film.. 
That's a lot if money/views.. Just as many won't see Caribbean. And that is how reverse cancel culture works.",Linda Douglass,0,2021-08-19T04:43:49Z

Who would watch Pirate without Depp. He was the reason why we went to the theater in the first place. Not to mention the franchise got significantly worst after the 3rd movie because of the shitty story-line. Without Depp there will be no reason to watch the movie let alone going to the theater for it. The same goes for any possible reboot they might have in mind with different main character or time line.
