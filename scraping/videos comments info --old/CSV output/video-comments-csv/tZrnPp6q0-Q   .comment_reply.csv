Women made men out of their bodies, we are built and happy to love men. The problem, mostly and sadly in America, is that every decent movement that was meant to change something, is been hijacked lately...like the body positivity one, who push people to become sick for the sake of their 'feelings'...as feelings would be more important than life itself, their life in primis. People nowadays just want to be cuddled, be respected no matter what and feel strong and safe....without BE strong, provide for their safety, give and earn respect, put efforts in building a more mature and caring society for all of us.",2020-04-02T10:35:18Z,4

20,UgyIu8_Y5lWLrmm-iTl4AaABAg,Anna,"@cavalcojj I do believe in the power, and responsibility, of good examples. None said she should end up on the streets, but she, with her job, with the message she could convey, must not be left alone when those kind of, not only, accusations come out. With Depp they did the only thing the should've, at that moment, they fired him immediately when she accused him of domestic abuse. It wasn't a punishment, it was a signal for the rest of us people. They were wrong and maybe they should've handle it with more class and cautiousness but, eve if I didn't believe it possible for him to be an abuser, from the beginning, I think he losing his role of Captain Jack was the right move in that moment, with what we knew back then. When a person have a job or a position extremely delicate (like a doctor, a teacher, or a public figure with a lot of resonance) better safe than sorry. The thing I cannot stand is that he received an harsh but right treatment, she isn't going through the same path, people are in denial even now that proves have reached the public. In Italy we have a saying that explain my point about how we judge and how we expect others to be worth of a good judgement, it's about the Emperor Julius Caesar's wife, we say: ""...To be like Caesar's wife"" (You/they/someone have to be like Caesar's wife) And it have this meaning: Caesar's wife not only should be above all suspicions, but also she should APPEAR above all suspicions. Because her role (as an example) was so important for the name and the honor and credibility of the Empire that she shouldn't put herself in any potentially dangerous or promiscuous or debatable situation, ever. So it's my opinion that when someone is in a certain position, even the slightest suspect should be treated harder, with more cautiousness, faster, because it can have larger consequences (like emulators). A shop assistant can keep his job if he's suspected to have punched his wife, court will provide private justice for them, but a prime minister, an actor, a doctor etc, are different figures, that's why I used the ch*ld molestation example, to compare the gravity of the two and yes domestic abuse it's a very serious matter, just here in Italy, every 2-3 days a woman is killed by her partner or her ex....even now that we're quarantined, it's unbelievable, and still the society is helpless because women don't talk about it (it's not just a social behavior, it's instinctive to not let other knows that you are someone's victim, because predators always attack wounded animals) and also, men do not believe so many of them are abusive. Nowadays the problem, but thank good is in the open!, is that females are doing exactly what some men always have had the chance of doing (add they're bigger and stronger than us, so they're more lethal) and that's why it is SO important to talk about males victims and how it works, it's not a gender thing, it's a target thing, and that rightful indignation men are experiencing now, is the right step to recognize that anyone who is allowed to be abusive, anyone who can have easy victims, is going to act like that sooner or later and becoming very dangerous. For years men told women we were exaggerating...we weren't, and now we have a horde of crazy females who learned this sh*t from some abusive men and are turning tables, making more victims...so it's important that females are fighting for men and men star fighting for women, we all should be against abuser, even the suspected ones...with proper but clear step in cutting them out of society.",2020-04-02T21:12:16Z,1
21,UgyIu8_Y5lWLrmm-iTl4AaABAg,cavalcojj,"@Anna So I understand where you are coming from. And you are correct in that what you permit you promote but in any other profession they wouldn't lose their livelihood. Throwing someone on to the street because they might be abusive is a bit extreme. I'm not condoning what she said, or probably did, does she need counseling help, more than likely. Now if there is a child molester, that is a completely different story, so please don't conflate the two.",2020-04-02T17:11:58Z,0

28,Ugzyq-wUawVGIGxaVn94AaABAg,Resvrgam,"savitarsavior Flashfan Xd People stop playing games when they know said games are stacked against them - that‚Äôs their choice to do so.

Also; it‚Äôs generalized because you have to look at the bigger picture. Most marriages now end in divorce. Most men are financially destroyed in divorces. Most men don‚Äôt get custody of their children. These are general rules now. Exceptions exist but they‚Äôre not the general rule.

Fight back? You mean like the oft demonized Men‚Äôs Rights Activists? Yeah; how‚Äôs that working out for men? Many see opting out as fighting back - by starving the system.

Either way, it‚Äôs not your or my place to tell men what they should or shouldn‚Äôt do - just to inform them enough to allow them to make their own choices.",2020-04-05T19:47:00Z,1

30,Ugzyq-wUawVGIGxaVn94AaABAg,Resvrgam,"savitarsavior Flashfan Xd Dude, this is a ‚Äúgeneralized‚Äù situation. The stats back this up.

As I have stated multiple times; warning of the dangers (of which exclusively fall on men) isn‚Äôt forcing men not to make that decision - it‚Äôs hoping they prepare themselves for a horrible system that is dangerously stacked against.

You clearly feel passionate about your decisions (as evidenced by the lengthy replies) but no one is attacking them. It‚Äôs all about knowing the increasing dangers of that decision. 

It‚Äôs like having sex in a post-HIV world. Warning people about the deadly consequences of sex and informing them of protective measures isn‚Äôt the same as demanding abstinence. The choice to put yourself in that danger lies solely with you.",2020-04-05T19:18:36Z,0

And my reasoning isn't absurd, it's reasonable I'm saying if a man wants to marry he should, if he doesn't want to marry he shouldn't. I'm not a idiot & I'm not ignorant I know about a lot of things That happened to some men over nothing, false Allegations a boy killing himself when he was Accused of rape. And all the creepy Situations with female Teachers that r pedo's. And men shouldn't be discouraged from Wanting a relationship, it's not a gender Armageddon outside its just stupid people Complaining about Bs (Feminists). And I do know they R using Things in their favor, but the thing is People seem to generalize people like what people Did with star wars fans calling them Sexist racist White men. And people do the same to women saying they are All like Amber heard that's not right & it's not fair, and it's not right For men to Get their Lives ruined for no reason it's disgusting, and Feminists propably Use that to Get more men to be against women, and more women against Men .
