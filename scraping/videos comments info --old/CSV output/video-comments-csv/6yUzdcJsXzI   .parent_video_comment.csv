194,UgyZoCTgQJZx8-V87a94AaABAg,"Like as a BTS fan and a BLACKPINK fan, I think the groups' fandoms should both be spreading positive messages about both. Some fans get carried away and tend to spend more time criticizing the other group rather than paying attention to their own. Even if it was a joke, Kpop has much tension between fandoms and I honestly think it would be best for us to always spread positivity. Even a joke like boycott BLACKPINK could lead to haters jumping on that train and spreading hate.",Yummy Friend,5,2021-07-31T20:28:40Z

201,UgwueFjerHQkkMkkBp14AaABAg,"It‚Äôs not about her not getting her money‚Äôs worth out of black widow, she‚Äôs extremely rich. It‚Äôs about the fact that Disney is rolling over her to increase their own profit, and she‚Äôs highly established in Hollywood. So imagine all the other people that might have this or something similar happen to them that don‚Äôt have her privilege! I support her just because honestly Disney is so powerful I think it‚Äôs good that she‚Äôs fighting back even in a small way. I hope something good comes out of this. (Also I think it‚Äôs so gross that they used the pandemic as a reason to discredit her when you don‚Äôt have to be a rocket scientist to see that they did it for their own profit?? Hugely disrespectful and a hilariously bad call from a company that I assume has a good publicity management team).",cora rose,104,2021-07-31T20:17:26Z
