O_O ...
Are you fucking kidding me?!?? :D :D :D :D Like for real? The problem with feminism is ... THE NAME?! It is not that men are treated like third class citizens by society by the justice system and by everyone around them? It is THE NAME that you see is the problem? You think that changing the name to something else will somehow address the issue?! How clueless are you exactly about life in general? 

The issue isn't with the name the issue is with human nature for example men have outgroup bias while women have ingroup bias which is effecting the majority of how people act and react to their environment (look it up). Without 'reprogramming' and re-educating men and women on massive scale the problem will never be solved but that isn't the biggest problem the biggest problem is how fucking ignorant people are! You all have internet and access to an endless amount of information but instead of actually using it to your and society's benefit you prefer to waste the huge majority of your life watching reality shows.

And don't even get me started about Afrika I mean as far as I am concerned the majority of the continent is populated by low IQ barberians who simply don't deserve to be helped or pull out of the fucking hole you dug yourself in! Fucking hell one of the most ancient civilizations were in Afrika yet somehow thousands years later some of you still choose WILLINGLY to act like fucking animals by raping killing and fucking ENSLAVING their own kind! Not only that but your whole mentality is fucked up ''then oppressive men in LEDCs would point and say 'see, the job's been done! It's about everyone' and our problems would never get addressed here.'' IT ISN'T SOMEONE ELSES JOB TO FUCKING SOLVE YOUR PROBLEMS FOR YOU! Unless you are willing to get your hands dirty get on with the program and clean yourselves up you will NEVER be able to live like the 'developed' world because deep down inside you are fucking animals! It is obviously ok for you to rape kill and enslave each other because if it fucking WASN'T!!! you wouldn't be doing it!

The funny thing about all of this is that the majority of the 'developed' countries follow the same retarded mentality ''Ohh the americans/russians/germans will come and save us!'' yeah because other countries care soooooo much about your fucking ass! Or I don't know you could use the 2 fucking brain cells you have left in your head and realize that the only reason why anyone would help you is to come and steal your resources or whatever other shit you have to offer in order to help themselves. If you can't fucking help yourself no one else will! The idea that someone will come and save you for free is a fantasy.",2020-11-14T22:25:37Z,1

""It is 100% proof that the judge was biased, corrupt, unfit to be in a court, and so on.""

Translation: he didn't come to a verdict I agreed with, therefore wrong.

""He was determined from top to bottom to conclude that whatever she says is true""

Well except for those 2 incidents that he said weren't proven.

""whatever he says is false""

Because Depp took alcohol/cocaine and then couldn't remember what happened.

""whatever his witnesses (lots of them) say is false""

Because it contradicted the evidence.

""whatever her witnesses (yeah, one ""neutral"" indeed, the make-up artist) say is true.""

Because they had no reason to lie.

""I will state a few things as undeniably true, because I say so.""

Retard spotted. Next time try using evidence to support your claims.

""based on the reading of the whole story, Amber Heard targeted Johnny Depp.""

Well it's clear that you didn't read the judge's judgment and are instead just going to make things up.

""manipulated him to be mostly drunk and drugged for a long time.""

Depp's addictions were his own fault.

""When Depp tried to go through a treatment to get clean, she deliberately hid his medication and emotionally abused him to get him back into addiction.""

Source needed.

""While AH was building a case by sending herself emails with fictional happenings""

Those texts were sent to other people.

""Which is what caused the March 8, Australia incident.""

I noticed you only quoted what Depp said to hide that the judge didn't believe this claim.
 
""Lots of photos from that period, all over the media, no swollen nose, no cuts, but then we know she's Miss Miraculous.""

Due to Amber using make-up to hide them. 

""Incident 12: During this incident, the Claimant also wrote a message on the kitchen""

You forgot this part:
""a.17 The Claimant repeatedly hit Ms Heard, knocking her to the floor""

""Incident 13: Birthday celebration Los Angeles 21st April 2016 
The Claimant was not drunk or high on drugs""

The court documents literally say the opposite:

"" ‚Äò8.b   On 21 April 2016 Ms Heard had a birthday celebration with friends at the  couple‚Äôs  property  at  849  South  Broadway,  Los  Angeles  (‚Äúthe  South Broadway apartment‚Äù). The Claimant arrived, drunk and high on drugs.""

""Two police officers who attended the apartment directly after the alleged incident""

You forgot this part:
""While it is not for me to criticise the methods of another police force, the absence of contemporaneous notes means that their evidence does not carry the same weight as it would otherwise.  Their  first  account  appears  to  have  been  when  they  gave  their depositions some two months later.""

""165. When Ms Heard was cross-examined on this topic, she said that her feelings towards Mr Depp were confused.""

You forgot this part:
""She certainly would not be the first woman to have equivocal attitudes towards her partner, even if he had been abusing her.""

""That's really funny""

the only funny part is how you keep selectively quoting this judgment. Especially since you only mention the summary in the first part and not the more detailed 2nd part.

""And now Amber Heard's own statements about the monster that she really is""

Ah yes those recording that the judge dismissed for the following reasons:
""None of those features applied to these conversations which, in any event, according to Ms Heard had a purpose or purposes different from simply conveying truthful information.""

102,UgwCBjY5OugtW58Y9KR4AaABAg,AryaFi,"@uanime1 1. Nothing was proven in the court. NOTHING! 

And because you called me ignorant, I will prove who's actually ignorant. I promised you dictionary definitions if you continue to misinterpret the English language (which you are doing on purpose, I am not accusing you of ignorance, I am accusing you of telling lies and ignoring facts on purpose)

proof   https://dictionary.law.com/Default.aspx?selected=1642
n. confirmation of a fact by evidence. In a trial, proof is what the trier of the fact (jury or judge without a jury) needs to become satisfied that there is ""a preponderance of the evidence"" in civil (non-criminal) cases and the defendant is guilty ""beyond a reasonable doubt"" in criminal prosecutions. However, each alleged fact must be proved separately, as must all the facts necessary to reach a judgment for the plaintiff (the person filing a lawsuit) or for the prosecution (the ""people"" or ""state"" represented by the prosecutor). The defendants in both civil suits and criminal trials need not provide absolute ""proof"" of non-responsibility in a civil case or innocence (in a criminal case), since the burden is on the plaintiff or prosecution to prove their cases (or prove the person guilty).
Evidence     https://dictionary.law.com/Default.aspx?selected=671

n. every type of proof legally presented at trial (allowed by the judge) which is intended to convince the judge and/or jury of alleged facts material to the case. It can include oral testimony of witnesses, including experts on technical matters, documents, public records, objects, photographs and depositions (testimony under oath taken before trial). It also includes so-called ""circumstantial evidence"" which is intended to create belief by showing surrounding circumstances which logically lead to a conclusion of fact. Comments and arguments by the attorneys, statements by the judge and answers to questions which the judge has ruled objectionable are not evidence. Charts, maps and models which are used to demonstrate or explain matters are not evidence themselves, but testimony based upon such items and marks on such material may be evidence. Evidence must survive objections of opposing attorneys that it is irrelevant, immaterial or violates rules against ""hearsay"" (statements by a party not in court), and/or other technicalities.

2. The court doesn‚Äôt need to prove anything, the defendant needs to prove. The defendant was the newspaper. And again, nothing was proven. NOTHING!

3. The testimony of someone (other than the medical experts) is not medical evidence. It has nothing to do with what I like or not, it has to do with the English language that you hate so much. 
https://www.wcat.bc.ca/appeals/preparing/medical_evidence.html
Medical evidence is a form of expert evidence. Medical evidence can take many forms. It can include a doctor's clinical notes or records, and the forms a doctor completes and sends to WorkSafeBC on a regular basis. Medical evidence may also include first aid records, emergency room and hospital records, diagnostic testing results, CT/MRI/x-ray reports, and permanent functional impairment evaluations.

4. You didn‚Äôt understand what I said. That English language is to blame. I said ""No, the photos of real people who went through real abuse of the sort she claimed, don't look like Amber Heard."" I never said that many people who suffer abuse don‚Äôt try to cover it up. They do, that‚Äôs a truth (unfortunately). But it wasn‚Äôt about covering up, it was about going public with fake photos, which she did. 

5. The Sun said that Amber said she had a broken nose. And the court said that the Sun speaks the truth. So, how is it? Do they lie or they don‚Äôt? Here‚Äôs the article:
https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/uknews/12192735/amber-heard-injuries-johnny-depp-headbutt-attack/

6. ""One must be really poor on the inside to do things like that.""
Like telling such lies. By now I am already used to the fact that you don‚Äôt understand English, but I am determined to be kind and help you with it. 

7. ""And yet, she never called the police for the so-called 14 attacks.""
That‚Äôs you agreeing with me again. Except for one time when she did, and the police couldn‚Äôt find any evidence that she has been abused in any way, so they went back to where they came from not understanding why they have been bothered without reason. 
Incident 14: Los Angeles 21st May 2016
Two police officers who attended the
apartment directly after the alleged incident and interviewed Ms

103,UgwCBjY5OugtW58Y9KR4AaABAg,AryaFi,"@uanime1 
Wow, Thank you for the link with the actual file. It is 100% proof that the judge was biased, corrupt, unfit to be in a court, and so on. I literally couldn't believe my eyes what I read in there. He was determined from top to bottom to conclude that whatever she says is true, whatever he says is false, whatever his witnesses (lots of them) say is false, whatever her witnesses (yeah, one ""neutral"" indeed, the make-up artist) say is true.

So, based on the pattern of thinking in that court, I will state a few things as undeniably true, because I say so. I would have been cautious or even avoiding such statements, but that was before I read this file. After I read it, I can simply say I am right because I am a woman! (yeah, I know that it's wrong,  but if the court says it's fine, then why not not do it with uanime1?) As such, the truth is that, based on the reading of the whole story, Amber Heard targeted Johnny Depp. She knew he had a troubled childhood and some trauma, she knew he had a history with alcohol and drugs, and manipulated him to be mostly drunk and drugged for a long time. Purpose? Obviously money. When Depp tried to go through a treatment to get clean, she deliberately hid his medication and emotionally abused him to get him back into addiction. No human being abuses verbally (and/or physically) someone who is going through a withdrawal unless they don't actually want the person to go through withdrawal, meaning that they have something to gain out of the other person not being sober. While AH was building a case by sending herself emails with fictional happenings, at some point, apparently he realized something is wrong with her (other than the abuse that she was doing regularly). And he wanted a post nuptial agreement (I really don't think people want something like that unless they feel like they need to protect themselves from fraud). Which is what caused the March 8, Australia incident. 
And now from the file:
2.2H.1 Immediately before 8 March 2015, Ms Heard had a conversation with
the Claimant‚Äôs then lawyers, Bloom Hergott who explained the Claimant‚Äôs
intention to enter into a post-nuptial agreement. 
Then AH says: Incident 8: March 2015 Australia :  three-day ordeal of physical assault which
left her with injuries including a broken lip, swollen nose, and cuts all over her
body
Lots of photos from that period, all over the media, no swollen nose, no cuts, but then we know she's Miss Miraculous. 

Incident 12: During this incident, the Claimant also wrote a message on the kitchen
countertop in gold pen that said, ‚ÄúWhy be a fraud? All is such bullshit‚Äù.‚Äô

Incident 13: Birthday celebration Los Angeles 21st April 2016 
The Claimant was not drunk or high on drugs; he was shocked from what he
had learnt at the meeting about his business affairs. Mr Bett took a photograph of the injury to the Claimant‚Äôs face.

Incident 14: Los Angeles 21st May 2016 
After a short period upstairs, The
Claimant came back down the stairs then grabbed the phone again and this time
threw it at Ms Heard, striking her cheek and eye. Ms Heard sustained an injury to
her right eye. pulled Ms Heard‚Äôs hair, struck Ms Heard
and violently grabbed her face. The Claimant started to slap, shake and yank Ms
Heard around the room while she continued to scream. 
Two police officers who attended the
apartment directly after the alleged incident and interviewed Ms
Heard twice in good light, saw no injuries or bruising or swelling to
Ms Heard‚Äôs face (or elsewhere). When one of the officers asked Ms
Heard what had happened she responded ‚Äúnothing‚Äù. Both of these officers subsequently confirmed their evidence to this
effect in separate depositions, which are attached to this Reply at
Annex A.

 the Restraining Order which Ms Heard obtained on 27th May 2016 was
temporary. Originally it was due to continue until 17th June 2016, but it was extended
by agreement until 16th August 2016. It therefore remained in force in July 2016.
163. Ms Heard nonetheless contacted Mr Depp and proposed that they meet in San
Francisco. Mr Depp agreed to the meeting which he said took place in a hotel in that
city with just the two of them. Ms Heard recorded the conversation which they then
had. Mr Depp said he was unaware of the recording.
164. Mr Depp said that during the meeting, Ms Heard at one stage asked him to embrace
her. He refused. He said that she had accused him of assaulting her and of being a
horrible monster. He could not understand why she would then want him to hug her.
The discussion continued for some time. Mr Depp said that Ms Heard complained of
feeling unwell. Mr Depp suggested that she take a nap in the bedroom. She got into bed
and asked if he was going to join her. Mr Depp declined. He said that at no time during
this meeting did Ms Heard seem scared.
165. When Ms Heard was cross-examined on this topic, she said that her feelings towards
Mr Depp were confused. She loved the side of him that was charming. She was terrified
of the other side of him; what she called ‚Äòthe Monster‚Äô. It was put to her that, if there
was even one aspect of the Claimant which terrified her, she would not have met him.
Ms Heard denied that was so. 
 That's really funny: she was trying to use her ""natural charms"" to bed him and drag him back into the relationship. I laughed a lot, I must say (though i's not funny really, the woman is really dangerous). 

And now Amber Heard's own statements about the monster that she really is (seeing that she likes that word):

‚ÄòJD: It‚Äôs not true. It‚Äôs not true. I‚Äôm not the one who fucking throws fucking pots
and whatever the fucking else at me.
AH: That‚Äôs different. That‚Äôs different. That‚Äôs one ... does not negate the other.
That‚Äôs irrelevant. It‚Äôs a complete non sequitur. Just because I‚Äôve thrown pots and
pans does not mean you can come and knock on the door.
JD: Vases and fucking ...
AH: Just because there are vases does not mean you come and knock on the door.
JD: Relationships should let you throw ...
AH: I‚Äôm not saying that. You‚Äôre saying that. You‚Äôre putting words in my mouth
and then making non sequiturs.
...
JD: You punched me
AH: ... hit you across the face in a proper slap, but I was hitting you, it was not
punching you. Babe, you‚Äôre not punched.
JD: Don‚Äôt tell me what it feels like to be punched.
AH; I know you‚Äôve been in a lot of fights, you‚Äôve been around a long time. I know,
yeah.
JD: No, when you fucking have a closed fist ‚Äì
AH: You didn‚Äôt get punch. You got hit. I‚Äôm sorry I hit you like this. But I did not
punch you. I did not fucking deck you. I fucking was hitting you. I don‚Äôt know
what the motion of my actual hand was, but you‚Äôre fine. I did not hurt you. I did
not punch you. I was hitting you.
...
AH: You‚Äôre a fucking baby.
JD: Because you start physical fights?
AH: You‚Äôre such a baby. Grow the fuck up. 

‚ÄòJD: I don‚Äôt want a divorce, I never wanted a fuckin‚Äô divorce. I didn‚Äôt want you to
fuckin‚Äô go to Coachella [presumably a reference to the fact that Ms Heard and a
group of friends went to the Coachella music festival after incident 13] without
fuckin‚Äô talking to me because I left you because you were fuckin‚Äô ... you fuckin‚Äô
hay-makered me, man. You came around the bed to fuckin‚Äô start punching on me.
AH: I‚Äôm so sad. I love you so much.‚Äô

JD: Because you start physical fights?
AH: I did start a physical fight.
...
AH: But I do ... and I can‚Äôt promise you that I‚Äôll be perfect, I can‚Äôt promise you that
I won‚Äôt get physical again. God, I fucking sometimes get so mad I lose it. I can
fucking promise you I‚Äôm ... I‚Äôll do everything to change...‚Äô 

In his closing submissions, Mr Sherborne referred to a text from Mr Depp to Malcolm
Connolly on 5th April 2016 which said (file 10/147(a)/O17),
‚ÄòPlease get her out of this room NOW!!! She‚Äôs struck me about 10 times ... Can‚Äôt
take any more!!! ...
 Mr Connolly replied several hours later,
‚ÄòAmber gone through, no problems! Are you ok? Do you need anything mate?

""No, the court siding with her based on what she said does not count as proof of anything.""

It means it's literally be proved in a court of law.

""When you have accusations, you need to prove them.""

And 12 of the domestic abuse incidents were proven to have happened by the court.

""The testimony of someone is not a medical evidence.""

Just because you don't like this testimony doesn't make it wrong.

""No, the photos of real people who went through real abuse of the sort she claimed, don't look like Amber Heard.""

Now you're just being ignorant. Many people who suffer abuse try to cover it up.

""Thank you for agreeing that she lied when she said she had her nose broken.""

When did she ever say that?

""And if she did lie about having a nose broken, what else did she lie about?""

Now you're being deluded again. Amber isn't a doctor so she can't judge whether her nose is broken or not. 

""Unlike Amber Heard, I actually had my nose broken.""

This means that if her nose was injured but not broken it won't look like this. Which doesn't change the fact that her nose was injured because Depp head-butted her.

""One must be really poor on the inside to do things like that.""

Be beaten by Depp 14 times?
  
""Thank you for agreeing with me again.""

Because you supported my claims.

""And yet, she never called the police for the so-called 14 attacks.""

Well except for the time that she did call them.
 
""Witnesses? What witnesses?""

You know all the people who went to court and provided evidence that Depp had attacked Amber.

""Would you be nice to return the favor and copy paste some information that i might have missed?""

Here you go:
https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/QB/2020/2911.pdf

""And please, don't say the witnesses are her sister, because it's not how it works like.""

A sister can be a witness.

""Or her best friend's ex husband, who claimed to be neutral witness.""

They kind of are.

""If she had had those injuries, the witnesses should have been a lot of people from their entourage.""

Amber said that she wore make-up to hide those injuries.

""Not to mention the medical staff.""

Only if they were so bad they needed medical treatment. Also Depp has his own private doctor who gave evidence at this trial.

""The reason why many people are really pissed off is because we live in a world of abuse that Amber Heard is mocking right now with all this rich bimbo bullshit.""

That's a funny way to say being assaulted by Depp 14 times.

""There are hundreds of thousands of victims of real abuse who are actually trapped with their abusers.""

Like Amber was.

""Each and any one of them would love to have even a quarter (well, a quarter is too much, they really could do with much, much less) of Amber Heard's money to be able to get away from the nightmare they are living in.""

Amber had the full amount and it took her years to get away from Depp. What motivated her seemed to be that the level of violence was increasing.

""Many live in countries where a man is supposed to beat his wife because...that's why he's a man.""

Because he's legally responsible for everything she does.

""I wonder sometimes what on earth was she thinking of when she started all this show?""

Exposing Depp for being a wife-beater and encouraging abused women to leave their abusers.

""she has the nerve to say we're bots, we're paid... and other nonsense.""

I suspect some are. Though the rest are deluded idiots who don't want to accept Depp was a wife-beater.

""Being a compulsive liar is not the winning method all the time.""

Good thing she had other witnesses to back up her claims. Almost like she was telling the truth.

""but she can never fool us""

Depp did.

""It's about truth, human rights, justice...""

105,UgwCBjY5OugtW58Y9KR4AaABAg,AryaFi,"‚Äã@uanime1 No, the court siding with her based on what she said does not count as proof of anything. I can claim that I am the Queen of England, that doesn't mean that a royal escort will come to take me to my new home in Buckingham Palace.  I can claim that the Pope is  the father of my son. That doesn't make it true. When you have accusations, you need to prove them. Yes, sorry to bring it up to you, but Santa Clause doesn't exist, the Easter Rabbit is an invention, and human beings tend to lie... a lot. 
The testimony of someone is not a medical evidence. Next time when you say some nonsense like the one you've just said, I will have to copy paste basic definitions of words from the dictionary, because obviously you've skipped school... a lot. 
No, the photos of real people who went through real abuse of the sort she claimed, don't look like Amber Heard. It would be nice if they did, but they don't ... sadly.
Thank you for agreeing that she lied when she said she had her nose broken. When her lies are accepted as such even by her supporters... well, that says a lot. She did claim Johnny Depp broke her nose, just google it and you will see.  And if she did lie about having a nose broken, what else did she lie about? How about everything? 
The only injury that was shown on photos in court was some dark makeup applied on the so-called broken nose. How do I know it's makeup? Very simple answer. Unlike Amber Heard, I actually had my nose broken. It gets swollen (a lot), it changes shape, and the color is a bit different. Especially after a few days.

I don't waste my time with feelings of hate. I despise Amber Heard for what she is doing, and I feel pity for her as even though she has money, she is poorer than the poorest human on earth.  One must be really poor on the inside to do things like that.  
Exactly. One time when she did call the police. When the relationship was at an end. Thank you for agreeing with me again. They've been together for a few years, and married for one. And yet, she never called the police for the so-called 14 attacks. 
Witnesses? What witnesses? Would you be nice to return the favor and copy paste some information that i might have missed? And please, don't say the witnesses are her sister, because it's not how it works like.  Or her best friend's ex husband, who claimed to be neutral witness. I feel like you've missed the point of what I was saying earlier. Amber Heard had a very rich social life. If she had had those injuries, the witnesses should have been a lot of people from their entourage. A lot. Not to mention the medical staff. Yeah, sorry, I won't give up on that part at all. 
I  feel like I need to add something here. The reason why many people are really pissed off is because we live in a world of abuse that Amber Heard is mocking right now with all this rich bimbo bullshit. There are hundreds of thousands of victims of real abuse who are actually trapped with their abusers. Each and any one of them would love to have even a quarter (well, a quarter is too much, they really could do with much, much less) of Amber Heard's money to be able to get away from the nightmare they are living in. None of them would stay to be abused 14 times if they had the option to leave. Many have children that they need to protect (which are also abused) and behave like punching bags only to save the children once in a while. Each and every one of them would love to have the financial independence needed for them to be able to run away and pay a lawyer. And yet, most of them don't afford the luxury, and live to be victims their entire lives. Many live in countries where a man is supposed to beat his wife because...that's why he's a man. The society itself would condemn them for leaving their husbands, they would be outcasts forever, even their families would be ashamed of them.  
I wonder sometimes what on earth was she thinking of when she started all this show? Can someone be so blind in their bubble as to believe life is a film set, just apply a bit of makeup and everything becomes possible? 
And she still doesn't want to wake up from her deep slumber, she has the nerve to say we're bots, we're paid... and other nonsense. Being a compulsive liar is not the winning method all the time. She might have fooled Johnny (it's not that hard to fool a man who is in love with you), but she can never fool us, because not only that we are not in love with her, but we don't care about her at all.

But do you really think they wouldn't have some director's cut for Justice League somewhere down the road, even when it was terribly underwhelming,  But thinking that fan backlash had anything to do with it is preposterous or as they say, correlation is not causation. WB told the public what it had to hear to whip us into frenzy so we'd think we had a victory and they get profit in return,  the actors are just set dressing to really milk it for good measure. There are two billion dollar examples in 2019 to support that trend. And we as the viewing public keep falling for it.

It's a cash grab, like any other extended cut. We shouldn't feel vindicated because that grab is in exchange for something we think we want.

""Why the judge ANDREW NICOL dismiss all the assessments, emails, recorders, texts, law statements and other testimonials""

They're all mentioned in his judgment so he clearly didn't dismiss them.

""SASHA WAES council for THE SUN during the Trial is part of the Doughty St Chambers and related to Andrew NICOL and Geoffrey ROBERTSON""

You forgot that the judge is no longer part of this.

""01 ANDREW NICOL wrote a book with GEOFFREY ROBERTSON and was employed by his firm DOUGHTY ST Chambers when appointed judge for trial J. Deep (Barristers Chambers).""

So what. Are you claiming the judge was biased because of a book he wrote?

""02 GEOFFREY ROBERTSON is Mentor and Employer of JENNIFER ROBINSON, who is AMBER HEARD Council. She was employed by Doughty Street Chambers in London. She works with Andrew Nicol and G. Robertson on seminal media law text as The Media Law on Contempt 2015.""

So what. Are you claiming the judge was biased because he worked with a lawyer when he was also a lawyer?

""03 JENNIFER ROBINSON (Australian) brought AMBER HEARD to a Private Dinner during Trial. Attendees BARONESS HELENA KENNEDY, HOSTESS KATHY LETTE (Australian wife of Geoffrey Robertson in 2015) very close to Jennifer Robinson""

So what. Are you claiming the judge was biased because he worked with a lawyer when he was also a lawyer whose wife once had dinner with Amber?

""04 Helene Kennedy is also with Doughty, KATHY LETTE is Ex-wife of Geoffrey Robertson. and Personal Friend of JENNIFER ROBINSON and mutual CAMILLE PALMER, ANDREW NICOL‚Äôs Wife mother of ROBERT PALMER who works @ TalkRadio UK, TalkRadio employs Dan Wooton, who wrote the article for the SUN that Johnny Deep sued for Libet.""

So what. Are you claiming the judge was biased because his son works at the same company as the author of an article about Depp?

""05 Multiple News, Reports place this Team of Women Working with and supporting AMBER HEARD for years from UNA Functions to Published Support During the Trial.""

What is this even meant to mean?

Their go-to is usually pretending like robots are manually reviewing things poorly.  (This line is worded that way on purpose.)

But, you're entirely correct. Especially considering the lengths to which they went to protect the paul brothers at various points. A specific example would be the way that the suicide forest video was looked at by a real person from their team and it didn't get flagged. They took down videos even just pointing it out.",2020-11-13T00:44:52Z,0

220,UgxMENoTyKQRlwUUHQJ4AaABAg,Major Van Bloodnok,"@James Stewart It often happens where victims will defend their abusers, even to the point of taking some of the blame. Whereas abusers _always_ go on the attack. This is one of the reasons why, aside from all the evidence in his favour, I believed Johnny Depp. He had the exact demeanour of someone not wanting to get his abuser into trouble. AH on the other hand was maliscious and manipulative, calculating herself as the victim from the start. The first thing she does after being 'beaten'? Go to some party/festival/TV appearance. What does Johnny do? Goes to hospital.. He also reacts emotionally with his friends when things had broken down which is what the prosecution relied on - and I'm amazed the judge focussed on JDs texts reacting to AHs abuse and defamation - as if the judge had never heard of the word 'context' before.",2020-11-14T08:47:47Z,1

Nope.

Other than all the witnesses who reported these injuries.

That's not how the courts work.
