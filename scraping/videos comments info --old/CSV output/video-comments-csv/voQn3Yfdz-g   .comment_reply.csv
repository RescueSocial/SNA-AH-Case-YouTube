5,Ugx697ykMEeXY3HfRcR4AaABAg,monkey na,"@Incognito Account yes. I don't care what their gender roles are anymore or less than I care about their personal lives in relevance to my ability to enjoy art that has to do with so much more than a single actress and her actions in her personal life. Thats like saying oh I'm sorry ENTIRE CAST AND PRODUCTION, but I don't like this person so I won't be able to enjoy anything including you. 

It makes no sense and seems like a miserable existence",2021-09-21T23:09:45Z,0

8,Ugx697ykMEeXY3HfRcR4AaABAg,monkey na,You sound like you have a very miserable existence. Chances are you fucking love at least 3 of these films and it would be a shame if you let your emotions on something that has nothing to do with you affect how you appreciate art,2021-06-04T22:13:53Z,2

21,UgytpyXhoohBfy2GVo54AaABAg,monkey na,@Michael hooper that's specifically why I tell people to mind their own fucking business and stopped paying attention to everybody else's lives. For starters I imagine they don't like their personal business being the focus point of everybody's conversation but then on top of that I'm also sure that they don't really appreciate the idea of people no longer being able to appreciate the art others have created just because one person treated them like shit. I understand being defensive about these types of things and sticking up for what you believe but what I will never comprehend is why people allow someone else's personal life to affect them so drastically that they can't appreciate Something Beautiful. I personally never really knew who she was nor have I ever really cared but some of the movies that she is in our absolutely fucking classic,2021-09-17T17:36:21Z,0
22,UgytpyXhoohBfy2GVo54AaABAg,Michael hooper,"@monkey na I get a bit defensive over that horrible creature, and I understand what your saying but that art goes out of the window when you see that abuser in the movie, and millions of others think exactly the same 😔",2021-09-17T16:36:43Z,0
23,UgytpyXhoohBfy2GVo54AaABAg,monkey na,@Michael hooper that's your problem. It's unfortunate that you aren't able to appreciate greatness because a singular individual is shity and part of it,2021-09-17T16:22:19Z,0
