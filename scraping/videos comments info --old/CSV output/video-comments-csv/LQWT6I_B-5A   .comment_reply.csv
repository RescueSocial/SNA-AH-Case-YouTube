12,Ugz5maHi7L9clExoloV4AaABAg,Ricky Boccardi,@eHacker I just think people are missing a piece of this. Honestly... Johnny Depp is a wimp for allowing this to go on much longer. Hes made his point and should let it go. But he's allowing all these people to keep riding and destroying this girl. We get it. She's a stuck up snob and a manipulative shrew. But Johnny needs to step up and just wipe his hands of it. He's a bitch for letting this go on.,2020-06-27T20:37:19Z,0

You sound like a very strong Woman and an inspiration to not only Women but also the less discussed case of DV against men. 

I'm also so happy the truth came out, I've always liked Johnny Depp and from the stories of other actors, Co-workers and even ex's he seems like such a good man. Quiet and shy actually. When all of this first came out it didn't sit well with me. Also from a very short video of him being angry and yes, most likely drunk, it's crazy the amount of people that believed her. I try to be a good person but if someone filmed me while I was incredibly angry and inebriated, I wouldn't look great either. I'm sure a lot of people have acted in ways they would never want put out to the world. She knew exactly what she was doing, he's very upset and she sees it as an opportunity to show how angry he can get while acting like the sweet little victim. I'm so glad she is such a horrible actress and it shows on that deposition tape.",2020-06-18T06:53:18Z,0

Heard doesn’t realise that there is a real risk that there might be a RICO indictment waiting in the wings of this case.",2020-06-29T07:20:47Z,0
