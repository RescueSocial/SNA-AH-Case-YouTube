That's what I'd like to know.life is to short.Why is society so concerned about domestic flights like this  that go on all the time.you said it, moving on... wait but your still on the subject.life is to short to be involved with two other couples lives.No one is going to get sued or get into trouble. The only people that win is the attorneys that made millions of dollars for something that both of them could have taken care of themselves.The  attorneys love to take advantage of people who are all emotional and reved up so they can get millions from them.No one wins, everyone looses in a divorce .Ecspecisley the children.",Joseph Turner,0,2021-08-07T20:26:51Z

- if she was a vampire I would let her turn me into her kind.
... To me she's the most beautiful woman to my eyes and she's from Texas!",Jesse Daron,0,2021-08-06T18:56:49Z

7,UgyFdrQMFb2eq-o8hwZ4AaABAg,"Ok I just watched this video 3 times, and not once is there any actual delineation of a bribe by her toward the lawyer. You just said there are ""rumors."" Complete lack of credibilty and false headline. You just spent 5 minutes rehashing facts we all already know. I want my precious life moments back and I will never get them back. What. The. Frig.",arashi seiraika,3,2021-07-09T18:18:10Z
8,Ugyjw8Sf7YrctxwYXfR4AaABAg,"I personally believe that there is way more to the story than we've seen or heard. I am not sure what is going on and furthermore I really could careless. The only thing I have seen this woman in was Aquaman and nothing else, I did not think she even did a reasonably good job, either her acting skills are horrific or the director was not very good, However I believe that her acting skills are lacking. 
 As for Mr. Depp I always liked him in 21 Jump street and even in the first ""A Nightmare on Elm St."" I enjoyed the Pirates thing. But as for his personal life I know nothing, I do know every time I seen him on tv he was always respectful and polite. It is hard to believe things said about the man. But then again I really do not care either way. I just feel bad for the man to be victimized by a vindictive woman out for something that she does not deserve or entitled to.
 Now as bad as this is going to read, I feel the woman should do time in prison and pay a very hefty fine for her story telling ways. And I mean the maximum no questions asked.
 It is women like this that give other women a bad name and because of that trust has become extinct and no longer exists today.",ken parvu,7,2021-07-09T17:15:14Z
