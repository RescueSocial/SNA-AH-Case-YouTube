2,UgyaJYdOGrXT_4jKW8N4AaABAg,art,"true, this video is not meant to represent the reality, it should be treated as a music video with an aesthetic instead of a representation of what actually happened. this was never meant to be anything more than an edit. peace <3",2021-03-26T13:17:00Z,2
3,UgxzL5KfBSfXcKTnaox4AaABAg,Sufia B,"Ummm. Girl. He's innocent. She admitted to her abuse, but she got away with it because she's a girl and she knew the judge.",2021-07-15T21:16:08Z,3
4,UgxzL5KfBSfXcKTnaox4AaABAg,かぼちゃ,She's not a victim. Johnny's the victim and she's a liar and a abuser,2021-03-26T13:12:48Z,7
5,UgxzL5KfBSfXcKTnaox4AaABAg,FM A,Well she admitted on the tape that she recorded that she gets physical and johnny runs away and she laughed about it . Just because the judge sided with her doesn’t make her claim true .,2020-11-08T20:16:28Z,16

7,Ugwfv-Xp5nnV7Q38T2F4AaABAg,Tin,"@Sami Marzouki she abused Johnny during their marriage. It was both menta abuse and physical abuse. She would constantly body shame him, make fun of his deceased mother but worst of all she constantly hit him, she cut one of his fingers, burned his face with cigarettes, pooped on his bed. And then she had the AUDACITY to fake bruises with make up to make it seem like he had hit her. You can even look up for pictures of his finger and see some videos that she recorded trying to show he was aggressive but it was because she kept pushing him. There are some tapes that Johnny was able to record from their phone calls where she admits hitting and punching him and then she mocks him saying that if he says that she is abusing him no one would believe him because he is a man. It’s very sad how she almost kill his sweet personality. 🥺 they have been going on trial since the beginning of the year but I think they have not come down to any conclusion",2020-11-28T00:39:22Z,1

9,Ugwfv-Xp5nnV7Q38T2F4AaABAg,Tin,"@Chau That has nothing to do. They were not married, and sometimes people are better off alone. Im not defending what he did to Vanessa but what Amber did to him is absolutely outrageous and she should be in jail by now",2020-10-17T00:04:13Z,4
