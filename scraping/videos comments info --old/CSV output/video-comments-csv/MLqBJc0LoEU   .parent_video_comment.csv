3,UgxM40fM3imeEKcMGB94AaABAg,"Ah is a bad person. Johnny is kind & has his own share of karma. He could have married his kid's mom but maybe love is not there anymore. She stayed for a long time, must have gone thru thick & thin with him but no marriage. Out of the blue he chose to marry Ah after a short time knowing her on the surface. The other woman must felt the pain, it's a lie if she dont feel any pain knowing johnny choose ah as his wife & not her, maybe then she had accept it, hold no grudge, wish them the best but the universe is watching. He thought the grass is greener on the other side until karma came knocking at his door

In its most slendid and fully bloomed form. And it is not about male or female abuse its about ABUSE for everybody. Narcissists are men or women or wtv you identify as, and no, it certainly doesn't always take 2. Why? Cause no one consciously consents to narcissistic abuse, manipulation, gaslighting and so on.

Johnnys blaim as a victim, similar to me, is excused hole-heartedly if we learn the red flags and prevent it. My 2 abusers were completely different, using different tactics of manipulation - yes inside an abusive relationship you feel loved even tho you are in pain from the treatment. An abuser can't abuse a person if they know what they are trying to do. I hope this makes sense xD",Katie Wilcock,0,2020-10-17T11:42:22Z

On this show Johnny had the car all fixed up for her as a surprise. This show was definitely all about her until he started talking then she is super annoyed. She is a spoiled brat! Johnny is so very generous to everyone plus he is thanking the people who worked on and rebuilt the car, I'm willing to bet she didn't. Johnny probably caught hell on the way home.

Also, I'm not crazy into cars.. but I LOVE older model vehicles and I feel that's kinda how most people are. This was probably a fun project to work on. She's just...

It is a true nightmare and getting a lot of ignorant folks to say well, it takes two...is just what they do. Tho in this case, notice how it goes from eh, maybe it‚Äôs not all her. Maybe it‚Äôs both. But in the end, it‚Äôs all getting dumped on JD and somehow it gets totally flipped onto it being his fault entirely. JD himself has used the word ‚Äúperverse‚Äù and he is absolutely correct. This is standard protocol for these types of abusers tho, who would do ANYTHING to skirt all accountability and all consequences for their own bad behaviors toward others. Particularly when it‚Äôs abuse. 

They also often do what is called love bombing, and they love to do it when someone is at a vulnerable place in their lives or when they can find someone who is unusually kind and tolerant. Mostly tho, they are just calculating what benefits them and only them the most. (Aka. Money. Fame. Status. Etc). So they inundate their targets with a shit ton of overwhelming affection and attention and mirror them claiming to be some perfect ‚Äúsoul mate.‚Äù Then they get the hook in and get the other person addicted to them. This happens a lot more than many people would like to think. Male or female. So when they‚Äôre good and addicted, they start in with all the abuse and devaluing and the target is totally thrown off balance.

Another trait I've noticed, especially at a couple of premieres with press attention is if JD has ""a word"" with her she throws her head back in a fake laugh and then ""whispers"" her reply and he looks decidedly edgy.  Another thing she does is turn round and smile broadly at the cameras and then turns back looking very sullen.  That coupled with the ""kiss and/or flirt with a random bloke going past"" (I think to wind up JD).  Man! She has this whole ""act"" down to a T..

I had to address my co-dependency and where it stem from. even if unknowingly ultimately  I was enabling his behaviour , keeping the cycle going and abandoning myself instead of dealing with my issues. We need to take accountability and responsibility for our actions even when we are the supposed ""victim"" and look for help and work on our self. Plus I don't want that person to continue doing that to others. For example maybe Johny would just get someone else younger as it is less emotionally taxing (in theory obviously) instead of really looking in to last trauma, attachment style, codependency issues etc. We owe to ourselves in his case to his kids as they learning from him and I hope he wants to brake that cycle if not for him for them and any future children etc.",Tatiana Correia,0,2020-10-15T18:50:50Z

You can see the second his focus switches over to the crew her disposition changes and she flutters her eyes like she'd rather be anywhere else. What an entitled, self centered brat. 

And I disagree with the ""it takes two"" statement. Sure, Johnny may have not seen or even pretended not to recognize red flags for what they were, but I believe Amber is responsible for her own behavior. Just because he may have put up with it doesn't mean he deserved the shit she pulled on him. That's like saying it serves the victim right, that their submission warrants the reason to be abused because they didn't walk away, fight back, or even invited their abuser back. No one deserves to be humiliated, harmed, and taken advantage of. And Johnny is responsible for his actions.

99,UgwuDtBCymFjuqtWCa54AaABAg,"The attention is not on her and she is not being asked her opinion so she is not interested.  She makes no bones about showing with her body language that she is not interested.  This is typical narcissistic behavior - they are the star of the show and everyone else is in a supporting role.  When people don't treat them this way then they think there is something wrong.  She is also letting JD know that she has no interest in what he is saying. The question on why JD got involved with AH I believe is because her looks and fake persona initially swept him off his feet.  Then bit by bit the narcissists actual nasty, malicious personality come through.  What they tend to do is brainwash their victim into believing that their change in attitude is the victim's fault.  This leaves the victim in a state of confusion and they then try to find out what is wrong and try to get the narcissist to return to their original persona.  This won't  happen because the original persona was fake.  So when you hear JD continuing to try to reason with AH and her continual arguing and blaming him, this is what happened.  The moment when JD told AH 'you know what Amber, your not real.  You were just something in my head'.  That was the moment it clicked and he realized that it was not his fault and her original persona was fake.",Susan Gavaghan,3,2020-10-15T15:52:50Z

Even when you are done and ready to leave the abuser,  you will remember that at one time you cared/loved this person and you will try to not hurt them.

148,UgyDAoToCAUh12_8gdR4AaABAg,"I noticed a ""snide smirk"" expression while he was talking which is typical ""childlike behaviour"" and her obvious display of ""lack of interest"" while she's on a major TV program is on purpose to make her self ""noticeable"" (believe it or not) because everything she is doing is to try and make people look at her.
I saw a photo of her , Jason Mammoa and his wife out for the Aquaman premiere and she actually Pushed his wife out of the way (you can actually see Jason's wife almost fall over in the photo!!)  so she was centre and front with Jason......she's a pile of steaming crap and hasn't earned or deserved anything good that has come her way in life.",The Killing Joke,25,2020-10-15T12:19:58Z
