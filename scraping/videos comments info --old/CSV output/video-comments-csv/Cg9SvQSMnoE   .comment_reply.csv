151,UgwCAsyM7_JHc0mwgn54AaABAg,Rock Candy,@Christin Prüstel well it's strange - but he is in shock and Johnny is an artist who paints & writes so i believe the blood and paint and words were the expression of his physical and emotional pain. The thing is she never called for medical help and just let him continue to suffer.   Then later she added the words on the mirror about Carly Simon because he said she was vain or self-absorbed mentioning she liked nudes of herself.   Amber replies 'Carly Simon said it better' refering to her song 'You're So Vain'.  In any case the only person Johnny hurt here was himself by putting paint in his wound and Amber who is a narcissist had to have the last word which was added in red lipstick.,2021-07-15T21:27:21Z,0

153,UgwCAsyM7_JHc0mwgn54AaABAg,Christin Prüstel,@Rock Candy I just feel for him. He clearly loved her so much. Even at the end he just wanted to let it all rest. But then she published that article. He needs to be vindicated. I can't believe after those audio tapes people are still defending her and saying JD was the abuser.,2021-07-15T20:43:17Z,1

155,UgwCAsyM7_JHc0mwgn54AaABAg,Rock Candy,not sure why he went back to her after that but i think the abuuse he suffered as a child kept him in love with her.  i seem to recall he also said he was embarrassed by marrying her and of the abuuse.,2021-07-14T23:30:05Z,0

191,UgzDNQo5JS6s3I8dd554AaABAg,pink bubbles,That's you not seeing things from other people's perspectives.  Sometimes people fall in love with the wrong people then they show there tries colours and even tho there getting treated like shut they still love that person bc there thinking of how it was in the past or whatever etc etc. Theres so many reasons why people love people who treat them bad. Ur actually rlly pathetic and so fucking stupid to not think of other possible reasons to why. Just bc u couldn't do something doesn't mean others cant. Thanks,2021-07-06T23:42:02Z,0

304,Ugzf_ldZdwH20mqIjQx4AaABAg,Rowena Morgan,"She sounds very irratic and like she needs chaos. Sometimes people try to recreate traumas experienced in childhood by provoking others into rage. It's a compulsion and at the time they are so emotionally heightened by the appearance of passion that they can't think straight. The feeling gives them a rush. If there is no fighting, they feel empty and sad without the rush. I would say this woman has Borderline Personality Disorder....she appears quite psychotic at times. At any rate, poor Johnny Depp, he sounds worn out and actually more compassionate than most would be. Personality problems are also distributed equally in both genders....she is painfully unaware of how acutely obvious her abusive behaviour justification Is!!!",2021-11-19T02:37:12Z,0

321,UgxpcqfXwsvo96eUHgl4AaABAg,Tanya Kauffman,@Nia Selah I agree with the general statement. People are to quick to judge a situation without looking for more information.,2021-11-16T10:20:14Z,1
322,UgxpcqfXwsvo96eUHgl4AaABAg,Nia Selah,"@Tanya Kauffman My comments are not about AH and JD. Like I said we can all have opinions but it is all speculation. I see it more important to learn from cases that are in the media and reflect on why we believe something to be true, challenge conditioning, etc",2021-11-13T00:33:50Z,0
323,UgxpcqfXwsvo96eUHgl4AaABAg,Nia Selah,"@Tanya Kauffman In my country yesterday a male member of Congress ( mostly men) said regarding a new legislation that when a woman is raped her life is not at risk so if she harms the man it would not be considered self defense. There are females that are as physically strong as a man but generally we all have been programed to be light as a feather. Women go to gym to loose weight, men to build themselves up. Imagine the situation. A woman is about to be raped, the man is a lot stronger. Her best chance is to immobilize him, she may have to be extremely violent if she gets the chance only to stop him from hurting her. They are not in the same conditions , that is what I see in her comment to be relevant and to be acknowledged yet we judge the situation as they were the same. So with the new legislation if a woman fights back she will be processed as attacker. If she doesn't fight back when she goes to make the report for the rape, her word is not enough and since she didn't fight back in order to avoid more damage she is told there is not enough evidence of the rape, she is "" asked"" if she is sure, if maybe she wanted it and now she regret being easy.... I am glad you are believed where you are. It is how it should be everywhere",2021-11-13T00:27:15Z,0
324,UgxpcqfXwsvo96eUHgl4AaABAg,Nia Selah,@Tanya Kauffman Maybe where you live women are believed but generally it is not the case. Also I listened to her comment and she was saying something different. What she said is that nobody will believe him he was physically abused because of the difference of weight and strength between them. If they got in a fight she was in greater danger than him regarding the physical aspect.,2021-11-13T00:12:43Z,0

I believe you totally,read stories. But men should be protected too from abuse. I encourage you to fight back bye law. Maybe you can help men? So wrong women abusers get away with this. Stay strong!

749,UgyahC6KcUaRaHw_PE14AaABAg,TCK TCK,"Shot in the dark since there’s a lot of replies here. But you’re the first feminist I’ve seen comment on anything that seems open for discussion. In your hopefully unbiased opinion can you answer my questions? I am in no way attacking you or your views I’m simply a white man, conservative, mostly government doubting, mostly open minded father and husband to a beautiful crazy Latina that has questions that is honestly ignorant to “feminism”
1- is it a stereotype that all feminists hate men?
2- do you believe all men are evil?
I think that its case by case basis. Like cops, some are racist and bad but some are good and true. 
3- what should happen to women who falsely accuse men of rape and are caught?
 I think it should be the same sentence a man would get for truly raping. 
4- it’s a no brainer that women are a force to be reckon with, but do you truly believe that US women are still treated unequally in the workforce? IMO I think it’s based on skill set and experience. 
At the same time, I do believe it’s more race based than gender. 
Thanks for the read and looking forward to a positive civil discussion

Both did this to one another. Both were toxic. It was mutual abuse""-- all this sounds like victim blaming. If ur 1st impression on hearing a woman accusing some one of assault, isn't ""she deserved it""  then this shouldn't be difficult just becoz the victim happens to be a man.

Its all here and in any of the recorded audio but in all fairness, I am still not entirely convinced who's the abuser and who's the victim as I was not there during the relationship and I can't assume the guilty and the innocent based on my assumption and opinion. I can't assume Johnny didn't beat her because she seem more violent and I cant assume she didn't beat him because he has more money. It is not that easy to assume that he is bullying her because he has more money, fame and power without a proper proof that he did. If it were that easy, it would be easier to say she beat him up because she was medically documented as having a raging temper. However, based on all the documents, London trial transcripts, video and audio that was made public, Amber may seem guilty of violence and substance abuse but still, I need more proof to be completely convinced. I'm not particularly a fan of Johnny or Amber or both. I've watched some of his movies and I have watched Aquaman. Can't say I watched them because I'm a fan. Just that I love watching movies.",2020-08-26T04:17:47Z,1

Johnny is a proffecional manipulator, the most dangerous and sneaky kind.. Master mind... And he has a very proffecional highclass lawyer and manegement team behind working for saving his public immage.. ;) 

Those kind of men suck your mental health and soul till the last drop and than if you can't get out of that relationship as soon as possible, when you start to react they show passive agression to push you to do more wrong things and than suddenly they use a calm, cool mask to show others that he is the good one but she is crazy because he really know its gonna end and  he is the guilty one... Common dude, i watch this film several times...  All those past situations about Amber was nothing related but he threw all these things to public to save his ass on the court and manipulate her again infont of the judges...  But nobody talks about what he did in his past, Jhonny Depp ... Money talks if you are a rich man support by hollywood giants you can slient anybody or you can make anybody talk for you... They don't wanna loose Johnny he is a gold mine for them they invest a lot... Its so easy to destroy a young women actress with internet rumours or fake witnesses... She is surrounded by high dose manipulations, arround her even those hollywood wolves can push her to do more wrong or even they push her to ""commit suicide"" ...

She excuses it by saying she was 115 pounds. As if that excuses sh**ing on someone's bed and cutting their finger off.

Don’t forget she banged Elon Musk and others, while married to the man.  Come on dude, he was worried about his kid, she was worried about her reputation which she ruined, not him.  I’m talking about intention here, hers were NEVER honorable!!!! Surely you see that.  I wouldn’t mind a sugar daddy like him if that were the plain fact of the matter.  Having said that, I’m happily married with 3 kids and my first thought is to their well being, as his seems to be.  The court of public opinion judged him in the beginning without any proof he was guilty.  He’s is trying to clear his name and you think that’s unfair when she started it?  Gimme a break, that’s a double standard , and you know it.  Hollywood sucks, this whole lawsuit sucks and to be quite frank the newspapers lawyers suck,  also who is footing her bill, Elon Musk, he can well afford any publicist and lawyers, for her, but she choose some dumbass team to back her up.  Again, not his fault!  Not to mention her stupid friends lying for her under oath.  They look like fools all on their own.  Don’t you wonder why her parents are on his side?  They know her for the manipulative, lying, scheming, narcissistic person that she is.  They obviously would know better than anyone.  As much fun as this has been, I must get back to the real world now.  Take care, until we disagree again.  😉",2020-07-28T14:23:14Z,0
1226,Ugy0qYSsQAv6TRQyCnh4AaABAg,Michael Inniss,"​@Sabrina Beharry I'm not sure why everyone is putting Johnny on such a pedastal. - Well i do. it because of the narrative Johnny and his team have put out there. I have seen no evidence that she drove johnny to drugs and that his drug use started during their relationship. If you research Johnny and drugs you get a mix amount of stories going back to his childhood before Amber was born all the way upto before she got with him. I do think Amber has tried to twist his addiction problem to her advantage in the media and court of public opinion though and even then probably wasn't her directly but the publicist she hired(johnny has them too working overtime now).Sabrina why do you think Amber went into this without conscience and a gold digger but your unwilling to label Johnny a ""sugar daddy"" it seems to be a biased lense your looking through. I am only saying it takes 2 to Tango and whilst Amber is 100% coming across as a massive evil manipulitive psycho -Johnny isn't just some victim either. He just has more money to throw at the media campaign to save his face. I personally think they are both Toxic in this relationship and a clean split would of been best. You were nice to Amber calling her a B list though - Im not even sure she is that worthy haha. In my ideal world the media circus would die down and allow them to handle more privately, Amber and Johnny would never cross each other paths again.  We would get more pirates of the carribean and  Gilbert Grape 2 - The geratric years. Amber would fade into obscurity or maybe release a Elon Musk sextape lol. I do feel a little sorry for her in the long run. Johnny has done enough that even after this shit storm he will be able to work again. Im not so sure about Amber and I dredd the path she would take to stay ""relevant"" Fuck ever being famous - it seems like the worse drug of all.",2020-07-25T09:43:42Z,0
1227,Ugy0qYSsQAv6TRQyCnh4AaABAg,Sabrina Beharry,"Michael Inniss, the only difference is, he didn’t set out to blackmail her, she clearly, had(has) an agenda.  From what I understand he had been clean for a long time prior to her.   She, without conscience, decided to go after him for money, on top of the free designer duds she racked because of her affiliation to him.  She is at best a ‘B’ actress, he on the other hand could get anyone he wants.  I can’t really see what was in it for him, the exception being he truly loved her.  Now everyone sees her for the gold digger she is.  Because of her lies, people are less apt to believe the women who are really in abusive relationships.",2020-07-25T06:56:03Z,0
1228,Ugy0qYSsQAv6TRQyCnh4AaABAg,Michael Inniss,@Sabrina Beharry I have been out with women like this in the past and I bet it wasn't all bad.  Johnny has been around a while and i'm sure he knew what he was getting going in. He has been quoted speaking about how she used to rack up his lines for him and party. In most cases the rollercoaster of getting high and coming down is never a healthy mix for a relationship the caveat of course is if your both game for partying too self destruction then you may have just met your soulmate. I bet with there money the rollercoaster was bloody wild. You get what you give and I'm sure there where benefits to going out with an attractive driven younger women however unhinged. This sounded like a standard conversation that happens all over the world when one partner wants to stay and the over knows it over but the girl(in this case) also doesn't want to fuck up her cheque. It sounded more like a negotiation the a real emotional exchange. It was recorded for a reason.

If you give people that power they will tend to be corrupted (or. maybe in her case she already has a disorder) unless they have a strong persona. I feel sorry for Papa John here because he's out of two movie names and franchises he carried while Amber is still on the job despite clear evidence of her abuse. I know technicalities of law since i am in the legal profession, but you dont apply rules of evidence out of court and it sucks that Johnny was out from those movies even if the tapes and depositions show Amber acting as abusive and as an ass.

I don't think these scenarios would change. Sympathy goes to Johnny as everybody heard the tapes and he is famous and is known as a nice guy. Makes you wonder what happens to unknown people and if their story gets told or even believed given that most of society sympathizes with the girls rather than the boys.",2020-11-07T04:36:08Z,1

Truly, as much as I'm still PISSED at what she did & how she did it, I also feel SAD for her, too. It was probably a personality mismatch?? 🤷🏼 All I know is that it's not easy for a fiery person to deal with silent treatment & being left when they wanna discuss important things. In no way am I justifying her or blaming him; I'm just saying that I understand where & how her rage/hatred started. Seriously, man, these past couple days were heartbreaking for me -- listening to the recordings, following the timeline of events from dedicated YouTubers 😘, reading msgs etc -- and my hearteu is BREAKING FOR BOTH OF THEM!

Never once did she feel for him or care her false accusations would destroy his future...I pray that the truth will prevail and the world will see through her and her lies and that Johnny will come out unscathed.

1508,UgwTY3Ii06RltTpi_9t4AaABAg,Elisa Rivas,"@hq :3 You really think calling me ignorant is not a way to try to convert me into feministic views? You think all those statistics are factual? You never question? Never, really? Men shame other men because that's how us as a society depicts them to be and supposedly how they should be. Men go through the same sort of shit women do when it comes to these crimes, although sometimes in different ways. Men and women can both be aggressive in the same mannerisms. Men are just the more common aggressors we HEAR about. I told you, I gave you no evidence because you wouldn't listen anyways. Was I not clear? I don't care enough to tell you facts rather than just a different perspective because if you can't take the first bite of the apple (trying to understand the mindset first), then there's no point in trying to share more food (no point in giving you support and evidence). Why should I try to convince you when you are set in your ways? Why try? There's no point. You are ignorant as well; ignorant to all except your own perspective and I could tell from the moment you got defensive at my mere mention of being an antifeminist. A smart person would say, ""agree to disagree,"" or would roll their eyes and leave it at that. You acted like a fish to a line with bait and you didn't let go. I misjudged you, my apologies. You are not polite, you attack instead of think, and you only now understand that you can't convince me. It's not American, my dear, it's philosophical. In fact if what it means to be an American is to use my own brain to think for myself instead of being spoon fed information from other people, then I'm proud to be an American (I don't think I ever thought I'd say that, but I guess I just did). I'm so disappointed in how this all went down. I only said I was an antifeminist rather than a feminist, but otherwise, I said I agreed with you. YOU then proceeded to attack ME (which is whatever, attack me all you like), but then you attacked a group of people and their beliefs because they don't think like you (antifeminists), then you attacked a whole damn country (the US) because you disagreed with me (one single person) and don't give the excuse of ""no offense,"" as it's well known that, ""no offense,"" is really just another way to say, ""while I'm not intending to be mean or rude, I'm going to do it anyway,"" and it usually just contradicts itself. Note my consistency: I never tried to convince you I was right. I never tried to pass off my beliefs as facts. I never insulted you. I tried to be respectful, while disagreeing. I never gave you facts or evidence to why I believe what I believe, but rather tried to give you a taste of a different viewpoint. Still, all these things I just said I never did...YOU did. This is important to note. If you are confident in your beliefs AND no one is attacking you or your beliefs, then you will not feel the need to do any of the above. You won't fight AGAINST someone for justification for yourself, but instead you'll fight FOR someone to help a cause. Note, I only went on the defense when my beliefs were attacked. You didn't. There was no provocation. It was like a person saying, ""While I see the sky as gray instead of blue, I agree with you otherwise,"" and you chose to view that as a way to defend your views on the sky being blue. You don't think I'd know why you see the sky as blue? I just see it as gray. We will both raise up facts and evidence of why each side is right and simply battle over it as though it matters what the other thinks. It's stupid. That's why I didn't give you facts and evidence. Why should I justify my own beliefs? Maybe to someone who I think would actually listen with interest, sure, but to someone I don't think would because she immediately went on the defense for no reason as though I was attacking her? Yeah, no thanks. I won't even try. You may need to think about those things I said I never did, but you did and ask yourself, why did you feel the need to go on the defense? Why did you feel the need to ""educate,"" me? Did you feel attacked? Why? If you felt attacked, btw, I'm sorry. That was not my intent. I was simply saying While I have a few differences to your statement, I agreed with what you said and thought it was nice of you. If you thought I was attacking, you could've also told me I should've phrased something differently instead of attacking back, which is childish. Analyze, why did you have the need to do this? You expressed your pride in feminism, so shouldn't I have the right to also express my pride as an antifeminist? I'm not a threat to you just because I disagree with you and don't view things the same way. I could, if I wanted to, but honestly I don't think I care enough to, bring up facts supporting my cause, but I chose not to. I don't see how it would make a difference with someone who is willing to talk more than they listen. I still think you have a good heart, geared in the right direction, and full of passion for what you believe to be a good cause, but I don't appreciate your mannerisms and how you go about supporting your cause. You attack and have been a bit rude. This is my perspective, of course. I'm sorry if I have hurt you, caused you too much trouble, or made you feel like you had to go off on me for whatever reason, but I sincerely never meant to and I hope you understand how you could change your approach as well.",2020-08-27T21:19:43Z,0

I think Johnny wasn’t use to dating someone outspoken and indifferent. She clearly has her own mind and interests. She just wouldn’t be the silent, complying type that he was use too. So it got destructive.

The purpose is to make the divorce go away from the public eye. I’m sure they both were toxic but the unfortunately for her in all the audios that have came out he seems to be the more reasonable one. For example  asking security to step in or leaving the premises all together . The girl has issues and they were they long before he was there, some ppl are just bad with every partner they have. I’m sure there is plenty of ex’s out there that aren’t part of her inner circle. She doesn’t sound like she’s scared of him, she just sounds like she is milking the situation for what it’s worth.

But this one is different , this audio call is  from the day before the court date, after all those lies she sold to the press and media accusing Johnny and now they are talking cause Johnny wants to give that one last chance to solve this peacefully without going to court, but she selfishly doesn't care about his name and reputation and wants to go to court but wants Johnny not to file back and not defend himself. So what I meant to say was that at this point both sides recorded their calls. That's why she is trying to paint herself as a victim and believing her own lies, hoping that she can use some part of this phone conversation editing the things she wants as an evidence. And johnny ofc would reecord all his conversations related to her at this time.

I'm not sympathizing with him because he is famous but because he like a lot of men also get falsely accused. I get it your not sure yet but from what's out now in court. He has a staggering number of records to show how she acted in the 2 years of their marriage(really only a year or more because they started living separately in the second year I think).
And it nearly covers those years end to end she has nowhere to go if she doesn't have anything new to show in court.

Oh people will forget about this in 5 years i guess but as long as Johnny Depp is alive and on screen people will get a reminder every once in a while of how dangerous taking the side of the woman who merely accuses her husband of abuse can be.
He got crushed early on burned down his career and reputation.They might be rich and famous but they are people too.
I would believe it that its just 2 people who are incompatible but she has done nothing but try to soften him up and stomp him into the ground legally and blames it on her lawyers when they talk.

Thats why there is an allegation that Johny waited a few years so the little evidence that existed might have disappeared. I believe  He claimed he didn't contest it to protect Amber.

1724,Ugwigaa8IZG1mmICns94AaABAg,Liny Dee,She's right when he talks about countering her statement by saying he lost his own finger like I said this is a concept of mutual domestic violence but the man in this situation is not owning up to what is going on instead he is countering her position where one moment he wants the conversation to appear like she is giving her an olive branch and that he is this highly developed first and that's only out for her interests but his natural response is the counter her... He could be ending this phone call he has already said what he needs to say when it comes to court but instead he still presses a certain position... if you were to take this audio and send it to somebody experienced in body language interpretation they would tell you that there was a reason why he is stuttering because he is not genuine in this conversation... She is getting emotional at the exact points when the conversation warrants the emotional nature and she's being very honest with him but he is stuttering and just letting it record because in the background he is plotting this entire scenario out to but he is stuttering and just letting it record because in the background he is plotting this entire scenario out... No word of a lie she even addressed that this was all Mutual... They both should get some kind of a reprimand for it be mutual domestic violence but this is not a case where it is one or the other,2020-03-17T18:36:06Z,1
1725,Ugwigaa8IZG1mmICns94AaABAg,Liny Dee,The case that I have dealt with was the largest domestic violence case in the province and was the 3rd most intense in all of Canada when it came to the protection of families and this is exactly what would occur... The woman involved in that case specifically thought that she was going to die and that he would accidentally kill her and I'm telling you that this is what happens between domestic couples all the time when the woman is trying to not just protect a man but she technically does have feelings for the man but she gets so afraid that she doesn't know which measurement to take so she attempts to find Refuge by telling somebody like calling somebody on the phone and then by the time the cops come she switches the story because she doesn't want her boyfriend go to jail. If you were to send this to a criminal profiler equip the experience of domestic violence and most specifically a health specialist that was experienced in personality disorders like borderline personality disorder you would see that Johnny Depp and her conversation fits very well with a couple who is involved with mutual domestic violence but we're the man in this case is extremely manipulative... She's even telling him that she does not know how to get her own reputation back because she trusts him still while she's talking to him on the phone he is not the only one who claims he's in love... She likes him so much that she's trusting him enough to tell him exactly what she's afraid of losing,2020-03-17T18:31:06Z,1

I said YOU are sexist and I don’t care if you are a man or woman, I care that you are repeatedly saying things that are sexist. Now before you get it twisted up like you have with every comment I made, it’s not okay because I’m a woman and “can say whatever I want” or something like that. It’s okay because I haven’t made a generalized comment about men and I’m only making my remarks in response to what you say. I am only responding to what you say and not making any claims about most men, like you have about most women. At this point you just aren’t going to ever understand what I’m saying so I’m kind of done with this conversation. If you keep making sexist remarks and keep getting called sexist, maybe one day you will realize that it’s not man shaming to call one sexist man sexist. Maybe one day you will realize you are part of the problem.",2020-05-01T16:50:23Z,1

He nailed it on the head she never existed. Which is true these abusers love bomb and mirror, they aren’t true. She deflects from answering his straight up question ‘do you think I’m the abuser? Do you believe you’re the abuser?” She gaslights him into believing she couldn’t be abuser because he is bigger and stronger than her. She then continues to try and manipulate him and goes to far and it’s why he retreats and asks for a minute. You guys might feel he’s just as bad, but what he is doing is known as reactive abuse. Which is common in domestic violence relationships. 

This is good your making this content because the world needs to know and be educated on this abuse, because it can be mainly emotional and psychological which can be more complex and difficult to recover from. Please if you can research more on Narcissistic abuse. These recordings are so hard to hear because they have so many triggers and can effect survivors.

No, i don't nessecarily think she's been the only one to cross borders and i'm not saying she hasn't been abused before, because the lasting damage of that is clearly noticeable, but I think that she does him very wrong, a fact that he might be more aware over than her actual self, and still he is trying to comfort her, listen to what she thinks is happening for the most parts of it, and trying to find a peaceful solution. and only at the very end when he's had enough and stops to care, she actually breaks down, inducing that all she really wants is for the world, but especially HIM to acknowledge how much of a victim she is, and i believe she does really feel that way, I do believe her emotions for what they are at the most parts of all of this, but i also think that she is thinking clinical paranoid and surreal, one more reason for this whole war to hopefully stop as soon as possible, so they both can get the (psychiatric) support they really need.

And if you don't think the video of his kicking cabinets and acting like a wild animal is proof that he has violent tendencies, then think again. Whether he was drunk or not is irrelevant in the big picture. My point to you is that witnesses and videos have shown him in drunken, violent states. If he was not drunk in the video where he demonstrated violent behavior (as I am sure most objective people would view his behavior as violent), then he belongs in a zoo and not a home that he destroys because he can't handle this anger. Why do you expect him to have a record? He is a covert. I would expect him not to have one, particularly when just about everyone else sees him as a ""nice guy"" and have no interest in crossing the man who hands out his money. I don't care how old he was when he tore up a hotel room... it is more than apparent that he never dealt with his issues.

Here's the problem, she destroyed his life, caused him to be fired from Disney, caused the Media to turn on him, caused him years of pain and persecution mentally, physically and socially AND ALL THE WHILE, HE WAS INNOCENT. 

You cannot possibly come in here and expect us to simply go ""Ay, get her mental health help'"" and ignore everything else. People are FURIOUS not only because of she did to Depp, but alos what she did to THEM. She LIED to the Media, and caused many people to believe her. Now those people are guilt-driven, some too shy to speak up for mistakenly persecuting Depp, others admit their mistake and turn on her instead. How else would people react?! It would take an extreme pacifist to react the way you described. Defending her by saying she's mentally ill and therefore should not receive brutal treatment is testament to a pacifist thinking. It's bullshit. You do realise almost every serial killer, rapist, pedophile in history has mental instability/illness as well? So is the public (especially the victim(s) supposed to just rap them on the knuckles and send them to a mental ward? Hell fucking no.

Does she need mental help? Of fucking course. But she also deserves everything the public is throwing at her. Is it bullying? Yes. Is it helping her? No. But does she DESERVE it? Absofuckinglutely. It's called karma. What goes around comes around. I'm not going to tell a drunk driver who ran over a family to go to AA and leave it at that.

My EX husband talks, projects, deflects gaslights, lies and manipulates just like Amber *A.K.A  Queen of Projection* It's life shattering, devastating, and hard to come back from when you realize the person you FELL in LOVE with NEVER EXISTED, IT WAS ALL AN ACT. These types of people do not know how to SHOW LOVE or RECOGNIZE the FEELING of being LOVED. So they FAKE IT for you,until your hooked. Reality is no matter how hard we try to prove and show our love for them it will not matter.They'll NEVER BE SATISFIED. Amber, my EX and unfortunately many others DO NOT LOVE THEMSELVES. We can't teach them. No matter how much we want to. Trust me I KNOW from experience, I tried for 10 years. #JusticeforJohnnie.

My EX husband talks, projects, deflects gaslights, lies and manipulates just like Amber *A.K.A  Queen of Projection* It's life shattering, devastating, and hard to come back from when you realize the person you FELL in LOVE with NEVER EXISTED, IT WAS ALL AN ACT. These types of people do not know how to SHOW LOVE or RECOGNIZE the FEELING of being LOVED. So they FAKE IT for you,until your hooked. Reality is no matter how hard we try to prove and show our love for them it will not matter.They'll NEVER BE SATISFIED. Amber, my EX and unfortunately many others DO NOT LOVE THEMSELVES. We can't teach them. No matter how much we want to. Trust me I KNOW from experience, I tried for 10 years. #JusticeforJohnnie.

They can’t help but admit, in face of the evidence that Amber was the violent one, but they can’t go all the way and say he is guilty.
The worst is there is no proof whatsoever he had a part in this. People just assume it just like that so that Amber doesn’t look as bad in comparison.
Or people saying: We don‘t know the whole story. When everyone accused Johnny, no one said that, but no that Amber haw been exposed, apparently suddenly it‘s their own private thing, we as public don’t have enough information and it’s only between them.

The concept of white privilege is very racist.  It is a concept that white people are morally evil, just because of the color of their skin, with no way for any individual to escape it.  I can't think of a more racist thing I have ever seen.  The idea that you are evil and benefitting from a crime against humanity, only because of your skin color is obscene.  There are many more examples.

Discrimination exists also.  White people (and Asians) need better grades to get into university because of their skin color.  This is  institutionalised racism, in today's terms, it is more correctly termed racial discrimination.

This is just clear thinking and having a clear moral compass.  If you are so overcome by racial hatred, that you really are unable to see this, then you need to get help and get better educated.",2020-02-13T16:27:34Z,0

* Manipulative and conning - Does that fit Amber?
* Pathological lying
* Need for stimulation - Amber repeatedly kept starting fights. 
* Lack of empathy - she often mocked and dismissed Depp's concerns on those audio tapes. 
* Poor behavioral control - such as throwing bottles and pots. 
* Promiscuous - She was cheating on Depp with people such as James Franco and Elon Musk and Billy Bob Thornton. 
* Parasidic lifestyle - She was talking on the tapes about how she needed Depp for ""security"" and to have ""A foundation."" 
*Changes image as needed - Her lies about what happened kept changing. 
* Secretive
* Needs victims affirmation, respect, and love. 
* Their goal is to create a willing victim.

*The victims of these BPD'ers will **_always_** come to the same realization eventually - the realization that they had spent months or years, interacting with someone who **_does not exist._**  As someone who has been in that position as well, I can tell you just how mind-fucking it is when you finally reach that inescapable realization that not only were you played, beginning the very first time you **_met_** that BPD'er, but on every subsequent interaction with them - and that **_every single interaction was meticulously designed and executed on an individualized basis, to create a false personae for the sole purpose of aiding the BPD'er in some way.  This false person trait leaves BPD'ers with a ""tell"" - they will always have large (usually HUGE) numbers of people behind them which they ""knew"" and can describe intimately, yet very few - if _any_** of them are still in the BPD'ers life.  Essentially, this behaviour pattern leaves them with clearly identifiable ""vignettes"", but none of the people they knew in those vignettes have carried forward to the present day.  And the ""reason"" these people have not been carried forward is always the same - every single person in the BPD'ers past was either ""an abuser"", or a friend of the abuser, and all of them were acting to the detriment (usually to the deliberate torture) of the BPD'er, who will ALWAYS present themselves as a ""victim""*

*This false victim narrative fits in so well with todays intersectional ""victim olympics"" culture that it's difficult to discern that you are interacting with a mere ghost of a preconstructed character from the BPD'ers current storyline - right up to the point where the BPDer finally turns on you or someone else in that vignette period. Then, it's ""everyone"" was trying to abuse her, but she was ""saved"" by [whomever the BPD'ers newest actual victim is].  Note that I use the diminutive ""her"" here because BPD is an overwhelmingly female phenomena: it does occur in males, but it is so rare that it is essentially a unicorn in males.*

*So, Amber Heard is a **_textbook_** example of a ""Gone Girl"" BPD'er.  And we have been allowed to see in to her carefully constructed ""victim world"" by Depp's prescient decision to record her conversations, once he realized that there was no actual ""Amber Heard"" that any single person could identify - that would not be destroyed by simply comparing notes against ANY other person the BPDer has had personal relationships with.  Humans have a hard time trying to assimilate the fact that they have had a relationship with a caricature of a person.  A caricature that was built just for them.  This disbelief reaction is a difficult one to come to terms with for obvious reasons: it is SO sick, that who would **_do_** such a thing?  Well, now you KNOW who would **_""do such a thing""_** - Amber Heard would.  Or any other BPDer.  Thank God the world has very few of these particular nightmares floating around, as each one that hits general circulation does incalculable damage to those left in the wake of their faked, artificial, pretend lives.*",2020-02-09T07:42:41Z,0

2227,UgwP1R06vvB_c5TYYIB4AaABAg,sahib5,Rochelle Anne Romero  - it is really heartbreaking.  But also?  He left the beautiful mother of his own children - thinking he could do better or needed something different.  He was clearly drawn to this toxic woman.  That does NOT excuse her abuse.  At all.  But he is definitely no saint either and he also deeply hurt someone who loved and trusted HIM.  Life is complex and relationships are more so.  Heard deserves the blame she is receiving and deserves to be appropriately punished for her abuse.   But he definitely was drawn to her for a reason and he hurt his family in his own quest for happiness.   No one is perfect.  And again while it does NOT excuse her behavior - I do have to wonder what happened to her to make her like this?  This toxic chains are so long.   Sad story.   Glad he was able to leave the situation.  Narcissists do very often drive away the people they actually most love - because they deeply mistrust the love being shown to them.  They don’t feel deserving and so they think something must be wrong with those that love them.  And so they attack and despise them.   It’s devastating.   And often they literally don’t see how they are wrong.   It’s all quite sad.   And she is reaping what she has sown.  But in a way - so is he.   He hurt his own family in his own quest for whatever he was seeking and it didn’t end well for him either.   The upside is that he seems to have some genuine goodness and decency in him.    He probably learned a lot from this and here’s hoping he goes on to find some peace and happiness.   She will likely never see her fault or find the humility to change.  Narcissists rarely do.  And she will suffer for that greatly.,2020-02-14T04:47:59Z,0

Later about week later found out she had used her last money to go and see a ""virtual boyfriend"" in a different country she had met via internet. Haven't seen her since. Talk about messed up !  Also when i was still recovering, i had a short term fling (couple of months) and damn, she was bpd too (cutting etc). I was lucky it didn't cause any hovering or other bad stuff. After that i was like WTF, it must be me who is inviting these nut cases. That shit toke me about 5 years to get over fully. Still some times get little PTSD symptoms and my mind wonders to ""what if"" ..Anyhow, still single on my own will and doing ok, and i'm relaxed. Better than forcing a bad relationship. I know the ""guilty"" feeling, its part of their game. We can only get stronger after this stuff. Cheers.",2020-02-10T21:04:57Z,7
2310,UgwYm9Sb31cx-09u_pF4AaABAg,Rocko M,@johto Don't know about Narcissist but if she is bpd she must have been an amazing bang. No wonder Johnny felt so intensely about her. My bad luck i have date 2 girls in the past who after dating them i found out they were diagnosed with bpd and man did those 2 relationships mess me up. Even when i finally had the moment of clarity to end it i would always wonder if i should have just stuck through it because it was the best sex of my life. Every time i think back and even now while writing this i'm slightly ashamed that i let myself go through that kind of hell.,2020-02-10T20:49:39Z,2

2312,UgzpZyXyaVRnnMMjn2N4AaABAg,Bry,"Golden Gainz I think that it’s just because it’s such a vast subject. An explanation would be too big for the comment section on a YouTube video. 
There’s a whole science behind why victims stay or why they “don’t just call the cops”. When I left my abuser my friends and family were shocked that I had stayed for three years and simply couldn’t understand why someone would put up with that. 
It’s very hard to explain, but if you’re interested research “trauma bonding”, “PTSD”, and “love-bombing”. That’s why people don’t report it right away or sometimes ever. ❤️",2020-02-12T23:54:52Z,1

Well, that’s not just her, that‘s what all women do. Heard it over and over again. This is exactly what contracts are there for. You don’t have one? Your loss.

When I was with the German Air Force, had a smart law teacher who told all of us to get an individual contract with our future fiancées - I was the only one to follow his advice (and it was not easy to convince her; she’s still blaming me to not truly loving her because I did it). But you know, funny thing is, we are still together after 17 years, while most others around us already split at least once.

I think maybe you understate the potential of narcissism, however.  She should have the requisite narcissism to recognize how she is creating a living hell for herself where she will be surrounded only by other victims and predators.  


I think her psychology might have more to do with her fears of past abuses and social abandonment than her desire for power.  Just a guess... but from my experience real narcissists with careers or money don't let themselves go this far.

About 3 months ago my best friend was in a similar situation, his ex wife purposely backed into his car. Right after backing into him she called the cops, lied to them and said HE rear ended HER, and claimed he was actively trying to kill her. He was speaking to a 911 dispatcher at the exact moment that she backed into him, and he immediately verbalized to dispatch ""she just backed into me"" then left to avoid any potential escalation, because she's a complete psychopath especially when drinking or on drugs. He initially dialed 911 to report her driving while heavily intoxicated, and doing so with their 6 year old daughter in her back seat. Guess what both of their calls resulted in? 

No cops followed up with what he reported, instead they sent multiple officers to my friends house, who proceed to forcefully arrest him and take him to jail. No witnesses, no proof. Just her word (that of a felon with a history of violence and drug use) was enough to put him in jail. No questions asked. His son who was with him riding passenger during the incident was begging police to listen to his explanation about his mom lying to the cops, being an abusive alcoholic and drug addict, and intentionally backing into his dad's car. He then watched his dad get taken to jail, with multiple guns pointed at him like some violent criminal.

Those are people who get to the point of such psychological distress, that they BELIEVE their best avenue is to end their own life. We need to validate women's issues BUT WITHOUT SHITTING ON MEN. I rarely see any feminists posts that don't annoy me because they are always taking shots at men instead of validating each other which is fuckin ridiculous. Feminists drive home nonstop how predatory men are so much so it makes men feel guilty about being a man. That amount of diabolical assholery is man hate, taking away men's voices because some jerk off fuckin waste of space in Mississippi is a serial rapist is the same as the same as saying all women should sit down and shut because that crazy bitch wore astronaut diapers or whatever and drove 6 states with a diaper on to kill her husband. It happens all the time. The news caters to outrage. Women HAVE the narrative right now. And the women who are controlling the narrative sure a bunch of self centered assholes with a victim complexes that care about no one but themselves. And the only time any one of talk about male issues is when they come to videos of johnny depp who is clearly a victim of narcissistic abuse and talk about how women deal with it too and it affects them as well. It fucking doesnt. And your analysis of this situation is staggeringly ignorant. Sure they both have issues but if you can't see this as how disgustingly ugly and evil women can be then you are probably a perpetrator of that same behavior.

A couple months ago my best friends ex wife purposely backed into his car. Right after backing into him she called the cops, lied to them and said HE rear ended HER, and claimed he was actively trying to kill her. He was already speaking to a 911 dispatcher the exact moment that she backed into him, and immediately verbalized to dispatch ""she just backed into me"" and left to avoid any potential escalation. He initially dialed 911 to report her driving while obscenely intoxicated, and having their 6 year old daughter in her back seat. Guess what both of their calls resulted in? No cops followed up with what he reported, instead they sent multiple officers to my friends house, proceed to forcefully arrest him and take him to jail. No witnesses, no proof. Just her word (that of a felon with a history of violence and drug use) was enough to put him in jail. No questions asked. His son who was with him during the incident was begging the cops to listen to his story, about his mom lying to the cops, being an abusive alcoholic and drug addict, and intentionally backing into his dad's car. He then watched his dad get taken to jail, multiple guns pointed at him like some violent criminal. He's now facing multiple felony charges for her lies.",2020-02-08T10:07:17Z,0

2759,UgypPEuRiA6kJAwKH_R4AaABAg,Tiffany C,What got me in the other video was her talking about all the times she’s chased him out of the elevator – – that shines a light on the fact that there are 87 surveillance videos to be used in the trial. For the longest time I thought they all depicted her with no injuries after the incident in May where he supposedly through the phone. Now I realize that they must be “all the times” that she chased him out of the elevator and probably beat him there and in the hallways.

So when he said that, the judge assumed he had struck her back. Also she bit herself on the arms took pictures and claimed he did that to her, when he tried to tell the judge he had NEVER bitten her EVER, the judge said Mr. @&!*$ DO YOU BLACK OUT WHEN YOU GET ANGRY?! She didn't believe him at all. But you are right it is a marathon and now we have testimony from all her other ex husbands and they're experiences with her ready to go for the next hearing. It's  going down and I can't wait.",2020-02-08T17:41:18Z,1
2790,Ugxw7nL5iHMW6R9cy0N4AaABAg,BTMillion,"KitKat 90 An appeal to emotion shouldn’t be enough to get judges to make decisions as long as they stay reasonable, which it seems some of them haven’t been before in your case, but some of them will.

Making empty, unprovable claims is pretty much the only thing it seems she’s been doing. She’ll have to lie her way into a contradiction at some point: you can definitely catch her in one if she goes too far. You might have the burden of proof against her claims because of the emotional appeal, but you’re sure to have the upper hand if you calmly(very important) present indisputable evidence against her claim. Don’t let her frustrate you with her lies, since that might force you into giving up the evidential high ground and just
make claims about her that might  be just as unprovable in court.

To that end, you need a good lawyer for when you find a reasonable judge, since good lawyers are a financial expense in themselves and there’s a good chance she’s trying to exhaust your finances.

If she’s twisting information she knows, that’s even more likely to cause a disprovable lie of some kind, since the situation is grounded in fact. Make sure to make use of that whenever you may find the opportunity. 

You pretty much already have experience with how she would act, but you have to remain vigilant and learn carefully from how these court cases are handled from an emotional, financial, and intellectual perspective in order to give her what she deserves, since courts can be very biased.

If you’re already good at all that, then it’s just a matter of time before something shows itself that’ll put her in deep trouble. Winning in court is not a sprint, but rather a good marathon, so make sure to maintain your composure throughout the process.",2020-02-08T17:23:39Z,0

We used to be a nation that had common sense and we held people accountable for their actions and we weren’t so sensitive. Now, it seems people can get away with anything if they’re seen as a victim, and it’s in the spirit of that mentality that people are lying about being victimized. There was Jussie Smollett who wasn’t content in being rich and famous, he also had to be a “victim” of a hate crime. There was the girl in Virginia who said 3 of her white classmates cut her dreadlocks. There was the girl in NYC who was “kidnapped” which we later found out she arranged so she wouldn’t have to go back to her native South American country because she wanted to stay with the boyfriend. There’s also been countless women that have come out, just like Amber Heard, who lied on men for either the social acceptance and public empathy of being a victim or for money and even for vengeance for being tossed aside or dumped or whatever. There have also been countless men who lie on women in order to not pay child support or to have their children taken away from their mother in a nasty custody battle and even men who cry wolf and say a woman hit them so she can get arrested. There’s malice everywhere and no one thinks to look at circumstances with a cognitive and critical thinking mind.
They just hear “victim” and automatically believe and side with them. Everyone is outraged and appalled for Johnny Depp, but where was all this supprt when she said she was a victim of domestic violence, even though nothing really pointed to it, his exes came to his defense and he had witnesses to prove otherwise? I never believed it from the beginning. The story always sounded fishy to me. If a story doesn’t add up and the moving parts don’t flow smoothly and if something is off and it doesn’t make sense, there’s always something more to it than meets the eye. 

People like that Tia Marie you replied to, in length; they stand in their self righteous indignation and repeat the narrative of political correctness and public opinion because they can’t think for themselves. And so, everything that people tell them it’s correct, they repeat because they want and need the validation. This blind belief that people are victims and they should be given a pass is just a hindrance to society. I understand that there are exception to those cases, this is just not one of them. 

If we go by her mentality, then we need to excuse all victims of horrid things in order to avoid their accountability. That means, the child who killed their parent because of sexual abuse. The woman who slowed her partner to beat and abuse her children from a previous relationship. The rapist who was also raped as a child, and therefor that’s why he rapes. The kid who grew up watching his father beat his mother and now he’s a woman beater etc.... If we go by that mentality, then anyone’s who’s ever been through anything in life should be given a pass and not be held accountable due to their childhood traumas. We’d have all kinds of degenerates out in society roaming about claiming victimhood and victimizing others. 

Again, I am not without empathy for victims and survivors, but in the case of Johnny Depp and in so many other cases, people walk into something (not blindly) but with knowledge of what they’re getting themselves into. 

I have a friend who recently started seeing a guy, and this guy is like 10 different types of no good lol Firstly, he’s married (that right there should be enough right?) nope, not for her. He’s also into the street life and he’s a known womanizer. He has a bunch of children with different women and there’s no day job to speak of lol He’s a smooth talker though. I’ve hung out with them a few times and I genuinely like the guy. He’s cool, he’s fun, he says mostly the right things. Still, you would have to be one stupid motherf*cker to look at that situation and think to yourself “Yep, this is ideal for me.” lol So when she gets hurt (and she will get hurt because there’s no other possible outcome) and she’s crying about what an a**hole he is, I’m gonna look at her and say, well, you walked right into that one. He showed you who he was from the very beginning and it just slowly got worse, but you knew from the beginning. At some point you’ve gotta make an assessment of the situation and say, man, that was stupid of me, I can’t believe I did this lol 

Anyway, that’s what I think. As for writing. I used to write when I was younger and nothing came of it. People are mostly stupid and they barely read anymore lol Let’s ask Tia Marie when was the last time she read a book or even an article that she didn’t find on her Facebook page lol I don’t even have social media anymore because that got intense after the elections haha I a had to deactivate everything because of the ridiculousness of friends fighting about politics. But thanks for the encouragement. Maybe I’ll start writing again since there’s people who aren’t stupid in the world lol",2020-02-08T13:30:22Z,0

I'd very much enjoy reading more from you.",2020-02-08T09:34:56Z,1
2835,UgzsfUBE7wvp-bhfJF94AaABAg,Ernest Gonzalez,"@Tania Haeussler are you gonna enlighten all of us to how victims aren't liable to take any responsibility? So far you sure are doing an amazing job at regurgitating the bullshit everybody hears all too often for anyone who's ever been shown as a victim in the media, then adding your oh so clever and original ""calm down/STFU"" tagline at the end.

Do you have any original thoughts or points? Your insults are pathetic for someone so educated on the subject of abuse. I find it laughable that you're calling people self righteous while giving Depp, an intelligent grown man, ALL the sympathy for something he's had decades to recognize and actively avoid through experience. 

You're the one who sounds self righteous with your politically correct attempt at stating the exact same bullshit any fuck stick can spout out after watching any recent media. 

Yes, he's a victim of abuse. Yes, I'm sure he was manipulated, but that bitch is no genius mastermind. Any half wit who's had a few relationships can recognize she's obviously emotionally and mentally immature, manipulative, and has no problem justifying her own violent tendencies while sipping on her own cool aid.

Depp has had more than a few relationships at this point. My best guess is he was not in his right mind when they got together, based on how much he was spending on wine every month. So I doubt he was sober, that's important to keep in mind, aaaand she's also drop dead gorgeous. If she's also good in bed that goes a loooong way in how much craziness too many men will put up with before calling it quits. Especially if they're inebriated while making those decisions. 

Given the fact that he married her, that tells me he genuinely did love and enjoy being with her. He probably thought ""yeah she can get crazy at times, but that's just a result of whatever happened in her past, and who am I to judge how past trauma manifests? She's still young and hasn't had time to work all that out yet, but I'll gladly help her with that, because I fucking care about her. And she knows she goes too far sometimes, which is why she openly admits that to me (as we've heard her do in recordings) so I see that as a sign of her moving toward emotional growth. So until she does truly leave it behind I don't think she's gonna draw blood, or stab me in my sleep. I can deal with some slaps and punches from a teeny girl every once in a while."" And right there is where he should've known better, and should've been the sign to see how it goes before marrying her.

So again, maybe tossin back a little too much of that $25,000 plus monthly wine was clouding his judgement? I'd say more a probability than a possibility, I'm also willing to bet THE HOUSE she didn't unleash the ""full crazy"" til after the wedding. And to that point, being an experienced grown man he should've known how much a person can hide about themselves, for years on end. Especially in their profession!!! Lying and changing their personality to fit the narrative is what she and him both do for a living right? 

For whatever reason, I doubt he was thinking clearly. Was that alcohol, or a mid life crisis, like the ridiculous money spent on the 14 houses or some shit? All of that along with giving some young hottie the benefit of the doubt were all mistakes, that he's now kicking himself for. Just because he's not on TV saying it doesn't mean he isn't thinking, ""I should've seen this shit coming! Fuck!"" 

So, you also agree he's an intelligent man, you said so right? Do you really think an intelligent, successful man just gets conned into marriages? I sure as fuck don't. Generally being conned into shit isn't something intelligent people suffer from, and if that was gonna happen it sure as fuck wouldn't be at his age. She's not a con artist, she's just gorgeous and thought she could get away with walking all over him. I bet so many men in the past let her do exactly that! When he said ""enough of your childish shit, I'm fucken done with your crazy ass, you're just getting worse, and if you really gave a fuck about me, or our marriage, your violent tendencies wouldn't be escalating."" She showed more of her true crazy ass colors and started formulating ways to make it look like she's just a victim of his physical abuse. Because all she cares about in the end is herself, and potentially her public image even more.

Like I said, she's no genius. She can't even keep her story straight when talking to Depp, she's just used to getting her way and anything she wants cause she's a smoke show and there's plenty of idiots who've shown her they would've stuck around regardless. But since he's such a genuine nice guy, along with thinking so highly of herself she really thought she'd get her way with making up lies. Why wouldn't she get away with it? After all she probably gets her way with anything 99% of the time, especially being a celebrity and super hot.

Regardless, he absolutely made mistakes. That's not victim blaming, that's the truth. Not to mention, by your logic he'd just remain forever a victim, condemned to a life of being conned by beautiful genius women into marriages til he dies I guess. You think he thinks that? Fuck no, I guarantee he's thought to himself a hundred times ""I can't believe I let this shit happen."" He's gotta take responsibility for his mistakes, he 100% understands that. The only way to make sure this doesn't continue to happen to him, would be to recognise where it went wrong and come to terms with the ""mistakes he made"" and ensure he doesn't end up in the same situation moving forward, right? Or would that just be more victim blaming? Is he victim blaming himself?

So maybe you should ""shut the FUCK up"" with your politically correct bullshit and get your own opinions. Then add something meaningful to the conversation, instead of regurgitating all that shit from your moral high ground of virtue signaling for likes. No matter how many likes you get from the endless sea of idiot media followers, you still look like an asshole to anyone who thinks as an individual.",2020-02-08T08:54:45Z,1
2836,UgzsfUBE7wvp-bhfJF94AaABAg,Honesty4yoass,"jorge osorto — I agree. For everything in life, there’s personal accountability, even for staying in toxic relationships with shitty manipulative people. How many cases have we seen where a woman is a victim of domestic violence and she’s afraid for her life and her boyfriend, the abuser, also hits her children and mistreats them and in some cases, even sexually abuses them. There are tons out there if you look online in court cases. Just because a woman is a domestic violence victim and she’s afraid and being manipulated, that doesn’t mean she’s not going to be held accountable if her boyfriend one day kills her child for beating them to death or the school finds out that the child is being sexually abused or malnourished and the kid gets taken away and they go to jail. As much as the woman can be manipulated, she still allowed it, so she goes to prison too. It’s called accountability. You can’t say “Oh I was being manipulated” and act like you don’t have some responsibility for staying. In this case, there was audio of him saying that he thought the fights would cool off after they got married. My response is, man, if you knew she was a raging bitch then why’d you marry her? This sensitive ass society needs to chill out. They give everyone a pass. I’m not saying that he’s a villain. She’s an abuser, and she’s dead wrong and (in my opinion) people who lie about being of victim of anything should get some jail/prison time, when there is consequence to others for their lying, but I don’t think he’s entirely blameless either. I think he’s a grown ass man who made the unfortunate decision to marry that raging b*tch and he’s acquiring consequences for his (not so well thought out) actions.",2020-02-08T03:16:25Z,1

Part of some therapy thing or something. I could be wrong though. You can think leaking audio like that is bad, sure, but I think they both knew it was recorded and after all she said about him I guess it's fair game if the leak comes from his side (I don't know that, I said IF). Plus it's true that she seams more ""reacting"" (what you call ""normal"" I guess) and he sounds more calm (maybe just a bit high, lol), but ""reacting"" like she does does not sound ""normal"" to me. Basicaly I feel she's manipulative in her words and you think he was manipulative by playing the cool guy while she goes angry... it's just that in the end she admits having done bad things in those audio leaks, period.

Narcissit use their kids as a form of self esteem and never really consider them first unless it serves their purpose. Lack of remore, and empathy is classic NPD as well.

I see her as the slogan of NPD Which is ""love me or else"" and the slogan of NPD ""I hate you, Don't leave me"". I see her black and white thinking and erratic emotions that show signs of BPD as well as her physical harm to Johnny which can be NPD but more in the ASPD area. Even though a sain person can physically harm someone in a fit of rage. She's a bit of a drama queen as well with all her Histrionics as well.

2880,Ugx2vCw_wiG_jSWCD-x4AaABAg,sherikrupp,"1974GreekTiger Are any of you educated enough to be making claims like this? Like what do you actually know that proves in a scientific capacity that all women need to be institutionalized? There are definitely differences in how the brains of men and women work, some due to how we're raised and some due to actual physical differences in our brains. Those differences make women more likely to suffer from certain mental illnesses, but men are overwhelmingly more likely to murder their spouses and end situations in violence. 

That's not generalizing. That's a fact that you can Google the numbers on yourself.

We should be institutionalized when you're the ones shooting up buildings and starting wars? Because we're generally more empathetic and given to things like depression and anxiety?

However in my opinion living together and raising children together for that long does make it a husband and wife situation really, despite not having a bit of paper to make it legally so. 


In my country, if 2 people live together for 2 years or more, when they split up they are legally required to split all their finances and belongings 50/50 as far as I am aware, so Johnny ""rewarding his ex for good service "" is no less than I would expect. 


I do agree with you that if the love is gone, then the best thing to do  is to be honest and end the relationship if it cannot be salvaged. 


Perhaps karma was a little strong. I don't wish anything bad on Johnny at all. I guess I'm just a little bit bitter that hot women can manipulate men, no matter how crazy, destructive and abusive they are, and the guy can still say they are the love of their life, when there are really sincerely wonderful, loving women around who get cast aside or not even given a chance.

Falling in love with amber may have been a mistake( even though you can't really control who you fall for and as she's shown, people can hide their true colors) but to consider it karma is idiotic. 

If you fall out of love with someone the BEST thing you could EVER do is come clean, honestly let your partner know how you're feeling and leave. 

The only other options are to cheat, or remain with someone you no longer love miserable, slowly becoming more resentful of each other as time passes.

3013,Ugy--7NHPFZVSFRj8NV4AaABAg,Edward Campbell,"@Just Another Happy Humanist You haven't addressed the inconsistencies within that narrative. And before I go on, I'm not defending her a person, denying she seems to be (a phrase that everyone has really got to start using more) a petty, selfish, manipulative princess, just that this isn't clearcut evidence that she's guilty of spousal abuse. Some key elements: she's the one who wants to go to court because she's confident it will clear her reputation. Why? Because the idea of planning all this five years in advance is ridiculous. Second, SHE told IO to call the cops. Which makes absolutely no sense if she were the one being abusive, just as it would make no sense for him to be upset about it. Most prevalent, I feel, is that her behavior doesn't match the MO of perpetrators of spousal abuse. They've been together, what, eight years? That far along and the man should have few, if not no, friends, be subservient with only appraisal toward her, without the constitution necessary to hold up arguments this frequently and for this long. Look, I'm not denying she's guilty of battery, but it sure seems like he was too. He at no point denies that himself, and while technically that is abuse, when it's reciprocated it isn't fair to call one party abusive, and I find the certainty with which people are saying so to be disturbing. Because the most important factor is the most obvious, and ironically the most overlooked, is that these tapes exist in the first place. And I hope people know that they weren't made surreptitiously, they both agreed to record these fights, something an abusive spouse would never dream of allowing to happen. If we stop looking for the bad guy in all of this we can see a couple who still love one another, desperately trying to keep their relationship from falling apart at the seams, regardless of being aware of its mutually destructive nature. I'm not defending her character, but I'm not willing to call any of this proof of such an egregious crime. I find that just as reprehensible as the people who immediately started throwing stones at Johnny Depp when the news first broke. Is it really more convincing that Heard is ""the abuser"" in this relationship, or that these are two people in a fucked up, slowly eroding and ultimately doomed marriage? The grim reality is, neither of us know enough to have the upmost certainty that we know the answer. Oh, your poor toes.",2020-02-07T10:27:10Z,0
3014,Ugy--7NHPFZVSFRj8NV4AaABAg,Just Another Happy Humanist,"I think you're the one exercising your confirmation bias, I'm afraid. You have to notice key details of what she said. I can understand how you came to the conclusion that you have if you weren't paying attention, or haven't followed the rest of the case, or the rest of the conversation, but if you had done these things, you would hopefully understand why it is so obvious that Amber is passive-aggressively threatening and manipulating Johnny here.

For example, in the middle of the speech that you are referring to, Heard says

""Do you really think that people are going to believe that you, a man, has been abused?""

Now on first glance, it may seem like she is simply implying that he won't be believed because the evidence isn't in his favour. However, note the key phrase ""a man"" here. Heard is implying that Depp won't be believed because he is a man - as if men can't be victims. She is using societal biases against male victims to manipulate Depp into believing that people won't believe him because he is a man. If he really was the abuser, there would be no reason for her to throw that extra phrase - ""a man"" - into the mix. 

Heard also repeatedly mentions how nobody is going to disbelieve her because she has so much evidence, but it's all about her own reputation. She repeatedly laments the damage this might do to her reputation, never once either saying, or implying, that she is doing this because it is the right thing to do, or because he actually hurt her.",2020-02-07T09:02:06Z,0

We're both entitled to our opinions.

 As my comment states, Amber Heard is the aggressor and to that extent the fault is entirely and exclusively hers.

Edit: Johnny Depp is an intelligent, autonomous individual... To imply that he was completely under the spell of manipulation/having no responsibility (already counter to the truth just from what we hear towards the end of this recording from Depp himself) is actually passively dehumanizing... in my opinion.

Luckily for him and everyone who now knows all about this, he set a powerful example by (eventually) respecting and defending his own boundaries.

He's modeled important behavior, here. Primarily by changing his behavior.

Just sounds to me like a lifetime of extreme feminism bullcrap - which is ignorant to me.

I don't think he's a chronic abuser or anything, but he throws scary tantrums and shit gets thrown around and it's very possible she was hurt in one of those incidents and that's what they're discussing here.

I'm a woman who attended a women's college and this double standard bothered me so much ----- female abusers are the hardest to bring to justice because they hide under the pretence of female weakness ---- and put down male victims and shut them up. I don't understand why people can't understand that both genders are capable of being abusers, and both are capable of being victims --- and Johnny Depp was the victim for sure, Amber Heard is horrible",2020-02-07T05:19:05Z,6

I know, because I lived it.
And it is a very *very* twisted and fucked up place to be in.
This is a societal problem... and it needs to be fixed.
I've also had friends deal with this...
Imagine a 6'-4"", very rough sort of man... standing there while his 4'-11"" psycho wife literally mauls him... as tears run down his face... and she humiliates him for crying and mauls him even more because his tears make her angry?
I witnessed that myself... even gave a statement... with two other witnesses... and *still* she got custody of their kids... *he* had to leave their home... *he* wound up going to a correctional facility because she told police and court that he threatened her (which he never did) about 5 months later.
This sort of shit is happening everyday... to many men... and no one gives a shit... because men have to just ""suck it up""
and men are never believed... and even with proof... society's mentality is (yeh but... he's a big guy... he wasn;t hurt)
Yep, many many cruel and vile women out there... but society is even crueler and... much more vile.",2020-02-07T04:49:52Z,9

If they did that, you'd run for the hills stat. They'll be the most charming people you ever met, you'll think it's unreal how wonderful they are. Add on beauty like Amber's, and you'll be roped in easy. 

They won't show themselves right away. They'll slowly reveal themselves to you. Then sucker you back in with gestures and words. It's a push and pull, slowly climbing and becoming more aggressive, adding in bits of projection and blame onto you, gaslighting and all, making you feel like _you_ were wrong too, until you don't know what is real and what isn't. Until you find yourself accepting a certain level of abusive tendencies because you've been tricked into believing you're being too sensitive or you brought it onto yourself.

And because they'll balance it with the high of being with them, the way they will rope you in with pretty words, promises and grand gestures to overshadow the bad. Then the abuse starts again. It's a cycle. That's how abusers work. And when you're sweet natured like Johnny, you may end up taking it longer because you want to believe the best in them, that what you had from the start, that beautiful, whirlwind of a romance that made you feel like you were on top of the world, like you were the luckiest person on Earth, could be that way again, if you only just work _hard_ enough...

I’m not defending that, just laying out why this happens. Just like when a child goes missing police always look at the parents - because 9/10 the parents were involved. The bias exists because the of overwhelming statistical evidence. Female on male abuse DOES happen and we certainly need to talk about it more, perhaps this case’s one silver lining is that we as a society can reckon with this.

Now when it comes to psychological aggression men are more like to be subject to it(it's only a difference of 0.4% though). There obviously is a problem of women falsely accusing men and men not reporting their own abuse, but I can't say how much of a difference that would make in the statistics as a whole.",2020-02-07T06:48:59Z,0

Even though you agree on other parts... you are still mentally conditioned to not go the full way.
Because you are not able to believe it to be true... because ""how could it be?""
There has been research done into this, which has found nearly half of all domestic violence situations are started by women, and half of that is women just saying there was violence when there was none... but still the man is considered guilty until he can prove his innocence before a judge/court.
Media and society have no interest in this end of things.
You can look into the research for yourself... I had to.
But until society begins to accept that this problem does exist, and *if* it finds an interest in resolving it... then *maybe* in about 100 years things will start to change... But I am not holding my breath.
Society and media will *always* find some way of making the woman out to be a victim one way or another... even when it is proven they are the aggressor 100%.

Amb=(She says there's no need to be cruel on top of it.) 
Dep=""I CAN'T BELIEVE IT, YOU'VE BEEN NOTHING BUT CRUEL, and I'M GOING to COURT with you."" 
[Me-I think he doesn't understand how she could be so cruel and still say she loves him. And the fact that they're going to court to get a divorce.I speculate it is because he LOVES her, showed her, told her, and everything in between.Yet it was never enough nothing ever would be. I believe divorce was the last thing THAT HE ever wanted]                                    Amb=(She yells im defending myself)  [Me-I believe she is yelling because she fears she is losing control]        
Depp=""Your DEFENDING yourself against ME, and something I DIDNT FUCKING DO. I'm NOT GOING to FIGHT WITH YOU because I KNOW this shit lasts forever"" [Me- EXACTLY IT'S LIKE TALKING TO A FUCKING WALL]       [Me-This was hard to listen to, it brought up old feelings for me. I had the exact same realization and said the exactly the same things. I loved you for so many fucking years but you know what? You DIDN'T exist. You DON'T exist. YOU'RE NOT THERE. You are a FUCKING MADE UP THING IN MY HEAD. I was 23 he was 33 when we married. I recently, finally got divorced at age 35. My EX husband talks, projects, deflects gaslights, lies and manipulates just like Amber *A.K.A  Queen of Projection* It's life shattering, devastating, and hard to come back from when you realize the person you FELL in LOVE with NEVER EXISTED, IT WAS ALL AN ACT. These types of people do not know how to SHOW LOVE or RECOGNIZE the FEELING of being LOVED. So they FAKE IT for you,until your hooked. Reality is no matter how hard we try to prove and show our love for them it will not matter.They'll NEVER BE SATISFIED. Amber, my EX and unfortunately many others DO NOT LOVE THEMSELVES. We can't teach them. No matter how much we want to. Trust me I KNOW from experience, I tried for 10 years. #JusticeforJohnnie.

I don't know how out of the loop you are, but LEFTISTS are destroying America (and the world) with their Politically Correct SJW nonsense, no fact-checking, outrage and cancel culture. It may seem like a conspiracy theory to you because you've been unaware of what's happening, but the evidence has been there for YEARS.

- Antifa
- BLM
- Feminists and their SlutWalk
- Milo Yiannopoulos being protested, banned, and hated against. His audience facing militant groups of activists preventing them from attending, or by being disruptive. 
- Cassie Jaye's Red Pill Documentary getting protested and backlash, review bombed. Her work labelled as hate and propaganda and therefore banned from screenings. Her audience facing militant groups of activists preventing them from attending, or by being disruptive. 
- Jordan Peterson being protested and hated against. Books banned. His audience facing militant groups of activists preventing them from attending, or by being disruptive. 

And similar things happening to Ben Shapiro, Steven Crowder, Candace Owens, Bettina Arndt, et al. All being repressed and attempted to be silenced by LEFTISTS. 

That doesn't include misandry in schools (especially with Title IX) resulting from left-leaning policies as revealed in Duke Lacrosse, the Mattress Girl case, Columbia University's Ben Fiebleman incident, Brian Banks, Malik St. Hilaire, et al.

And then there's false accusations taken as fact because ""believe women #MeToo"" regarding Brett Kavanaugh, Nick Sandmann of Covington, Vic Mignogna, Aziz Ansari, Neil DeGrasse Tyson, many other men, and of course Johnny Depp.

Leftists are fucking every country up. In Canada we have Justin Trudeau who preaches we should believe all women and vehemently chastises ""abusers""... until he gets accused of sexual misconduct to which he then states ""don't believe everything you hear. There are always two sides to every story.""

And leftists taking Donald Trump's ""if you're rich and famous they'll let you do anything"" quote out of context to smear and villify him.

Then there's Jussie Smollet and all the fake outrage he generated from his hoax. And Cardi B's non-punishment for ""being a strong woman who had to survive."" 

Not to mention how many of the persons listed have ALSO been lied and smeared, having their words and actions taken out of context by BLATANTLY left-leaning publications and persons, who always smear their targets as guilty before being proven innocent, and offering no apology or news coverage even after it's been proven the guilty party was actually innocent. 

Leftists destroying society isn't some bullshit political war propaganda: it's very real with a ton of evidence to support that claim. And I didn't even list every bullshit that spawned from leftists.",2020-02-08T18:47:33Z,0
