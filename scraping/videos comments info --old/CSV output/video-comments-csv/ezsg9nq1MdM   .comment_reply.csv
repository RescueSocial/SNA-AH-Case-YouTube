12,Ugxo2pFcPUyXCaUZOwt4AaABAg,guitarman0365,i just wonder if they will pull a thor and loki type deal..bring patrick back once and awhile as a semi pro/antagonist while he has less reason to hate aquaman now that he can no longer blame him for the mother's death they still saw things very differently so i have no doubt orm will be seen again. In fact Patrick is the best villain DC has at the moment so they would be mad not to reuse him later on. Manta was underwhelming. Steppenwolf was both underwhelming and defeated. Zod is dead.,2018-12-25T00:58:45Z,1

20,UgwqG6t2gGCaK4f5foZ4AaABAg,Grace Ade,She shoukd be. All of them should be because they are like different from the surface dwellers. Atleans like Queen Atllanna and Mera should even Vulko looks young. They are like amazonian in themyscira. They can be killed but they are almost like immortal. Plus the fact that during their film shooting Durector James Wan splash a real water to these actors whilst they were hanging in harness. As you know human skin texture change if they are always wet plus the visual effects so yes 3 of them should look young and thats how it should supposed to be at least in my opinion.,2018-12-21T02:28:24Z,2
