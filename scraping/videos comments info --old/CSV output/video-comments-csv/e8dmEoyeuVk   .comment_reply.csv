16,UgxBEN0eSR9_x62zryh4AaABAg,TeamAllGamersForever,"@Jlovedown McHoedown, even right now the corruption spreads. CNN lambasted Bernie over supposed claims of him telling Elizabeth Warren that a woman couldn't be President. They spread the narrative that when a woman claims anything, you should believe them. Tara Reade accuses Biden of sexually assaulting her. CNN hasn't said a word and it's almost common knowledge now that these accusations have been made.

 The whole framework needs to be burnt to the ground. Everything in America needs reframing. From how we talk to each other, conclude on ideas, treat each other and most definitely need to stop treating politics and the policies therein which make people's lives like it's a goddamn sport. George Washington said that having political parties will ruin us.

""However [political parties] may now and then answer popular ends, they are likely in the course of time and things, to become potent engines, by which cunning, ambitious, and unprincipled men will be enabled to subvert the power of the people and to usurp for themselves the reins of government, destroying afterwards the very engines which have lifted them to unjust dominion.""

EDITORIAL NOTES

Washington is warning the American people against the negative impact that opposing political parties could have on the country.¬† During his presidency he witnessed the rise of the Democratic-Republican party in opposition to the Federalists and worried that future political squabbles would undermine the concept of popular sovereignty in the United States.

17,UgxBEN0eSR9_x62zryh4AaABAg,TeamAllGamersForever,"@Jlovedown McHoedown, you've admitted to being brainwashed whether you realize it or not. You had shitty friends. Newsflash time! This happens to everyone everywhere and at all points of history. Cut the cancer out your life, which you have so kudos to you for that. These people manipulated you weren't SJWs. If they even went around labeling themselves as such, they're idiots and shitting on the legacy of Abraham Lincon who freed the slaves, Rosa Parks an actual feminist in America history, Bernie Sanders, MLK who preached about respecting individuality over championing prejudices and stereotypes, etc. I have family that call themselves feminists and do nothing but lie and steal to get their way. I've told them they make actual actvists that came before them and will come after that they make these actual heros look like shit and need to get their shit together. They won't, so I don't talk to them. I'm not going to comdemn Johnny Depp cause my family is ridiculous. I've done nothing but spread the word on how a criminal  named Amber Heard has infiltrated the feminist movement and brought it down to her level. She's absolutely evil. She lied about a lesbian Cop while being a lesbian herself. And if I were to listen to you, I'd now have to label all lesbians or all gays SJWs. Not happening.

I'll never be like what you currently are right now.ü§∑üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",2020-04-06T17:01:16Z,0

For the past year a voice actor was accused of sexual assault by a few women with no evidence what so ever. And anytime someone question them they would get bombarded with "" YOU SHOULD BELIEVE ALL WOMEN WHEN THEY SAY THEY BEEN ABUSED!!!! "". And so on and so fourth. The whole Believe Victims thing you know.... And acting like women never lie. Johnny Depp's case here is a perfect example that we shouldnt just believe people without evidence. Otherwise we could end up ruining an innocent person's life.",2020-04-11T13:52:26Z,1

29,UgwPsikb-QrDDANoO7F4AaABAg,Chris R,"Actually, I have to say, I think not, and I have a very, very good reason for thinking so.

See, Amber NEVER succeeded in any of her attempts to take legal actions against Johnny apart from her BS restraining order, which frankly means she didn't actually do any real harm to him directly, not even using the courts as her proxy as she tried.

Yet, still, she managed to do tens of millions of dollars worth in damages anyway. How did she do this? Through the court of public opinion. She stirred the pot with lies and deception, and the public responded, burying Depp's gig on Pirates of the Caribbean in the process.

Yes, it might be cathartic seeing her get fired, but at the end of the day, it pails in comparison because that job is worth a fraction of the one she cost Johnny, and even if the two were comparable, it just brings us full circle, right back to the root of the problem, and that problem is COURTS SHOULD BE AJUDICATING CRIMINAL TRIALS, NOT HR DEPARTMENTS.

If we didn't have a culture that was so damn happy to see people fired over meer accusations in the first place, she could have never done the degree of damage she did.

By celebrating her being fired, we are just perpetuating the problem that started it all, and no, there is no reason to celebrate her being fired. Why? Because if she goes to prison for her crimes, her employment gets rendered a moot issue anyway.

In fact, I wish she had not been fired. If she loses her job, I would hope it would be because she was too busy sitting handcuffed in a prison cell to work, not because some busy body decided the accusations against her were a bad fit for the company.

That's how it SHOULD BE, and if it was that way when it was Johnny on the chopping block, we would have had a much better outcome all around.

Quit trying to turn HR into a court of law.",2020-04-08T02:23:24Z,0
