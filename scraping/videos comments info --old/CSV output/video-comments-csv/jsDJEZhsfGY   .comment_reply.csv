0,UgxWLqSeoD7A3UkOvZd4AaABAg,Elvira Feher,"@Van A. Johnson She is amazing, isn't she.  Wearing heels with cut feet and as you said eyes popping out. Not to mention how good her nose looks, can't even tell it was broke and all without medical attention.  Wow what a fast healing wonder woman. Lol",2021-02-20T09:34:55Z,1
1,UgxWLqSeoD7A3UkOvZd4AaABAg,Van A. Johnson,"@Elvira Feher ScAmber had pretty feet until ""Johnny"" dragged them/legs/back/arms through glass. They're ruined as she never sought medical attention just like her broken nose, popped out eye etc.",2021-02-20T03:48:46Z,1

9,UgxgfBauzbwUZOyLwFl4AaABAg,Rock Candy,@PureSparkles22 don't quite agree on this - well i agree that bringing in drug abusers to your family  is bad.  Respect that you are just thinking about his family and are  team Depp.,2021-02-22T01:48:30Z,0
10,UgxgfBauzbwUZOyLwFl4AaABAg,PureSparkles22,"@Rock Candy that's no excuse or justification. I'm Team Depp but I'm not gonna hesitate to call out his faults. It was incredibly irresponsible to bring in a violent, drug abuser into his family )He and AMber were already broken up by late 2012 and was dating Rochelle Hathaway & Amber moved onto Marie de Villepin) Those are 2 things u should avoid (volatile drug abusers) bringing into ur family. Anyone with common sense would know that.",2021-02-22T01:01:16Z,1
11,UgxgfBauzbwUZOyLwFl4AaABAg,Rock Candy,He was just overwhelmed by her abuse.  He would never have intentionally hurt his children.  He was a victim from his childhood and not able to leave AH and protect his family and himself.  And i don't think he understood it was abuse - he thought she was volatile and he loved her and wanted her to be a part of his family - unfortunately.,2021-02-22T00:42:58Z,0

15,UgwIWiT6deaiPCSHGrB4AaABAg,Enna O' C,"Totally agree, how vindictive she is, she has made sure to mention ANYTHING that makes him unpopular like the nicknames he may have given her co stars if he was jealous, she made sure to let them all know and bringing his children into it! Lily rose was more damaged by that slime ballâ€™s IOâ€™s piece Iâ€™m sure",2021-02-19T17:52:17Z,3

22,UgwDjIdmmL-8WDHPwoB4AaABAg,EAprima,@Stevie J Raw I don't blame you at all. I would have been beyond pissed editing that let alone reading it. I would have scarred myself out of pure anger and fustraction. That demon barn witch queen turd drove me crazy with her waffle and her contradictions are so easy to spot.  This truly highlight that Nichol conspired against Depp.,2021-02-19T10:34:41Z,3
