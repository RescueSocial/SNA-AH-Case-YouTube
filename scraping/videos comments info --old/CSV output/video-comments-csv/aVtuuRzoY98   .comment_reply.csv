I actually didn't know who the actress playing Mera was until I was stuck following the DV case recently and at the time I never bothered to search who played Mera. It didn't feel like watching Black Widow in the Avengers or Wonder Woman in Justice League where I usually wait for the credits or google the casts. The Mera character or perhaps the acting itself wasn't as memorable as the female characters in most superhero/comic movies. Lets see if she's going to do better in Aquaman 2.",2020-09-02T06:46:34Z,0
