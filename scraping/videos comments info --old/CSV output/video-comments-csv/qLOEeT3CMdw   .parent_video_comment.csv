6,Ugw7y_HrCkrJaixGRM14AaABAg,"I wasn't gonna say anything but you brought it up. We as consumers have a lot of power but we never seem to organize enough to use it. Please watch the corporations that take the bail out money from Covid-19, any company that fires employees, does not cover medical costs, buys back their own stock....one word BOYCOTT!  If Heard is in this movie I won't see it and I hope the other actors are paid a flat scale and aren't profit sharing because I hate colteral damage but I don't think it'll kill any of them. Most of the CEO's of these corporations make Heard look like a decent human being, now that's saying a lot.  Please, please pay attention and take back the power, if a company sucks don't reward them with your money...they really think we're too stupid to get together and make a difference.

No matter how they complain they still go watch it giving studios millions of $. So, their opinions and complaints don't matter much.

16,UgwdWuldnWouLJSB7Pl4AaABAg,"Thanks for the update, its GREAT to see the petition come so far, but its STILL not good enuff if we want em to take us seriously, hence why they are only limiting her appearance rather than cutting her altogether. REALLY would like to see it get to 500K, coz dats a nice round figure, n HALF A MILLION sounds SO MUCH scarier than only 400K. 

The sad reality is, GOT was a worldwide thing...EVERYBODY who was ANYBODY was watching that...it was a BIG DEAL in TV history. Aquaman 2 on the other hand, well its JUST ANUTHA DC Superhero film, which yeah has a big foillowing, but sadly Aquaman is just no batman/superman lol

I know its been said time n time again, but just to beat the dead horse once again, but just to say I WONT be following this or ANY film that has Amber Heard in it",BIG Daddio John Bamford,0,2020-04-04T03:39:46Z

39,Ugw4wZLwYQAt0oZB6PN4AaABAg,It's true what Johnny Depp said in a interview on the radio. You no longer have movies that make a cultural impact. Johnny Depp: The Godfather will always be classic because of the cultural impact it made upon it's release.
