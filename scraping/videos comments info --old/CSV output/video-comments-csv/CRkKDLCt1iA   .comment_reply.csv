41,Ugw3K_4A9ZqfT5zNz4x4AaABAg,MGSBigBoss77,After CW's Crisis event there's suppose to be only one Earth now so maybe after their appearance together the JL sequel might want to adopt Grant Gustin's Flash as Erza's replacement in the DCEU sequels to Justice League and their own Flash movie. And Gustin shows up in JL2 and says things have change so let's just move on (referencing Iron-man 2's scene with James Rhodes' War Machine). Reckon if the situation with Erza Miller's that ugly in the public Warner Brothers might do something like that to make several changes some people are looking forwards to for any movies featuring the Flash! Yes i like Grant Gustin Flash moreso but i had no previous resentment towards Erza's Flash either though. And John Wesley Shipp was also my Flash from the 90's!

126,Ugw-SjCOelsHQ0vIGid4AaABAg,Aizen2468,"@Fuckth eChineseGovt ""sigh"" you are an absolute fool, and an angry one at that.  Literally every sign and piece of evidence points to this being an angry drunk assaulting another person, as well as common sense, but you just CANT accept that out of some blind fanboyism.  Calling others retards for believing multiple sources (even the bartender and other patrons who didn't agree with the girls for how pushy they were, all agreed he assaulted her and spat at them), as well as this taking place outside of a bar (hence drunken altercation), the background in the video proving it takes place at this bar, information that points to Ezra frequenting the place (which kinda shows the guy may be a tad bit of a lush), and the lack of comment from DC or Ezra several DAYS and DOZENS of articles from multiple news sources later stating he choked her to the ground and all of this happened.   Not only that, but the story is now moving PASSED whether or not it happened, but to the consequences of it, and STILL no statement from Ezra or DC.....

But nope, everyone is just reading too much into it and we're all just retards and you're the only ""sane"" person here XD must be nice to live in such a blind fanboyism bubble.  The angry reaction and blatant denial of all reason and evidence certainly fits with what is atypical for your kind.  Im blocking you now, I've presented tons of evidence that you haven't disproved ANY of (just stated 'you can't trust all those sources.....even though it's literally coming dozens upon dozens of areas, and DC and Ezra haven't made any statements yet.  I just KNOW he's innocent, cause Im a blind fanboy with no evidence to support he's innocent!  But who needs stuff like evidence when you're a blind fanboy anyways?  People who actually lean towards the evidence against MY opinions are just retards!"". 

Who really wants to argue with an idiot who thinks like that?  Noooo thank you, I'll openly admit doing internet war with blind fanboys who ignore evidence and pull out the ""retard"" line as their only defense is generally a person no one on Earth should argue with >< tell you what, I block you here.....but when Ezra is found to be either innocent or guilty.....then we can brag about it here, yeah?",2020-04-09T15:34:57Z,0
127,Ugw-SjCOelsHQ0vIGid4AaABAg,Aizen2468,"@Michael Fireheart Denial....is not just a river in Egypt...

Don't get me wrong, I ONE HUNDRED PERCENT agree that men get held to higher standards to women, and one screw up in the industry for a guy is enough to see him burried (whereas a woman can do just about anything and make infinite mistakes and just blame it on someone else or blame the fans/audience for failing her).   That being said though....Ezra's case is cut and dry, and you'd have to be pretty in denial to doubt it.

The case: Multiple eye Witness accounts state he was drunk and SHE wanted to play fight, but he, in his drunken stupor, took it seriously and grabbed her by the throat and began choking her to the ground, upon which her brother, the bartender, and several other patrons had to get involved (and all corroborated the same story).  As they pulled him off of her, Ezra spat on the bartender (and some reports of him spitting on others as well).  Police were called, and Ezra was made to leave the establishment.

Evidence: multiple eye witness accounts all corroborating the same story.  This is confirmed to have taken place right outside a bar that Ezra is known to frequent between the hours of 6:00 pm to 1:am many days (and if they have his hours down, that gives the impression he is there often).  Bartender told a none to flattering story of the fans that came in (one of which he would eventually choke) by stating they were ""very pushy"" and that Ezra appeared to not want to be around them.  And the bartender STILL corroborated the same story of him choking the one girl, and the bartender and several patrons (and the girls brother) having to pull him off of her, AND corroborated the same story that Ezra spat on him during this ordeal and that police had to be called.  

Extra concerning information: Ezra has not come out anywhere denying he assaulted that girl.  DC hasn't made any statements denying it, no one has.  BUT DC has made statements about considering dropping Ezra over this (which lends further credence that this is EXACTLY what people are stating it is....assault).

So you mean to tell me.....the video takes place outside a bar he frequents....that's proven fact....multiple parties (some of whom don't even like the other as they paint poor pictures of them) all corroborate the same story....that he was drunk and became aggressive....and there's a video of it.....and DC nor Ezra have denied it...and yet DC is speaking of dropping him this many days later....and you're stating people are reading too much into this?  You sure you're not trying to grasp for staws?",2020-04-09T07:34:49Z,5

Women participate in Domestic Violence just as much as a man. They just do not generally get in trouble for it. IMO if you start shit and get hit it's also your responsibility, it's not victim blaming it's common sense. Call the popo and leave. Or leave do not antagonize or push buttons than run for cover, that's what children do. Violence is never the answer but it is a solution in the moment to prevent yourself from harm. Context is key every scenario is different, a concept women ignore. It's always a man's fault even though you smack and corner and step up to a man. Stop doing that and guys if your gal is pulling this shit you need to cut her off and inform friends and family asap. Regardless of your passive nature she will make you the aggressor in a hipocritical fashion every time. I guess all men are toxic right? If women want equality than they need to understand if you hit you get hit that's how men live, so if you want to be treated like a man than that will be present. Not condoning violence just pointing out how ridiculous equality is when men and women are seriously biologicaly different. Strength and power are completely different which in true equality would create inequality. Let that sink in.",2020-04-20T17:58:49Z,0
