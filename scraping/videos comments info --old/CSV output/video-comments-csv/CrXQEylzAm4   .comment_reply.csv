10,UgyDid3zu2eEgM6AxJh4AaABAg,Rock Candy,@Green Greeneya Messing up a hotel room is not DV - unlike severing their finger or putting out a cigarette on their cheek due to the request of a post-nup.  I am biased - towards victims - regardless of gender.   The evidence part - is the part that Amber is missing and that Johnny has - in spades.  See the online LAPD bodycam footage.

31,UgyyW00HIDhWyuvJGDp4AaABAg,Shaun Bang,@AJ 1998 it could be possible that her scenes for the Knightmare scenes were already shot since I’m pretty sure they only needed Jared Leto and Ben Affleck back for the extra new footage. I doubt Snyder would have brought Amber back especially during the horrible crap she’s in for trying to frame Johnny Depp. I really hope karma gets to her cuz after hearing the recordings then seeing her flat out lie and try to paint Johnny as the instigator and violent one really upset me. She clearly is the psycho one that just wants to start fights and will go berserk just to rile Depp but the recordings were as clear as day that Depp is the one that tries to walk away and stop arguing but she kept trying to get a reaction out of him. Like she says in the film “let the Bass-terd come.” I’ll stab her with this for she did to Johnny lol horrible accent btw ugh so bad,2021-04-02T10:58:32Z,0
32,UgyyW00HIDhWyuvJGDp4AaABAg,AJ 1998,"Lol yeah just cast Emilia Clarke. Fan art of her as Mera is popular, she has better chemistry with Jason mamaoa and she has an actual British accent if they want to go there.
