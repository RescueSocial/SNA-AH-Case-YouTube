29,Ugzbp-DIUSQWGXV3rlN4AaABAg,Deb,I respect your opinion and I agree with how toxic AH is. All of this is a little heartbreaking we are right back to where we were before Me too. It was a great movement in the beginning it allowed women that had been assaulted and were being assaulted to come forward without fear. The only men that should have been concerned with mee too should have been the abusers. Like it or not there is a long history of powerful men abusing women in vulnerable positions. It's also shocking when the victim is victim shamed (and it's normally by other women.) Where do we go from here I wonder? AH has a lot to answer for,2021-02-07T08:36:36Z,0

41,UgwCSsMkc5bEJ0lLF-x4AaABAg,drawitoutlady,"@eHacker I hear you, and I agree this would help her. I‚Äôve been hoping she would do this. Having said that, it‚Äôs important that we look at the bigger picture. That 15-second action would have consequences that she may not have the energy to deal with. I imagine many celebrities (who appear to have quietly withdrawn support for AH) will not speak against her until all of the courts have made their decisions. It‚Äôs a fragile time right now, and every celebrity that speaks out has to think carefully about what kind of controversy they are getting involved in and whether they want that burden. Not every celebrity is going to read all the transcripts. 

I think ERW‚Äôs recent silence on AH speaks volumes, and unless she comes out and shows some kind of solidarity with AH, then I think it‚Äôs fair to assume she knows AH is problematic. Maybe in the future she will speak out against Heard for trying to co-opt her situation. I hope she does, but we should not expect anything from her. Her not supporting Heard at this very opportune time is enough.

42,UgwCSsMkc5bEJ0lLF-x4AaABAg,eHacker,I never said she has to speak against Amber. I said she has to take back her current support or she comes off like a hypocrite. It won‚Äôt take time at all? Huh? A quick tweet or mention in the next interview. 15 seconds?,2021-02-06T22:48:33Z,0
43,Ugwy0vcmvjmIq_1NkLJ4AaABAg,Susan Gavaghan,@Naomi Sherred I agree.  They both come across as too confident.  So I wait for any evidence.  I had a narcissist friend (at the time I wasn't aware that she was a narcissist).   She started chipping away at my confidence and eventually said something so terrible it left me feeling completely destroyed.  At this point I got rid of her.  It took some time for me to completely regain my confidence.  I learned about narcissists by accident and the more I looked into it I became aware that she fit the bill. i recognize AH as a narcissist.,2021-02-13T11:09:58Z,3
44,Ugwy0vcmvjmIq_1NkLJ4AaABAg,Naomi Sherred,I was abused by my ex husband and had police involvement and court cases (he ended up in prison)and managed to leave after 3 years of intense abuse but even all these years later I wouldn't be able to talk in front of cameras the way they do - tbh they come across as very aggressive and not the typical 'abused' persona - I'm still pretty shy now so I don't know - that's my opinion though...I just think that if they can be this confident in front of cameras they would be strong enough to go to the police but hey...soz for the rant!,2021-02-12T16:09:00Z,3

These days as soon as you don't jump on every metoo statement you're victim blaming, but come on, doesn't all this just look too convenient? MM&JD best friends, JD fights out a win so the other two good friends slam down MM which could work against JD just by association.

The fact that ERW only chose to seek legal action 11 years later and only after becoming friends with AH is suspicious. Whether ERW is lying or not, this still seems like AH has a definite agenda in befriending JD's friend's ex, who is now spear-heading a campaign to change the law that blocks her from seeking legal action against MM. So it all does look shady and cast doubt on the validity of ERW claims.",2021-02-06T16:57:25Z,8

111,UgwyorzhUeoBpPhInR54AaABAg,Stephanie Stogner,"@SheDevil I gave the story a chance. But the more I hear from them and the more they do, it becomes more and more suspect. One of them was caught in a lie and I read her text and she sounds like she is clingy and needy and he ghosted her for that reason. There were holes and issues with some of what I heard. Like the assistant gave very vague account and added things that didn't matter. There were numerous things. But I don't have time to write a book. But then when people start deleting posts and accounts ..idk. Add in when they try manipulate narratives by saying someone is threatening to post an underage photo making it sound like it a nude photo but turns out is neither underage nor in any way risqu√© or nude.. hm. Plus I heard the ex assistant bought his new CD, they've all been following him and liking his posts till they made the allegations public, and this coincides with both his new album release and him possibly being a witness for Depp. . Hm. Saying you aren't into BDSM when you were. Admitting you never said no or stop, said you liked it to him, and said again later you liked it.. Like why does he have more responsibility in this relationship? That's not how things are supposed to work.  Sounds like they wanted his approval and agreed to do things. Now that story changes. They keep talking about emails and texts and photos.. so there should be plenty of evidence. She also had a different abuser she doesn't talk about..which makes me wonder if that's the actual abuser and she is pinning it all on MM cause bigger splash. Hard to say. Im not saying he isn't abusive mind you but that these accounts have various issues with them.",2021-03-22T05:33:31Z,1
112,UgwyorzhUeoBpPhInR54AaABAg,SheDevil,@Meaghan Butler he is a dominant who is into BDSM so he really can't say he's never been abusive. But because it's part of what they are into it's not the same thing as straight up domestic violence. I'm not saying that EVR is lying or is not a victim. If she is a victim I will be behind her 100% as I am a survivor as well. All I am saying is the way it played out is just very suspicious. Ambers involvement in it makes me think it's part of Ambers attack on Johnny Depp. I need more information from a reliable source. Amber Heard is a self proclaimed liar.,2021-02-11T18:14:00Z,1

Manson was supposed to be at Johnny Depp trial as a witness in defense for him just days before this was dropped against Manson and I don't find any of this coincidental do you?,2021-02-10T15:38:00Z,2

You know the old one - got enough problems of my own- but this thing really hit a nerve(especially because it's become a trend lately even in my country), enough so that I've been reading about it really a lot and the more I read the more believable it sounds that it's staged.
And I hate the fact that I have the need to say such things about potential victims. I mean everything in me is against the very thought, but I can't allow myself to just blindly believe, you know?
And on the other hand it's really easy to believe MMs guilt on the surface. MM Is such a persona that he screams guilty by simple appearance. I even watched a video that honest to God convinced me lol but as soon as you dig a bit deeper it changes. But really, that's the media.

For me it's the timing. I would maybe pass two of them teaming up as just general support for the metoo thing in a sense that you never throw another woman screaming abuse under the bus, even if she's screaming it really loudly and with a bottle lol
But JD gets a hearing date and woah, suddenly the abuser has a name, after how many years? And ok, lets let that pass too. You've kicked him in the balls, he's down, cancelled and whatnot, but hey the story has taken off, lets add more things he did just to rub it in a bit.
