If someone is not at the correct physicality or conditioning, the actor goes to the gym as we have seen from many other actors who have played superheros, including Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman. It's also helpful to point out the unbalanced treatment of Heard vs Depp was due to Depp losing a major court case back in November 2nd with the judge siding with Heard and the Sun Newspaper and essentially stated that Depp was guilty of of domestic abuse in about a dozen of cases.

But I changed my mind when I watched the film, because I felt she at least got Betty's mannerisms right (and especially the laugh). I assume that was the reason she was chosen for the role, rather than anything physical. 

I can get changing a plan for a character because you found an actor or actress who you feel are perfect even if they don't fit the original plan (e.g. if I remember right, Idris Elba was chosen for Heimdall in the MCU because it was felt he brought the appropriate gravitas to the role, the Ben Affleck Daredevil film had Michael Duncan Clarke as an African-American version Kingpin because they thought he had both the appropriate bulk and acting skill to pull it off). 

But I also get why you might fire someone from a role because they no longer suit it. I mean, imagine if someone got hired to play Superman because he's ripped, but then shows up on set all flabby because couldn't be bothered to stay in shape during the lockdowns.",Muhao Ai,0,2021-02-28T22:41:52Z

I hope she loses the court cases, but is hired and fired for reasons completely unrelated to that, and considered by the public based on her talent (yeah, I know, that won't improve things much for her).

Emilia Clarke has a long history of HBO. They're going to want somebody that has great chemistry with Jason Momoa. Clarke again for almost the same reason. They are going to have to cast someone about the same age. Clarke again fits. They are going to want a fan favorite. Again clearly Clarke fits.
