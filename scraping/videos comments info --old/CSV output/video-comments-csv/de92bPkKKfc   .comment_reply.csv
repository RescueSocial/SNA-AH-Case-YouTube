Even if they try to put it on HBO its the other channels across the world that WB will need to pay and although WB are in denial a lot of other distributors won't be and they're probably going to want to see viewers support before shelling out millions. I was so excited about seeing aquaman 2 til WB announced turdie is in it again and I won't even watch the first again now even though I really loved it. I know its not the other cast and crews fault but after everything has come to light I can't support something that is basically supporting a liar and abuser. Plus everything I've seen of her that's not edited and she's just so nasty and mean. And I mean really nasty, like she's something way above the commoners beneath her. Like wtf...........? All she had was looks which are fading very quickly 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣",2021-07-17T06:12:33Z,0
