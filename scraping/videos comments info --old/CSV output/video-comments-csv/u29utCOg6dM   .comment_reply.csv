Michael Keaton and Christopher Reeve are still beloved 30 years after their movies have come out there's a reason for that. Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck will be forgotten.

38,Ugz1Gh0_5IuO8RWdQSd4AaABAg,BULLETSCARER22,"@POPculture But thing is, he did screw himself. And you don't know what's going on either lol. Ray screwed his chances by throwing Hamada under the bus over nothing, and is constantly attacking WB. Lemme ask you this, cuz I don't want to talk about Ray, cuz that's not what this is about. I honestly shouldn't have brought him up, that's on me lol.


My question for you is, if you were with WB, would you wanna bring Ray back? He may have been good in the Snyder Cut (idk if he was or wasn't, I can't watch the Snyder Cut), ik he was good in the theatrical cut, but this isn't about his acting ability, I'm asking about him as a person and you hypothetically if you were a head of WB, would you bring him back? Would you wanna bring back someone who will just accuse you over nothing. Like, Hamada had nothing to do with Justice League, yet he keeps getting roped into it by Ray. Whatever. Back to the point lol.

The point is, I would've liked to see a Batman solo movie with Affleck, I mean, from the stuff that's come out about it, holy crap, that would've been awesome. I mean, who wouldn't wanna see Batman in live action potentially heading to Arkham Asylum and fighting Deathstroke? That just sounds awesome.",2021-06-21T21:28:46Z,0

People tend to forget that Batman v Superman didn't do as well as warner bros had hoped.   Yeah it made money, but not as much money as they were expecting.    Justice league was an outright flop, and both mos and bvs were very divisive films among fans.   Therefore can you really blame warner bros for wanting to move on from them?   I loved man of steel too and I'll go on record right now that Henry Cavill is a great superman.   Maybe not so much Clark Kent but he's a great superman.   However that doesn't change the fact that every dceu movie he's done were either very divisive among fans, or in the case of justice league, just an outright flop.    

Heck there's a lot of sequels I'd love to see but I know they'll never happen.   But do you see me crying about it?   No because these are just movies at the end of the day.   Not sacred texts..",2021-06-21T18:32:13Z,0
