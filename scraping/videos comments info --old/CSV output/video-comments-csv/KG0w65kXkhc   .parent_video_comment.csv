That if they get Amber Heard off Aquaman 2 as Mera, the ideal actress to replace her would be Deborah Ann Woll, now that the Daredevil series was canceled, they should pick her for Mera's character, I think she would be perfect. Don't you think so?",Erik Garcia,0,2020-04-14T06:34:03Z

One single source gives an official Warner Brothers statement, THEN gives a L'Oreal Paris official statement, then gives an official statement of what Ms. Heard's lawyers are going to do. Who at Warner Brothers can make an official statement for L'Oreal? Who at L'Oreal knows what Ms. Heard's lawyers are doing. This source has to be Ms. Heard herself. The statement is full of her usual lies. L'Oreal runs it's own social media site. Ms. Heard could not settle with Mr. Depp even if she wanted to, because Mr. Depp is the PLAINTIFF. ONLY the plaintiff can settle. If Ms. Heard had any viable evidence she would have used it in the original case against Mr. Depp. Instead, she dropped the case, which allowed the Judge to DISMISS the case WITH PREJUDICE, which means Ms. Heard LOST, and the case was found to be egregiously flawed, and without merit. As a result, Ms. Heard can NEVER bring the domestic abuse case against Mr. Depp again. (You can find verification of this, and a link to the legal documents at TMZ). There IS much more to these legal allegations, there will be about eleven charges brought against Ms. Heard and her co-conspirators for attempting to frame Mr. Depp for domestic abuse.",NIBS,1,2020-03-06T02:54:20Z

Ironically i think the first group of people are the ones who actually spend money for these types of films. Guess we'll wait and see.

Luckily the choice is easy for me. The first movie sucked, so I don't need much more incentive to stay away from the next one. At least insofar as to make the effort to see it in the cinema. They can cast as many trashy, lying skanks as they want. Everyone knows the hypocrisy of the situation. Hollywood and the media are willingly complicit. And no matter how hard you try to point it out, nothing will change. Johnny Depp needs to sue her ass and hope to god he gets a conservative judge.",Michael Knight,3,2020-02-28T06:40:20Z
