Here is amber's own words exonerating Johnny while she puts him down.
Amber: ""You can't run away EVERY fight! You can't -It's easy (to run). It's not strong. it's not brave.""
I'll add some more:
Amber:"" You want to make it easy on you so you split (leave).  You DON'T FIGHT!""

141,UgxBA9jX7g5kahx2zL54AaABAg,Taste The Rainbow,"You are correct - When Johnny leaves, he takes the power from this girl. She sees that as him not caring about her that she is not worth it because she has a low self esteem. She is probably very needy and smothering and has to have Johnny saying and showing how much he lovers her every minute. She has to always be in control and I bet Johnny felt like he had to entertain her at all times. I imagine she has an explosive temper and reacts and start yelling immediately so fast she does not even see it. Johnny would be like why are you yelling, and she would yell I am not yelling!!! And then say - ohh yea it’s always my fault. She argues like you always, or never, you don’t love me, you don’t care about how I feel, it’s always about you. You do not take the time to even talk to me - that is because Johnny already knows exactly how it’s going to go because he has been through it so many times.  She believes she it totally justified acting the way she does because she loves him so much. I bet money her father was extremely loud and rude and ruled the house with an iron fist, probably even hit her, her mom, talked loud rude and put everyone down all the time. I bet she also believes that she is pretty, and thinks she would do anything for other people and has a kind heart - she can not control her emotions or even tries to hide them. If someone says something she does not like you can see it on her face immediately. I bet she gets upset and yells if she can not find something like a hairbrush or phone and demands everyone help her find it immediately!!! Because it is their fault she can not find it. Basically she is a bitch and might even be proud of it but deep down wishes she was not. I could be wrong.",2021-03-10T15:48:27Z,1

As for myself, well... lets just say that being willing to get evaluated led to a diagnosis of Bi-Polar type 1.  Now I see the light.  I was the abuser after all. Now I'm medicated and stable.  I honestly didn't know I was being abusive but, I took the red pill and now I know.  Moving forward with meds and counseling, I'm a very nice guy now. So, yer ex-boyfriend wouldn't let you leave and you feel as though there is no escape... I can't speak for him but, I used to do that, and I can say with certainty... He's literally in a state of acute psychosis.  He most likely thinks he's right and doesn't see his behavior is unacceptable and unreasonable. I'd say more but I'm not qualified.

In this case I assume amber was after Johnny's cash and notoriety from the beginning. I imagine it wasn't hard to play the woman in love when she truly loved something that Depp has.  When they got married I believe she decided to abuse the man as she went along and then blame him for all of her crimes when she filed for divorce. That way she could get a hefty settlement and her survival story would grant her more popularity and access to more prestigious roles in the industry.

368,Ugy72ACRzYOa5ZReZXt4AaABAg,tDf,"@Lauren Kelly very well said! Absolutely agree with everything you put in your comment! Her behaviour and everything she has said and done are exactly the reason that so many people who genuinely have been put through total hell at the hands of another person, be it a random violent rape or attack, be it domestic abuse, whatever, never get the justice they genuinely deserve and because of this, the perpetrators never get the consequences they absolutely deserve. They have the strength and courage, while no doubt terrified, to report it to the police. Although the right thing to do, they may not be believed, or have enough evidence to be able to prove what happened. They may be almost made responsible; you were drunk, in a short skirt, he walked you home, you went back to his (or hers)??? Well, what do you expect to happen???
It's bad enough, without people that are apparently high profile, (tbh, although I'm well aware of Johnny Dep, I had never heard of Amber, or seen anything that she's ever been in. Judging by the state of her acting skills, I have no intention of watching anything she's ever been in!!) using the role of being a poor innocent victim, which despite her apparent privileged life, I may be wrong but I get the impression that she has been playing the victim role for a very, very long time and has used it over and over again to manipulate every person and situation in order to get her own way and doesn't give a shit about who she destroys in the process. She is a disgrace, as is every single person that has ever enabled her to continue to behave this way. I really hope that the court will see through her shite, and that Johnny Dep and his career are not completely trashed by her and this whole situation. Shame on her, and I am really hoping that karma really is a bitch!! Sorry, not quite sure where that rant came from, I was only planning on agreeing with you!

(And Domestic abuse is something that, by the age of 50+, he would definitely have shown a proclivity for by now with a clear pattern of abuse) but not only is there nothing in his history of Domestic violence, his Ex's have all come forward to vouch for him and his non-violent nature! If at the age of almost 60 he has not ever shown the remotest sign of being a ""woman-beater"" and in fact, has all of his ex-gf's coming out to defend him...well I think it's safe to give him the benefit of doubt in regards to Amber's very suspect claims.

404,UgynUqrbl_8pfZZelY54AaABAg,Erik Jarandson,"She undoubtedly has strong traits of both antisocial and narcissistic personality disorder. Whether it's enough to set a diagnosis... I'd bet 'yes', if she was about to be examined for it and anyone would take my bet.

People like this lie often, and without moral qualms. This does make them better and more practiced liars than they would otherwise be. However, it doesn't make them more intelligent, meaning that they can still get confused and be trapped in contradictions. They also have the handicap that they often don't understand normal emotional reactions, and might end up making peculiar claims, either because they don't know what a normal person would say, or because they don't know how normal people will react to what they say. Finally, and most importantly in the context of a legal deposition, they're not immune to fear and stress about losing control of a situation. They can remain calm in situations where someone else is in trouble, and are often calm even when their own safety is at risk, but the absolutely hate losing control.

A highly intelligent person with antisocial or narcissistic personality disorder will almost always be a very skilled liar. Less intelligent ones will be surprisingly skilled in some situations, and surprisingly unskilled in others.

450,UgyVouGFOLDcYsmI4E14AaABAg,Earl Grey,"cassl14 it seems to me that u see celebs as these entirely different species. You constantly distance yourself from them and (by your words) it almost feels like you don’t regard them as normal human beings. At the end of the day, celebrities, actors, actresses, influencers and any other person working in the entertainment industry doesn’t really own you anything. Sure it would such a wonderful if they used their wealth and success to help less fortunate people and the thing is they DO majority of the time. You search up any A list celebrity and I guarantee you they have probably donated a sum of money to a honourable cause or/and have used their platform to bring light to issues that need awareness in the time they have been in the limelight. I know a lot of people like yourself who have this vehement hate towards celebrities and I’m not here to invalidate your feelings or your own opinions that you can 100% have. I just want to kinda remind you, that at the end of the day, the people that you see on these big budget movies, on tv shows, on the red carpet, in interviews right here on YouTube- they are just humans like yourself, they aren’t very much different from you and I, the fame and money are things that they have usually earned and had to work for (whether you believe they worked hard enough is subjective at the end of the day). I’m not sure WHY people dislike celebs, I’m not sure why people always expect they to ‘down to earth’ ‘quirky’, let them be whoever the hell they like and if you don’t like them, then just think about all the people you have met in your lifetime that you’ve disliked. It isn’t much different.

Btw sorry if I came of as pissed, I just feel like people always pressure actresses (never actors because tbh most people don’t give a fuck what the actors like as long as he isn’t a dick) into having the personality that THEY want them to have. Like you said, you’d rather support an actresses that you find less arrogant and show offy right? And if they aren’t like and the complete opposite, you automatically dislike them and disregard them as just another annoying women that’s in the film industry. What I’m saying is, let the actresses act the way she likes because half of the time, she’s isn’t being entirely unlikeable or awfully rude, she’s just different from what you would perceive as likeable. It’s always subjective eg, some people see Jennifer Lawrence as ‘trying to hard to be down to earth’ and then actress like Kirsten Stewart ‘as rude and antisocial’",2020-09-10T17:19:34Z,3

I know of a few age gap relationships where the couples have been more suited than some where both partners are similar in age to one another. Even I like a guy who’s about 18 years older than me and a big reason I like him is because of how similar we are. My feelings for him are different to how I would feel with a crush on someone like JD. There have been attractive guys I’ve fancied. But I don’t feel a connection to those guys.

Plus in the audio recordings she literally says he runs away from every fight they have. He removes himself from the situation. She tries to chase him down and keep it going.

506,UgzH8FC_1NF1gOWQPIh4AaABAg,Christian Boulay,"@Esteban Ortega Jumping to conclusions tin-foil hat wearing, crackajack? It isn't exactly called for, is it? Does it make you feel better? More knowledgeable? More powerful? You can just try to intimidate anyone, as you don't happen to agree with their view? And therefore I am suddenly to you, some old friend you once knew? And we behave like we know each other? With all due respect, but who do you think you ARE? 

I lived and travelled the world, acquired an extensive education. And yourself? What have you got? An empty bank balance and a growing debt? Isn't something I'd be happy about though. Let me guess you've managed to leave school early, and somehow it's made you the person you are? And, you wouldn't have it any other way? Maybe try to prove to me exactly? What?! You're good at name calling? What did I do to you personally? Did I attack your character, your family perhaps, your existence? Did I leave a dislike to your message? Was I uncourteous? No, clearly I did not! However if that's how you want to embark, I'm fine with it dear Sir. I'm fine with that. You lack an etiquette. That is rather, obvious. Your low income, low educated life hadn't served you well at all. Has it? Infact, switch your devices off and go back to education. Hear schools will reopen.

And for your insolence, it was a ""TESLA"" car, publicity stunt. The tires on the car have a heat tolerance. Tires would burst, due to extreme pressure system. (Remember space is a pressure system i.e. vacuum) During the live feed there was a 1.73 second fault, as the cameras disconnected from a VIRTUAL reality program and showed the car to be held on a dark platform inside a studio chamber, with the foreground being nothing but a switched off large panel display. Switched off screen was then back on, and television screen projection of Computer Generated Earth. I was actually watching the live stream and amazed the human advancement of science. Until the mishap revealed it was a hoax. Nothing more. The reason, Elon Musk said ""Looks so fake! It must be real!."" He knew they were potentially getting caught out, however the public aren't honest. And want to believe a fantasy. Elon knew very well it was a stunt, a planned deception. It's nothing more than a pshyop.

 Take that as you may, you'll undoubtedly come back with more drivel about a car being observable in space this very moment. I heard you can buy plots of land on the Moon 🌒, if you're interested? They are looking for unfortunate victims, in next phoney scheme. You appear to be a good candidate. I am fortunately not a, ""Low Life"". Just throwing a little bit of your treatment, your way. With that said. I do hope you & family are safe and well in these trying most difficult times. (I won't reply back, to your next premise.

Next  thing I knew, she was  telling me that I was abusive. Then the story of how badly I abused her was the hot topic in my family. One of my aunts told me I was a horrible person.
I have never told anyone about the abuse. I was dependent on the abuser and I was ashamed of my situation. I never defended myself against her accusations.. The ease with which she turned the story around and made me the abuser, left me stunned and humiliated.
Johnny Depp is going through this very same situation before a global audience. I physically hurt for him.
The pain I feel, when I watch this woman lie and lie and lie, is visceral. So is the anger and the shame and the grief. 
The difference between this woman and a real survivor, is the  shame and the grief. The humiliation of realizing that you had become so isolated that not one person, cared enough about you to see what was actually happening.
Amber has never lived with abuse. She can't act it, because she has no idea how it feels. She's bored and contemptuous and she is no   DV survivor. Her behaviour has abuser written all over it.",2020-12-26T04:32:54Z,1

I've dealt with situations like these, and eventually you learn that the best thing for the abuser is for you to lose control and escalate the confrontation, because then you will be clouded by anger and emotions, instead of sustaining rational arguments. The abuser knows that through a rational perspective, they're obviously in the wrong, so the only way for them to dominate the argument is for you to let emotions cloud your judgement.
The fact that he kept his cool and calm means he is more than used to deal with situations like these, and knows that's the best thing he can do.

On the third day he rose from dead and offers the gift of salvation and forgiveness to those that repent and trust in him. This is the Gospel which means the Good News.

John 1:1-3,10 KJV

For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: [9] Not of works, lest any man should boast.

825,UgwoHNZ3zojl_RiGvE14AaABAg,Nicole Owens,"@Nims thank you so much. It's really hard not to carry that around with you, I definitely still blame myself a lot of days, that's the unfortunate thing about the abuse, they don't just attack your body.. The mind is a very difficult think to predict or understand, but because a lot of people don't understand it, they project what they THINK they might have done, not realizing that even if they're right, everyone has different make-ups, triggers, experiences, genes, upbringings, etc. I think it prevents a lot of healing to happen, for the people involved, and for our sense of empathy all around in the world. If we could be more understanding of each other's weaknesses and trauma, even if it isn't our own, even if it seems to be self-inflicted (abuse victims, addicts, diabetics, and so on), we would have so much less fighting, so much more working together on solutions. Thank you for being one of those people going in the direction of understanding. I was scared to share it here but you guys were so nice about it. I hope that I helped someone, especially OP, see another side of things, not because I'm right and they're wrong, but because there are more options than one and that's important to know. Compassion may not be able to heal PTSD, but it certainly makes me feel a little less alone and crazy for having been through it. Thank you again, truly.",2020-08-02T16:59:09Z,0

828,UgwoHNZ3zojl_RiGvE14AaABAg,Nicole Owens,"@ALCzysz17 I am, thank you. I replied above to all 3 of you but I don't disagree with you, I was just pointing out that it wasn't always the case that mimicking the abuser's actions in this case doesn't in itself indicate lying, that's all. She's definitely lying, I just don't think that is the best example of why it's so..",2020-08-02T16:49:38Z,1
829,UgwoHNZ3zojl_RiGvE14AaABAg,Nicole Owens,"Wow I didn't expect such supportive comments, thank you. I've had a lot of invalidation with my abuse, especially from him, which is probably why I may have reacted a little emotionally here, it's still a sensitive topic for me even a few years later. I get what you all are saying and I agree 100%. This woman is clearly lying. 5 years later and I still break down sometimes for seemingly no reason, I certainly couldn't sit in front of all of these people without being emotional. In fact, twice I dropped the assault and battery charges against him just to NOT testify like this. You're terrified of the person when they're truly abusing you, speaking publicly against them for a lot of people (not all, because again, trauma isn't one size fits all) would cause extreme distress. I was afraid to even go home after the hospital, after his assaults, because abusers tend to get angry when you ""make"" them hit you. They usually have so much control over your life that them being upset could jeopardize your freedom, your ability to eat, the safety of your kids, even your safety and life. Even after leaving, that fear is very real, you've already been conditioned to submit to them, you already feel broken, guilty, ashamed, and they usually convince you you're entirely unlovable, untrustworthy, unforgivable, and that is very hard to unlearn, I'm still trying.. She does seem way too comfortable in that chair, eating, no apparent distress. My point is, I agree, I was just pointing out that I don't think the mimicking of the hair-pulling was indicative of lying, I just thought it might help to share that with people who maybe haven't been on the receiving end and so maybe don't know it could work that way. Everything else about her body language shows she is lying, but that specifically, is all I take issue with. Again, seriously, thank you for your kind words. I don't want to play the victim, but it really is a painful situation that a lot of people don't really understand, or even blame me for. It's actually a lot of comfort just to have people understand. Thank you..",2020-08-02T16:47:33Z,3

945,UgyESby44zk0QGo3LU14AaABAg,Luke Buddy,"There are people in the comment section who still refuse to believe that Amber Heard is the sole abuser, and she and Depp abused each other. They said because ‘Depp admitted to headbutted her’ and a text message from Stephen Deuters (who work for Depp and present at the ‘Boston plane incident 2014’) to Amber that said that when he (Stephen) told Johnny that he kicked Amber, Johnny cried afterwards. I will counter that claims.


If you follow the court transcripts, those things above were brought to the trial and we heard what were actually happened and how Amber contradicted herself. The headbutt was accidental, happened when Amber was attacking Johnny and he tried to stop her hand motions and accidentally bumping head during the process.

Now, Amber claimed that she suffered the headbutt as part of series of violent assault during 15 December 2015. She said that besides the headbutt, Johnny caused her bloody, broken nose, split her lip, gave her black eyes, pulled part of her hair off (it was ‘pusey’ after several hours she said) while she provided a picture of chucks of blonde hair without any roots.

But there are no medical record about this despite her being an actress thus facial appearance is her money maker. And guess what, she attended James Corden Show the next day (you can YouTube the interview, the one about her and her ‘ballet claws’) without any injuries, not even a swollen face. She said it was a makeup magic but no makeup can covered broken nose, swollen face and split lip without intensive procedure that basically alter someone’s face.

I think this is actually help Johnny’s integrity because he actually admitted things that happened even if it could be twisted against him, but Amber lied, lied, lied and making things up.


About the ‘kicking’ text, Stephen Deuters actually defended Depp in court. At the plane during the incident, Amber get off of her seat and Johnny made a playful kicking motion without actually touch her. Amber caught this motion with her eyes and scream bloody murder. She tried to gaslight people who were present that Johnny kicked her and caused commotion. So, Johnny walked off to the bathroom and sleep there. Stephen admitted that when he had the text conversation with Amber, he just played along and agreed that Johnny kicked her to not angered her so she stopped bothering him.

Of course, Amber couldn’t help it, she embellished the story about the kicking. She said how tormented she was, how Johnny violently attacked her, how Johnny threw ice cubes at her and kicked the plane seat off (it ‘‘swivelled round”, with one kick) to her. Which she never mentioned in those text messages, and sounds very ridiculous because plane seats are bolted down. So, did Johnny kicked her directly or kicked a chair to her? She couldn’t stick to a story.

If you read the court transcripts, don’t be surprised if Amber basically created some fiction to the point is sounded like Hollywood movie script. She also always exaggerated Johnny’s physique, called him twice her size, ‘big man’, even though Depp known for not being a big or tall man. He never bulked up for a role and doesn’t played a brute in action movies either because he doesn’t look the part nor believable. And if you see their picture together, Amber almost as tall and (sometimes) close to his weight, without heels.

Depp apparently have superhuman strength, according to her. He can broke a bed frame by the pressure of his boot, broke a door, kick a bolted down plane chair off with a single kick, dragged her by hair for hours to various rooms, able to pull her hair so hard they weren’t pulled out to the roots but broke in the middle of length, etc.

*She’s lunatic.*

​ @Monique H  
_""There are text messages from him saying he is a savage, saying ""let's burn and drown her and f- her dead corpse.""_

He was venting to his friend after years of abuse and almost losing part of his finger (and almost died of infection). He earned it. What about Amber discussed with her friend about wanting stab Johnny too and actually her friend (who also lived rent-free in JD's penthouse) provided knife pictures from his own collection? How about her who was ACTUALLY abusing him?

_""Despite all the videos of him smashing things up, all the pictures of her apartment smashed up, her injuries, his bodyguards proven to lie under oath, audios, text messages, you still can't see it._ _Why don't you educate yourself on this case instead of victimizing this woman like every other Depp fanboy who can't face the evidence so calls her an evil liar._ _SHAME._ _SHAME._ _SHAME.""_

Do you watched the full 'kitchen fight' video and not the edited TMZ one? She was setting him up, provoking him while trying to sound innocent and left her after realized he was secretly recorded (unlike the edited version when all went black and people insinuated that he beat her up after). She even chuckled, smirked, and was following until he disappeared from the room. No injury on her face, BTW.

His bodyguards proven to lie under oath? In what world? Their claims actually matched audio evidence, Johnny's and other witnesses' statements. Amber's friends and sister actually who were contradicted with each other and changing details and dates. You can see the court transcripts. Amber even claimed that professional medics are lying and LAPD officers also lying.

The pictures of her apartment smashed up? You mean spilled wine, picture frames stacked together on the ground and clothes hanger racks overturned? Police officers who went to the place claimed that there are no destruction, no injuries on her face at all. Her injuries? You mean minor bruises that somehow were mysteriously moving places often? And appear and disappear without explanations? Without ANY swelling at all?

I will say it the way you say it, then, *the evidence called her an evil liar.* *SHAME.* *SHAME.* *SHAME.*

God Almighty, the Creator was manifest in the flesh. He came into the world to take away the sin of the world. He gave up his own life to save yours. His sacrifice on the cross paid the price for your redemption with his own blood. On the third day he rose from dead and offers the gift of salvation and forgiveness to those that repent and trust in him. This is the Gospel which means the Good News.

John 1:1-3,10 KJV
In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. [2] The same was in the beginning with God. [3] All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made. [10] He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.

Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.
