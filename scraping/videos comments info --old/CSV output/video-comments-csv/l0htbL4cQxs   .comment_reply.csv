I guess I do.
I also liked this movie called Knock Knock with Keanu Reeves. 

He lets 2 girls in his home that where looking for shelter from bad weather. Being the good-hearted husband character. And then these 2 girls practically ruin his life, a bit like AH was doing but then on a much shorter time scale.

Many people dislike the movie. 
However, I thought it was quite interesting. 
(Imagining that something like that could actually happen to someone in real life scares me.)

As now thinking back to it, reading the news about JD and AH, it's not as improbable as it seems...

I think JD starring in this kind of movie would make this movie so real, as he has experienced something like that himself. He'd be able to show a lot of emotion and most likely impeccable acting that we are used from him.

Although I'm not sure if he'd ever want to relive this part of his life through a movie again.",2021-01-21T10:45:54Z,0
