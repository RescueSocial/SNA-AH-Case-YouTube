12,UgwUXqrMJg_4L2sMm3V4AaABAg,Actually let the left remember another one of their great heroes. Neville Chamberlain. The british PM that churchill replaced after he had churchill thrown out of parliament for being a warmonger and signing an infamous peace treaty w the dictator of germany. That's what happens to a left idea. And history repeats itself. Over and over. Churchill worked to his dying day to tirelessly remind everyone of Chamberlain's genius by slamming him in every book he ever wrote.

15,UgxfIy1xIbV2lxHDVJl4AaABAg,What I can see WB doing is doing Aquaman 2 without Mera in the film so they can avoid the fired / not fired issue until after the suit is over without having the suit interfere with the film. They can easily have Dianna Prince be the female partner in the film while still having it a Aquaman film just like what Marvel did for Thor Ragnorok having Bruce Banner/Hulk supporting him throughout the film but still focused on Thor. As for Johnny Depp in Pirates he isn't going to be the star if the film but there was talks he will have a supporting role which could mean flashbacks or even mentoring since they are rebooting the franchise but he will be in the film in some format. There has also been a rumor of a new female pirate filling the role as the main star instead of Johnny Depp but those rumors also never give any proof he wouldn't be in the film either.,WolfDShadow,0,2020-05-27T22:29:54Z

I dont understand why people fan girl over celebrities like they are some type of God. To me celebrities are just normal people or even worse because they let money get to them.

SHE very intentionally STAGED a falsification to benefit from ruining other person and his life - SHE had NO rest, NOR ease on him, HIS misery SHE accomplished was HER way of building HER life, once more - without addressing negativity,slurs in society, THAT SHE FABRICATED AND MILKED ANY GIVEN CHANCE (KNOWING VERY WELL THE TRUTH OF WHAT KIND OF PERSON HE ACTUALLY IS), not once did she ask those ''to calm down'', ''spare him'', called that ''too rough'' - the more blood she could drain out of him, the better her life came together. in her plan she literally didn't reserve any limits to her damage where to stop, she only calculated the benefit she can get out of it and any still undamaged aspect left in his life meant the resource she could still drain, meaning her life still had ways to get better - the happy days of heard.
she has ''hard'' time? ...for something she DID. how come it's ''hard'' for her, like ''hard'' to comprehend? sounds like ''she is not ''strong'' enough'' TO FACE consequences and REALITY, like it's THE ''shocking'' part, something no one ''warned'' her about to exist. 

she's ''suffering'', going through ''hard time'', ''too weak'', ''under pressure from negativity'', ''fragile'', has ''so much to loose''? ROFL, ROFL, ROFL - society has ''to spare and guard'' mental and physical comfort of someone whose zen best reality and perfect day consists of intentionally brought on destruction to other person, being fully at ease and peaceful harmony seeing him suffer, being trashed, hated and loosing everything, fading away from his life, without a fear or sympathy to what she's done, like she goes about it as any other regular day, but consequences and responsibility is the ''discomfort'' part, that she should be ''sheltered'' from, because THAT'S what ''hard'' for her and THAT'S the ''stress'' part?

Johnny (if i remember correctly) was fired from Disney just on the allegation of abuse. While that isn't right, i don't think it would have been any more so if Amber was fired just on allegation. Its better if she is fired (and charged) when undisputable evidence is brought to light (which it was). So calling for her release before all of that doesn't feel like it would have really solved the major issue (Which is sexism in the courts/Hollywood)

Studios, of course, are not bound to wait until the courts decide, and we all know it was a dick move by Disney. In the case with Amber, if all of these are true, then its both logical and frustrating that they would only consider firing her because ""she may be put in jail during filming"" and not for 'face value moral reasons' that Disney apparently did when releasing Johnny.",lyianx,0,2020-05-11T16:47:02Z
