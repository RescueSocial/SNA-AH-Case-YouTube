 Then paid off Depp's attorney's to withhold the evidence of said affair (87 surviellance videos) causing Depp to have to sue his attorney's. Costing Depp $7 Mill.
 She DIDN'T give to charity.
 But Heard's #timesup attorney's HAPPEN to be paid by Elon Musk. As their #1 contributor, again, to keep his name out of the Defamation case as he was with her the night before she showed up in court with fake bruises. So he's an important witness in the case.",Julie Lea,21,2020-03-06T02:16:09Z

Elon Musk wouldn t say anything also because he started dating her when she was married with Johnny, the staff from the buildings where they lived together testified he was at her fpr a few nights in a week when Johnny was out of town touring with his band. I think Amber acussed Johnny at first in order to get some fortune from him, some money and the penthouse but after a while she realised that she could  promote herself more efficiently using mouvements like metoo and presenting herself as a victim. So it wasnt so much pathological behavior, she trashed Johnny s name in order to promote herself. Luckly she messed up with a person that has the evidence to fight her in the court. I cheer Johnny didnt let her get away with that, he is very loved as an actor and he has the power to change the society mindset in this regard.",Casuta Laurei - casuta cu bunatati,14,2020-03-06T02:09:54Z
109,UgxgdSMo226WNMn3Hv54AaABAg,"I'm a psychologist. People are USUALLY serial physical abusers & ALWAYS serial emotional abusers.
 Heard makes it clear on the tape she believes violence is a ""normal"" way of conflict resolution in a relationship. 
 Depp is intensely private, it took him 3 yrs to say anything about the abuse. It was affecting his kids, his career, & she was CONSTANTLY giving speeches making a career of how she was abused by him, to keep her name in the media.
 Since she already named him during the divorce, everyone knew she was talking about him.
 In 30 plus years Depp managed to keep quiet, in the news twice. 
 I don't think it's fair to say "" Elon doesn't like drama"" it insinuates Depp is OK with it.
 The man lived in France for as long as he could. Bought a French town so his kids could grow up not being photographed.
 And only moved back to the US so he wouldn't have to pay taxes in both countries. 
 He's probably the most intensely private actor in Hollywood.

162,UgyRCTq122aPjuJTphp4AaABAg,"This is all speculation, but to armchair the situation, I would say that it is highly likely that heard abused Elon Musk as well based on her past history of domestic abuse as well as the obvious injuries to Elon's face. Now, it is possible that he got those injuries in any number of ways, so I won't ever say without evidence that it was amber's doing, but from the pictures, the wounds do look like they come from being struck in the face. Additionally, if Elon and heard decided to stay together after breaking up to maintain appearances, it could have been to dissuade the public from speculation of domestic abuse and, given heard's obsession with her image and Musk's nonconfrontational and reserved nature, he might have gone along with it to avoid tabloids and drama. 

One thing that I believe is evident from the pictures of them together is that Musk was not happy being with her. The look on his face in all those pictures is not that of a happy man. Also, the way he is holding her hand looks very firm and begrudging, not relaxed as it would be if he actually wanted to hold her hand. He looks like he would rather be anywhere else with anyone else in all those pictures. None of that is definitively indicative of domestic abuse and it could have just been an unhappy relationship, but I don't believe it can be ruled out.

Unfortunately, there is no actual evidence in these pictures and articles that would be admissible in court, but it is possible that evidence exists with Elon Musk that would help Johnny's case. I believe that it is ultimately up to Elon himself to insert himself in any of the ongoing legal cases, but that if he does have any sort of evidence, he should provide it in the interest of justice for himself as well as Johnny and all abused men",doctordetroit84,2,2020-03-05T23:37:29Z

173,UgylrbAnk2c1su3JyAR4AaABAg,"Elon Musk found love after Amber Heard so it's possible. There's hope Johnny Depp will heal eventually. If Bianca comes out with an abuse story I don't think Amber will recover. Dude, can you imagine three ex's with proof of abuse?




Off-topic, you should check out Darth News channel here on Youtube. He gave you a shoutout and he likes your Amber Heard content. He's also covering Amber Heard in a very humorous way. Love his channel, and yours.",Ariel Coffin,3,2020-03-05T23:21:53Z

178,Ugy2JZnKB2WpUD9Ji6R4AaABAg,"Amber Heard is a disgusting person. I don't think about what celebrities are doing in their personal lives, but just from the factual information coming out about her, she is a vile person and i dislike her personality. She deserves to be fired.",Nathan Nate,103,2020-03-05T23:13:31Z

180,UgzoND-OBuf4heeByQt4AaABAg,"There is so much evidence against Amber Heard, not sure how she is not outta here.  I saw another video that showed tweets from people  that worked with her or ran into her  at some point and they all said the same thing that she is manipulative and just a mean nasty person. even her own father says this to Johnny in the leaked text messages. He was on Johnny side.",Kicknowledge Smith,39,2020-03-05T23:11:21Z

182,UgyPcTPIlIqke4IGFgB4AaABAg,"This is a pathological self-victimizer on a level we've never seen in the spotlight. Study this. Elon is notoriously a non-confrontational personality type, I can 100% see how someone like Amber could walk all over this man in a relationship. Very similar to Depp it seems, in that sense. Is this a pattern of seeking non-aggressive partners for an abuser? If this is true with Musk (which its very likely) this woman needs psychological help NOW before she ends up damaging any other poor soul that falls for this devil in a dress. If a man had this kind of track record he'd be blacklisted immediately. But miss Amber is the type to never own up to her own failings unless everything is stripped away from her and she's forced to look her true self in the mirror. We can only hope comeuppance is on the horizon. That's what I'm most worried about, her not learning a single damn lesson and moving onto the next victim.",Chris HP Le,114,2020-03-05T23:10:10Z
183,UgxE5Bk4y_jO32cmuul4AaABAg,"She seems to be that person who will abuse anyone who wants to be in a relationship with her. History does repeat itself, so i don't get why ppl wants to be with her when you obviously will get abused by her, sooner or later",Liv G,62,2020-03-05T23:09:14Z

186,Ugx3CBiARUwW_jJgiWF4AaABAg,"If she did hit Elon Musk, then he has a moral duty to come forward and support Johnny Depp. When women are victims of abuse we're always told to come forward, else your silence will allow the abuser to carry on abusing. If people don't speak up, justice will never be done. She does look a bit guilty in those pictures, the way she's hanging her head and standing in a very submissive and girly way.",Victoria A Beeching,114,2020-03-05T22:59:49Z
