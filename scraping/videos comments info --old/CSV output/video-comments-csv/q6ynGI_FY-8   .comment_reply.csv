1. Get the judge to explain how ambers bruises disappear the next day, when multiple photographic evidence/witnesses testify that they saw her in close proximity with no makeup on, and you can‚Äôt cover up a busted lip/2 black and broken nose that were beaten with heavily ringed fingers and look they say she did in James cordon , and the fact that 2 pairs of police officers specialising in DV aw nothing, and her ‚Äòhair that was pulled from the root‚Äô clearly were just cut off , the fact that she has zero medical record even when she saw a nurse/had the time to document everything Johnny does/secretly record 
2. Voice recordings of amber saying she was the one that started fights, that he always ran away and removed himself from physical altercations, that she can‚Äôt promise she wouldn‚Äôt hit him again 
3. All ambers witnesses here say and he bfs, yet they don‚Äôt believe witnesses like police officers/medical professionals, not amber who told her friend who then told her husband who then told the court",2020-11-07T09:10:13Z,1
