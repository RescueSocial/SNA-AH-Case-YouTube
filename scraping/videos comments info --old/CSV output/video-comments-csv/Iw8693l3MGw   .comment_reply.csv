36,Ugxvx9y2z1OELRoWMx54AaABAg,Johnny's Girl,"@Daniela What people think you're saying from what I gather is that their relationship was mutually abusive. But putting my two sense in, Amber had no evidence in court proving that he was abusive to her. And if you want to call his friends, exes and others who know him into question then you have to call into question her friends and others who know her who said she TOLD THEM ABOUT THESE THINGS NOT THAT THEY WITNESSED THESE THINGS. There is not one person besides those on her side that has real proof what she says is true. And about Johnny. Not everyone doing drugs and alcohol are violent. I had an alcoholic father. Believe me I know what an addict is like. And Amber admits on tape to hitting him and throwing things at him once causing his finger to be sliced open and a cigarette burned on his face. Where are her consistent injuries that don't move from once place to another? Absolutely NONE! He may have had substance abuse problems but he is not a wife beater. And of course like everyone else famous or not he has flaws but he's been very honest about them but Amber hasn't. She's been proven to be a liar along with being an addict of drugs and alcohol. She got Johnny hooked on alcohol again even though before they married he was sober for at least a year. But then she would give him her drugs and alcohol to take and then he was back to drugs. She also partook. So don't act like he was the only one. Read the documents. Listen to the tapes. She was the abuser. Not him.",2020-09-22T07:13:39Z,4
37,Ugxvx9y2z1OELRoWMx54AaABAg,Dread Cthulhu,"@Daniela I have facts.  You just don't care to hear them.  You say, ""people that hook up are more similar than appear at first sight.""  Well in some cases maybe, but it's also true that opposites attract.  It's true that those abused as a child tend to draw those who are abusive in their adult life.  It's true that abuse follows a pattern and no one abuses only once.  There are no reports of him abusing anyone else not one, but there is a well documented case of her abusing a former partner and probably more are out there.  And finally as I keep pointing out neither of us know the man personally and all is speculation.  Yet you seem pretty adamant that you MUST be right in this no matter what.  Well if he was ever abusive at any point considering that she was constantly recording everything for a period why is there no credible evidence of it?  If he beat her as bad as she claims including the claim that he dragged her through broken glass and she even claims she had cuts all over her body then she would have permanent scars from it that she could easily show to prove it, but there are none and she hasn't.  She would have had to go to the hospital to have the shards removed and there would be medical records.  Yet the only picture she has of bruises is the one where the alleged bruises are so faint that it looks like she could have just slapped herself a few times to just barely raise some redness and there are NO records of any hospital visits at all.  HE can produce hospital records of the incident where part of his finger was cut off and in one of them you can see the wound where he claims she put out a cigarette on his face.  She claims he once held her hostage for three days while he beat her.  Well surely if this was the case there would be significant enough bruising to photograph wouldn't there?  Some thing so bad you couldn't hide it with makeup?  What about the audio recording where she admits to hitting him and then calls him a big baby for always running away from their fights?  The man she claims beats her regularly ALWAYS runs away from fights and there's no discrepancy in that?  Or the incident with her sister where she claims he attacked her sister and punched her with a closed fist and in the same incident he tried to push Kate Moss down the stairs?  Why is this a problem you ask?  Well at that time he had a broken arm with a cast on it.  Now I don't know if you've ever broken a limb and needed a cast, but it's pretty hard to get leverage with one.  The point is I have seen all of the pictures, heard all of the audio, read all of the stories because I wanted to find out the truth no matter how difficult it might be to accept and what I've found is that her claims simply don't hold up to close scrutiny and that when asked questions she'll make claims and then under further questioning contradict herself whereas his statements stay consistent all throughout.  If you want to look at all of the evidence; photos, audio and so on; you can easily find them online and judge for yourself.  I'm sure you will note some interesting patterns as well or perhaps not.  I'm not just some crazed fan who won't ever accept the truth as I've been disappointed by many I thought might have been decent before and am not really surprised anymore when it's proven someone is in fact actually awful.  I just know you have to get the evidence first and not just blindly jump on the bandwagon.",2020-08-20T19:41:50Z,5
