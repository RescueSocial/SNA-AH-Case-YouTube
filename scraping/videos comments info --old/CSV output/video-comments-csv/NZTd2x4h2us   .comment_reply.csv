But 8 feel like for the most part ppl are TRYING to overcomplicate things with all the new ""trends"" in slang! Matter of fact, it was INCREDIBLY distressing to see how many college kids could not write a decent paragraph for college work. They couldn't spell, properly punctuate, or format sentences!
