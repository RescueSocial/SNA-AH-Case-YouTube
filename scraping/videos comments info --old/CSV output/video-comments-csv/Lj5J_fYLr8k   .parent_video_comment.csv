A rumor almost exactly like this became popular months ago and it turns out it wasn't real. Only difference this time is that there's a weight problem tossed in the mix. However, i will say that there is somewhat more of a possibility that this rumor is true then the last one for the weight loss reason. Hollywood ha sa very strict standard witj looking fit for roles. If an actor fucks up, they're completely fucked from a role that could make their career. So this is VERY possible. If this is true, I'll still be pissed at WB. Cause of the fact that it had to take a break in the contract for her to be kicked from the role, and not her being an abusive bitch.

Maybe she gained a few pounds, became heavier but Hollywood is notorious for working on their body for a role. So I would be surprised if they let her go for some 'weight problems'. I mean the most crazy example of this is Christian Bale that went from muscular to skin over bones for a movie playing some anorexia patient and roughly 2-3 months later was muscled bulky for another Batman movie. Even the director of Batman 3 when he saw Christian Bale so thin was like..... this is gonna be a problem, but actually he eventually ended up having to loose weight again coz he was so bulky that he didn't fit into the Batman suit they made for him.",stijnvdv2,0,2021-02-28T21:27:51Z
