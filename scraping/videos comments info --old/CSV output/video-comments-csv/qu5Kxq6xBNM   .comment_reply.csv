2,Ugw28hdRFmFeElOvkwV4AaABAg,amie rhodes x,@Homeboy you literally didn‚Äôt read what I just said... you clearly can‚Äôt even be bothered to search up the definition of feminism then if that‚Äôs what you think as I‚Äôll look out for men as well as women as feminist and so will any other true feminist. Also men are more likely to be raped by another man than be falsely accused for rape by a women so you‚Äôre worrying about the wrong thing. If a proclaimed feminist refuses to also look out for men then they are not a feminist. End of discussion.,2021-04-29T17:26:20Z,0

4,Ugw28hdRFmFeElOvkwV4AaABAg,amie rhodes x,"@Homeboy no I disagree. I don‚Äôt disagree with the fact some people hide behind it however feminisms point is to combat issues and unfortunately the toxic ones all end up viral so it sets the wrong impression. Women in all countries are oppressed more than men, some countries much more than other hence why it‚Äôs called feminism, however it also tries to combat toxic masculinity which is the cause for so many men committing suicide as society has over the years told men they have to be strong and bottle up their emotions. True feminists, which is the vast majority of girls I know and are friends with will call out shitty behaviour regardless of gender, unfortunately most shitty behaviour does come from men in my experience and according to statistics, however by no means am I calling out all men. Hope this made sense and helpedüòÇ:)",2021-04-29T15:33:51Z,1

You might want to look it up. Johnny's never had a record of domestic violence. She does. And just because he might be a drunk or an addict, doesn't mean he's an aggressive person. I've seen and known addicts who are just into their addictions to numb themselves and not feel anything, therefore, they don't get angry or beat anything, they're just zonked out. Plus, if you look at the pictures, her ""bruises"" are in different colors, one was brown, the other was red, and in different places. Clearly, that's make up. Besides, she only donated the money because Johnny said he'd give it to her if she donated to charity. She merely played along with it. She's the one making it harder for women to come forward because her story isn't true. Women standing up for each other isn't just about women, it's also about men helping these women come out. She's an actress. I studied acting, and I can see acting when I look at it. She totally acted out a poorly written monologue in her speaking up video. That's so fake.",2018-12-28T18:15:08Z,0

91,Ugym5pgdEQCnKvZJ-FF4AaABAg,Lotta,"Alex Eastwood the allegations of him throwing iphone at her were fake you should do your research before you doom a good innocent person. there were shitton of evidence proving she was lying:
-SHE HERSELF was arrested for DOMESTIG VIOLENCE and she even had to go to court because of it
- 1. she first asked for divorce and 50k month suppousal support (even when they did not have kids and were marrued 13 months) she also asked for all the cars, houses and the dogs
- 2 when she got denied she made the allegations. 
(btw she asked for divorce day later his mother died.)
-her only edivence was pictures of her ""bruises"" that you could easily do with makeup or just drop a phone to your face
- their housekeeper said she saw amber without makeup next day and without bruise
-THE FUCKING POLICE filed a report saying there were no sign of violence whatsoever, (they were called when they were fighting but left after amber asked and saw no sign of any violence)
- their bodyquards who were there when it was happening said they didnt hear nothing 
- they also said that amber had tried to set him up on the privious day
- photo of amber next day partying without bruises
- ambers publicist was testifying against her
-also every single one of johnnys exes saying the allegations were nothing like tha man they went out with
- the ""video evidence"" was about their fight over a year ago not about the ""incident"" 
- that video was edited and amber was egging him and not getting anywhere safe like she would if she was really scared (we dont know what was happeninf before the video she could have made him really mad and start recording after and start acting like a victim)
- ambers friends who were going to testifyi for her had been friends for 12 years and they lived in johnnys apartment
- there is a leaked email where she said give money and she keeps silent
- in leaked documents its shows that johnny actually ACCUSED HER of hittiming him and AMBER ADMITTING TO IT
- she was many hours late for testifying and then in the end didnt even go to court just settled because she knew she was going to lose
so do your research before you make yourself look like moron",2018-12-08T01:23:38Z,2

109,Ugy-jxRgp_s_E4-FyOZ4AaABAg,Lilly C,"@R. Plaza You must've misread my comment. I'm saying no one knows what actually happened except for them. 

I don't think she ever did back track her claims. The joint statement they agreed on and released to the public said that, neither party intentionally meant to hurt the other person and that neither party made false accusations. 

I'm pretty sure Amber just mentioned something about her being a domestic abuse survivor with her humanitarian work and I'm also pretty sure Johnny Depp did an interview for GQ(?) advocating for his innocence. 
So it looks like neither one of them has back tracked. And what I was saying is that no one will ever know what actually happened, except for the two of them.",2018-12-10T05:39:14Z,1
110,Ugy-jxRgp_s_E4-FyOZ4AaABAg,R. Plaza,Lilly C So you actually know that Amber actually did it. Not to mention that Amber back tracked her abuse claims especially when her witnesses credibility began to crumble,2018-12-10T03:28:33Z,0
111,Ugy-jxRgp_s_E4-FyOZ4AaABAg,Lilly C,"@R. Plaza Actually, it was the ex gf who assumed the cop was homophobic and said the cop exaggerated what happened, via a written statement to the public basicly. Then the cop came out and said she was a lesbian. I'm not aware of the ex gf changing her story on this. Amber Heard herself didn't actually say a lot during this period, nor did Johnny Depp himself. It was mostly their friends and lawyers talking on their behalf and being character witnesses. It was a total shitstorm. Who knows now with all that chaos.",2018-12-10T03:07:41Z,3
112,Ugy-jxRgp_s_E4-FyOZ4AaABAg,R. Plaza,Lilly C Actually the officer who witnessed the assault is a LESBIAN woman. The cop didn‚Äôt lie and the only story that changed was the girlfriends. Cops especially LGBTQ cops don‚Äôt just lie all the time. Amber Heard is a D rated actress and the cop didn‚Äôt come out publicly until Amber said she was a homophobic liar. So yeah there is a way to know by doing a simple search.,2018-12-10T02:16:48Z,0
113,Ugy-jxRgp_s_E4-FyOZ4AaABAg,Lilly C,"@R. Plaza I guess there's no way of knowing now, but officers lie all the time too. Also they were broken up when the ex gf said that the officer over exaggerated and she just grabbed her arm. So, what 5+ years after they broke up, the ex gf said that.. so she would have NO REASON TO LIE at that point.",2018-12-09T23:17:07Z,2
