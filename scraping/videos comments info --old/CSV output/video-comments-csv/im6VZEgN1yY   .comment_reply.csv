1,UgxqloRcwLO5t0MFxKt4AaABAg,Rob's Rules,"She might be staying in jail if she goes to the Australia filming. That will be her issue. They are investigating the evidence of the UK case and this could become a factor. Either way, I am boycotting seeing the movie",2020-10-30T12:15:14Z,1
2,Ugxk2eW2H8bAEQqxNRJ4AaABAg,Rob's Rules,Killing Joke thank you üôè. I hope you continue to enjoy it. I will do my best !,2020-10-09T18:36:52Z,0
3,Ugx1PoF_qnPebBqUOPJ4AaABAg,Wendy Norris,@Kim Whitehead very true her hands are bound now either way and she is not silly she knows she is in alot of trouble and she has to much negativity surrounding her now. Aquaman. Really don't want or need that. But cannot make decisions or take any action without solid evidence and reasons x,2020-10-09T09:44:55Z,0
4,Ugx1PoF_qnPebBqUOPJ4AaABAg,Kim Whitehead,And the legality of re entry into Australia. She‚Äôs on the list now. The country is not happy with her.,2020-10-09T00:44:20Z,0
5,UgzbScy_byIKgxT6zq94AaABAg,Rob's Rules,Your not the only one. I hope they kick her out. She doesn‚Äôt deserve to be rewarded for anything after what she has done to him,2020-10-08T17:08:57Z,0
6,UgwYav7QgoGwV7cgUcx4AaABAg,Rob's Rules,rachel denny I can‚Äôt say I understand this either. Why didn‚Äôt they withhold payments for mortgages and rents until it was safe to return to some normalcy. There are empty buildings and you have to wonder why they don‚Äôt house the homeless or something to that nature. Doesn‚Äôt make much sense unless it is a money issue.,2020-10-08T13:25:11Z,1
7,UgxZJi1cyKX84H6gKIt4AaABAg,Judith Hodgson,@Rebecca Vaughn yes I know  but it still isn't  fair,2020-10-08T12:11:23Z,1

9,UgxzgeiUmBMl8ZEeI1d4AaABAg,Rob's Rules,"Did not know about it to be honest, I am streaming a lot today and focusing on my birthday seeing friends and family, but now that you have informed me..... thank you üôè",2020-10-08T16:59:37Z,0
10,UgyF2A67PlWiCrl6a194AaABAg,Rob's Rules,"I don‚Äôt think she will be replaced. I think they will film at different locations. If she goes to Australia, she might be arrested and that is a chance I would not take. Not worth it to me anyway",2020-10-30T12:26:30Z,0
11,UgzK39MH6roZalQdZHN4AaABAg,Rob's Rules,"As of now, they are investigating what she did in Australia. Her bringing the dogs when she knew not to, will be the issue at hand. They may have to film her at different locations. Either way, I am NOT going to see this movie. Sorry. I don‚Äôt accept an abuser, multiple times with different people, getting rewarded for her actions. I can‚Äôt and won‚Äôt accept it",2020-10-30T12:18:50Z,0
12,UgwzDdJyT2MIYoioQgh4AaABAg,Rob's Rules,They are investigating the UK case right now. That will play a role and I am sure the verdict we get this Monday will be a factor as well,2020-10-30T12:25:10Z,1
13,UgzkDSMo4E48alpanvV4AaABAg,Ewa Sadowski,"Starting with, ""The Stand"", coming out in December.",2020-10-08T21:29:26Z,0
14,UgzkDSMo4E48alpanvV4AaABAg,Rob's Rules,"I can‚Äôt blame you either. I wanted to see it until I HEARD about her and investigated what she had done to JD. I did enjoy the movie so I truly hope she is not in it. I would hate not to open my wallet, but with her in it, it will remain closed.",2020-10-08T16:58:21Z,0
15,UgzdNFv3CUKKiSy0qcp4AaABAg,Rob's Rules,"@Chickp Stranded I agree. I will not see the movie. I may watch it at a cheaper price, but not see it upon release. I want to send a message out there. It is the only way to do it. She should not be rewarded for what she has done. I hope she loses in the US case. Monday is Judgment day. That will give us the final call. That will tell us where Johnny and Amber stand. I am nervous about the decision, but I have confidence that #justiceforjohnnydepp will happen",2020-10-30T12:24:14Z,0
16,UgzdNFv3CUKKiSy0qcp4AaABAg,Rob's Rules,"As of now, they are investigating the UK case and what she did. This could play an impact on filming in Australia. They could do scenes at a different location for her. Again, time will tell",2020-10-30T12:20:45Z,0
17,UgzdNFv3CUKKiSy0qcp4AaABAg,Chickp Stranded,"I know you‚Äôre right, WB are definitely waiting for the sun trial verdict, but you know, sometimes i feel like venting some of the disgust I feel for that thing, not woman. I find her behaviour extremely insulting to all women, especially those of us who have experienced REAL rape or domestic violence, so I fantasise about a just world where abusers are punished for their actions",2020-10-08T05:55:52Z,6
18,Ugyq1RZVwVnF4FSVlwp4AaABAg,Rob's Rules,"JediLadyMisty I know what we wish for, BUT, I don‚Äôt believe in rumors. I don‚Äôt think she will get arrested. There are time frames. They are called Statues of Limitation. If he did not proceed at that time of the incident, I don‚Äôt believe he can after so many years.",2020-10-10T19:47:31Z,0
19,Ugyq1RZVwVnF4FSVlwp4AaABAg,JediLadyMisty,I heard that they will arrest her over the incident where she nearly severed JD‚Äôs finger on top of smuggling the dogs in.,2020-10-10T19:17:31Z,1
20,Ugyq1RZVwVnF4FSVlwp4AaABAg,Rob's Rules,Thank you üôè I appreciate it,2020-10-08T13:28:45Z,0
21,Ugyq1RZVwVnF4FSVlwp4AaABAg,Rob's Rules,Donald Dolan I think those are strong possibilities. I was wondering if she would get arrested and they have to take that into consideration also. They could do scenes without her and then make a determination,2020-10-08T13:28:22Z,0
22,UgzYjhRenViYzgwAMzR4AaABAg,Rob's Rules,"@marr bandz yes, but if she goes to Australia, she could be arrested and they are investigating her about the dog incident",2020-10-30T12:13:27Z,1
