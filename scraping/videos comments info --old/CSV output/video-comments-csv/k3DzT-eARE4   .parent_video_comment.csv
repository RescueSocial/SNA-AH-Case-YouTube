YOU may decide about a relationship on what a person's body looks like, to each it's own....but ME personally, I learned very young ( thanks to my step mother ) to never look at the body or the fact cause that's just a shell like a turtle, but look at a person's soul. Ms. AH Johnny has always & WILL ALWAYS have a gentle soul, he's kind, thoughtful, loving etc. Johnny is my dream man that more then likely won't come true.

8,UgzMc4LaS3WHV2D-yRl4AaABAg,"People are struggling with empathizing with Depp because he‚Äôs an older wealthy man who married a pretty young woman. Apparently because he‚Äôs a rich white man, he somehow asked for it...?

But it‚Äôs clear she preyed on him, not the other way around. She could have killed him. Society needs to evolve on the understanding of a ‚Äúvictim‚Äù. I have not seen a single explanation for her behavior. Amber Heard has not offered a single explanation for this supposed ‚Äúabuse‚Äù.",s h a d √∏ w b a n n e d,0,2020-08-06T05:08:46Z

He emphasied it like that, as if to tell me I wasn't really beautiful, but ""as good as he was"" he ""sacrifised"" himself to be with me. Only in that way did he evet compliment me. And towards the I read ( and I am sure, he let me found it on purpouse) a message yo his new supply that said something like""It is so nice to finally be with a real woman, not a skinny pale one who doesn't fill any real function in society;"" But that was just days before I ended the relationship.

15,UgyfnMytupyP2Ny8Co94AaABAg,"This is typical abuser tactics.  It is a process of making the victim feel worthless. I am glad they were not together longer than they were as I think she could have destroyed him.  I think what did save Johnny was Johnny himself when he finally woke up and stood up for himself. The fact that for a long time he kept so much private is just his kind heart and when you love someone even when it is over you still want to protect them and sacrifice a part of yourself.  Like many people who are abused the full realisation of things that have occurred often come after a relationship when they look back on little things that were signs at the beginning.  They get the warning signs quite early on but   because they think they love someone they bury the doubts.  It is when the heart takes over from the brain.  With Johnny I think the reason he came clean is because Amber continued to play the part of a victim in the public eye and not only was his life affected but also that of his children.  He finally had enough as he could see it would never be over and thank goodness he finally said enough is enough, no more protecting her. 

¬†When she first accused him right back to the time she appeared in front  of the paps with her ""injuries"" I thought hmm no not buying this and even that far back I hoped Johnny would come forward to defend himself.  I was really frustrated when he settled it all privately but I also understood it knowing him and his personality.  I, when he finally fought back, was and still am a very happy lady.  I just thought about time and it was a relief to me.  This must have given his family so much pain the past few years and for their sakes I am happy too.",L Mac,5,2020-06-26T09:27:44Z
16,UgzHx2pbUw62pB_Ve4Z4AaABAg,"Amber's behaviour is of someone who moves through life without any feelings of guilt. Some of the indicators listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM-5) include:‚Ä¢ Impulsivity, failure to plan ahead
‚Ä¢ Irritability, aggressiveness ‚Ä¢ Lack of remorse after having hurt, mistreated, or stolen from another person. 
Johnny was  trapped in a marriage with someone who has no trace of empathy and no genuine interest in bonding emotionally with him. He married a sociopath. He was manipulated, his boundaries were ignored, unloved, constantly lied to, she tried to separate him from his loved ones. He was obviously taken to the edge of insanity. we all know he never hit her and this shows a lot of character. He is a champion, he will come out of this experience a stronger, wiser and more conscious person. I think this has been ‚Äúa tremendous learning curve‚Äù for him. God bless Johnny Depp, all good things will come to him. He will meet someone who will love and respect him for who he is.",Nana Martin,7,2020-06-20T22:11:38Z
