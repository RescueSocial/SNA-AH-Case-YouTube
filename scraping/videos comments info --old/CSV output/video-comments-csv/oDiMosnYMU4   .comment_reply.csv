79,UgzYToBiqke549IEiUN4AaABAg,Mike Reger,"Unfortunately, the courts often do some frighteningly stupid things.

The UK Depp vs The Sun trial was proof of it. You can get biased judges, or those with political leanings, conflicts of interest, or simply lazy or impatient (looking at YOU Chupp, we haven‚Äôt forgotten about Vic Mignona). You get evidence dismissed or permitted when it shouldn‚Äôt be. You get perjury. When there‚Äôs jurors involved - although they aren‚Äôt always depending on the kind of cases - you get individual biases for every single person on the panel, and varying degrees of smarts or sense.

Then you‚Äôve got the lawyers. They‚Äôll try anything to circumvent or avoid some procedures under any technicalities they can find, to suit their clients or harm their opponents. And THEN there‚Äôs money - richer guys get more legal power because they can literally bankrupt their opponents by drawing out proceedings and racking up the bills, they can afford a more experienced and larger legal team. They can literally pay to cow opponents into silence under threat of legal action and ruin.

Any idea that an honest person has nothing to fear in court is dangerously naive. There is no ‚Äúeven chance‚Äù and nothing equal about it, it‚Äôs a nasty, dirty, cut-throat process where a common man has little chance against anyone with power, money and influence.",2021-03-04T07:03:42Z,1
