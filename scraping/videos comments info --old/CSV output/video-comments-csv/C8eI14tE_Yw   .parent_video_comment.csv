3,Ugzfk0epEgyl-dh2vVV4AaABAg,"As much as it sucks that other actors are going to be affected by one single person's actions, their careers won't be tarnished or deeply affected if/when this movie flops.
In saying that, YES I want this movie to fail because Amber's actions are so much bigger and more damaging than the success or downfall of a movie.
What she did was serious and I don't believe she should be rewarded with movie roles for her bad behaviour.
Warner Bros punished an innocent man by taking away his job, and rewarded an abuser by giving her work. 
What kind of backwards, topsy turvy world is this, where the bad guy gets the  reward? No no no no, that's not how this works. 
So no, I will not EVER see the movie. In theatres or otherwise.
In the end, I believe we should all hit Warner Bros where it hurts and not support the movie at all. They will understand just how much we mean business when they lose money. 
And in the end, there will be #JusticeForJohnnyDepp",Savage Karma,0,2021-06-20T15:04:16Z

14,UgxDsKrfXDHpADFGG8J4AaABAg,"I found Something quite interesting. I truly believe Depp was step up by Amber Heard, and was probably paid to Seduce to get Married, Restraining order, Removed Depp from Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean #6, let me explain.
Disney wanted to go another route with the POC#6 movie. Their agenda empowered female fighter against a world of abusive and dominated by men... 
Sound familiar so far!
A female to take control of the helm, a new type of Capt. So what do you do when you have an IDEA, and Johnny Depp's character Capt. Sparrow is in the way? 
You create chaos to have Depp removed. By now every
one knows she lied and Disney. So why hasn't Depp been returned to Hollywood? This makes sense!  Why after a year with Depp, now there's a problem? Did you know that after ONE month of marriage to Depp this foul Creature was having Elon Musk over to the apartment 3 times a week, everytime Depp was out of town filming? Elon Musk even had his own Key Fob access to the underground garage.
Did you know, before Depp married Amber they were seeing each other for a while? What caught my attention was on how QUICKLY Depp was dropped, with no proof. Depp gave Hollywood 40 years of his life to acting, proved himself among his friends, movie colleagues, and crew, directors Tim Burton and even his ex-wife Vanessa Paradis of 14 YEARS together stated, that he never struck or was ever physically abusive to her or his children. This whole thing was a stepup to remove him,  they already have a someone as a replacement Margot Robbie! Check into it, this freaking LASS is wearing an outfit similar to our beloved framed Captain Jack Sparrow.. They might be thinking of the idea of killing off the  Captain Sparrow character. When you check there is a picture of Capt. Sparrow under a Guillotine about to be BEHEADED!!",Elizabeth Torres,1,2021-06-14T15:45:02Z

WB has a long track record of making dumb and terrible decisions where DC movies are concerned.

I suspect this movie will tank in the box office, and that likely means that if the Snyder verse wasn't dead before, it will be now.

I had a tooth pulled a few years back and it was not a pleasant experience. Ironically enough, 2 weeks ago i had first phase of tooth implant done. Expensive, but spending on own health is always a good investment.
Love the format btw. You ought to do it more. One nitpick, text cards on the sides, if you make them slanted, make them slanted on top and bottom, not left and right. It looks weird otherwise. Plus new photo, gorgeous as always. üòç

As far as JD goes, double standards of Hollyweird are well known, but eventually even they will gonna have to accept that AH are more trouble than she is worth. Sometimes battles are lost, sometimes they must be lost, but for as long as war is won it is an acceptable loss. And JD is winning this war.
