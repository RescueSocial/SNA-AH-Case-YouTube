35,UgxPTb4dgLQ6CfKTLqp4AaABAg,Kim Smith,"@petra r. Both Elon Musk and James Franco gave written statements about their time with Amber, the truth that she would phone them when Johnny would go away for business or to shoot a movie...and how they would stay at Johnny's home, having sex with her in his bed. Both said that she was very violent.  The day that she went to court for the restraining order against Johnny...she had a bruise on her face which she claimed was caused by Johnny hitting her in the face.  But through video evidence taken from the security camera's at their condo, in the condo elevators and lobby...plus eye-witness testimony from two make-up stylists and the condo lobby staff...it was proven that after Johnny left she did not have any bruises...until the 4th day after he left.  

Elon Musk as admitted, in his statement, that she attacked him one night and during this attack he did end up hitting her...while he was actively trying to physically restrain her from attacking him. Six different people gave testimony that the first time any of them saw the bruise...was the morning after Elon Musk had spent the night with her. 

This woman is a true sociopath...I can't wait for the trial next year...to see how her story will have changed...since she gave her testimony in England.  I cannot see how Johnny can lose either of these lawsuits, especially since there are 13 video and audio recordings of her admitting that she hit him, not the other way around. (But in today's world, with liberal activist judges...who knows if this judge will obey the tenets of the law...or if he will side with feminists...who believe it is different when a woman hits a man, than it is when a man hits a woman).",2020-08-28T16:36:10Z,1

124,UgzxE9rfZU3-VHjjE854AaABAg,Walter B,"The courts must (and should) follow due process.  I know you're only expressing frustration.
There are some challenges within the law.  The industry often talks about power structures.  For example, Johnny could use his fists to defend himself (we know how that would end), conversely, Amber could use a knife or similar weapon (as it often the case in domestic situations) to defend herself.  The court argues because males have more muscle mass on average (if biology is not disputed), then that creates a power imbalance which means that courts need to ""factor"" that imbalance in, creating these complex webs.  In the old days it used to be actus reus and mens rea (basically what did you do any why).  That was condemned as giving privilege to some.
Basically, it's a long-winded way of saying that equality before the law has been redefined and that rather than considering the crime and the motive, it's often couched as pre-determined power structures.  This obviously will depend on the judge presiding over the case.
If that sounds complicated, it's far more complicated than it should be.",2020-07-13T00:12:51Z,6

182,Ugx6yZRI7qh7Y5UYr4p4AaABAg,Mila C,That's so funny because in the leaked audio during the finger search they are all discussing how she refuses to leave was begging to see Johnny Depp and refused to fly back to the USA. They were discussing having someone chaperone her to a hotel and on a flight back. They couldn't get rid of her.

Yes, it's true there is a lot of activism in the judiciary.  George Pell was convicted in Australia on the testimony of one person.  When I asked ""was the burden of proof met"", there was stone silence.  The court of appeals refused to listen to the case.  It took the High Court to throw the case out (and that surprised me).
Unfortunately, like most domains, activism is pushed heavily.  The concept of meritocracy is dead.  Almost everything now is quotas.
If you want to make your blood boil, read some feminist journals.  They have perverted principles of the law like ""equality before the law"" beyond recognition.  But, the real question is who let this happen?",2020-07-12T23:59:34Z,0
