38,Ugz2heOjEyfm582LlE94AaABAg,obsidiana07,@MyboiJAEGER It brought awareness to a problem that still exists in this country whether men want to believe it or not. Just because you have never personally experienced what women have doesn't mean it still isn't a real problem and that is the issue as to why a lot of men dismiss it which is unfortunate. I am Native and our women are at a higher rate of being sexually abused/raped/trafficked than most others. This is a problem we have had to deal with since the Europeans first set foot on this continent (in my own family I have close female relatives undergo such things as rape and myslef was almost sexually assaulted. And I have nieces that are children that I worry about every day and the future is very bleak for them because of the percentage at which we have to deal with this so it hits close to home ). I am not insecure in anything just tired of this being overlooked by the good ole' boys club. People Like Amber Heard do so much damage but don't care because all they want to do is further their own career. It is very disheartening.,2020-04-02T14:17:37Z,0

41,Ugz2heOjEyfm582LlE94AaABAg,obsidiana07,So let's dismiss the women who actually were sexually assault/abused by people in power? Say you were married and your wife was raped by her boss repeatedly and he said if she wanted to keep her job she had to continue to get raped. Would you then allow her to continue to get raped because the guy paid her salary? Would you allow the same for your daughter? If yes than you are part of the problem and the reason this movement exists. Amber Heard tried to be a spokeswoman for the Metoo movement but as it turns out her situation was the complete opposite of what it stand for.,2020-03-31T21:31:33Z,1

As for the appropriation  of the role,playing a ""part""also means meeting basic expectations of that characters established image. You could probably have a black haired Irish women do the scripted scenes just as good but it wouldn't be the ""Mera"" that is established and trying to claim it is the same or even better is just odd. 



There are some who call this hope that she merely continues to be portrayed as a red head as ""Racist"" but these are the same people demanding  for more and more introductions of ""POC"" (who also must fit the stringent ideological and political demands of such groups as well)actors, to such an extent that fans of all races find it annoying and racists who are then of course insulted and degraded by those demanding groups as ""bigots"".
