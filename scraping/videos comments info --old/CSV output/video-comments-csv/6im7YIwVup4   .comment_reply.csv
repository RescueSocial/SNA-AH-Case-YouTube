34,Ugxfg2qhd3HN-eCeMPB4AaABAg,Totto„Å≠„Åà„Å°„ÇÉ„Çì,"@Nichole Shackelton Lol don‚Äôt be üòÖ But seriously, in Amber Heard‚Äôs case, it would make a lot more sense if you consider her personality disorder to somewhat close to that of a NPD (narcissist personality disorder). NPD and BPD are somewhat alike and most people still confuse between them two. I‚Äôve been there. I was in a narcissistic abuse relationship and 3 years after it happened, until someone else spelled it out for me, i couldn‚Äôt even believe that my ex was a narc. I thought it over and even thought of myself as a narc instead because all the symptoms are mixing up. But no, in the end i found out that there‚Äôs a thing called a BPD - NPD relationship, which believe me, is the worst kind. So if you are a BPD or if your friends or someone you know are one, you should at least educate yourself about this matter. Because a BPD tends to get caught up in a dangerous relationship like one with a NPD, so it is very alarming if you‚Äôre still not able to tell those two apart.",2021-05-20T15:47:08Z,0

36,Ugxfg2qhd3HN-eCeMPB4AaABAg,Nichole Shackelton,"@Totto„Å≠„Åà„Å°„ÇÉ„Çì I too am BPD, unfortunately and meant no offense. I said my friend had borderline personality, is that the same? If so I completely agree that's not what she has, I've seen this particular trait up close and personal with two people that I loved desperately and are both gone ironically, but it's one thing to tell a lie, you told it, you know it's a lie, you may take it with you till death but you still know it's a lie, there's telling a lie so many times it becomes your truth, that happens quite often I'd bet, but to straight faced tell someone a story, a story of a gruesome and horrific rape and blame it on an innocent man is unforgivable, but the fact that a close friend actually lived that vile narrative, and confided in you, then taking that story and telling it like it's yours, like you lived threw that? It's just vile and disgusting and purely unforgivable and I genuinely hope it becomes a well known fact about her, that the mainstream media gets off there added and tells the world she did this, even if everything else she did never comes to light and jhonny looses so people think she's been telling the truth all along ( for the love of God just typing that pissed me off lol) even if all that happens, we know she did this for a fact, and she should be held accountable! Cause what could she say? ""Oh I know it's weird he chose to rape me exactly the same way with the same weapon....her I could continue to rant but the point of all this rant was to day I'm sorry I did not mean to offend you and I didn't realize those diagnosis were even similar. I do notice that they, both the bi polar disorder and borderline personality disorders are blamed for just about everyone in Hollywood fuck ups! It never helps me with my fuckups!!
