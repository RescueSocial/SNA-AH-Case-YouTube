The way he handled it has shown him to have shown very poor judgment in how he dealt with both witnesses and evidence.

50,Ugzh8G4OELgU4oSJPfJ4AaABAg,"Personally, looking at this...while there is a connection it does seem like corkboard style conspiracy theory connecting:
The judge would have to be aware of the close connection to the case. That his co-writers ex-wife was the mentor for Amber Herd's lawyer. That's not exactly something likely to come up in conversation depending how well the judge knew his co-writer. Hey may have heard about the wife, but not know about the lawyer connection.

Plus we are forgetting the ex-wife part. Assuming he is close to his co-writer it also provides an argument for him to side against Heard to get petty payback.

As for the Rupert Murdoch connection. I could find barely any information on the son let alone a connection to Murdoch, but assuming there is a connection there, Murdoch is putting pressure on someone in the workplace on personal grounds and that persons father is someone who understands how the law works....that's not going to end up well for you when a lawyer is hired to sue for workplace misconduct against whoever is messing with the son.

My own opinion on this connection, I see an internet determined to find some way to question the case's legitimacy in any way they can construe even if it's a tenous and illogical link at best.

While Heard does deserve to be cut from Aquaman, or Johnny restored to the cast of Fantastic Beasts...I don't see a clear 100% case for a conflict of interest.",Ebak,0,2020-11-13T01:40:42Z

68,UgynEW525JVu-6TCTFp4AaABAg,"This video is moronic. These two guys are both confusing the judge with a man that the judge co-wrote a book with. Dan does this at 4:38 and Andy does this at 6:39. Dan has also recently come out with a video that has a thumbnail saying: ""Judge's WIFE dines with AH & TEAM?!!"" Dan is an idiot. The video itself does not contain any claim that the judge's wife dined with AH and her team. In the thumbnail, this idiot is referring to the ex-wife of a colleague of the judge as the ""Judge's WIFE.""

At 4:59 Dan is apparently claiming that Kathy Lette claims it is not true that the judge's ex-wife is Jennifer Robinson's best friend. This would be a moronic thing to claim. The judge does not have an ex-wife; he has a wife, and no one is claiming his wife is Robinson's best friend. But then immediately after this, Dan implies that this claim of Lette's is disproven by some photos of Lette with a woman he refers to only as ""her""! And when we eventually are shown these photos we still do not know for sure which woman he had referred to as ""her"", but I am guessing it's Jen Robinson, as she is in one of the pictures. A viewer that doesn't know what Robinson looks like would not have a clue who he's talking about. But what is he now implying that Lette is claiming to not be true? That Robinson is her best friend? This is so confusing. How is Andy allowing this moron to talk like this without pointing out that he is not making any sense? 

There is a tweet from Lette saying something is not true, but it is about something else entirely. It is about the claim made by Katie Hind in the Daily Mail that Kylie Minogue and Cate Blanchett attended her (Lette's) dinner party:

https://twitter.com/KathyLette/status/1282581510860701696

At 7:35, Dan and Andy start claiming that the judge prevented The Sun from revealing the name of a man under investigation by the police for a financial crime. Andy says the judge blocked a news outlet, and Dan replies that he blocked The Sun. No, he blocked Associated Newspapers Limited (the publisher of the Daily Mail, Mail on Sunday and Mail Online), and his judgment meant that all the media were blocked from revealing this man's name. Dan then goes on to make the astonishing claim that there is actual evidence that the man was guilty. At 12:19 he even says ""there's _so much_ evidence against him."" What evidence? The man was not even arrested, let alone convicted. Why doesn't Andy ask him what evidence he is referring to? He is implying that there is lots of evidence and all of it was ignored by the police, and yet Andy is not asking him how he knows this and what this evidence is. Surely Andy must realise the man has not been convicted, because if he had been, we would know his name. 

Please note that the Sun article contains the following sentence: ""The law refuses, rightly in my opinion, to grant anonymity to those being investigated for alleged sex crimes, even if they are famous and have been exonerated, as Sir Cliff Richard has."" 

https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/2143912/in-this-judicial-dictatorship-it-seems-money-talks-and-free-speech-walks-says-author-mick-hume/amp/

I would not be surprised if this moron Dan also started claiming there is _""so much_ evidence"" against Sir Cliff.

If you want to buy in or sell out... getting rid or reducing the value of a great value icon has also great financial impact on the value of those assets if you want to buy in or alter the value of those assets.

78,UgwXT2EMymXvZIuacB14AaABAg,"It's an everyday thing in English courts that the judge is friends with one or both the barristers.  Let alone people further out from the centre. 
If a judge feels her decision making power is compromised she recuses herself. If not then any barrister is free to bring up the point.
Judges typically come from chambers of barristers.  And there are not many of those.  It would be nigh on impossible for there to be no connection.
In my short career as a litigator I've been out for dinner with man my judges and barristers that have worked or adjudicated on disputes that I'm working on (although not whilst the trial was being heard or before judgment is handed down).

85,UgwqI3XitOVZNDGGfWR4AaABAg,"God this case is riddled with bias and malpractice.

Please everybody share this information:

Firstly:
Sir Andrew Nicol the judge (jury in this case) is married to Camilla Palmer. Go to here wikipedia page and apparently ""She founded the legal partnership Palmer Wade, the forum Women's Equality Network"". - Big red flag and conflict of interest in my opinion.

Secondly: 
It's not the first time this judge has got the verdict seriously wrong and wrongly convicted someone: 
""Justice Nicol was the judge in the trial of consultant surgeon David Sellu in November 2013. Sellu was found guilty of gross negligence manslaughter following the death of a patient under his care. He served 15 months imprisonment of a 30 month sentence.[4] After release Sellu's appeal against the conviction was successful in 2016.[5] The grounds for success were that Justice Nicol had failed to instruct the jury properly with regard to the meaning of the charge.[6] The jury had returned to court before reaching their verdict seeking further guidance, which was not forthcoming from Justice Nicol.[7]""
For those of you wondering how bad this judgement was feel free to do some more research and read David Sellu's book:
https://www.amazon.co.uk/Did-Save-Lives-Surgeons-Story/dp/1912892324
His career was completely ruined by the way.

Thirdly:
The judge's son works for talkRADIO, and Dan Wootton, the executive editor of The Sun newspaper is also the host of talkRADIO's drivetime show. 

Fourthly:
The connection in this video with Amber Heard's lawyer to the judge.

121,Ugx5x6tcqsGn6AMDgTJ4AaABAg,"If judges recused themselves for this kind of link there would be no judges to hear cases. There are 98 high court judges and with some specialising in Family and Chancery so wouldn't be eligible to hear this court leaving 69 who could hear the case.  So it's a really small pool. And while there are a lot of law firms and people working in the law profession the number of barristers and at that one working for a prestigious, enough law firm with enough hours to be involved in a high court case is also small. So you have two small groups of people, two groups who are linked because Judges used to be barristers. They have generally worked for at least one of these high court level law firms so they have worked with many of the barristers who might be involved in the case. Barristers at least often socialise together both just down the pub but also at social events. You could most likely also claim that JD's legal team had a conflict of interest as you can most likely find if you dig deep enough find a personal link, not just with the judge but also the opposing legal team. After all even without a small circle like we are talking about here they say you can link every person with someone else in just 6 steps. Actually, if we take Nicols wife who is a respected Barrister, it's like saying every Judge should recuse themselves in her cases because they likely all know Nicols 

Also writing a book with someone, especially a professional book like this one doesn't equate to being friends. You are rarely an expert on every aspect of a subject so you might hunt out (or your publisher hunt out) someone whose expertise complements yours. So saying that because he co-wrote a book with someone in 1984, who is married to someone who is friends with someone on The Sun's legal team is a stretch. 

So no a judge knowing someone on either legal team (or knowing someone that that person knows) isn't a conflict, they are highly respected professionals after all. For it to be a conflict he would really need to have a relationship with either the claimant or the defendant or at the very least for the judge to have an intimate relationship with someone on the legal team where you wouldn't want it inferred that sex was being used to influence the decision",Simon Wakefield,1,2020-11-09T23:37:27Z

158,UgyCki2E5no_BqsqT_h4AaABAg,"This is so wrong:  ""A situation in which a judge steps down from a case, usually because he has a conflict of interest, either because there is actual bias against a party or, because there is a real possibility that a fair-minded observer would conclude that he should not try the case because he cannot be impartial (apparent bias). The judge can recuse himself of his own volition, or a party can make an application for the judge to recuse himself, and it is for the judge to decide whether to accede to such an application and step down.""  *From Thomson Reuter's Practical Law *  IT IS FOR THE JUDGE OT DECIDE???",Dee Anne Sweetapple,5,2020-11-09T19:28:25Z
