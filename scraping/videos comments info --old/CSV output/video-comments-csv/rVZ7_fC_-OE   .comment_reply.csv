48,UgyCRmAIBEHybMvrOiN4AaABAg,A real Mrs. Smith,"Yep. When a real Hollywood slimeball is outed ALL his former co-stars, associates, etc. come crawling out of the woodwork to corroborate the allegations.

See, men?  The accusations of a single woman can‚Äôt ruin your reputation or blacklist you. Men (and women) who have have lived good lives, treated castmates, crew, and co-workers well and been all-round decent people will have many coming to their defense. And people who make false allegations end up like Heard- villified and broke-ass career.

Being a good person to all those you meet, work and interact with actually matters. THAT is what a reputation that other will defend you for is built on, and not much in this world can irrevocably destroy that kind of genuinely good reputation. Nothing short of killing puppies or abusing children will kill a good reputation of a kind man. Aside from those things, if you lead a genuinely good life and DO screw up, that good reputation will usually earn you a second chance if you sincerely take responsibility and take steps to make reparations and do the work you need to do on yourself. 

There is really no down side to being a good person. But being a good person also means being a good person WHEN NO ONE IS LOOKING, and when you won‚Äôt get a pat on the back or praise for it. If you are only doing it for show.. you aren‚Äôt a good person.",2021-04-09T12:22:21Z,1
