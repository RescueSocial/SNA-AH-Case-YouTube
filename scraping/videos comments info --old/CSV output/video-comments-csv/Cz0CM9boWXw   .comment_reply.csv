1,UgyTNie8Fp0_4lPnwmh4AaABAg,Sha Magic,"And that's the problem with these movies studios they keep getting these actors that's in there 40s to play these hero's and villains for example, Ben affleck I love batfleck I think he's the perfect Batman but they should of started with a prime Batman a Batman that's mid 30s

Another example Jason momoa is 41yrs old playing aquaman around that age there should of been an aquaman 3 or 4 already out.  I think the only person that started young was Huge jackman.",2020-09-02T05:41:47Z,0
