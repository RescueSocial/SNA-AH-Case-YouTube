2,UgygiriFcmXJmvSx61h4AaABAg,"(Heads up: I have posted this on several videos, hoping that Lost Beyond Pluto might see it. Sorry for the spamming) 

Dear Lost Beyond Pluto, I miss watching your legal analysis and professional translations of all the ""legaleze"" into layman terms for us. 
I get that you are clearly having much more fun with your current format of talk show with someone you care about and feel comfortable with. It clearly shows, and you look like you are having such a good time. And I want that for you. 

I just miss having your unique and sharp and simple breakdowns of a case that has been so complicated and felt so confusing (the AH/JD case). 
As someone who is still living with long-term consequences of prolonged emotional abuse (it's nearly 20 years later and I am still having a hard time trusting anyone or even functioning as an adult), this case really got to me. Hearing those tapes really punched me in the gut, emotionally. 
One of the things that have been so devastating for me, is that no-one believed me, and that's what I see repeated with Depp. 
...and the let-down and despondency so many victims of abuse felt collectively after the UK ruling...! Well I know I'm not the only one who took that really hard. 

I continue to follow this case because I am so personally invested, but I really miss your expert, clear-cut and qualified analysis and take on the developments. 
I would so much like to hear your opinion on the paper that just came out, using the UK ruling as a case study and minutely and systematically assessing the credibility of AH. The paper is called ""Assessment of Credibility of Testimony in Alleged Intimate Partner Violence: A Case Study"" and can be found here https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/24732850.2021.1945836",damnitalexis,1,2021-08-03T14:36:11Z
3,UgxUMkUhmSAmpxQy0rd4AaABAg,"I think I got about half way through this to figure out that Justice Nicol has obviously been paid off here. Lets not forget that The Sun is in a bad way and is owned by one of the richest and  most powerful men in the world, Rupert Murdoch.

I have little legal knowledge but even I am speechless at this stuff. I even ask the question as to why the trial was necessary when Nicol could have made this judgement from a brief internet search. But then, British courts are appalling and judges are as corrupt as you want them to be. Nicol probably only got this position because he was a friend to someone else and not because of his nous.",Noel Whinyates,0,2021-06-17T12:39:17Z

Saying things like Johnny is rich and powerful and would have stopped anyone from speaking out is out of the question after a powerful man such as Weinstein was taken down, then so can Johnny. Yet, contrary to that, we have his exes come in full support for him. If a man lays hands on a woman, he wont stop at one. Over the years; he has been in very public relationships and one even lasting to 14 years and yet there has never been even an inkling that he was a wife beater or woman beater and here comes Heard, divorcing him after 3 days after his mother died and filming him whilst in grief really says something. With false promises of donating 7 mil and   selling the press her sob story and destroying his career. I just feel like she was in it for the money and obviously 7 mil wasnt enough.

71,UgzOCo8w3gji5IY5YKZ4AaABAg,"According to a few lawyers I‚Äôve heard talking about this, the judge used some Olympian contortionist level logic to reach his decision. He disregarded third party testimony and recordings, including from police officers. Essentially claiming these third party witnesses would lie for Depp and the any recording of Heard admitting to being the abusive one(instigating fights, chasing Depp down when he tries to avoid a fight, calling him names and demeaning him, etc.) by arguing Heard wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúunder oath‚Äù in those recordings so they can‚Äôt be trusted.

He made no such claims about Heard‚Äôs audio recordings, despite the fact Depp wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúunder oath‚Äù during the recording of those. I‚Äôve listened to hours of audio, both from Heard and Depp, and they all convey the same things. Heard admitting to instigating the violence, calling Depp a coward because he ‚ÄúKnows how she is with her anger‚Äù and should stay and let her ‚Äúexpress her anger‚Äù towards him. Those recordings have all of the hallmarks of an reciprocally abusive relationship, but they also show that Heard is the abuser by her own words and actions. Depp being the victim of abuse and trying his best to avoid confrontation while still trying to stand up for himself.

Anyone who has been in an abusive relationship will recognize Heard‚Äôs manipulation, projection and justification for why she is violent with Depp. Something you never hear Depp say despite hours of audio. I‚Äôve yet to hear him once say any violence he may have committed was justified and that Heard deserved it.

Time was only an Issue because both Amber and the judge took massive chunks of time either saying ‚Äúwait a minuet then asking what an aspect pertained to even though he had every bit of evidence and written/photographed testimony in front of him and Amber answering questions with long answers when they were strictly YES/NO questions,and also her Incredibly Outrageous Speech damning Johnny In Public while his attorneys were submitting their Fjnal statements!! It‚Äôs an unbelievable The fact that the judge constantly allowed all of it until a critical point arose where HE himself would have been questioned about his legal conduct of the trial. and also the fact that Amber rambled On and On as to make sure there was marginally reduced time to produce Venessa and Winona who because they are Female.....were Critical to Johnny‚Äôs case and the judges decision (and also how the judge threw Another females testimony out is unbelievable)
there would have been obvious character building progress if Vanessa/Winona‚Äôs testimony were included,because it would have FORCED the judge to consider there testimony ‚Äúunder oath‚Äù which is the Allowance he gave Amber.

It seems painfully obvious that this judge was tapped on the shoulder and ""guided"" to his judgment. American law (from my understanding) is largely based on precedent, meaning that (if the same is true in the UK courts) this judgment - if found in JD's favor - could have a wide-ranging impact on future cases. That was one of many reasons why I was so personally interested in the outcome. Tabloid journalism has had a nice run, being able to assert whatever narrative they choose if they simply skip through certain legal loopholes but a judgment in favor of JD could threaten their status quo. When situations like this arise, I ask ""What is the real reason?"". Good, bad or indifferent why did the judge rule this way? It's patently obvious that his decision was influenced by external factors, the evidence does not support his conclusion.

214,Ugy0rv-mS1sdAXb3D6B4AaABAg,"As a woman, I am absolutely appalled by Amber's behavior. This is not how a woman should behave. As a psychologist, I understand she has a myriad of issues and in the end she does what she knows and feels, which by no means is an excuse, as she is fully aware of her actions, as well as difference between right and wrong, good and bad.

This being said, my interest in the cases between Johnny and Amber has showed me that there is still a gender inequality, which instead of being balanced out with the previous attempts of shedding light over all the times women have been subjected to domestic violence, which used to be almost always shunned and disregarded, now we have the pendulum swayed the other direction, where men have been seen as the immediate enemy to women, condemned to be the abusers with or without proof. I believe that the law should always be blind to race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, etc, and such bias should always be strictly avoided, by always focusing on the facts! I'm really not a law expert, yet I could easily understand how the law in this particular case has wronged Jonny, based upon gender bias and most likely also public opinion. A judge who names a male as innocent in a domestic violence case, must face a huge lot of public disagreement, since the latest developments of the #MeToo movement. So there's the public opinion fear bias. Yet, to the public it's obvious that Johnny is an innocent man. Still that public can easily be attributed as ""Johnny fans"" and disregarded as they might be biased by their preference toward Depp. But that is exactly why the law has the instruments of evidence and professional expertise in various spheres of assessment. I'm at awe by the incompetence this judge shows in his comments and judgment, even if I take in or out the idea of possible conflict of interest. If the latter is true, then his incompetence also borders with outright impudence! And honestly, Johnny's team would be indeed crazy if they don't attempt to declare mistrial and dismiss the decision of the judge, not just appeal it! I wonder how come his team hasn't dug that conflict of interest sooner and filed for a recusal of the judge? But I guess they thought it's an open/shut case with all the proof on Johnny's side...

Anyway, on a side note: that text, where Johnny describes Amber? I laughed sincerely to it! He does that - getting that creative with insults when he vents, with quite a few of his movie characters. One can see that same creativity with insults in FaLiLV, PotC, TAW, Blow, OUaTiM, SW, etc. It's really hilarious that a judge would take that as a direct proof of anger and as if he indeed is responsible for being a wife beater, based on that specific reaction. That would only mean that his characters were also wife beaters or at least he was one during the filming of all of those movies... It's hilarious!",RandomSauce,1,2020-11-15T13:29:40Z

I really wish Johnny had nanny cams in his apartments.  I really so but I understand he is very private.

Abuser Turd makes me sick, when I heard her in those tapes I knew that she was the abuser.  Its exactly how my ex talks to me.  I still support JD even though I've never been a huge fan of his I definitely respected his work.

I can only take solace in that there are multiple parallel universes where JD did not end up with AH at all.  Hell he might have even ended up with me and we'd have been happy üòÇ 
Or one where I invented spacetime travel and went back and warned him. Fuck there might even be one where AH is the famous one and JD is the golddigging abuser and she just lost her case because in that universe its unthinkable for a man to be physically abusive....IDK.  I am happy that there are so many supporters for male DV victims.  I really hope that the US trial goes better.

As for the judges determination?

If the judge had ruled in favor of Depp, the backlash from radical feminists, woke twitter mobs, etc, would - have - been - COLOSSAL. I honestly think #MeToo would have been protesting on the streets.
Despite their claims to the contrary, radicals aren't interested in truth or justice, they fight to maintain a black and white narrative fed by mob-think. And they will use any means possible, including collective intimidation and/or downright lying to maintain control. 
Bottom line, the judge had to weigh the backlash from Depp fans against the fury of woke mobs labeling him as a ""misogynist"" and ""a tool of the oppressive patriarchy""  I think he took the easier of the two options - the coward's way out. But he didn't own his cowardice. Psychology observes that the more intelligent an individual, the more competent they can be at complex self-deception. This judge was using all of his mental faculties to convince HIMSELF that Depp was guilty, because any alternative conclusion would have unleashed the most almighty shit storm, and he would have been stuck right in the middle of it, being judged himself and ultimately condemned by the new inquisition. 
This is the world we now live in. Very few individuals or institutions are demonstrating the courage to stand up to woke. Witness the way the tabloids are also turning on Depp now, like capricious teenagers in a schoolyard. None of them have the courage to question the ruling.

easier, even with some loss at first.

Being violent, aggressive, lying, selve serving, manipulative and criminal is AH. Johnny Depp is a kind person who was caught by a venus flytrap.

475,UgyvH46wdgPwMaEg_Hp4AaABAg,"Thanks for posting this video. I have been waiting for your comments on this judgement.
When Amber first accused Johnny, I was inclined to believe her story. I did so with some reservations because accusations of abuse can be a legal ploy in divorce.
When Johnny was willing to put everything on the line to sue for libel,  I started to have doubts about Amber's story. Why would Johnny take this risk? 
The videos and audio recordings convinced me that Amber was both an abuser and a predator. She targeted a rich,  powerful man.  She was unable to keep up the facade as his perfect match. The pressure of trying to control him sent her into rages and she responded to his independence with physical, verbal and mental abuse.
Johnny's distress showed outwardly, with his dramatically changed appearance. This is so common in abuse victims, it actually appears in movies (check out the Burning Bed). Thankfully, leaving Amber reduced his stress somewhat.
Amber saw benefit in slandering Johnny after their seperation. The more public abuse she heaped on him, the more famous she became.
This judgement is a farce. Amber stalked Johnny, reeled him in, abused him during their marriage and continued to abuse him through the press after their seperation.
She scrambled and floundered to defend her behaviour during the court case. 
This was a terrible miscarriage of justice. I had hoped that this case would open the conversation about domestic abuse being an across-gender issue. This may still happen, if people pay attention to information of the type to provide.",karen berg,0,2020-11-09T15:31:43Z

The courts ruling was ONLY that johnnys carrer didnt suffer because of the artical therefore the court doesnt feel the sun is liable to pay those damages.

493,UgzhGYZx-I-7MPLkNNl4AaABAg,"Looking over this again I ultimately think it was a public policy decision. The judge must have been concerned about raising the standard of evidence too high to the detriment of domestic abuse victims who will frequently not have a solid body of evidence due to the nature of the offences. The Uk courts do not have a good reputation for accommodating the inherent disadvantages domestic abuse victims will face in proving their case in law. And here the court was put on the public stage. The Claimants put in their claim in very strong terms against Amber - ‚Äúnarcissist, psychopath, gold digger‚Äù,  and made the point at the outset that there was no middle ground here - one was a liar and the judge must decide. So it‚Äôs hardly surprising that a 60 something year old judge acting as sole judge and jury, married to a notable woman‚Äôs equality campaigner, would never have the nerve to make a judgement which would inevitably be interpreted as agreeing with such a scathing portrayal of a potential domestic abuse victim before the world. Not in the era of Metoo and following the scandals of a string high profile powerful men who used their means to escape justice for years and threw all sorts of mud at those who spoke out against them. And if a member of the public gives the matter a superficial glance, Amber Heard‚Äôs case looks half-decent. Evidence of injuries, witness statements...a layperson would probably see this briefly in the media and, if Depp succeeded, be surprised that this kind of evidence wasn‚Äôt enough to prove it in a civil court. So they‚Äôd think, ‚Äúwell proving it in criminal court must be virtually impossible‚Äù. So this could act as a deterrent for genuine abuse victims who would otherwise speak up. The judge probably imagined he was doing something noble and necessary for the greater good, and was justified in making Depp the sacrificial lamb because in his eyes it‚Äôs only a spoilt lying drug addict with a malicious desire to exploit the courts to get one over on his ex. Equity‚Äôs ‚Äúclean hands‚Äù attitude seems to be pervasive in the courts of this country. It‚Äôs this ‚Äúwell you haven‚Äôt been a model citizen and if you‚Äôre going to misbehave then don‚Äôt expect any help from us‚Äù. It‚Äôs that aggravating, passively resistant attitude based on this idea they seem to have that they‚Äôre doing you a favour by listening to your case, that access to justice is gratuitous and that there is something audacious in an attempt to make use of the justice system or commencing litigation. In my opinion this judgement is disgraceful. Even if you were to agree with the overall ruling,  the content/reasoning is so offensive to everyone with a brain and principles.

If Johnny cant even get a win in defamation not talking about actual domestic violence. With the evidence he has. What chance does the average Joe have? Reminds me when I was a kid how I witness my uncle's wife slash his face with a knife and she called the cops on him and was arrested. They divorced, lost his home, and business. I know Johnny is continuing to fight. But I know things wont change much. People will feel bad for Johnny for a couple of months but the story will be a dust in the wind in a couple years. But what's sadder is Hollywood will treat Johnny like a has been or worse like a wife beater. Leading to young potential fans  to treat him as such. Leading to them not investigating the injustices done to him. The universities will continue to push these notion that women are these docile being that can in no way make any bodily harm. In term we will have future judges coming out with these pre conceived notions and make judgments based on that, like this judge. And I know its in the UK but we kid ourselves if we don't think courts aren't similar in terms of cultural held beliefs. Unfortunately I don't think Johnny Depp will be strong enough to bring awareness to this issue. Unfortunately the media control what social issues are relevant.As mentioned before its looking like Hollywood wants to ostracize Johnny so his impact wont be felt. And as long as they don't think female on male violence is an actual issue. Nobody will pay attention. Worse, they push the ""she hurt him so he must have done something wrong"" narrative.

525,UgyBDLUBasxXyOFRy0J4AaABAg,"I was waiting for your analysis as well. I actually been through lawschool, but I don't work in the exact field for the time being, and has not worked as a lawyer. I also been through a though divorce and custody battle with my own ""Amber""(the same time I went through law school in Sweden, out of pure. .. anger maybe ..) I still see the law system as almost our last frontier for pure trust in our society. Even though I've seen some questionable things. My first court case was over my children being kidnapped to another EU country by their father. His country was quite a new member og EU and the court really favored their own citizents. But according to the hague convention the children should be returned in max. 6 weeks. The Judge continously prolonged the procedured to more than a year. He was under preassure. The prosecuter, she was great, and I had the minister of forreign affairs, the Swedish embassy and the biggest newspapers in the country on my side. Even their Prime minister took an interesst and made a beneficial statement. The Judge was sneaky. Suddenly he retired without giving the verdict, he thought he could get away with it wich had meant I had to have started all over again. Anyway he was forced back, but it all prolonged the case even more. When the kids were back in Sweden the custody procedure went through three trials over 4 years. Two of the Judges were greate. One could see how they really took their ""call"" serious. The first an older man I had great respect for. He retired during the time, but it did not start over. Two middle aged females were to Judge in each and every trial. One was great as well, so correct and out to get justice and a correct verdict (and I do see it as objective I can, not everything was beneficial to me, but in retrospective I don't have any complaints of the Judges) But, there was one Judge, I could not believe what wad going on. Neither did my lawyer. I really got the feeling that she was bribed, corrupt or very manipulated. She was giving a verdict (altough a custodyprocedure) similair to this one, in the Case Depp/Heard. She was totally bias to my ex-husband, who by all means could manipulate people, but he hadn't been able to do so with any other professionals envolved. To mention, it was during a time when the trend was to favour the fathers, since there had been alog of cases where the mothers unjustified got custody and even had won cases on lies. It was also ""dangerous"" to go against any forreigner, because the word racist was used as a weapon in ridicolus situations. Anyway, after some more battles it worked out well. I tried to check this Judge up, a while ago and I found out she was not a Judge any longer. Could be any reason. But I wonder, she must be caught sometimes if she continued her way. I was so dissapointed that Johnny would have a Judge like this. I mean, he should be seriously investigated. This is not right. I finish by telling you I finnd you so competent. It is noticeble how well prepard, and how much research and work you put into every video. You really give something, alot, to us, your audience. I was surpriced to hear. How young you are.

555,UgyokN_fNoJkRnfl1g14AaABAg,The word on the street is that the UK judge was a mentor to Amber's lawyer and that Judge's wife is best friends with Amber's lawyer's wife and that Elon Musk or Rudolph from the Sun paid the judge off.,LaraCroftEyes1,0,2020-11-08T17:27:32Z
556,Ugwv5OgoXzIRozOItjF4AaABAg,"this judgement seems to be highly unprofessional and i am shocked that the judge was so unbothered about being this blatantly biased. the amount of double standard  in AHs favor is truly shocking!!  if Depp is granted an appeal and wins it, could the judge have any negative repercussions or be held responsible in any way for such conduct? or is it legally permitted to be this level of bias?",Arthropology,3,2020-11-08T17:18:04Z
557,UgwAlmMkpQL9fIf21_V4AaABAg,Not only did the judge cherry pick the evidence. The judge also allowed Amber Heard to bring in (out of context and cherry picked) confidential information from the VA trial (and ordered Depp not to sanction her in VA) BUT Depp could NOT bring any of the confidential marked evidence that would benefit or impeach her!,TheRealLauraB,2,2020-11-08T17:11:06Z
558,Ugwb7fVCE1wafYdpuxd4AaABAg,I don't follow high-profile marital cases really except this one. I guess because of the me too movement. But what I am really disappointed about this case is how gender bias can undermine the real victims and what me too movement really stood for.,Nelsie Geografo,0,2020-11-08T17:06:26Z
559,Ugy1568cBiJbBsxOAuh4AaABAg,"Depp was found guilty of 12 of the 14 counts of domestic abuse. Care to explain how all 12 of them are false; especially since if even one is true then the Sun would win their case by proving Depp is a wife-beater.

-------------------------Incident 2-------------------------
The tape was irrelevant as it didn't relate to the 12 domestic abuse claims. The text messages did.

-------------------------Incident 8-------------------------
A judge is free to decide what is most likely to be true if there are conflicting accounts. They're also free to decide what the victim was most likely to be feeling.

Nothing prevents Depp from writing using paint or lip-stick. Even if Amber did write this does it have any impact on whether this was domestic abuse or not?

-------------------------Incident 9-------------------------
It's not impossible to hit someone with a cast. Especially if it's on your dominant hand.

What would it mean for this case if the can of Red Bull was thrown? If nothing them it's irrelevant.

If there's no expert evidence then the judge is free to make an assumption about what is most likely to have happened.

What would it mean for this case if Amber did scratch Depp? If nothing them it's irrelevant.

What's wrong with a judge accepting the account of someone who saw the injury but not of someone who never saw the injury?

-------------------------Incident 13-------------------------
Do you have any evidence regarding how large dog poo is for that type of dog? If not then it remains possible that it came from the dog.

-------------------------Incident 14-------------------------
The absence of written notes does make their testimony less reliable. Notes do not change, witnesses' memories do.


Even if the 5 incidents you mentioned were all fake that still leaves 7 other incidents of wife-beating. So Depp would still lose this case and would be a proven wife-beater. 

You whine about dangerous assumptions but you clearly haven't read through the evidence to see how accurate these assumptions were. Before the trial did Depp's employees blindly obey him or did they ever stand up to him?

You seem to have forgotten that this was a libel case about Depp, which is why anything to do with Amber's character was irrelevant. That's not the judge being biased it's him doing his job.

Until you address all these incidents this video is nothing more than cherry-picking the parts you think were weak and ignoring all the parts that prove you wrong.",uanime1,1,2020-11-08T17:01:48Z

Hearing the outcome was a large enough blow but when I actually read the judge's findings I confess I broke down in tears and am still profoundly affected by what was and, more to the point, was not to be found therein.
Having been brought up in such a toxic environment, this all resonates deeply with me and am sure with so so many others. This is us effectively being told that standing up to your abuser will get you nowhere and that lies, gaslighting and toxicity can win through despite all evidence you may hold to the contrary.
Part of me wants to believe that blackmail, bribery and corruption played a part in this egregious verdict, but as anyone who has been involved with such an overwhelming amount of physical, psychological and emotional abuse, you start to second-guess your own initial gut instincts and, even when the evidence is there in front of you, you can shy away from it too, for fear that it will bring about more abuse.
I hope that Johnny does go ahead with his appeal and that this time the truth will truly come out.

706,UgxA3Y-77lTwkDCqUZJ4AaABAg,"Welcome to the ugly side of the British Judicial system. The following is from an article published in 2013. Just imagine how many more cases there are...
Judge Peter Bowers
Judge Peter Bowers refused to jail a paedophile for accessing images of child abuse, saying ""he'd have a hard time"" in prison.

Judge Bowers is famous for refusing to jail a burglar after saying it took a ""huge amount of courage as afar as I can see for somebody to burgle somebody's house.""

He was officially reprimanded for damaging public confidence in the courts.

Judge Mark Lucraft

Judge Mark Lucraft refused to send a paedophile who abused children aged seven and eight to jail because it would cause ""suffering"" for his family.


Judge Julian Hall
Judge Julian Hall has been criticised on several occasions for his comments in sexual abuse cases.

In 2007, he jailed a window cleaner for two years for the rape of a ten year old girl. In his summing up he commented on the ten-year-old's clothing was ""provocative"" and that she looked 16.

Earlier the same year, he suggested that another victim of child sex abuse could be bought a bicycle ""to cheer her up.""


Judge David Paget
In 2002, Judge David Paget handed down a suspended sentence to a paedophile who police believe was part of ring that abused hundreds of children over many years.

80-year-old Trevor Mellis was given two years probation for taking and distributing images of child abuse. Despite having a string of sexual abuse convictions against children, he never served any time in jail.


Judge John Prosser
In February 1993 Judge John Prosser freed a 15-year-old boy found guilty of raping a 15-year-old virgin and suggested he could pay his victim ¬£500 for a good holiday to ""get over the trauma.""


Judge Ian Starforth Hill
In June 1993 Judge Ian Starforth Hill described the 8-year-old victim of attempted rape as ""not entirely an angel herself"" and gave her attacker two years probation.


Judge Sir Harold Cassel
Judge Sir Harold Cassel QC in 1988 refused to jail an ex-policeman for indecently assaulting his 12-year-old stepdaughter, who had learning difficulties.

He said the man was driven to assault the girl because his wife's pregnancy had dimmed her sexual appetite, causing ""considerable problems for a healthy young husband"".

Judge Cassel was strongly rebuked by Lord Mackay, the Lord Chancellor, and retired early on medical grounds.",Amy George,5,2020-11-07T16:20:35Z

It should have been made clear that she is lying, and there was no possibility she sustained those injuries. 

They should have delved into the effects of her unjustified use of Modafinil, which can cause irritability, anger and mood swings. Focusing on this would counter the emphasis that was put on JD's drug use. 

They should have taken an image analysis expert to show that her photos were, in fact, manipulated, and also to dispute the ""undisputed"" metadata.

715,Ugxce8t_KyzDI9c94_l4AaABAg,"Another frustrating part of this was the UK charity Refuge released a statement regarding the trial; they talked about how victims (in reference to Amber) are constantly told that they won't be believed and how this is proof that money fame and power (aka Johnny) cannot be used to silence women. This would have been such a powerful message but, when used in reference to a ruling that was very clearly biased and poorly-handled (also when they seem to ignore the fact that Amber is also rather rich and famous), it sounds ironic at best and appalling at worst.

If anything, this is a step backwards for abuse victims as a whole (because this showed that evidence can be discounted due to bias and that judges can just make assumptions about your character, the circumstances of injuries and testimonies on a whim, thus reinforcing the mindset that you may not be believed), but if you want to focus specifically on women as victims, it's even worse. I can already see the terrible handling of this case being used to try and accuse women of being liars regardless of outcome and the idea of that makes me so angry. Even if Amber was innocent, people would still easily use these inconsistencies to discredit the case and her, so it wasn't even really a victory in that sense either.

It's infuriating that one man's strange decisions have meant that, no matter what happens going forward, there's very little hope of either side ever being believed by outsiders because of how much can be contested and cherry-picked (which normally wouldn't matter in the long run, but their living is based on being in the public eye). It really does suck.

That's basically how this judge treated Amber Heard.

This is true for many jurisdictions in the US, Canada, GB, Australia and likely true for much of the rest of the world who uses them. There have been several cases in the US and Canada where the person the order was taken against was tracked by the person who took the order (some of them likely under false pretenses, although proving that is difficult at best) through locators (phone location or GPS devices) so they could be in the same restaurant, theater or other venue that the ordered person was closer than the restriction proximity in the order and the protected person could have the ordered person arrested and jailed for a ""created"" situation.  This makes for some very strong evidence against the ordered person in family court and child custody cases and, since the order commonly puts all the non-contact requirements on the ordered person, can make for some damming evidence against them.",Bear,0,2020-11-07T14:02:47Z

JD was up against Rupert Murdoch's corporation, not an organization known for the very best practices e.g. their extensive phone hacking history and Murdoch's own statement that he didn't like Brussels because, unlike Downing Street, he could not control it . Personally I'm not a great fan of Musk and clearly it is not impossible that he used his financial power to influence things IF that is what happened. What it must remind us is the importance of not allowing extreme wealth, status or power to overturn the truth. Even from what we all heard and saw of the trial, it seems impossible to believe this is a sound decision. Given what has been revealed about Amber's past transgressions including the  very public physical abuse of her ex-partner, the lies about the smuggling of the dogs to Australia and what feels like endless  testimony by such persons as  highly qualified police officers and others who have no 'dog in the fight', it is bizarre. If JD is indeed innocent and actually the subject of the abuse, I do hope that his big gun supporters including the Hollywood ones get behind him for an appeal and that he comes out triumphant in both that and the Virginia case. If that happens, it will be an important victory for decency and Democracy itself. Whatever, at the very least I think that Nicol will soon rue the day he handed out such a decision. Whether JD is innocent or not, Nicol's decision lacks credence as it stands. His apparent connection to the Heard camp is also of grave concern.

Balance of probabilities isn‚Äôt a difficult threshold to meet in a case where the Claimant is forced to rely on a hoax narrative that sounds so far-fetched. I‚Äôm assured that that shouldn‚Äôt matter but it seems inevitable that it does. 

In my opinion Johnny Depp lied about a number of things, the most obvious of which being the cigarette burn. I don‚Äôt buy that Amber stormed up to him after just injuring his finger and committed this spontaneous act of extreme sadism which she‚Äôd never done before and which was never mentioned again. It read like a lie in all the witness statements and it didn‚Äôt help the Depp has a history of severe self harm. With a fan base of goths and Emos he would only have gained sympathy as a victim driven to selfharm by their abuser. And the judge wouldn‚Äôt have dared suggest that ability to selfharm bore any connection to ability to harm another for fear of being chased by a social justice mob.  But instead they went in guns blazing, throwing all sorts of extravagant derogatory labels on Heard like ‚Äúnarcissistic psychopathic gold digger‚Äù. All Heard has to do is show evidence of a successful long term relationship to dispel the psychopath claim at least.

But to give you an example of the cynicism of our race, I'll mention a woman from my home town (real name is changed) and her many accusations against the local men about town.

This woman, who shall be named Shelley, has accused 14 different men of raping her. All complete attention seeking bollocks. At 38 years, Shelly was living with a woman who acted as a ""therapist"" of a sort. Damn psychiatry and their wishy-washy ways; why did we every let that social so-called science enter our emerald isle? Anyway, one day the therapist's 21 year old gay son popped round. ""Rape!"" Shelly cried. Of course every accusation has to be taken seriously, so a garda and his ban garda partner (that's a male cop and a female cop respectively to the rest of you) came round to investigate accusation number fourteen. When they arrived, the ban garda took point -- as a member of the fairer sex, she could speak plainly to the fairer sex. ;) When she entered the sitting room and engaged Shelly the first words out of the ban garda's mouth were, ""So what lies have you been telling now, Shelly?""

I think there's a significant issue with the anglo-saxon race. They've lost the ability to speak bluntly and without fear of political incorrectness. That's never been an issue for the Irish. And that's why he would've won here.",Ross Furey,0,2020-11-07T04:09:27Z

For me it¬¥s proof, that the #MeToo movement - once founded to support abused women - has turned into a misandr√≠st attack on men, promoting the ""BelieveAllWomen"" mantra, regardless whether they are innocent or not. This twisted fake feminism has infested society and even reached court. Johnny had not the slightest chance of winning this case from the very start. I see this as a very dangerous progress in the justice system, as it turns itself into injustice, bowing to the completely fictitious assumption, that women can only be victims and men can only be perpetrators. This verdict is frivolous, dangerous, harmful to every male victim of abuse and a freepass for women to lie about abuse. Furthermore the judge opened the door for press to defame Johnny even more. As a result he was kicked off filming Fantastic Beasts III. The judge has done serious harm and in my eyes completey failed in his job to serve justice and truth. For any negative outcome for Johnny after the verdict I hold this judge responsible. I don¬¥t think, appeal will help.

Seeing your breakdown of the judgement and evidence here just makes it even more obvious and shocking to me; for example the notes of Ambers therapist Erin Boerum- in Johnny‚Äôs favour they were dismissed yet the very same notes were taken as gospel when it favoured Amber,  and the rest was twisted so that it could portray Johnny as the jealous insecure type, even when those terms clearly refer to AH. 
A ridiculous ruling, and I hope it is highlighted as such when Johnny appeals. It is unfathomable to me that such an unjust ruling can be allowed in a UK court, but then I know that this wouldn‚Äôt be the first (or last) time the justice system failed.

941,UgwBl06KhsHymedJCKV4AaABAg,"Thank you once again for your clear, concise     & informative video. Like many , I was astounded by the biased  & inconsistent judgement passed down on 2/11/20. With so much concrete evidence on his part, that was  completely waived in favour of her own  questionable ones, it makes you realize how difficult it must be for a  victim, without all this proof, or the wealth to employ top barristers,  to put their case forward and be believed. The judge did a great disservice to all domestic violence and emotionally abused people who will probably think, what is the point of trying to clear my name  and get justice.

The emotional  abuse continues for him and will do so until the VA trial and hopefully his appeal takes place, but those are months away and only then can the slow and difficult   healing  truly begin, but it takes years to fully recover and this emotional turmoil has already gone on for over 4 years since their divorce.

And today 6/11/20 the fallout continues with the announcement that WB have asked him to resign from FB3. 

We know he has his problems, who of us do not in someway, it is part of life to gave ups and downs. But one thing is blatantly clear from all the evidence, in whatever form, Johnny Depp is the victim in all this.  I truly hope justice will prevail and he is exhoronated.

I understand it‚Äôs defamation versus libel‚Äîbut also I think they had an NDA type agreement in their divorce settlement which she definitely violated. But NDAs are getting a lot of pushback these days too. And I do believe the judge in UK did not want to be the judge that ruled against a woman in the #metoo era. It‚Äôs so heartbreaking but not surprising that the first woman to use this movement to her advantage would be a psychopath and abuser. They need to bring full guns to VA and make sure it makes it into court. And they need to show that she used johnnys addiction against him and he was blackout wasted during these accounts and she told him he did these horrible things and his guys went along with her because as we saw, anyone who doesn‚Äôt go along with Amber is going to suffer and lose their job. And so many people are conflict avoidant and just say, ‚Äúyeah ok sure. I‚Äôll tell him.‚Äù They need to come in hard and get as much in as they can.

case in point, 2 circuit judges caught fiddling expenses.
One chose trial by peer, and found guilty
The 2nd chose trial by jury, and cleverly convinced the jury, that despite knowing law, he was ditzy when it came to accounting.
1st lawyer, struck off, the 2nd, was demoted and changed from criminal circuit to accident/ injury
 insurance circuit.
Links to articles verifying my statement can be provided.

In this instance, the Judge is politically remaining within the Me Too framework. And doesnt want the wrath of womens groups slamming him.
It is also said that newspapers get away with libel egregiously.
So, heres hoping Johnny gets his sober self into gear, and hammers the truth at his defamation case. 
One thing tho, the police officers that attended the birthday incident didnt write notes as they had no need to. They would have definitely protected an injured woman if that had been necessary, as DV is a large proportion of callouts.

1025,UgxWlYbzdSv6fx0yliN4AaABAg,"Shillings should be experienced enough to have had all recordings transcribed and sworn, before submitting them.  If this judge only pays attention to on oath utterances, then he has got those, sworn.  He made no reference to Amber's prescription medications, all of which would tend to redound to explosive, often psychotic episodes.  Furthermore her wine and illegal drug consumption would have exacerbated this.  The fact that although not allowed to get pregnant because of her acne pill, she made embryos with Elon and sought to do so with Johnnie, is unconscionable.

I feel Shillings, and Johnnie, picked the wrong battle.  The ridiculous Sun knew the minimum criteria for guilt to be adduced against Johnnie - preponderance of evidence...He had not launched a counter suit.  He was depending on his denials to swing ghetto implication of guilt to Amber.  This was not what this case was rigged for.

Maybe he should now libel her, carefully:  AH, husband beater, twotimer, walking drug fiend and fantasist...

1032,UgwA2iMBxC4ntUWRBe94AaABAg,"Thanks so much for this video. Does anyone feel incredibly uncomfortable/unable to comment about Johnny/the case after this verdict?  A number of my friends have made casual comments against Depp these past days, particularly following his leaving of the Fantastic Beasts franchise (one in particular who was following, and though not a fan of his acting, was supporting Depp having heard the tapes during the trial and then following the trial.  Now, with this result she has reverted to negative comments towards Depp/Depp's career.)  While I support Johnny personally just the same as pre-verdict, and so much in this judgement seems to me to have been decided by means of subjective personal opinion if not bias, nevertheless I feel uncomfortable to publicly disagree with a judicial decision.  The decision has been made and what does it say about me if I am unable to fully accept it?  Will I not accept it because I know the opposite to be true?  How can I *know* that?  Or will I not accept it because I believe I know better than a Judge?  Or do I just simply not want it to be true?  Neither say anything good about me.  What upsets me most about the trial is not even the result, but the fact that this is a libel case, yet the judgment reads like a indictment of Johnny's alleged (but deemed true) crimes with the Judge literally saying he believes it most likely all of Johnny's alleged deeds are true and that Amber did nothing wrong as far as he can think (which in fact surely shouldn't be part of the verdict as does it even matter for this case what Amber did or didn't do?  Yet still she can be deemed innocent?)  Though it isn't a case of Johnny's guilt - that is how the verdict reads to me.  I feel silenced and don't even know how I could talk about it in any case without my own prejudice because of course I have personal bias.  I always try to be objective of thought, but I am just a person and I cannot claim that to be fully true.  Anyway, whatever the result might be, I hope Depp is able to and does appeal and I certainly feel for him right now.",myelixir,0,2020-11-06T19:29:32Z

An accidental butting of collision of heads is not a headbutt. The term headbutt implies forceful intention and purpose. Which was not there.

If this was a woman who accidentally during an altercation hit her head against the man's head while trying to defend herself and get away, it would not be considered abuse.

It seems that Johnny has not lost his support base  Those who believed him still do .The trial in Virginia will be a different situation. A jury will decide the outcome and surely sensible people when shown the evidence will have serious doubts about Amber's motives and truthfulness. I agree the judgement was unbalanced but think it is unfair for some of the comments to call Judge Nichol corrupt or say there is a conflict of interest .If you are a lawyer it is likely you have other lawyers and their partners in your social circle. Amber was not on trial here, she was a witness. She had her story her photos, texts and video evidence of violence, property destruction etc and the judge believed her.

Mr. David Sellu
Justice Nicol was the judge in the trial of consultant surgeon David Sellu in November 2013. Sellu was found guilty of gross negligence manslaughter following the death of a patient under his care. He served 15 months imprisonment of a 30-month sentence.[4] After release Sellu's appeal against the conviction was successful in 2016.[5] The grounds for success were that Justice Nicol had failed to instruct the jury properly with regard to the meaning of the charge.[6] The jury had returned to court before reaching their verdict seeking further guidance, which was not forthcoming from Justice Nicol.[7]

You mentioned Geoffrey Robertson, the co-author of a book with Judge Nicol. His ex-wife, Kathy Lette, is also an author - she wrote ""How to kill your husband"" (available in all good book shops). Kathy Lette's previous husband is Kim Williams, he was in charge of Foxtel, which I believe is/was a Murdoch owned company so it's very likely Kathy Lette is acquainted with Murdoch. Amber Heard attended a dinner party at Kathy Lette's during the London trial. Isn't that cosy.",Mic Vaughan,7,2020-11-06T16:14:38Z

The thing that baffles me the most is that if all the judge needs is a 51% certainty that what the Wooton's article is factually correct, he could have used phrases such as ""on balance of probability"" instead of making assumptions and filling in the gaps while ignoring credible evidence and exercising blatant double standards. Statements like ""They must have been terrifying"" just comes across as unnecessary and flagrantly biased.

1248,Ugxg6X06F0R-YjKvvBB4AaABAg,"Thank you for your video. It was not an easy one, so I'm even more grateful. 

JD has done public declarations several times since 2016. That never shut her up... So I think he felt he did not have any more choice unless he wanted to be under her allegations all his life, not even talking about his children. Am I the only one noticing that he is never in public with Lily-Rose? She is now also a public figure and goes out with her mother. I am sure that without AH, he would also be proud to be seen in Film festivals with her, too. 

I don't know if the judge was corrupt. I can easily understand people thinking he is.
However, I do believe that as a human being, he can have his own strong bias. 
I also believe that he had his own agenda to move foward, at the expense of JD: Freedom of speech for the press (even tabloids) and Believe-all-women kind of feminism (not my kind). He can also have the misconception to think that this is for the greater Good. What is puzzling is why drag a innocent man into the mud  for that? He could have so easily been more subtil. I really don't understand.

I hope that he will be able to appeal and that the verdict can be overturned.
However, on the bright side, I am happy to see that Public Opinion is now more firmly on his side than it was in 2016.
And that is, in part, thanks to you and all your fellows YouTubers. 
Thank you so very much for that!",Ng Sylvie,3,2020-11-06T14:50:13Z
1249,Ugx_GCVS36-baPAbP9p4AaABAg,"The thing that stood out to me, was that no evidence was actually looked at and considered and thought about. Everyone here must have watched Incredibly averages video, and know about the Sun having a mix up of both the date and time of the Australian Incident. This was overlooked because anything Johnny provided wasn't looked at as evidence, but as an unreliable source. Also If the appeal process proceeds, does that mean he will get a new judge?

1254,Ugy7Y72Itwis1k8rGAl4AaABAg,"My take:  this case highlighted that in UK laws,  if a woman makes assertions on the stand under oath  of abuse she's given automatic deference. Ergo, she wins.  The bar is so high to impeach her testimony it's virtually impossible to do so.  This would seemingly be the only way we get a verdict that strains point by point to dismiss any evidence by JD.  This verdict screams,  'she said it's so, I must believe her.'   

This is also why The Sun's legal team brought her there.  She testified under oath. She wins.  Game. Set. Match. Never mind if she has been arrested for DV, never mind impartial uninvolved observers (LAPD) cannot corroborate her details.  She testified, she wins. 

Am I wrong?",Stephanie Sandlin,13,2020-11-06T14:45:51Z
1255,Ugzp7U0m0O3GY954zS94AaABAg,"So essentially; no witness would ever lie in court, unless said witness is Johnny Depp (or offering evidence/testimony in support of Johnny Depp)? Honestly, when this ruling was revealed, as a survivor myself, it felt like a punch in the gut. It does make me feel a tiny bit better to hear that it's ludicrous from a legal point of view as well. I sincerely hope that Johnny appeals, because this whole judgment screams of bias to me.",Niko,9,2020-11-06T14:44:14Z
1256,UgxgjRJVWESwmyyB9Ot4AaABAg,"Thank you so much for your continued excellent overview. Imo - the Judge had to establish AH's credibility, which clearly was in question in arriving at his judgement. I found the dismissal of 'expert witnesses' deplorable. AH refused their offer of medical treatment. AH was fully aware her dogs did not have the paperwork to travel, declaring to customs no animals, plus being involved in the deception of possible fraudulent certificates. The charitable donation comment was an OMG moment for me.JD produce medical discharge notes where the diagnosis of the injury was caused by 'velocity'. To conclude? I feel you have provided a sound skeleton argument for an appeal. x",Selene A,7,2020-11-06T14:44:08Z

1259,UgzeaMX3A59S8VOY1lR4AaABAg,There no judgement made on any facts what so ever full of insane assumptions. This either mean he a idiot or maybe something worse but there not enough info here to know for sure. The only thing here is the appeal is going to have multiple grounds for being granted and this only makes Depp look all the better in the public eye. If this does go to appeal and in front of a judge who see facts not fantasy then Amber is toast. The USA trails couldn't end up to now be far more damning now for Amber. Ohh and this is Amber of course she going to try and change it in court she can't help herself.,Eric M,0,2020-11-06T14:43:31Z
1260,UgwA_qMZpwdjdTYkYCZ4AaABAg,"My first thought is a general one. In recent years the UK courts have received much negative criticism as being the home for global libel tourism. Therefore i suspect the legal profession would be ‚Äòlooking for‚Äô a libel case they could rule against. I also do not discount Judge Nichol‚Äôs potential conflict of interest. Most importantly i think this case was part of a longer game; which is to win the Virginia trial. This case, win or lose, has set out the stage where a lot of other issues may well be drawn into the case. Infidelity is hugely frowned upon in Virginia courts so i expect that to be a growing aspect of future proceedings. I do not know whether they have managed to subpoena Elon Musk yet whom i believe could be involved with the charitable payments as well as extra-marital activity (and embryos!). Finally can i say over forty-five minutes of the beautiful Ms LB Pluto was a welcome treat for a Friday! Impressive work.",Silvermane 3XL,6,2020-11-06T14:42:52Z

Re working with vulnerable adults I would be reprimanded severely if I wrote notes with such bias and including my personal thoughts. Thus, not relying on facts and opinions of qualified trained colleagues and associates.

It's not even a subtle train of thought, it's has giant inconsistencies as to why he supports Heard. I'm very curious to see how this information will be handled with the VA trial as well as the possible appeal in the UK. I wish Australia would say something, but I guess we'll just have to enjoy the sound of crickets for now!! Thank you for sharing your expertise and information in making this video!!

This so called judge is the biggest clown under the sun. Shame on him! Shame on all the tabloids but then again, what would you expect from them? I think we all believed in justice and believed that a judge would make the right decision and none of us was prepared for this kind of joke of a verdict.
It's so very frustrating to see amber being called ""brave"" in media. No, Johnny is brave, Kate James is brave, Kevin Murphy is brave, Jennifer Howell is brave. The list goes on. She might be happy now with her champagne shaped balloons but she is the most hated public figure and she will never get any real selfless support or friends and she will ""die a lonely man"".

The British legal establishment would not have tolerated victory for Depp in this case, because in order to side with the plaintiff, the judge would have to declare publicly that he believes that the balance of probability is that a woman is lying.   This is not possible for any judge in a civil case at the moment and even in criminal cases it is not possible to say it in explicit terms.    Like all of you I held out some hope,  but to date there is no light at the end of this particular tunnel.   I was right, and I hate it.",TheGreatSnoozer,2,2020-11-06T13:55:53Z

The problem with this statement? This case has been in the public eye, from the beginning. So in a sense, that's just not going to happen. Truthfully, the general public has already made it's choice, and no disrespect intended towards the legal system, they simply, like myself, feel that the decision made was more out of concern that his decision could seriously effect his future, rather than based on evidence. Either way, this will in no way end his career, turn the public masses against him, or destroy his life. This is the fun thing about technology. It allows the public, a clear view of the case. Those of us who actually read them anyway. I highly doubt that the Judges decision in the Sun case or the upcoming case here in America, will change minds to much. She lied. Clear as day.
