48,UgxhAZ2i7oz1aQg3zhZ4AaABAg,nina mueller,"@KannaSure! Yet diversity is not being rewarded by western society.  Generally at the moment in our time what is being rewarded are those POWER WOMEN, cool and strong, performance-oriented, skinny or muscular, focused like a sniper, sharp as a knife. 

It always depends where you live and what keyhole you look at the world through... my view is actually this tainted. 

Those women I see are not women. The men are not men. 
Those are machines with vaginas and penises. 
Warmth, openness, calmness, gentleness, care and especially EASE ...none of that is present. 
Terrible status quo, that persists since dark ages.  
I miss the qualities in most men too, but with women, it is just a bit more striking. 
The torn faces, judgemental looks, clenched teeth, tired eyes ... 
The strength of a woman, as well as the strength of a man, has been misinterpreted for decades. 
For man being GENTLE and UNDERSTANDING is BELLOW common MANHOOD. 
For a woman to be GENTLE in the presence of UNGENTLE man is a THREAT. (vice versa, of course.) 
If a woman has to protect herself with dragon skin or get beaten emotionally(or otherwise) ... that is no life. That is survival. 
What kind of children do such women bring to this world? ...and so the cycle goes on and on and on... technical improvement, emotional/mental deterioration. We may have space ships but the dark ages of the soul persist.  I am no optimist any longer. One day a huge asteroid shall NOT miss the earth and all will be finished in a BIG BANG 2, without having improved much about OURSELVES.
I suck at being a woman too. I suck being true to myself, my nature. Well...at least I sense that I suck... that might be a beam of hope.

50,UgxhAZ2i7oz1aQg3zhZ4AaABAg,dorito smith,"@KannaWe're not saying it's wrong to show these types of women, it's not cause they do exist! What I don't like though is that hollywood often times when it comes to strong women or badass women, they show them being very masculine, one of the guys, tomboys, or basically acting like a dude, you know a man with boobs type of thing. When they do that it kind of creates this narrative that women can only be awesome if they act like men, giving this false idea that if you're feminine you're weak, when that's literally not the case! That's why I like the fact that they're giving us more feminine badass strong women characters instead of what I described above. Proving that you can be feminine and strong and awesome and all those great traits! That was my problem with captain marvel.",2019-04-17T22:25:29Z,0
