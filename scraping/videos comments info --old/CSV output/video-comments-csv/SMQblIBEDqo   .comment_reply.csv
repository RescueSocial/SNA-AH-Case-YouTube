Some Layed back, some become loose and free. Some become jokers. Some become friendly.  Now the other types. Some become sneaky and have to be watched. Some become sneaky and try taking for themselves. Then you have the ones nobody likes.  They become belligerent to people. Some think they are the cats ass. Some become obnoxious and violent and no one wants to party with them.  He is an addict in recovery  and admits to relapsing every now and then.
