116,Ugx6SRl8AhG7vUYTMVN4AaABAg,Kunal Singh,"@Sherree Wilson the audio proof are pretty clear though. There are hours of audio, Amber several times admit to hitting Depp with pots, pans vases fists etc etc. And her main reason for anger with Depp was that he didn't fight with her and acted as a pussy, leaving when any fight turned physical. Depp on his part often says that they can't be together if they have any physical alteration. I mean if Johny had ever been physical Amber would have somewhere mentioned it, but her issues are actually totally opposite of him not participating in fights.
The whole audio was even worse. She cut off tip of his lil finger for god's sake. Like who does that.
Considering all this with the false allegations and her playing the victim in public no wonder she is hated now.",2020-05-26T12:49:05Z,51

701,UgzRZyBmN2CykjKt-Bp4AaABAg,Melody Gaming,jamie hebert true maybe I was a bit harsh. Just he's a brilliant actor and a shame to see the franchise be ruined due to personal business,2018-12-02T13:39:45Z,1
702,UgzRZyBmN2CykjKt-Bp4AaABAg,RoadKill 961,Amber didn't really like them taking her claims that way as to fire him from every movie.,2018-12-02T08:42:03Z,0
703,UgzRZyBmN2CykjKt-Bp4AaABAg,Jamie Hebert,Not her business? Indeed it was her business! They were in a relationship for a long time and married. As far as him hitting her...you or none else knows what really happened.,2018-12-01T11:18:27Z,1

709,UgyMW8O1g14xig7rbc14AaABAg,Janelle Weed,"Actually, originally they WERE going to fire him-- they quickly realized their mistake when there was an outcry from the movie going population who has come to see Jack Sparrow for what he is: Funny, sexy, ridiculous and amazing all at the same time. They weren't even going to have Depp in the last movie at all and people complained and refused to go see it if he wasn't in it. So yes, as far as the community is aware, he is working on the last movie. Can't wait!",2018-12-05T10:59:06Z,8
