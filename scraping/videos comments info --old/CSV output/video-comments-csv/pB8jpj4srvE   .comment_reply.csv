""oh here we fucking go. A person acting like every court case is valid when that's clearly fucking false.""

Oh here we go. An incel acting like the court case wasn't valid because it didn't tell him what he wanted to hear.

""Some witnesses have come out against AH.""

Most were against Depp.

""Her sister confirmed to a witness that it was AH who almost pushed her down the stairs , not JD.""

She literally said the opposite. That's why Depp lost this case.

""It was also AH who willingly admitted to hitting JD constantly throughout their relationship.""

In a recording where Depp was manipulating her.

""He takes his anger out on kitchen appliances.""

And then attacked Amber on 12 different occasions.

""The audio recordings show this.""

If Depp had evidence of this he would have presented it during this trial.

""Don't forget security guards for the two claiming that AH would constantly hit him and do dhit like light cigarettes out on his face.""

You mean the ones who were paid by Depp and made claims that weren't supported by any evidence.

""Let's also not forget the judge's connections to both AH and the Sun newspaper.""

You're really scraping the bottom of the barrel because you don't want to admit Depp us guilty.

""Also yes, it is a vocal minority that defense AH.""

Which is why she has a job and Depp was fired.

""Every video featuring her in an interview or something is filled with omments on people that hate her.""

Your delusions are not facts and angry incels are not the majority.

""You're the one who's fucking delusional and lying.""

How would he carry himself? What would his posture be like?”

Depp and Bill Nighy, who played Jones in the “Pirates of the Caribbbean” movies, are not features in “A Pirate’s Life” — however, that doesn’t mean some voices from the films aren’t back. According to a Microsoft spokesperson, “For the main characters featured in the announce trailer such as Jack Sparrow & Davy Jones, the original cast aren’t featured, but the keener eared amongst you will have recognized Kevin McNally reprising his role as Gibbs. Rare have worked closely with the team at Disney Character Voices to ensure the characters you know and love sound as authentic as possible, and we look forward to players discovering more about the story and characters featured.
