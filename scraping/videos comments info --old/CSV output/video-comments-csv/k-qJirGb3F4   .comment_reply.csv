Emilia Clarke, I already loved her for her role as Daenerys from Game of Thrones and Qi'ra from Solo. She'll be perfect for being Mera.",2020-12-22T19:32:44Z,1

207,UgxonHbawQ-JinvdakN4AaABAg,Akil Brazier,@anime boy Agreed. This movie will be lucky if it does even half of what the first movie did if they keep her. And it sucks because I‚Äôm a big DC fan (I‚Äôm a marvel fan too) who loves Momoa as Aquaman and liked the first movie fine. WB knows they gotta get rid of her. It‚Äôs the right thing to do.,2021-01-18T17:16:32Z,0

Well, Heard's reputations is already ruined. I doubt there's any way for her to gain back the respect of, idk, everyone unless maybe she does the right thing which is admit and accept the consequences of her wrongdoings.",2020-12-29T04:52:10Z,2
213,UgxV4DkZrJZC611eoxl4AaABAg,Natasha Goode,"IIRC AH is contractually bound to her roll and it's fait accompli. These rumours are just that and no matter the size of the petition,  WB cannot remove AH unless she voluntarily resigns which she won't do. Sad, because EC is awesome and has excellent chemistry with JM, and is an awesome person. I think it is a blight on our society that AH gets away what abusing JD and viciously slandering his name. Turn those tables and he would never get away with that. Yes there is still a lot of inequity out there against us women. But I see it as a disease of society as a whole that society must fix together. This includes protecting all victims of DV like JD. Now, he is no damsel in distress innocent victim; he would have thrown some spectacular tantrums (wouldn't we all with a vile shrew like her?), but he us not a an innately violet person that she is painting him as. Push anyone too hard and they are going to lash out. That is consequence. Not predatory violence. I hope AH loses everything. Especially her media presence and relevance. She craves attention. Deny it. Let her fester alone and unknown. ;)",2020-12-12T02:12:24Z,10
