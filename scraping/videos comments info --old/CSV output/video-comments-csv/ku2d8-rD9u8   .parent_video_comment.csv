1,Ugx6L7ocEEveBh4RkCR4AaABAg,This is why JD produces his own movies. He doesn't need those bozos because he has so many fans that the films make money regardless of what studio is backing it. Anyone trying to suppress him will lose. He's a friggin' legend and the fat cats will die nameless without having made any impact on society. Johnny Depp will be forever reveared for his brilliant artistry like Picasso or Van Goh. The evil men that run Hollywood are jealous. It's obvious why JD doesn't spend a lot of time there.,Zo√´ Way,0,2021-08-10T01:09:22Z

4,Ugxdws4Gm3AHGNMl_vl4AaABAg,"Just when I was feeling proud of MGM for producing the movie they go and do something really stupid like this. I‚Äôve been looking forward to this movie for a long while now. There‚Äôs not even a slight possibility that these pointless antics from the movie producers will change anyone‚Äôs mind about Johnny Depp. He has behaved with unbelievable dignity through all this. I can‚Äôt even find the words to describe how despicable I think this all is. Shame on you, MGM, for caving in. Justice for Johnny Depp!!",Jannet Brown,0,2021-08-02T08:50:01Z
5,Ugx7eencZ1eSp4mTTG94AaABAg,"The letter was very well written. I have not yet seen Minamata, but I understand it's importance. It should not be ignored.",Peta Bulmer,0,2021-08-01T21:45:45Z
6,Ugz_TcInqVV0yNPYyzl4AaABAg,Wonder if part of the reason for suppression of the movie is the fear that US audiences might learn something about corruption in system and equate what happened in a foreign country and health impacts to what is going on with water and environment in US and such awareness would be problematic here? Thanks to Johnny and others who are speaking and showing truth. The Minamata movie should be shown here and not hidden and censored. We should not fear facts and truth. That is what I am thinking.,Dragon Queen,0,2021-08-01T12:41:02Z
7,Ugx5ydzu5eGX4rvLY794AaABAg,"You know what urks me though, amazon prime Netflix and Disney are showing all his movies, from pirates to chocolate to Edward scissorhands! Making money of of it, but letting him make new movies and showing them nooooo! I srsly wonder why they are so quick to believe that barn witch? And taking away HIS career? They HAVE to know by now they bet on the wrong horse? (literally), why are they doubling down on this? Does she have something on them to blackmail them? I just don't get it.",Welcome to the Rebellion,0,2021-07-31T14:33:30Z

14,Ugx-E68WW7MwHRSPL4h4AaABAg,All these movie studios are dang cowards. They are stupid. They think they are protecting reputations but in fact they are damaging them.

16,UgyJ9hjCyrrUWmhajbB4AaABAg,"The problem we face as the viewing/paying public is the studios get movies like, 'NO Time to Die' and hold it, every once in a while they'll tempt the public with sneak-a-peak trailer (see 'Fishman II:The Lost Audience' they use use clips from ""AQ:I' )and once they sense the earning maximum potential of James Bond or forgot how Fishgirl screwed over JD then they'll release it. Well here's one guy that will never forget what that gold digging, money grubbing shill.

26,UgzVkuaFds0FtemBot14AaABAg,"When Piers Morgan refused to apologise to Meghan Markle on Good Morning Britain it was all over the news even after it was only 73 calls to ofcom, obviously, there were more complaints after it was first reported on but my point is after only 73 complaints it was all over the news. JD has 10.8 million people backing him so far which continues to rise every day and almost 2 million signatures on a petition yet corporations continue to back AH with the producer now coming out and saying he refuses to listen to fans (you know the people who pay his wages) and that AH was always gonna be in Aquaman 2 regardless what the fans want. With such backing from influential and powerful people and corporations, I am starting to believe that AH not only planned it from the beginning but that she wasn't in on it alone and that she was probably planted into his life from higher influential people like Murdoch, I truly do not believe people realise just how powerful and influential this man is. He has held so much power of the UK government since the late 60's and own's large corporations in North America or has shares in large corporations and let's not forget he has an ongoing dispute with JD over the phone-hacking scandal from before JD even met AH, he has just as much to gain from taking JD down as AH.",Tanya Campbell,2,2021-07-30T15:37:45Z

42,UgwYCiMT7N4ddVqRKMR4AaABAg,Yes I find it strange that AH is allowed to be advertised in A2 & all other movies AH has been in when AH has admitted what she has done plus proven what AH has lied about yet they are having issue with showing movies which people need the world to see so they can get closure/justice because there is an actor in it were they have heard one bad thing & instead of doing there job & finding out all info they just look for the bare minimum so stupid(my opinion),PICK&MIX GAMER,28,2021-07-30T12:56:08Z
