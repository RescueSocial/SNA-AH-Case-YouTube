1,UgygaV27cRnMyx8cHWJ4AaABAg,Having to listen to Amber Heard made me think she easily sounded more insane than when Johnny Depp spoke. I felt far bad for Johnny than with Amber whenever I heard them speak in this conversation. Amber Heard sounds like she has clearly psychological problems and could be quite possibly one of the most immoral actresses the Entertainment industry might have ever had.,Benjamin Frazier,0,2021-07-19T05:40:20Z

He outright asks if she has physically abused him and she avoids the question and starts going on about how it doesn't even matter because she's a small woman and he's a big man.

You have to remember that she was the one recording him secretly in his kitchen, she was the on who walked in to the hotel room in San Francisco recording their conversations and also recording Laura Divenere without her consent, so I am 100% convinced that she was definitely recording this conversation but couldn't summit it as evidence because JD did it first. And for JD not denying the allegations he was already very aware of everything she was accusing him of, that's why he asks her if she really believes all of this, that he is an abuser, he also reminds her that she initiated every violent episode.",Mud Skipper,7,2021-01-20T09:15:48Z

Depp: Be in your home. 
Heard: I am having to do everything, every step of the way my hand has been forced. I don't want to hurt you, I love you. 

9:25 Depp: Do you want to go to court with this, Amber? I love you more than anything in life. I do not want to go into a fucking court with you. I do not want to tarnish your name. I know you hate me. It doesn't need to happen like this. I'm trying to help you in this, I love you. Whether your love was real or not, I love you. Continuing through court is going to end up nothing but bad. It's going to be heart breaking.


12:46 Heard: It would be evidence, tons of it, and it would be through years. No one is going to believe that. 

16:06 Heard: [Quoting Lawyer] ""It's the most solid evidence case of domestic violence I've ever seen"" I would never want that for you. It's hard for me to accept any sort of victimdom ever.  
Depp: I'm telling you now it's a mistake to go to court. 
Depp: Amber, I didn't call you those things.
Heard: It's all coming from your side.

""I don't know how to get my reputation back.""

Depp: ""the abuse thing. We've gotta deal with that, yeah.""
Heard: I've been trying to protect you. 
""You're bigger and you're stronger.""

24:42 Heard: The same security guards have said to me that I was going to  get killed. 

26:15 Depp: Do you believe all this Amber? You believe that I'm an abuser? Do you believe that you are an abuser?
