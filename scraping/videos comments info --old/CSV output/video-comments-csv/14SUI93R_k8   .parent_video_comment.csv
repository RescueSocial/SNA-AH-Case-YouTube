415,Ugw_8S7AjmoIrkYDkM94AaABAg,"I like Jason Momoa & James Wan, so I'm disgusted with them for defending Heard. No doubt they either feel obligated to be 'white knights' after hearing sob stories which were likely faked from her or they just want to save the Aquaman movies. Either way, they are in the wrong. They shot themselves in the foot though for hiring a woman wrapped in such drama before it was legally settled and instead chose to take her word ignore the possible repercussions if Johnny was proved innocent in her claims of abuse",Elizabeth Lovett,1,2021-03-19T17:25:06Z
