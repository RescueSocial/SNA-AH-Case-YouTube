6,Ugx7yaYA87iRoPxMZNV4AaABAg,Oscillate Wildly,"His comment on the wine was an exaggeration and done with sarcasm and wit in response to the statement made by the financial management/advisors who were attempting to deflect their criminal mishandling of  his finances, losing 650 million, they failed to pay his tax for 17 years which left him owing 100 million to the IRS. Their immediate response was to blame his spending habits and used the example of the money spent on wine which (was not in the millions!) and was not just for him but also for entertaining guests and his many freeloaders. How he chooses to spend his money is no business of yours! Your attempt at a put down only makes you look like an envious prick who lacks empathy.  You don't even know him personally but you somehow feel entitled to make judgements about his lifestyle,  and the level of your hatred makes you not not care about a person's fate! Wow! Harsh! Check yourself dude.",2020-11-28T04:34:38Z,0

8,Ugx7yaYA87iRoPxMZNV4AaABAg,Wildcat Hawkins,@Bridgey not saying hes done anything wrong with his own money I just don't feel sorry for him.  He's so rich he can make independent movies with more integrity and executive produce them with his own wealth and connections.  Maybe now he will.,2020-11-20T01:05:26Z,0
9,UgyqF9LA2iPQ07AHIWN4AaABAg,D H,Though we all know even if ah was asked to resign she would never back down after all she is now trying to push for more screen time in the movie that she herself is only a side character in it‚Äôs not called mera and aquaman 2 it‚Äôs just aquaman and honestly mera is very easily recastable. This movie is going to suffer massively and it‚Äôs a crying shame and not fair to Jason who‚Äôs career is being dragged into this mess because of a gold digging abuser is lost in her own little fantasy world.,2020-11-18T21:36:24Z,2
10,Ugw7rYD11XbjoHBLEpZ4AaABAg,D H,Here‚Äôs hoping with the Virginia trial coming up and the judge actually saying bugger off to ah and her ridiculous attempts to silence people that this trial gives Johnny the justice that he so deserves and that ah gets what‚Äôs coming to her hard cause I will call this now. If wb doesn‚Äôt fire this witch if the verdict goes in Johnny‚Äôs favour then there will be riots outside wb studios calling for her head and the heads of the people too scared to do the right thing. Cause we all know for a fact if they are faced with that outcome and they pull a ‚Äúshe is under contract to play the character‚Äù then everyone will be shouting what about Johnny. He was contacted for his fantastic beast role which brought more money in anyway,2020-11-19T04:10:01Z,1

13,UgyP5LRsKGn_I4S7BRp4AaABAg,D H,Totally agree there I just really feel sorry for Jason (aquaman) seeing as she doesn‚Äôt have the decency to even back down and is only going to drag so many more peoples through the mud before she even gets down and dirty.,2020-11-19T04:05:40Z,1

17,Ugw7S0n-9Fma6YPLzAN4AaABAg,D H,@Ariel Legolas here here it‚Äôs all about acting talent and like Brie Larson amber has no talent she is pretty much cut from the same cloth her emotional range is that of a rough piece of wood just waiting to splinter some poor soul,2020-11-19T04:13:54Z,0

I don't like 21century beauty or sexiness, all of them look the same and vulgar. Nathing special for me in AH for example; I can see more beauty and sexiness everyday in the streets of my city. Besides, it should be about talent, skills in the art of acting. And now it is about justice for Johnny, justice for men; this will change society forever.",2020-11-18T08:15:25Z,3
