13,Ugx84OHEQ6lt6ZhVGuh4AaABAg,"The Greek word sin means ""miss the mark"".  Humans are sinful by nature, and commit sins as a symptom of our imperfection, which is why we age and die.  Our spirit, which we have, is also flawed, and is set to die as soon as our bodies do as the natural consequence of imperfection, and punishment for the evil we do. As the bible says, the wage of sin is death, physical and spiritual death. Our spirits exist outside of time, so they can't achieve death and keep dying forever.  This is the second death told of in the bible, aka hell.  We can't change our nature, like a finch can't change into a dove. Thankfully, the gift of God is everlasting life.  Jesus, who was God in the flesh of a man, died for the remission of sin, including yours, was buried, and rose form the dead 3 days later.  If you simply believe in this to apply to you and trust Jesus to save you from the second death, then you have everlasting life in heaven.  As Jesus says in John 6:47 ""verily, verily I say unto you, he that believes in me has everlasting life.""",TheModer8ter,0,2020-06-22T13:31:15Z

94,UgytZmRoOTQZRxlJUYp4AaABAg,"Heard's previous personal assistant is going to testify against her. She submitted a 12 paged document detailing how Heard was extremely abusive to her and paid her way under industry standard to be her assistant despite having 20 years of experience (the assistant was older than Heard but wanted flexible hours because she was caring for her 4-year-old son).

The personal assistant saved some text messages and emails of Amber being abusive to her and doing some pretty illegal stuff like lying about another assistant (who was from England) not being in America for work but to visit. The assistant took pictures of the woman's info and pay stubs and submitted those as evidence as well as the email lying about the other assistant's true purpose for working for her.

I really hope Amber is the vindictive type and doesn't let this lawsuit go because when she loses this information will be available to every single one of those journalists who supported an abuser as an advocate against domestic abuse.",Mephistopheles,0,2020-06-17T21:44:44Z

Clarke wasn't that great in GoT eventhough that was a really simple role and the movies she ""starred"" in all show the same thing: she's a very limited actress. 
Now being limited isn't necessarily bad: Stallone, Schwarzenegger, van Damme, to name but a few, all have limited acting skills yet enjoyed successful acting careers. The main difference is that they, as well as the people who cast them, knew that and took that into account. And pretty much the same went for scriptwriters and just about everyone in the Hollywood movie industry.

Modern day people in that same Hollywood movie industry seem to be completely braindead: 
- you can't act your way out of a paper bag but are a stunningly brave diverse actress? You're hired.
-  you can't write a storyline if your life depended on it but are stunningly brave and diverse or kowtow to that? You're hired.
- you've got a script that's completely trash, has plotholes a semi truck could drive through and is basically only pushing the SJW agenda? And on top of that you have actresses who can't act? Here's $300 million, go make your movie.",TJ Roelsma,0,2020-06-17T16:45:06Z

Most legal teams will stick with their client even if they're going to lose. They'll either settle or tone down the punishment whatever it may be. 
It's all speculations from here but once evidence against Amber Heard started to pile up, even if it may not hold up, Times Up had to pull out. Wouldn't look good on them if they tried to defend an abuser rather than an abuse victim.

191,UgwdnyC14QockaYF7794AaABAg,"I'm not sure you are right about the attorney withdrawal thing. Here is what I wrote on Nerdette's Newsstand channel when she covered the same issue:
I am an attorney, and here is what I think. Appearing pro hoc vice (pronounced vee-chay) mean to appear in a particular case jurisdiction in which one is not licensed. Each state has its own rules about how and when a foreign attorney may appear, but I think all require local co-counsel. It is likely that both of the parties' attorneys advised them that local counsel was more than competent to handle the case, and that it would be a waste of money to pay foreign counsel to fly in, stay in a hotel and appear in court (remember, one still has to pay local counsel) at celebrity lawyer rates. The other possibility is that Virginia only allows foreign lawyers to appear only for limited purposes (N.B. Virginia law has a lot of old peculiarities that have passed out of use in most jurisdictions, such as Writs and Courts of Equity), and actually trying the case might not be one of them. Also, just because the lawyers have withdrawn in Virginia doesn't mean that they don't still represent Heard or Depp, respectively. The celebrity lawyers may very well be working with local counsel with discovery, negotiations, &c. They may just be trying to save their clients money because of how expensive it would be for them to appear.",Han Ng,0,2020-06-17T04:52:35Z
