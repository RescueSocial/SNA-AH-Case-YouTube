23,Ugzf2qO6UPskzU1_DF14AaABAg,Shifting Mercury,@Sabrina Icestaff I try to get my information from primary sources or more objective sources that simply report the news. Then I come to my own conclusions. Sorry for the alien joke. I didn’t know what you meant. My father is autistic actually. I have a unique brain myself. Anyway I’m not a fan of Heard. I’ve only seen Amber in ‘the stand’ and that was very recently. I am a fan of Johnny Depp though. I still think the evidence proved he is guilty. There are a lot of assumptions that you have to make in order to believe in Depp’s innocence. You have to assume several witnesses are lying for example. With no proof that they are lying. Which defeats the purpose of witness testimony altogether. You also have to ignore the fact that JD says on the recording that they have been physical to EACHOTHER. If we take Amber admitting to hitting him as proof then surely Depp doing the same is proof. If you like I can provide a link to a clip of the recording where he says that. I’m not sure why you are making rude comments like the ‘herd’ comment. I try to keep any debate or difference of opinion limited to the topic. It doesn’t make sense to me to personally insult someone for coming to a different conclusion than me.,2021-04-22T18:52:31Z,0

44,Ugxaxd058dF9HwkRE2V4AaABAg,AFIXFORNIX,"@Woken't In our army, the combat soldiers are a small part. You need about 8-10 support soldiers for each combat soldier. So many males don't end up as combatants because there are other important positions to fulfill.  I was drafted as an engineer, and served in a position that suited my skillset. I ended up operating under fire even though I didn't have the proper training for that. 

Your concept of serving equally is plain wrong. We all serve equally. 

F15 technician don't fight but without them maintaining the aircraft our pilots won't be going on missions. We rely heavily on intelligence gathering, we need the soldiers and officers handling the information collection and analysis to create a bank of targets so our special combat units will know where to strike. We do much of the fighting from the relative safety of the control unit, where the UAV pilot sit. 

The war has many frontlines. And the frontline you imagine is actually the least challenging for us. The first priority is to defend our civilians. Making the soldiers operating the anti missile/rocket defense system the real heroes - and they are not on the frontlines. The unit of women that control different cameras from a control center and detect terrorists trying to sneak into villages - heroes. The soldiers on the home front that help communities function under daily rocket showers are heroes.  Geeky soldiers launching cyber attacks on critical enemy facilities, heroes.

I supported abolishing the archaic rules we have regarding divorce, like the woman is getting the kid by default even if she is completely unfit to be a mother, or the fact that child and spouse support is only paid by men. My opinion is that the child should be with the most competent parent, and support should be paid according to the financial status. In Germany for example, it is possible that the woman pays support for the man if she is wealthier. 

I can't speak for all women. I don't do politics or social media, so you won't hear about my actions. The loud ones that you hear are probably not feminists, despite what they might claimed.",2021-04-20T16:13:28Z,0

62,Ugxx49QL5fFcyvDIsOx4AaABAg,Shifting Mercury,"@Wallflower A makeup artist testified to covering up bruises on Amber’s face. She didn’t even want to testify because she received death threats and was terrified. Yet she did. And people are just ok with dismissing that and insisting that anyone who has any information that makes Johnny look guilty were paid off. You can’t just accuse every witness of being paid off when there is no proof of that. That’s undermining witness testimony itself. We use witness testimony from friends and family in many domestic abuse cases because they are usually the only people close enough to witness anything or for the person to have confided in. She did confide in friends and family and there are texts proving it going back years. 

All that planning and scheming over several years, only to have the case dropped makes no sense. Johnny Depp makes $25 million per film. If she wanted a huge chunk of money, she would’ve taken him to court and fought for it. The $7 million divorce settlement sounds big but to someone like Johnny, it’s not a whole lot. And if she intended to keep it, why would she make the pledge to donate the same amount to charity over a period of 10 years? People criticize her for keeping it when Johnny is suing her for $50 million. Which she certainly doesn’t have. Plus the legal fees involved.

83,Ugzk8sXQsm4nbl9i81h4AaABAg,Marianne Erni,"And the Suns lawyers knew exactly what to ask and not ask, so Depps lawyer had no chance in asking some questions. And the judge did not accept some of Depps witnesses and even changed witness testimonies. Like: the cop said H had a reddened face from crying, the judge said: she had a red cheek. That is willfully changing a statement. That judge did know what he was supposed to do.",2021-04-07T18:27:28Z,2

Edit: Incidentally, when I said ""confusing Law and Justice"" I wasn't meaning to be rude or nasty! I meant it in the same way as the difference between ""Knowing something"" and being able to ""Prove it""...the law of course seeks to provide justice, but can only do so within very strict and clearly defined confines. You can change laws, or constantly introduce new ones, but judges cannot allow straying outside of established ones; that is their very role and purpose.
It just occurred to me it may have sounded unintentionally dismissive!",2021-04-08T12:41:41Z,0
