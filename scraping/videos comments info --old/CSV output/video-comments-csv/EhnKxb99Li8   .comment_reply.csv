17,Ugyu1q2vXjOIyW-7t0V4AaABAg,L Smith,"@CTechy ID if the argument is about who is the victim or not regarding other videos then make that case. The comments made here are baseless, ridiculous. I have heard recordings and am fully aware of the details, Heard as a manipulative narcissist. 

So plead that case. 

The comments here saying Johnny would never hit her, baseless, cant and dont know. The comments stating his behaviour in this video is okay/fine/acceptable again nope, and the comments claiming this was the day his mum died, once again baseless. 

These bs statements dont help Johnny at all.  What would, would be facts about the content, tone and method of addressing it in other recordings.

But these irrational illogical comments here just show ignorant people defending a celebrity they think they know, reinforcing their instilled misogyny and delusions. Depp himself has stated he didnt know what provoked this bad mood, and it was not linked to his mother. Him nor Heard have linked this to his mother's death yet ""fans"" are running with any bs they can make up. 

I dont dispute at all that Heard is the abuser based on other evidence, but following evidence is important. Many commenting here are not following evidence. Even though I agree Depp is the victim of Heard's abuse. Commenters here are showing their bias, their engrained sexism and misogyny. Call her out for her actions, dont base anything on her gender. These people shouldnt be encouraged. On this odd occasion yes the victim is a man and the perpetrator a woman, statistics show the reverse is far far more likely, these commenters will be among those who will be on the man's side regardless of who, or what. Rather than being on the victims side.",2021-10-03T11:36:15Z,0
18,Ugyu1q2vXjOIyW-7t0V4AaABAg,L Smith,"@CTechy ID I didnt state that. I havent mentioned other sources of evidence as I was merely commenting on the ridiculous baseless conclusions drawn by people on this one. Based on this particular video, one CANNOT dispute that his behaviour is aggression and violent. The statements again by commenters saying Johnny couldnt/wouldnt hit her, again they cannot know and do not know. 

This video does show aggression, violence and cannot prove or disprove whether he would or had been violent to her on her person. 

Same regarding commenters saying this was the day his mum died, that itself is entirely false and baseless, they are making whatever up to fit their existing view.

These baseless conclusions help noone, and in fact are a hinderance to justice in this case.

Did she force him to drink copious amounts of alcohol and act in a completely unacceptable manner? No. All she did was record the behaviour she had experienced in the past and she has certainly paid the price for it.

The fact he lost his mother, literally makes the way he reacts understandable. People react to loss in different ways. And he is definitely not the first person to drink alcohol or whatever when they lose someone. So the fact he is hitting objects, and filling the glass to the brim, doesnt show abusive behaviour but shows his mental state which was obviously very broken (because of his loss). Its like people forget or ignore what it's like to lose a family member or a parent or someone you cared about. As you said, he didnt even hit her or interact with her, only until she talked to him and acted like a victim. Then he reacted like any sane person if they were being recorded whilst hes literally vulnerable and stuff. Gosh, most people would react like that whilst being recorded in general. The fact she recorded him whilst he was in that state, is utterly disgusting. If ofcourse he was like this because of his mom. And the fact that she didnt even seem scared, uncomfortable or anything, makes no sense if she was being abused or that kind of thing.",2021-06-21T21:44:20Z,5

But he didnt even talk to her or approach her until she talked to him and acted all ""victim"". She didnt seem scared as you mentioned, she seemed like she was more concentrated on making sure that she caught everything on camera. I'd think if he did abuse her, he'd hit her instead of the furniture and what not. Even when he acts quite angry and goes closer to her and says ""you wanna see something crazy"". He pours himself a cup full of alcohol. Showing his anguish and mental state in the moment, which could have been caused by multiple things. I feel like people ignore and forget about the fact we are humans and we all react stupidly when we are angry. Hes angry and drunk yet doesnt lay a finger on her. Honestly at the end, when AH laughed, it seemed like she was satisfied that her scheme worked more than anything. Obviously If she was being abused she would have been relieved or not as scared when he left, but the fact she laughed shows she knows she was never in real danger.",2021-06-21T21:53:04Z,1

She sees he is vulnerable and upset and is trying to bait him here. She seems pretty chill about what is allegedly her ‚Äúabuser‚Äù lashing out. She doesn‚Äôt flinch, doesn‚Äôt try to back away or protect herself, and can be heard laughing. She purposefully inserted herself into a situation that had nothing to do with her in an attempt to make Depp look like the abuser, when in reality most of the evidence points to the real abuser being her.",2021-05-20T16:34:59Z,0
420,UgyZ-VrgemoX8DvTzUR4AaABAg,Wach_,"@0000moz she ain‚Äôt a victim bro. He lost his temper over his mother‚Äôs death and losing 650 million dollars. you don‚Äôt think you‚Äôd be acting like that after losing that much? sure his behavior is still unacceptable, but he never laid a hand on her even without the knowledge she was recording him. Somebody throwing stuff around because they‚Äôre mad isn‚Äôt automatically abusive, it‚Äôs not right but it doesn‚Äôt instantly mean abusive especially if the thing they are angry about is completely unrelated to the ‚Äúvictim‚Äù and said ‚Äúvictim‚Äù is inserting herself into the situation on purpose. He barely even acknowledges her the whole time and when he does it is in response to her talking to him. Doesn‚Äôt seem like such a helpless victim when he is completely ignoring her and she is trying to step in and insert herself when it literally has nothing to do with her. It is clearly trying to bait him when he is at his lowest. 

What about all the times she struck him? All the manipulation and lies and deceit? You‚Äôre right that people are blaming the victim, and that victim is Johnny Depp. 

‚ÄúNobody will believe you because you are a man‚Äù does that sound like something a victim says? Do you think that a victim who is terrified and traumatized would be eating snacks and looking bored during her deposition? Why would a victim say she had bruised ribs, black eyes, and many other injuries only to have a bikini photo shoot less than 2 weeks later?

On top of that, look at the body language in any photo of them. Johnny clearly looks like the much more submissive one. The way he stands, the way he holds her, the way he avoids eye contact are all signs of somebody who is being abused. Amber clearly is in control of him and that shows through the way she is able to lie and manipulate these situations. I have never seen a ‚Äúvictim‚Äù look so confidant and in control in front of their abuser. Sure victims put on a face to hide it, but the way she acts in interviews and pictures and videos compared to his demeanor all point to her truly being the abuser. She is a master manipulator and seems to have duped a lot of people.

His behavior here is a red flag, but with the context and the fact that this lashing out was unrelated to amber and not done in an attempt to intimidate or hurt her points to it not being abuse. It‚Äôs still not okay behavior, but it doesn‚Äôt come off as abusive. 

This is corroborated by the fact that his ex wife, whom he left for Amber heard, is completely on his side when she has absolutely no reason to be.",2021-05-20T16:23:48Z,0

It is something very, very many do. And something that IS normal. It is normal to vent frustration when it‚Äôs overflowing, but it not normal to do it on others, but for maybe in hurtful words if it‚Äôs them they‚Äôre frustrated at. It‚Äôs not good, but it‚Äôs normal. He isn‚Äôt angry at her in the beginning, the only thing he does to her here is calling her an ‚Äúass‚Äù as he leaves the room.

The fact he is drunk shows something serious must have happened, AH obviously seems to be trying to make herself look like the victim. She asks him ""what happened"", starts mentioning how they fought in the morning or something, you really think if he was like that because of her. He wouldn't be screaming or shouting at her. He wasnt even talking to her at her at first, but even ended up hurting himself. The fact that its said his mom died this days, literally makes sense. People react in different ways to death and loss of someone important. He is not the first person to drink alcohol when someone important died.
