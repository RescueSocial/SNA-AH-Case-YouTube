You may feel you 're not loved and not good enough, but know that it's because you're surrounded by the wrong people. You are strong enough to endure for the sake of having a better life in the future. It's not easy and it WILL get worse before it gets better. Find friends with the right mindset. They are a minority but they are out there. Even if it's online friends they will be there for you. There is free counseling online that has helped me through. Please never give up looking for help. We cannot afford losing good people like this just because they are surrounded by dicks who never knew better. You are loved by minorities who care arround the globe. We only have eachother ♡ never compare your troubles to others because that will only make things worse. Never judge yourself but try to build this persona inside that encourrages you when you feel like you have no one else to support you. Don't hate but love as hard as it sounds. Never stop loving yourself! You are worthy of every beautiful thing this life has to offer. Live so you can tell your story when you're all healed up. Live for the people who love you and those who don't know you but are still willing to help. Live for yourself first and then good things will slowly happen.

53,Ugwm4gu8OSPvPAfRscx4AaABAg,"I do think this woman is the biggest waste of air BUT... The phone rang by accident. Was it her friend's phone or did she just do a very good celebrity job of diffusing an embarrassing situation like that? I felt that she did a good job saying ""Oh I so needed that"", as in, ""this topic is so serious, that an accident like that makes it bearable"". I'm not sure if that was sincere, but then again, how many of these speeches are entirely, 100% sincere, ever? She could have made the situation more awkward by listening on the phone ring and act like the person in question did the biggest faux par ever, but she laughed it off. This is not a funeral, at least.

Laughter is the best medicine, they say, and sometimes perfectly normal individuals laugh in the most awkward times, and it has the side dish of making a moment like this bearable. 

I don't like painting people either good or bad, entirely, like there had to be SOMETHING about this girl for someone like Johnny to fall for, right? I don't think she acted inhumane in that, personally, even though I am team Johnny all the way - even in defending his choice in the first place.

She laughed when she was talking about the doctor how he dismissed the girl and said it was normal to have these feelings. I bet shes had LOADS of experience from doctors in the past sayibg the same to her which is probably why she found it so amusing. 

2011? Jeezo. It's amazing that nobody commented on stuff like tjos back then. Probably because back then she was a nobody so a lot of this kind of stuff fell under the radar and it's only now that people are looking back that we start to see how much of a problem she was from the get go.

She can pretend but won't feel as the chances are she is quite empty. That's why she cannot appreciate the depth of the feeling of compassion etc and is able to quickly jump to laughter. Probably quite exaggerated as well. She cannot feel any of these (and probably can't appreciate that jumping from one to other is inappropriate). And in other situations she typically mimics others. I've observed so many times during interviews etc she looks at others to mimic their reactions as if she was unsure as to what is it to be felt. Also many times she smiles and stops the smile immediately because it's all pretend. Just my impression, cannot know for sure.",A Ace,16,2020-10-14T15:20:29Z

279,UgwmHsKoCT-MGLch3OF4AaABAg,"I’m speechless. I would have assumed that when you know you’re going to make a public speech, you would switch the phone off or, at least put it on silent, especially if you know you’re going to be filmed, therefore you know that it will be on record for many, many years",Chickp Stranded,14,2020-10-14T14:28:31Z

281,UgzxdhfttgIpABMkLIt4AaABAg,Next she will talk about how she killed herself because of johnny but elon brought her back to life. Wow she laughs at a phone but apparently cant duck one. She is a evil bitch who  laughs during that story n then stumble thro the label lgbt when she is ment to be in that community. People who r at that stage reach out n if u know anyone at that stage listen. Ranty again my bad. Great vid n info have a good day thank u,NEMXA Riddle,0,2020-10-14T14:27:03Z
282,UgxPe4jcJyRjDhhxdgF4AaABAg,Someone needs to pick on her! Look at how hypocritical she is! Look at how she picked on Johnny and berated Johnny for so long about his drug use and drinking at least he can compose himself. Look that b**** she can't even speak or hold it together it's obvious she's just high as a kite most of the time! I used to think that she was probably one of the most beautiful women in the world now I look at her and she's utterly pathetic and disgusting!,Rebel love,0,2020-10-14T14:27:00Z
283,Ugwus488cwkFC8BLuoR4AaABAg,"Whew, I said from the get go she is mentally ill, she just keeps proving it. In terms of her fillers uh and um, if she were indeed a serious about speeches, she belongs in a Toastmasters class.",Lepq,6,2020-10-14T14:26:28Z
