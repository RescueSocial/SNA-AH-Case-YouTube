2,Ugz8HdSks-u-lt-uckV4AaABAg,"She got I ""don't want to call anybody a liar"" from Wynona who had said that about Herd a week before in her statement about there was no way Johnny was abusive! You guys have GOT to do the HAIR photos! Where her face isn't anywhere except a side shot of her face were hair with what's supposed to be blood but could be any type of goo. And it's a no-brainer why Nicols didn't want to look at Johnny's testimony or evidence... NO WAY  there were going to be any change of media laws (Nickles has an ongoing hand in writing media laws) that would stop them from writing scandal Heardsay or any hearsay. ""Amber in Distress!"" Thank you!. Thanks for the detailed Nicols media laws thingy! Yeah!

7,UgzYVmle387wcnyVNNp4AaABAg,Ach I find this video so hard to watch because the spillage in photo1 is a glass fragment shadow and exactly the same shape and position as the glass fragment in photo 2. If you rotated and change the angle this becomes obvious.  Glass can appear barely visible at an oblique angle dependent on the lighting over head. I hate AH and wish all this was true but I feel this will come out  as unimportant with higher resolution images.,Lara Pelletier,0,2021-07-29T14:41:21Z

12,UgxKf-CTivmM3c3n-HV4AaABAg,"On the ""absolutely not"" discussion...the Behaviour Panel (a great channel)...if I remember correctly...says that using qualifiers such as these are often linked to dishonesty. Innocent people, just say No...no need to embellish. It's not in-and-of-itself a determiner...but, taken with other factors -- like photographic evidence, propensity to lie, being a stone-cold psychopath (you know, the usual, obvious AH stuff) -- LOL -- blah blah blah...... you know where I'm going with this. I was super-happy to catch a LIVE! Woot!!  __ How does she live with herself?

19,UgyBhRlHk1s6FpEMZ1N4AaABAg,"I remember my ex trashed my livingroom one time.  It took me 4 hours to clean up.  And it was the size of maybe....15x15 feet.  It was housing by the government so not meant to be big.  By the time the police had come I had cleaned it all up.  But they were by 6-8 hours later not within a couple hours. 
An enraged man can cause so much damage in a small amount of time but he is causing damage, the pictures I saw were not damage.  It was a joke.   
I also took pictures and there was not one item that was filled with damage.  The only thing he couldn't break was the wooden coffee table,  or couches, he just flipped those over.  Still.  Shit makes me mad people believe her still.  What kind of never witnessed a true dv incident where he breaks all your things have they not witnessed before.  Now their claims are back by ""the judge in UK proved her right in 12 out of 14 incidents.""

20,UgzyOYu7EeiChwIuqpV4AaABAg,"in Isaac's testimony here's a quote about the wine in the hallway : ""along with splashed wine running down the wall directly in front of the door (of PH1).

22,UgxAFyybyAuHY0WEXlV4AaABAg,"What‚Äôs also interesting is the particular photos they produced really only show a minimal amount of damage compared to the amount of damage described. Like why not whip out the camera and take pictures of the damage in the kitchen of PH 3. The broken candelabra, the fruit and utensils all over the floor, etc. it ‚Äúsounded‚Äù like a tornado had hit, but‚Ä¶no pics. Instead, a few pieces of glass in PH 5 and carefully placed a few other items.",LPS,7,2021-07-24T15:49:51Z
23,UgzXuYq_F8rnktvlUZF4AaABAg,"So the first cops arrived and went did a sweep of both penthouses and saw nothing. Shortly after they left AH and cohorts got busy in penthouse five setting up the scene and taking photos. Then the next set of cops came but they didn‚Äôt go into PH5 but showed PH 1 which was supposed to be trashed as pristine. Kaplan slipped up by saying the photos taken of the landing were taken the following day on May 22nd. The metadata, has obviously been messed with.",LPS,2,2021-07-24T14:01:31Z
24,UgzQnX__qWWHklyTXk54AaABAg,"According to Isaac Baruch's statement he arrived back at the ECB at 9:30pm (CCTV actually shows this to be 10:34 as he met the 2nd LAPD officers coming off the elevator) when he went up to PH level and turned a corner he saw broken glass on the floor and the wine running down the wall and on the floor outside PH 1. The bodycam doesn't show the broken glass or fresh wine stains so the only possible explanation is they appeared AFTER the 2nd officers left and BEFORE IB took the elevator up to the PH's. IMHO the hoaxers panicked decided to cause damage in the halls in case more cops turned up, while doing so they were in the hall heard the elevator door ping ( IB + friend) then all scurried into PH1. Why PH1? Because IB said when he saw the wine stains Drew came out of PH1 and looked stressed/worried and angled the door so IB couldn't see the inside of PH1. AH, ROCKY and/or MARZ were probably hiding in PH1 until IB left.",FRUITNINJA,5,2021-07-24T13:50:32Z

27,Ugxx-iPQfmRKdsnHjah4AaABAg,"just thinking .. if JD was already there drinking the wine, then how does this compare (for example) to elevator footage of him arriving with his security team WITHOUT any bottles in his hand and then leaving so soon afterwards. Or if he wasn't there drinking already, did he have time to arrive and get blind rotten drunk & rampage all over the penthouses in such a short period of time before leaving again???????",Intel Lius,14,2021-07-24T06:41:37Z

30,UgwD4EkdESeckWjUImR4AaABAg,"From a UK Barrister: Perverting the Course of Justice is a common law misdemeanor, the case of R v Vreones outlines the ‚Äòingredients‚Äô of the offence that a prosecution must establish before it is successful; one must:

""to act or embark on a course of conduct, which has a tendency to, and, is intended to pervert the course of public justice""

It is also worth noting that an ulterior intention of the defendant in respect of their motives can be largely irrelevant, for example where a person makes a knowingly false statement in pursuance of court proceedings but only does so in order to protect someone else, this will still be perverting the course of justice, the laudability of the motive being held to have been largely irrelevant: Att.-Gen.‚Äôs Reference (No. 1 of 2002).

One area which gives some people trouble is what constitutes ‚Äòthe course of public justice‚Äô. The answer is found in R v Selvage and Morgan [1982] where the Court of Appeal gives the classic definition:

‚Äú... conduct which relates to judicial proceedings, civil or criminal, whether or not they have yet been instituted but which are within the contemplation of the wrong-doer whose conduct was designed to affect the outcome of them. That conduct includes giving false information to the police with the object of among other things putting the police on a false trail ...‚Äù

So even if no offence has actually been committed, the interference with an investigation can amount to perverting the course of justice.

The offense includes:

Publishing things to try to prejudice a fair trial
Making false allegations/retracting truthful allegations
Concealing the commission of an offence
Obstructing the police
Assisting others to evade arrest
Interfering with witnesses, evidence and juror
Trying to get someone falsely arrested",Intel Lius,6,2021-07-24T05:52:35Z
