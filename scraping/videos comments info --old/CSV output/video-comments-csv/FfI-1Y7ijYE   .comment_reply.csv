Depp took The Sun to court because they labelled him a wife beater. They found evidence that at the very least he attacked her at least once and he admitted to headbutting her. Therefore, The Sun were not making stuff up and he lost. If Depp had taken out a lawsuit on Heard for abusing him, he probably would win that.

Firstly the trial wasn’t to prove heard correct and Depp a liar, he knew that there wasn’t all the evidence presented because of the US trial. Secondly he knew it wasn’t for him to ‘prove that heard  ‘just, innocent, or a hyena come to think of it’ the case wasn’t between Depp and heard, the Judge was there to say, if he thought the Sun newspaper could say what they said. Considering this he could have said that there wasn’t enough evidence (but there was), so he came out with this clock and bull story, even knowing all evidence not shown and reasons why, deliberately ignoring independent witness (police included) for AH cronies that actually stand to gain from AH win . To say he believed her and not the witnesses and evidence, because she was under oath (proven she had lied in the Australian court).  Also to say JD never suffered any injuries and didn’t take his photos, bruises, cigarette burn on face, and hospital re finger decapitation into account. THE WHOLE THING STINKS .

As a football supporter I, along with millions of others, watched this unfold on live TV. After they removed the bodies of the dead and the injured, they played a game of football.
After this tragedy the Sun newspaper run lurid headlines and stories claiming that violent drunken Scousers (i.e., Liverpudlians) were the cause of the tragedy and accused them of disgusting conduct which I have no intention of repeating here. It took around 25 years for the families of the dead and the survivors to get justice and have the guilty parties held accountable (such as the police who falsified evidence to make the victims look bad and to absolve themselves from responsibility), and to the day the Sun newspaper is shunned in Liverpool - and beyond.",2020-11-23T17:04:17Z,1

(1) I am trained in law, which includes criminal law.
(2) I worked in a law firm for a few years
(3) my training in criminal law instructed me that certain behaviours are a man thing and only a man thing.
(4) This gendered perspective within the legal system aligns with the judge’s ruling.
(5) this gendered belief is consistent with the United Nations and I encourage you to search the topic
(6) I said prior to the ruling that it was a significant case because it would open the flood gates that male survivors exist
(7) a search across the internet tells us there is a blanket ban on condemning female abusers and male survivors.
(8) that blanket media ban corresponds with government policies across the western world, including specific legislation that allows for prejudice by sex in all areas of society (including government)
(9) it is my honest belief the legal profession is in serious trouble because it is entrenched in ideology. Concepts like “equality before the law” have been strangled by ideology such as feminist law  (which is a genuine discipline of law and many text books exist on the topic).
(9) if you believe there is a slow march through the institutions (which I do), the legal profession in experiencing the same.

I apologise for repeating this comment but YouTube are shadow banning me and deleting comments because they don’t like some facts on this topic. This narrative is controlled tightly.

I will not support any movie that she's in I'm standing with Johnny Depp 100% I've been watching his talent mature and evolve and it all started when he did it platoon in the 80s and then after that what I saw him that movie he started popping off and other movies You Know What's Eating Gilbert Grape Edward Scissorhands Benny and Joon the underrated Cry-Baby and in a 100% heterosexual manner he was so freaking beautiful and I movie but I love his singing voice of Sweeney Todd to Die For in every aspect I really feel like the industry trying to keep him down and they don't want to give him an Oscar so anything they can use to take away the Legacy they'll try it and it's sad but it's never going to work because we love him too much and he's one of the best actors if not the best ever y'all f*** Amber Heard f*** that corrupt ass lawyer who probably f***** her the entire time trial was up and had dinner with her family every damn night I don't understand how to spell the job he should be doing now that should involve something around lines of no gloves no knock on his face and piles of s*** and him grabbing it and basically making one pile into a bigger pile than laying in it making snow angels if this was properly describe the Angels really really big stinky smelly gross in just s** f****** angels I don't like people shiting on America that's f***** up as our legal system does not very different from theirs and that's a shame and a change needs to happen now in a real courtroom with no bulshit she would have been laughed out of that courtroom and Jonny Big Balls death would be pimp walking right now in a f****** G string with a plate made out of glass with an ounce of the best yay yo just doing rails while listening with a plate made out of glass with an ounce of the best yeyo  white girl candy God powdered sugar Jesus flower China White okay never just doing rails while listening to some freaking Pink Floyd in their Prime ready to do his role in Fantastic Beasts I'm not even going to watch it now as much as I love the guy who plays Hannibal I refuse to watch the movie now it's sad when they ruined it for people who are die-hard fans appreciate the material but they have to let s*** do personal and you know for sure that some kind of personal feelings. In someone's either friends with Amber Heard they've been beaten themselves they feel like they're doing something for a cause for the me-too movement even though it's been proved time and time again that the woman is a liar he's lying because this me to s*** has gained so much Steam and it's working at is pathetic and it's disgusting because what's going on is that real women being abused by monsters like Harvey Weinstein they can be put in a position where they can fall into that turn into women that are not believe women that aren't trusted and just for her trying to advance your career give it a boost just for that because it's convenient she could really hurt the movement hurt a lot of people a lot of good honest,2020-12-10T14:39:38Z,2

I believe the judge's ruling was based upon the fact that JD had previously admitted to striking or laying hands on AH, so technically the news rag hadn't committed liable by describing him as a wife beater.

221,UgzGY91_8FSlCEvf5rh4AaABAg,Edward Z. Rosenthal,"I had a gf who abused alcohol & drugs and then would abuse me, usually psychologically through manipulation and attempts to publicly humiliate me. 

But on several occasions she physically assaulted me, sometimes viciously inflicting real damage such  as bruises, cuts, lacerations, and even a black eye. In every case I only acted to protect myself, and if she was especially agitated and violent I'd attempt to subdue her by restraining her arms or legs. 

Most often my impulse was to simply leave, to exit the room and even the building so as to not incite her further. But that was the thing that really enraged her and she'd chase after me screaming hysterically with a look of maniacal determination. It was such a surreal scene I wasn't always sure if I was actually experiencing the outrageous events or if it was imagined: a horrible nightmare. 

After 4 and a half years of a cycle of breaking up, reconciling weeks later, and then again enduring continued and escalating abuse, the relationship finally ended. For years afterward I actually believed that her violent behavior had been to a large degree my fault, that I'd somehow been intentionally instigating our clashes. That belief was crushing. It caused me to sabotage my own life.

I was a few years older than her so I told myself that it was my responsibility to keep the peace, to maintain a calm, mature, rational demeanor, and to avoid volatile discussions and situations as much as possible which I did to the best of my ability. But, of course, when substance abuse is involved all bets are off and it's absurd to assume responsibility for someone's outrageous behavior who's under the influence. But such is love. 

It's taken me many years to free myself from the formidable burden of guilt, shame, confusion, anger and regret, but the memory of those dark drastic days still occasionally slips into my consciousness like an unwelcome house guest. The uninvited intruder usually takes the hint and soon leaves, but sometimes I find myself nearly paralyzed with dread that the horrible heavy cloud of disgust and self loathing will decend upon me permanently. Luckily, the terrible feeling eventually dissipates and I'm more or less back to my relatively confident happy self. Well, maybe not *Happy,* but not miserable. UKWIM? 🙄🙂",2020-12-02T18:29:22Z,1

I saw video of Johnny banging shit around and smashing her camera and that’s hallmark abusive behavior, also mentally abusive. 

I think the reason ppl find it so hard to accept that is because we never had a high profile case like this before where a woman was the abuser. So they want to take that and make a point with it like women can be abusers too, which of course they can be. But in this case Johnny was abusive too. People don’t want to admit it because it would shatter the narrative and the truth is that DV and domestic homicide occurs way more against women by men.

While conviction rates are in the 70% range when they go to court which would potentially back up your claim the problem is over 90% of cases never get anywhere near court cases as they get dropped due to insignificant evidence as its one of the hardest types of crimes to prove so will only be pursed if there is significant proof. If your lawyer told you to take the deal he knew the evidence was strong and your self-defence argument was weak (Unless he was just felt your case wasn't profitable enough so a guilty plea was easier for him),2021-01-08T22:02:20Z,0
316,UgwMRV7d6JwPP7wA1Ep4AaABAg,Simon Wakefield,"@Apple Crave Where have I ever said she is innocent you idiot. Unlike you though I can actually think in more than black or white. Even if she at times abused him IT DOESN'T MEAN he isn't guilty. The self-defence argument doesn't hold up because HEADBUTTING someone in the middle of their face isn't self-defence as it takes a deliberate act. The assumption is that in an abusive relationship there is a dominant person and a submissive one but that often isn't the case ESPECIALLY when substances are involved. Parties can swing from being the abused and the abuser. You would almost certainly see both convicted of domestic abuse if either had a criminal case against them as the evidence on both sides is pretty strong that they did abuse the other and it wasn't self-defence. The thing is his could be easily dealt with, everything suggests its purely substance-related with him but he refuses to deal with that, he seems to just expect whoever he is with to be meek and walk away so he can beat up inanimate objects rather than challenged which further angers him",2021-01-08T22:00:40Z,0

322,UgxDH4yhIxphKwOLPBN4AaABAg,Jo Piscine,"@Nwando E No, it sure doesn't justify the term ""wife beater"".  If you are arguing that we should ""take our hearts out of it"" and stick within the boundaries of the case, then you should as well.  Your argument fails in this respect, which is no surprise.  It fails because a single incident does not make one a wife beater and, what's more, this is not what was alleged by the Sun.  The Sun alleged a PATTERN OF ABUSE, not a single incident, in order to brand the man a wife beater.  Get it?  A PATTERN OF ABUSE.  Your silly standard FAILS in this regard and means that, were it offered as The Sun's argument in this case (that there was only one incident), the argument should likewise fail at court.  Stick to the case and ""leave your heart out of it"", along with your highly emotional yet low IQ bias.",2021-07-23T17:27:48Z,0
323,UgxDH4yhIxphKwOLPBN4AaABAg,Jo Piscine,"Hold on a second.  He sure did lose to Heard.  Incompetent and biased leftist feminist Justice Nicol found that the allegation that Johnny Deep was a ""wife beater"" was ""substantially true"".  A court of law is making a finding that the man is a wife beater.  Regardless of the underlying libel count in the case, that finding will stand for all time, will and has been quoted all over the world, and is part of the official record in the UK.  That is a major loss in anyone's book.  As of today, this finding had completely ruined the man's acting career forever.  And yes, Heard was on trial because incompetent leftist feminist biased Justice Nicol evaluated largely her evidence to make that finding, and he chose to essentially believe nearly everything she said without the benefit of any credible evidence in support and, in fact, evidence offered to the contrary.  Heard was on trial and the UK court, out of sheer incompetence and bias, elected to uphold and vindicate her positions.  Get real.",2021-07-23T17:21:37Z,0
324,UgxDH4yhIxphKwOLPBN4AaABAg,Hawkcam1996,"@Walter B “my training in criminal law instructed me that certain behaviors are a man thing and only a man thing”
Bull. Women are more than willing and able to do *ANYTHING* a man does. Women can be abusers. Women can be murderers. Women can be rapists. Any kind of criminal a man can be, a woman can be as well. This stupid line of thinking that only men can commit certain crimes is absolute bs. So your “training in criminal law” is completely wrong. Whoever trained you needs a reality check. Women aren’t angels incapable of committing unspeakable acts. Women are human too. They can make the *same* mistakes as a man.",2020-12-03T18:46:17Z,1
325,UgxDH4yhIxphKwOLPBN4AaABAg,Walter B,"I apologise for the delay in responding. YT have a habit of “hiding” videos from me. It took a month for them to show me this video. I’m not surprised.
(1) I am trained in law, which includes criminal law.
(2) I worked in a law firm for a few years
(3) my training in criminal law instructed me that certain behaviours are a man thing and only a man thing.
(4) This gendered perspective within the legal system aligns with the judge’s ruling.
(5) this gendered belief is consistent with the United Nations and I encourage you to search the topic
(6) I said prior to the ruling that it was a significant case because it would open the flood gates that male survivors exist
(7) a search across the internet tells us there is a blanket ban on condemning female abusers and male survivors.
(8) that blanket media ban corresponds with government policies across the western world, including specific legislation that allows for prejudice by sex in all areas of society (including government)
(9) it is my honest belief the legal profession is in serious trouble because it is entrenched in ideology. Concepts like “equality before the law” have been strangled by ideology such as feminist law  (which is a genuine discipline of law and many text books exist on the topic).
(9) if you believe there is a slow march through the institutions (which I do), the legal profession in experiencing the same.

I apologise for repeating this comment but YouTube are shadow banning me and deleting comments because they don’t like some facts on this topic. This narrative is controlled tightly. I have posted many references (measurable facts with figures) that keep on being censored. I am hoping this may get past the YouTube blanket ban (it probably won’t), I’m tired of some abusers being given absolute immunity based on their biology.",2020-12-03T18:37:10Z,1
326,UgxDH4yhIxphKwOLPBN4AaABAg,Hawkcam1996,"@Derp Y-Derp Freedom of the press has its limits. That’s why defamation is a thing. It doesn’t matter if the case was against The Sun or AH himself. He proved what The Sun printed was based on a lie, and yet he still lost because the judge dismissed the evidence. He had a connection to both the Heard family and The Sun. They chose the most biased judge possible. That case wasn’t fair at all. A judge is supposed to be impartial. That judge clearly wasn’t.",2020-12-03T16:37:19Z,1
327,Ugxan3nWPpPuUXpi_zx4AaABAg,shampoo83193,"I think the thing that is the most astounding is the judges statement after ward. He could have said that exact thing. ""I belive he hit head butted her once because he admitted to it. I belive that he did abuse him on multiple occasions due to the mounting evidence shown but because he admitted to the one incident this had to be my ruling."" Instead he went on and on about his opinion of amber because she cried. That is where the whole ruling seems unjust to me.",2020-11-04T02:40:38Z,2
328,Ugxan3nWPpPuUXpi_zx4AaABAg,Tammy Milda,"Depends on how heavily the falsehood is suggested. Misrepresenting and taking things out of context is standard practice in reporting and politics. In uk libel law the court looks at the specific imputations and what is generally understood from the terms used, but I don’t believe they explore the implications in any great depth. I think Depp should have been able to challenge the use of the term ‘wife-beater’ on the grounds that the term suggests a sole aggressor and a victim, rather than two mutual aggressors (if he was remotely aggressive). Also could have taken issue with the rate and habitual nature of the violence the term suggests. But the court would never have entertained that depth of discussion.",2020-11-03T22:55:51Z,2
329,Ugxan3nWPpPuUXpi_zx4AaABAg,Tammy Milda,"I don’t know how he could have called it irrelevant. If she is perpetrating the violence she admitted, irrespective of whether he is being violent back, for her to then do a string of interviews for magazines styling herself as a victim, all the while knowing that she is a perpetrator exploiting those who have suffered at the hands of people like her...how can that not completely destroy any credibility she would have. How could anyone interpret her character as anything but duplicitous, manipulative and completely untrustworthy.",2020-11-03T20:40:02Z,5

Based upon what evidence? There is plenty of evidence that Amber Heard abused Depp, has a history of abusing her partners and is a compulsive liar. The only evidence is her testimony. The testimony of someone who is a compulsive liar and clearly has a personality disorder. So not really any evidence at all.",2020-11-03T18:35:15Z,1
