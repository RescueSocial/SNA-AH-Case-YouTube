On audio Amber to Johnny after hours of screaming and whining to him... about him: *""You can't run away EVERY fight! You can't...It's easy (to run). It's NOT strong. it's NOT brave.""*  And she goes on to say he runs away before she even starts her screaming tirade...'most times you split when i'm speaking in this volume'...and those who have listened to the audio can understand why he runs the F away. There's so much evidence and it's crystal clear she has created a hoax to support false DV allegations against an innocent man.  When someone is d-rowning in front of your eyes, and you understand what you are seeing - it's time to lend a hand and lend your voice.

This was likely due to his association with alcohol which involved bottles. Johnny was drinking a bottle of alcohol, Amber snatched it, smashed it, and a piece of glass cut his finger. Completely unintentional, those cut finger images you see are photoshopped. It shows him on a bed with a cut finger, but why would you put someone on a stretcher if only their finger got cut?

She was just writing about her experiences and yet Johnny still targeted her. Personalities don't always tell the story, as in the case of both sides. Neither of them are innocent nor guilty. Just leave them alone. She might seem angry right now, but that's due to the fact that she's getting critized by fans because of Johnny. That's it. That's all there is to it.

It's playing dumb. Really, don't be stubborn and accept she is an abuser. Go search for the testimonies from her own (looong term) assistant. It was revealed recently(like, today) that she contracted a researcher to find dirt from dp , he investigated a 100 people and only to find only compliments about his docile behavior. Not only that but she already has a record of being abusive towards her ex girlfriend before depp. Meanwhile, JD's ex wife came out to defend him. So....

As for the case I do believe it is still ongoing. Johnny Depp lost a libel lawsuit in Britain against a newspaper ""The Sun"" for calling him a wife beater. In the UK law for libel requires the defendant (The Sun) to prove what they said is true. The judge ruled that 12 out of the 14 alleged cases of abuse by Depp against Heard met the threshold for civil law. So in that court's opinion the newspaper was correct when it called Depp a wife beater (which while not a knockout punch is pretty devastating to Depp's legal cases). Last I heard Depp is appealing it and his defamation law suit against Heard is still ongoing due to delays from Covid 19. What the end result will be who can say.",2021-02-16T06:05:49Z,0

If captain Marvel could have a better storyline in Endgame than her own movie, thats a big problem. Sorry, but no one could connect with a military hardened assassin who solves every problem by blasting it with the emotions of a plank.

259,UgwTwXTXHxBvXXAJpqF4AaABAg,Liem Duong,"@Mathew George Lol, Captain Marvel pulled a mary sue in the very end. There is no journey, no arc, no emotion, basically, we dont know why she deserved to be a hero, she didnt earn it. Mera arc is as confusing, but she doesnt emphasize the part about being female at all, less talking, more showing. Unlike Marvel, DC has had female representation much earlier than marvel, almost 80 yrs with wonder woman and hawkgirl. DC doesnt need female representation, its female heros already stand out crystal clear compared to marvel's. marvel have great non token heros, Black Widow, SW, JG, Rogue, Wasp, Storm etc., and those heros showcased were great (except for JG), so I dont see the need for extra feminist agenda.

It just means you can appreciate the fact that they dedicate their time and effort into making a movie. In my opinion, Snyder has his moments. I love the recent DC movies, but when we needed a dark story, Snyder definitely delivered. Batman is a dark character, and it‚Äôs a shame Ben Affleck stepped away from the role because a Snyder/Affleck film would have look gorgeous and probably would have been amazing.",2019-03-25T04:33:18Z,0
