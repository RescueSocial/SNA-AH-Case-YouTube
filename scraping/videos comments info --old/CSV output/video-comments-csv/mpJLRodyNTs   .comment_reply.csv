I mean he loved the idea of her, who she pretended to be (he said that himself) besides ive heard she fabricated her whole relationship with him, she pretended to have the same interests, like music, movies etc so she could get close to him and then dating him. If it's true that she made up this persona to keep him interested then he did not love HER he loved someone who wasnt real and when they married her true colors came up as she didnt have a reason to pretended anymore bc she got what she desired....",2021-09-27T21:38:23Z,1

But if they have not seen the evidence they need to look at what is out there. It's not fair to judge a person on a presumption. How on earth the judge can come up with the findings that he did is stupefying. She has some weird powers and has the backup of powerful people both men and women.",2020-11-10T09:18:37Z,0
27,UgwVzX9Ce9UZYof-k754AaABAg,Rose Harvey,"@kriz lee agreed. AH has been using the feminist label and too many have jumped behind her without checking the facts. Remember though AH is not only the ultimate abuser but also has the title of ultimate manipulator. She managed to work her rubbish on Johnny, me too, the media. There have however, already been a couple of dissenting Metoo women who got to see through the act, and mostly because the evidence Johnny put out there. Her lawyers in CA, Amanda DeCadenet and Katherine Kendall dropped AH and were very upset they had been used or misquoted, or just wanted to dissociate from AH.
Most women have dads, brothers, sons, husbands, friends who are male, it's not okay to label every male and assume an entire gender is abusive, that is not feminism.",2020-11-10T08:37:18Z,0

Her behaviour is inhuman, Johnny was prepared to just leave the abuse he suffered and just move on, but AH wants more than that. She wants money, adulation and to destroy Johnny. She really is the ultimate abuser. She has trodden on every abuse victim male and female. She has abused every victim, as they can see exactly what she has done and she has been getting away with it. I really hope Johnny gets justice very soon, he has had years of this torture. He will be the champion of the real victims if he can prevail.
