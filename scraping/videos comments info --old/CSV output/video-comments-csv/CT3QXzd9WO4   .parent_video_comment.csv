1,UgynDBb8KGdOHGBO-Lx4AaABAg,"Wow!! You are so flawlessly beautiful and classy. The makeup tutorial was easy to follow. I wish I had found your channel earlier 💕💕💕😍😍🤩 Would you do another Mera tutorial please, it's the betrothal scene, where Ocean Master gives her the engagement bracelet and then challenges Aquaman for a fight. Sorry I had to explain the scene so much, I'm sure you understand the look I'm talking about XOXO💖",Tayyaba Akhtar,0,2019-01-26T08:03:57Z
