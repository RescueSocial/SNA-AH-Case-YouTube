When JD took the ACLU to court to get them compelled to provide information, somewhere I remember the lawyer hinting or flat out stating that they might be adding the ACLU to the case. If I am remembering right. Actually it makes sense because if JD can show that the ACLU was colluded with AH and systematically went after him with lies to ruin him. Fully knowing there was no abuse, but that he was huge and ruining his as an abuser would further their donations and bullshit crap they really do! Ain't no good coming out of the ACLU!  Damn!

108,UgwU5mbTkCnBKGEFJBp4AaABAg,"I swear Scamer Turd‚Äôs team of ‚Äúlawyers‚Äù aren‚Äôt really ‚Äúlawyers‚Äù (which is why I always write it that way!! Lol!) bc they do & say SO MANY things that are nonsensical, the opposite of what real lawyers would do, show they have no idea what they‚Äôre doing or saying, let alone just how damn unprofessional they act! üôÑ It‚Äôs like they thought they could just claim defense of reliance on counsel to get Scamber Turd out of being held responsible for the Op-Ed and get nabbed for the defamation, and that was just that - it would be over, no question, no ands - ifs - or buts about it!! It‚Äôs like her own damn ‚Äúlawyers‚Äù didn‚Äôt realize if they claimed defense of reliance on counsel, that meant they were waiving attorney - client privileges regarding the Op-Ed and that meant it would OPEN THEM UP FURTHER for even MORE lines of questioning, that they were now putting themselves in a position and claiming something they would have to PROVE - which they already have to prove so much in this case as is, this was just adding even MORE to that ever growing list........all making it harder for her side, more work for her side, more scrutiny, etc!! That claiming this defense would basically be opening a can of worms that they would NOT want to open at all, that a lot of the behind the scenes communications, information and going ons that would have previously been PROTECTED and NOT up for questioning PRIOR to claiming defense of reliance of counsel, would NO LONGER APPLY.....meaning all of those things would be up for discussion, discovery, questioning, depositions, witnesses, testimony, admittance of evidence for trail, brought up in trial, etc etc and that they‚Äôd be wide open to it ALL, w basically none of the protections they would have had, had they NOT claimed that defense! That basically, we‚Äôd not only get to have the curtain pulled back, revealing the man behind the curtain that we shouldn‚Äôt be paying attention to, but that we‚Äôd get to interrogate the man behind the curtain, compel evidence, put him on the jury stand during the trial for the jury to see....& so much more!! 

This is what I mean, REAL lawyers would damn well know claiming defense of reliance on counsel would be opening a HUGE can of worms that they do NOT want to open, it would leave their side and Scamber Turd more vulnerable and exposed, it would be opening VERY IMPORTANT lines of questioning that would NOT be open for questioning and examination if that defense would NOT be claimed, that they‚Äôd be putting their side and Scamber Turd in a position where they now have even MORE to prove and more work to do as a result.....more bars to meet for a trial, etc etc! REAL lawyers would know that on ANY case, w ANY client - even the strongest, most reliable clients that will play out well and play to the jury and public really well, in a positive way for their side and case........even the STRONGEST cases that are pretty damn clear cut, they would really want to think this through EXTREMELY CAREFULLY if they really want to take this position and defense or not, weigh just how risky it is vs the benefits, decide if the risk is worth it and this will bode well and play out well for their side and case, they would sit to talk this through w their client IN DEPTH, discussing all this would entail, risks vs benefits, the merits of taking said defense, how it can blow up in their faces, etc etc! They would have this LONG convos w their client MULTIPLE times, fully debating the topic and fully informing client BEFORE they decided to make this defense, that way the client is fully informed and they all know what the hell they‚Äôre getting themselves into so they can FULLh prepare themselves and come up w the best game plan!!  

However, it seems like Scamber Turd‚Äôs ‚Äúlawyers‚Äù did absolutely NONE of this at all!! It‚Äôs like they just claimed this defense and thought that was the end of that! It seems like they were completely unaware and unprepared of what claiming defense of reliance on counsel entailed and just what that meant for their side, what it opened them up to, what they‚Äôd now have to prove for that defense, how attorney - client privilege would be waived by claiming this defense and just how large and ugly that can of worms are! They have been acting completely surprised at everything that‚Äôs happened to them SINCE claiming defense of reliance of counsel, completely shocked and unaware that means they‚Äôd be waiving attorney - client privilege, that they‚Äôd now have to prove that defense, that it would open them up to some pretty extraordinary and damning lines of questioning, that they‚Äôd have to submit evidence, that it would allow brand new witnesses to the list for depos and court sworn testimony in front of the jury and judge......including that of her legal team and past lawyers, as well as the ACLU,  that this would make it in to the court room at trial - in front of the jury‚Äôs eyes, and much more! Ever since they claimed defense of reliance on counsel and they found out how they fucked go, picking out and opening the worst can of worms they ever could have.....they‚Äôve been feigning ignorance and idiocy and have been trying to fight all this defense and position they took entails and opens them up to, every single baby step of the way!! Which, is actually making them look even WORSE in the courts eyes, and the public‚Äôs eyes, and we can all see the growing frustration from the courts and judge and just how quickly the judges patience is dissolving bc she‚Äôs seeing how Scamber Turd and her ‚Äúlawyers‚Äù keep trying to play games, and keep wasting the courts time playing these games! It‚Äôs really not going well for them!! 

Not to mention, any REAL LAWYERS.....esp lawyers who are actually GOOD, know their shit, and WIN their cases at an astounding rates, would know that the risks of taking this defense and all it would entail and open up their side to, particularly Scamber Turd, WAY OUTWEIGH THE BENEFITS!! That this is a risk they should NOT and do NOT want to take........that they do NOT want to pick this can of worms, let alone actually open it!! REAL lawyers would know that Scamber Turd doesn‚Äôt even really have that strong of a case, she really doesn‚Äôt have the evidence and witnesses she should and that she claims she does and acts like she does! That when comparing Johnnys side and what they‚Äôve got to hers, she‚Äôs got a really weak case that doesn‚Äôt bode well for her, esp since she‚Äôs the one that‚Äôs been running her mouth this whole time, has based her entire personality and career of this lie and has said so many things (written Op-Ed‚Äôs, etc) where she uses such strong language, makes such bold claims and accusations, that she doesn‚Äôt actually have the evidence and witnesses to back those things up!! Basically, Scamber Turd‚Äôs mouth has been writing checks that her ass can‚Äôt cash!! Real lawyers, smart lawyers who know their shit, good lawyers, lawyers who win the majority of their cases would know and see these things immediately and would know they would NOT want to even THINK about fucking w the can of worms they would be if they claimed defense of reliance on counsel!!!

Fighting abuse against women and domestic violence in particular is so important but they essentially canonized a rich beautiful white woman who‚Äôs story was shaky from day one. You know how much vetting SNCC did before they went with Rosa Parks to be the symbol of the necessity of civil rights? The movement can be hurt when you make a liar the face of it.
