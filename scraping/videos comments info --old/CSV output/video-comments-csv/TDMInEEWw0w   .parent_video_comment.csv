I leave that up to the courts to decide.  Even if they decide against her, it is up to them to determine sentence, and I don't want the scope to go beyond the legal requirements.

The reason for this is simple. People are not perfect. People do bad things. People do good things. The more we destroy the lives of people who do bad things the less good things we get from them.  I'm not saying they should not get punishment. I am saying the punishment needs to fit the crime, and destroying a livelihood does not fit a crime where both in the relationship were probably guilty of many wrongdoings which we cannot have been there for.  To the degree evidence is presented allowing a court to make an assessment of damages, let the payments be high enough to fulfill the demands of justice, but do not make justice about piling on far above that.",Xanas,0,2021-02-25T18:46:23Z

In the case involving Amber and Johnny have some distinct differences. He is being kicked out of almost all of his rules based on accusations from her. He was apparently told that if he could win a defamation lawsuit, which requires the Publisher specifically knowing they were defaming him, he could continue to work. She is on tape saying that she had assaulted him but nobody will believe you because you‚Äôre a guy. So we are saying at least give us the same standard.
