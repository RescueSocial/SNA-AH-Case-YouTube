He seemed to hate her guts most of the time, but stayed with her, married her, got fat tattoos for her. WHY?? Did he have a contract to fulfill? I do believe that, that and that he has no common sense whatsoever. Plus no self esteem and self love. Nobody can seriously love a woman like that.  And why did he chicken out when she accused him of being the abuser? No, he paid her money. He should have opened his mouth right then.  And why does he do it now? Because basically he is afraid of losing the contracts with the sponsors and studios and needs his reputation to be rehabilitated. What I also don't understand: The SUN (was that the paper?) called him a wife beater. He wasn't convicted and therefore innocent (until proven otherwise) and the SUN should have been fined without any kind of arguments. Period. Why must everybody go to this whole process is really strange. Like they use the situation to dig in the dirt.",2020-07-13T19:54:55Z,1
