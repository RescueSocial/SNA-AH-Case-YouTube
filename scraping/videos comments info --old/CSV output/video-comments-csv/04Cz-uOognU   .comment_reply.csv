4,Ugyi0vnWCrPpUxbK9VN4AaABAg,Ghostluster,"‚Äã@Samantha McBay I think you are right, I had a girlfriend once, who was trying to explain me repeatedly obvious things she thought they would be very smart thoughts, like I didn't understand them, but in reality I was already 1-2 points ahead, and she in fact didn't understand what I reacted to her thoughts, and she thought then, maybe via projecting, that I didn't understand HER point. Because it cannot be, that maybe I'm smarter in something than she is. And most of us know, that smart people know very well they aren't smarter than everybody else, and especially not all the time. I think in her case she misunderstands her being successful, she probably thinks being successful requires being intelligent, so she MUST be intelligent. These types of women normally end up with some big, bald muscle guy, where they get both the good looks and the protection, which is on their level of status, while being able to maintain intellectual superiority. Or at least that's what I'm associating with her.",2021-11-11T18:38:55Z,0
5,Ugyi0vnWCrPpUxbK9VN4AaABAg,Samantha McBay,"I think she believes she‚Äôs very intelligent because she seemed uses it belittle Johnny on tape. She was constantly pushing the idea that she knows more than him, using big words and treating him like a child, and then expecting gratitude for it. She implied ‚ÄúI‚Äôve monitored your medication and taken care of you now you should show appreciation for that‚Äù. Even when he seemed calm and level headed (which he was through out all the tapes) she was gaslighting him trying to make him think he was being irrational  and delusional, and at one point got him his medication to deflect her own irrational and overly agitated behaviour on to him. I am a woman and yes we can hotheaded, and I absolutely love seeing other woman stand up for herself, but this was not woman being hothead or defending herself. In the tapes she was manipulative and overly controlling. She belittled and called him a coward for wanted to get out of physical fights. Not ok. She was also using his medication to control him. That is abuse. Telling him that he was delusional for any counter arguments he made. For example when he said he caught her in a lie when she lied about her hitting him, Or when he gave reasons for needing to leave when she started to get physically violent. When he‚Äôs trying to work it out, she said she couldn‚Äôt promise not to get physically violent again, that she gets upset and she should be allowed to do that. She seems oblivious to that fact he has rights too, that he  should be able to walk away when she‚Äôs hitting him or throwing things at him. Just because she‚Äôs a women it does not make her behaviour ok, and neither should she be treated like a victim when she‚Äôs clearly not‚Ä¶ DV is never ok no matter what gender the perpetrator is, or what gender the victim is.",2021-11-08T05:25:22Z,2

Personally, I get a little triggered and uneasy as though somehow I caused the argument or fight but it depends. I‚Äôm obviously not a therapist but my siblings do better than me and can disassociate (a coping mechanism) to get through what anyone may be trying to verbally or emotionally hurl at them.

In the second video he says, ""Objection harassing, argumentative, vague.""  He's making 3 objections this time.  Harassing and argumentative are very similar objections and he's basically saying he thinks the questioner is harassing Amber with the question.  The vague objection is over the words, ""made a door go into his head,"" which is a very weird way of asking if Amber closed a door on Johnny Depp's head. 

In the third video there's a bunch of objections all at once before the judge steps in and makes the lawyers calm down.

559,Ugz6bHMfuxdTafaOrkd4AaABAg,J P,"Yeah, I def think there is a major drug problem going on for years on Johnny's part since he has consistently been around with drug users and then her... She seems the equivalent of a lit match that can light the smallest bit of gasoline a person may have. I'm also an addict and it comes with a 6th sense for your people. He's always been close friends with heroin addicts and alcoholics especially. She strikes me as ClusterB, but I don't want to throw those terms around. She comes off as manipulative and like the type that excuses causing harm to others with real and imagined transgressions when coming to having their feelings hurt.
That being said it's important for me to state that drug abuse in no way makes someone morally bankrupt or bad. Addiction is a symptom of trauma, in particular childhood trauma. Which Johnny has a history of. His mother was abusive and he had a really dysregulated home life. A lot of people are misinformed on addiction, especially since a lot of things have changed since the days of ""they need to hit rock bottom"", ""tough love"" and just general contempt towards people who suffer from addiction. We now know that addiction is purely mental. You can become addicted to anything if you are predisposed to it genetically and have a mental illness, past trauma, history of abuse, etc. 
Withdrawal only happens with certain substances and is actually normal when it comes to things like opioid pain medications. What people once referred to as ""physical addiction"" is now labeled as dependence. You can become dependent on non-narcotic substances. It's just a feature of some medications like Effexor(which I have been on since 16/17 and its withdraw is unreal).
Just a casual disclaimer incase anyone gets triggered by my guesses that could be wrong. Being an addict doesn't mean he's bad or evil, but it can change a person's behavior. I remember there being some argument that she was withholding medication from him and if he was struggling with dependency not only is that akin to torture, it is something that can cause an addict to do things they would not normally do.

You assume that people who report their abuse, or trust the justice system in their country to be lying? This is why people Don't report, because of people like you. I trust the justice system, not society. 

I don't particularly care if you believe me, I have enough evidence to support my case should I need it, but it's not your place to accuse people of lying about what happened to them.

The UK courts aren't too bad at abuse cases, and we are the first county in the world to recognise coercive control. 

I suggest you may want to read up on this subject before making sweeping statements about who is, and isn't guilty based on your ignorant opinion. 

Most abuse targets suffer gaslighting, so your attempts at further invalidation are damaging and dangerous. You don't need to immediately believe every claim to make or create a safe space for abuse survivor's to come forward,  you just need to not immediately assume they are lying.",2021-02-03T10:57:05Z,0

Please take the time to listen to the audio recordings if you haven't already. Throughout all of the audio recordings you don't once hear Amber Heard say anything about him hitting her, but she does admit in those recordings to attacking him, including severing his finger by throwing a vodka bottle at him, as well as throwing pots & pans at him, & berates him for leaving every single time she physically attacks him. Everytime Amber Heard & her friends have told their stories in court they can't keep their stories straight, they've already changed their stories at least 5 times already, & Amber has been caught out lying more then once in court, including claiming that Johnny kept her from driving for 3 years to control her, when there's evidence of her driving & even getting herself into car accidents during those 3 years. Then you have the testimony of two sets of police officers, who all say they saw no property damage, & most importantly, no injuries on Amber whatsoever. Amber's own stylist even says she saw her makeup free the day after Amber claims to have been horrifically beaten with no injuries, & Amber has no record of needing medical treatment the entire time she was with Johnny, whereas Johnny's the one who wound up in hospital because of her. Amber claims he isolated her, but she had all of her friends living next door to them, in the penthouses that Johnny owned, completely rent free, whereas Johnny couldn't even visit their neighbour Issac without Amber attacking him for it. And finally Amber has a history of abusing her former partners, she was even arrested for it, whereas Johnny has no history of abusing any of his former partners, in fact Vanessa Paradis has even said she never even heard him so much as raise his voice to their two children.",2021-02-01T19:14:54Z,0

Abuse doesn't happen immediately, it's slow and insidious. First, they isolate you, they destroy your self-esteem, and then they make you believe that you can't survive without them. They gaslight you into believing that it's your fault and that ""if only you hadn't done x"" they wouldn't have got angry. You get told over and over again how lucky you are that they love you, or are willing to put up with you, that you're useless. Once you realise what's going on and leave, they further traumatise you by blaming you, calling you crazy. they know all your buttons so they know how to push you so you look crazy then say ""see, she's the crazy one"" some abusers are very calm and collected. It took several friends, and four psychologists to make me realise that what i was experiencing was abuse. When you escape, you're blamed, just as people are blaming amber. whether she was an abuser or not remains to be seen, but if you watch the Jonny depp video, whenever he recalls her 'acts of violence' he shows dupers delight, and there's a video which shows him trashing the house.",2021-01-01T00:07:35Z,2

There is a lot to unpack in this case.

She and her system are one of the oldest to give interviews and such, she's very well known in the DID community. She's been trying to educate people about DID for yeeeeears, had a youtube channel that only got hate cause it wasn't a ""recognized"" disorder yet (has a new one now), was Trisha Paytas ex-gf (the one she used as example in her fake ass, demeaning, ridiculous video saying she had DID - she doesn't, btw). And I say this because it's not the behavior panel's job (and could actually be very prejudicial to the community) to check if they're ""lying"" The diagnosis is a job for psychologists, psychiatrists, people who handle mental health disorders, not behaviour analysts (not demeaning any of them, but each job requires a different specialization). DID is a scientifically proven disorder with scientific data. DID is caused by extreme and RECURRENT abuse (psychological, physical, sexual) during an amount of time of a child's life. The DID can only happen until the ages of 6-9 (depending on the child's brain development) cause that's when the brain fully becomes ""one entity"" (one person with many types of tastes and likes and dislikes, morals, etc), but in DID the brain remains ""fractured"" in the sense that parts that form someone's ""personality"" can become people themselves (I'd recommed DissociaDID's channel for all the info on how it works). It's a very complex disorder that has a current diagnosis % the same as depression, and that's ONLY the people who are diagnosed! So you can imagine how many people who either don't know what this is, or that they could have it, etc are out there, undiagnosed. And again, I only say this because spreading misinformation about this, or any other, disorder, is extremely prejudicial. DID system CAN have semi-normal lives, but not if people who don't have the knowledge put them under a microscope and claim they might be lying. Is like saying to someone with depression ""you just have to feel okay and think good thoughts and you won't have it anymore"", no, that's not how it works cause depression is about an imbalance of chemicals in the brain, and no amount of ""good thoughts"" will change that üôÑ. Depression is 100% accepted nowadays as a disorder, but when it wasn't, people would be taken to mental asylums as ""hysteria"", and that wasn't that long ago! So can you imagine how long it'll take till people accept DID as a ""normal"" disorder that happens due to trauma (like PTSD, another disorder who wasn't fully accepted till recently!), without misinformation? Now multiply that by a thousand if people who aren't qualified, start dismissing the disorder. The number of suicide among those with DID is high already, they don't need any more people who aren't in the area of trauma, disorders, brain, etc to put their two cents in. Remember, DID is caused by extreme TRAUMA, always. So by dismissing their disorder is like dismissing the awful awful things they went through. That's all, sorry for the huge comment üòÖ",2020-11-20T23:21:41Z,1

 He said he believed AH because she worked for the UN ( with his wife's best friend) & WAS UNDER OATH....while calling JD's 40-plus witnesses liar's including the police officers, multiple Drs who saw nothing on her, video, CCTV, Building personnel, estate managers, eyewitnesses, etc etc ALL LIED UNDER OATH!

After she heard about the Australia incident where Amber (according to herself) was ‚Äúa hostage for three days‚Äù and Johnny got his fingertip severed by a (probably) 1 liter vodka bottle smashing on the kitchen isle where he had his hand after dodging a smaller bottle (probably a 0.7 liter bottle) that smashed the mirror behind his head and a cigarette put out on his face, she said in front of everyone that (paraphrasing) ‚Äúshe‚Äôs really done it now‚Äù and acting anxious and emotionally disheveled... so, take from that what you will...",2021-05-04T04:32:43Z,2

The woman who be-littled you,  hit you, kicked you, threw objects at you, sending you to the hospital with a cut off finger.  pood in your bed.   Brought other men to your apartment late at night while you were out of the country filming.  And took 7 mil from you claiming to have donated it to charity.    Drank in front of you while you were trying to get sober.  Withheld detox meds from you and had you help her lie to the Aussie Authorities for her bringing the dogs into the country illegally.  Then blame shifts you!  And now get a BS biased decision from an impartial judge that costs you your job.   The agony of me just writing this all out is brutal.   I'm not a Depp head by any means - just an advocate for justice.   Its possible we wont see justice at all.   The only justice might come by way of public opinion and not the courts.

The fact that he said nothing and for years allowed her to stand on podiums and give speeches as a representative of DV survivors and THEN finally put the truth out after her Op-Ed and losing his job over that Sun article, it ended up exposing her as a fraud and made her look like a fool. So, well played by her at first because she gained sympathy, fame and his money, but even better un-purposely played by JD because by default of society he stayed quiet which endeared us to him when the truth came out. Now we are marveling that it took him so long, that he took all her abuse even while she was gaining accolades for something he didn't do. I'm really enjoying all the backlash she's getting.

You got to hand it to Amber - she played it perfectly.   She know how it was going to play out, and in reflection, didnt we all?   The Weinsteins and Epsteins are out there, and they paved the path for all men like JD to toilet bowled into the ""category""   Toss in Sheen with that too - But JD?   He's a victim of a hoax and tossed into a pit because we are all overreacting to the #meetoo movement.  Why?  Because we all believe in the #meetoo movement.   I have 4 daughters - and i've seen sexual harassment in the workplace.  JD is a victim of societies overreaction.   Including this ""Judge Nichols""   Who disregarded all the facts, evidence and this BS testimony AH presented here in this deposition.  All BULLSh-t!  But - what a play AH!   Nicely done.

Try again and focus on lowering your breathing to your abdominal area when you will find your hands moving up and down. This is meditation breathing and it works quiet miracles for people in all sorts of stress. I live with severe chronic pain and use this breathing to greatly reduce my high pain levels.

Her verbal abuse on the audio is her spewing her feelings out all over the room and shrinking with a time that is abusive. People have a right to leave in the face of that. They do not discuss his behavior that causes her to be upset. It is a circular reasoning issue where she supposedly gets mad that he leaves and he leaves because she gets mad. There is an element missing. They avoid him facing his part. He is blind to his provocations.  Her anxiety when he storms out is common among addicts wives. He lies about her to others.

He spends the entire video assuring her that his anger has nothing to do with her, tosses the phone she had been secretly recording him with so lightly it doesn't break, then disengages. What TMZ (or she) didn't show is that she goes to pick up the phone, smirking, and heads out after him. Because she starts fights, she turns them into physical abuse, and he either takes it or runs away from her, locking himself in bathrooms and sleeping on floors. He is not a violent or abusive person and never has been with any of the other women he's been with, but she was arrested and jailed for physically assaulting her girlfriend in public. There are hours of recorded audio of her yelling and screaming at him about how she hates that he doesn't fight with her, that she will not stop physically abusing him, and mocking him for saying that her throwing heavy objects at his head, clawing his face, and punching him FREQUENTLY is domestic abuse. She pushed him into marrying her and stayed with him so long because she wanted his money and the fame being his wife brought her. All this evidence is freely and widely available.

1062,Ugyl-Iku3M4NsFlFn-94AaABAg,Paul Ward,"I believe they've covered it in bits and pieces in other videos similar to this one. Botox obviously restricts muscles, making it harder to read expressions in the affected areas, but it's not the case of completely freezing a person's entire face. An observer/analyser of body language would establish a baseline with the subject so they can still spot deviations in behaviour and look to the cues that are still visible in these cases:

Facial expression, indicators around the moving muscles as these still operate the same way. Eye movement is not affected by botox and can be a clear marker under pressure, including where they look and when, and movement of the head (up, down, to the side, do they jut in towards the interrogator or pull away)
Hands and arms and shoulders, do they close or cross them to make a pdychological barrier or open them up to imply honesty and trust, do they use illustrators and why
Body position, leaning in or away
Speech pattern and choice of language, particularly, does it match the emotion they are displaying or does it appear to be creating a false narrative.
There are other cues to look for as well in body language, such as stress responses like tapping or rubbing of the hands and shaking legs or feet, and one this channel taught me with the Prince Andrew video, which is detecting a person's heart rate by having them pop one knee on top of the other to see how their hanging foot bobs as blood comes through the artery.

When you consider all these factors are still relevant in examining a subject, botox does create a degree of extra challenge if you can't see a person's body, particularly when looking at a video, but if you had any idea what you were doing as an interrogator you would adjust the scene so that you can examine an entire body to be able to spot markers across the entire body.",2020-11-12T12:35:29Z,2

You do have to do the research to be thoroughly convinced of that, since she is sometimes a good liar, but it‚Äôs become clear over time, and with all the info out there, that Amber was the abuser. Their relationship was rocky, and he wasn‚Äôt perfect, but she has really pulled the wool over lots of eyes.

I fully agree with you, unfortunately, some people can't be fixed. I've also heard professionals say that they are undetectable, most of them -lol Trump is-because they are not really mentally 'sick people'. It's the way they relate which is profoundly sick.¬†
For us, it took two psychiatric expertises   and the second, done in Switzerland lasted 8 months around the child, alone then with each parent and many appointments. Only then, did they finally state that there was a danger of manipulation from the father and no worries with me, as for the child. Justice being what it is, it didn't suffice and some more years were necessary for my son to regain his full freedom. He was 9 when he was taken away (custody) and 14 when he finally was able to come back. Now, he can be touchy sometimes but is very strong, super creative and quite brillant in music and sound, which are his passion. He has good friends, a great social life. Still lives with me to this day... lol! Until I kick him out and tell him to get himself a job ;)
Man oh man, why am i telling you my story? - People need to be aware of those individuals, they can destroy you if you don't understand the mechanism. They feed out of the despair they trigger in you, the sorrow, zero compassion and they manipulate all people against you with lies and then they cry out playing the victim and everyone believes them. But the way out  -there is a way out!!- fortunately, is to cut all ties, and stop feeding the mechanism. Stop putting logs into the fire. Detach emotionally and let go fully. I was blessed to have a lot of support and my spiritual journey truly helped me get over it in a healthy and resilient way. Same for my boy. Resilience is amazing and then you are so much stronger than before!

The guy criticing the body language of the suspect talked about crossed arms not meaning anger and a way of putting something between  the suspect and others. BUT he missed the fact that the suspect was standing there swaying back and forth. That guy was rocking himself. He was hoping himself and swaying like you do trying to calm a small child - himself.

Then as he was talking about the situation being resolved he smiled. That smile, like Depp's smile about the vodka bottle thrown his way was inappropriate, involuntary, and telling.
