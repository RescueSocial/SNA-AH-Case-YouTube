1,UgylAACSVZLhJE_7Gut4AaABAg,Aaron Songer,"@Council of Geeks Totally agree. The amount of people that are actually involved and listening to what is out there and can make there own opinions about somthing and not just mindlessly fallow the flow of their own circle are very low. In today's society people are not grown up with the same values i was taught in pre school, The golden Rule. You think of that like I do and people would be much more open for communication, but today the loudest to yell is 1st.",2021-03-16T22:47:59Z,0
2,UgylAACSVZLhJE_7Gut4AaABAg,Council of Geeks,"That's kind of my point. Especially when it comes to entertainment the number of people who'll say ""we're boycotting this"" who were A) actually likely to buy a ticket in the first place and B) truly prepared to give up something they were looking forward to is never big enough.

I suspect part of the problem is a sense that you can't replace it with something else. Like if you decided to boycot a clothing line or a specific food company, others are making basically the same thing and it's easy to migrate. But movies are (theoretically) more unique experiences.",2021-03-16T22:00:31Z,1

You can make general statements about policing ""our own people,"" but the only one we've been specific about is Gina Carano, who is a sweetheart according to those who know her, and who hasn't done anything wrong.  Whatever general statement you think you have to say about politics and minorities isn't really specific, and doesn't have anything to do with Gina Carano.  I have plenty of answers, but your statement is so broad it has no meaning.",2021-03-21T01:18:23Z,0
5,Ugyda5EmM5-lnVIQMLJ4AaABAg,Roscoe P. Coltrane,"@Deadly Wax Studios What Gina said - well, retweeted.  She didn't even say it first-hand - was in defense of ideology, and her analogy was in defense of religious ideology.  Well, Jews can refer to an ethnicity or a religion, but that's besides the point.  Did you even read what she retweeted?  Calling her biased against the Jews or against any religion (or ethnicity) is a false narrative based on that retweet.  I call out people ""on my side"" when they are wrong, but Gina has done nothing wrong.  But if you think Kathleen Kennedy is a heroine and Gina Carano is a villain, then I don't think there is any middle ground in-between us.  It's too bad how polarized things are right now.  I hope we learn to come together instead of become more divided.  It would be horrible if things got to be as bad as the world was eighty years ago.",2021-03-20T19:48:44Z,0
6,Ugyda5EmM5-lnVIQMLJ4AaABAg,Roscoe P. Coltrane,"‚Äã@Deadly Wax Studios She honored the Jews by remembering their plight and hoping to prevent history repeating itself.  She basically said ""love your neighbor,"" because hating your neighbor is what enables people in power to be cruel.  Mando, on the other hand, actually did compare the USA directly to Nazis, and faced no repercussions.  Gina's firing was in no way based on any moral imperative; it was an excuse to oust a popular strong female character because it destroyed Kathleen Kennedy's false narrative that the reason fans hate everything she produced was based on misogyny.  Fans like good characters and good stories.  Gina was a fan favorite.  Favreau is a fan favorite, and hopefully Kennedy's future replacement.",2021-03-16T12:29:02Z,0

I have seen a lot of women tip toe around the domestic violence issue when its towards a man from a woman - a far cry from the empathy leveled toward women victims. It just bothers me that so many creators seem much more ready to jump on a man, but not as much a woman even with all of the evidence and especially the audio recordings where she admitted everything.

64,Ugwb-_P3Uz5M8VxAnQ94AaABAg,Warren Marris,"@Lola Twinkle It is most likely that Depp is the most truthful of the two - But WE WERE NOT THERE!!! We have a Second hand story... Without Direct experience, You have to make a Judgement call and be happy with your own choices.

If you believe Depp - Good on you! I cannot fault you and won't... If Pushed, I would have to say I lean more towards Depp! I feel that the in court arguments have laid far more in his favour than Herd. The original Judgement HORRIFIES ME as I was a reader of THE SUN Newspaper and I know how they are more interested in Sensational Headlines than facts. - Jesus, This case came less than a year after this ""Comic"" was forced to say SORRY for its coverage of the Hilsborough Disaster from Decades past... Where they ACTIVLY LIED about VICTIMS WHO WERE TRAMPLED TO DEATH!

But I also can see the other side... Based on Experience!

Many years ago - I became the Third Party in an affair... The man concerned was openly violent and aggressive towards his partner who I liked, and we embarked on a clandestine relationship for a short time... I DESPISE ANY MAN WHO RAISES A HAND TO WOMAN - The only time I see it as Palatable is if that woman would leave a child in danger by their actions... Because as ADULTS, Children rely on us!!! 

During that brief period of time though... I saw another side to the woman... She wasn't as innocent as she made herself out to be and I discovered that the man, who for the record is 100% a scumbag... That he COULD BE TURNED... 

...In fact, For a while, After he more or less discovered what was going on - He even came to me FOR HELP!!! For some reason, He found he could talk to me and wanted to change his ways - Be a better person! 

It never happened of course... But being on the inside, I saw that this was far from a one size fits all! There were issues that Could and DID provoke him - I do not under any circumstances condone his behaviour -  I am merely stressing that in the case of Herd and Depp, We are OUTSIDERS... 

We only know what has been presented to the courts. We will NEVER KNOW the full story!

The one thing we do know for sure... Amber Herd used THE SUN to Target and Destroy Depp! THAT IS UNDENIABLE! 

For my perspective - If she truly believes Depp is SO DANGEROUS... WHY DID SHE GO TO THE MEDIA WHEN HE WILL STILL MAINTAIN A MASSIVE FOLLOWING NO MATTER WHAT IS PRINTED OR SAID ABOUT HIM? 

Depp, Mignogia, Hell even Marylin Manson... All have resulted in CIVIL CASES! Surly if these men are SO DANGEROUS... The Victims would want to REMOVE THEM FROM SOCIETY WHERE THEY COULD NEVER HARM ANOTHER HUMAN... WHY DESTROY THEIR CAREERS???

UNLESS... It was never about their behaviour but their WEALTH!

This has been my issue with so called ""Cancel Culture"" for some time... I believe all abusers, regardless of their position, fame, ethnicity, or other protected characteristics should be held accountable - Should face punishment in some form... but it has become TWISTED on Social Media... Weaponised as it were for illegitimate reasons.

It was always going to happen... I predicted this back in 1997, Long before the internet was in all our homes... I knew that the Internet would create ""Factions"" - The Far Left and Far Right would from little Armies sharing their skewed opinions with fellow followers and a shit storm would follow... 

But through it all, There is hope and balance - I have nothing but respect for @Council of Geeks as I asked them some time ago for their views on this - and was very politely greeted back with ""Please don't ask me for my opinions on that, its such a mess and I don't feel I have anything to add"" (I have paraphrased... I asked on Twitter I believe and I have long since stopped using that platform due to it being a total shit show!)

Sorry for such a long reply, but I hope you understand that I need you to see the context and why I have the views that I do... Clearly you lean more towards believing Johnny Depp - And fair play to you, In all honesty... Based on the information we have available to us - I feel more or less the same, but I maintain an air of realism...

...What has been heard is a mere snapshot of a relationship! How much more is unheard or unseen? We may never know...

You are not wrong to support Depp! to say you were would be like me condemning someone for Voting for Trump or Biden... I personally do not hold either in high esteem... I personally think they are both horrible, but I support freedom of speech and freedom of expression. You have that right to support Depp! NO ONE SHOULD EVER TELL YOU THAT YOU ARE WRONG! 

We all have to make judgements based on the information we have available, and we make those judgements in good conscience - If they later prove to be wrong, It can hurt... But that is life! 

And as I said, On a personal note - I tend to lean more towards Depp, I have simply made a personal choice to look deeper and I feel that it may be more ""A Full on Toxic Relationship"" where BOTH have more fault than we have seen...",2021-03-04T09:40:55Z,0

85,Ugyu0ExE1W1QHMEIQWh4AaABAg,TheThemasticator,"@Andrea Solano ¬†@Andrea Solano¬† wow if your going to be that person I unfortunately have to be the one to go against what was asked of me and say nope, thats not true nor is it that simple. a judge reviewed evidence from both sides and despite there being many witnesses against her as well as physical evidence against her he ascertained that solely because a single witness and her family member and 2 literal freeloading friends; who happened to also be the primary witness claiming to be a victim of said DV which somehow entitled her to go to the press with accusations against her now Ex despite part of the settlement she had just won forbidding either party to talk about any of the matters publicly causing a tabloid to wrongfully and maliciously give him a damaging label; claimed through strictly spoken testimony that they were telling the truth and that anyone else saying otherwise was wrong, lying, and bought or paid for by her Ex which then caused the judge to throw out other evidence from reliable and respectable witnesses simply because she said they were lying, and then ruled against the defamation claim without explaining or citing any reasonable reason as to how and why he ruled this way except for that because the witness had simply said she had already donated the entirety of her divorce settlement to the charities she claimed she wanted it to go to; which were the only reason she had won 7 million dollars in the settlement to begin with as the court only ruled in her favor because she claimed she wasn't looking for money at all and that anything that she was awarded would go to charity; and so because she had donated 7 million dollars to charity that she couldn't be the ""gold digger"" she was alleged to be and so somehow that still allowed a tabloid to call her Ex that label. A judge's only job is to find out if what is being said or shown is the truth and that means that if someone says they donated money from a settlement they litterally only won because the money was supposed to go to charities, then you have to affirm the truth of that spoken statement by corroborating it with those charities, you don't get to just ""take someone's word"" as truth (thats the whole point of any legal system right? Otherwise anybody can say or accuse or claim whatever they want), and if he would've done that it would've been discovered earlier that she lied because she hadn't and still hasn't donated a single cent to said charities. All that doesn't even mention how this judge whom you just spoke of as of they were the epitome of a paragon of the infallible and completely unbiased and fair legal system who's word is like law and God which is never wrong ever, has multiple and considerably significant ties to the witness and her legal team and the tabloid she is a witness for, and regardless of conspiracy or not theres enough ties that are strong enough to one side of the case that warranted any moral, reasonable and respectable judge to recuse themselves from the case before it even began to avoid it even slightly looking as bad as it does. 
Putting 100% faith with no accountability to judges are why the legal system can be taken advantage of and is advantage of; for example, what you said could easily be said about the Zimmerman trial, yes a judge and jury ""reviewed"" both sides of the case, but because a spoken statement was taken as fact (unfortunately that kind of statement cannot be disproven, unlike facts claimed by AH) he got off, or what if a female judge refuses to grant custody of a small child to a man who has filed for custody because he said the mother is unfit and instead grants the unfit mother care because they claim a mother can't be unfit. where the child then dies, its pretty obvious the judge, and in turn the court made the wrong decision after reviewing both sides. Although these are more extreme comparisons, they are still relevant, and they're more well documented and/or more widely known. 
The problem the OP has is that while it's somewhat understandable to avoid ""taking sides"", it's not necessarily right to talk about anything like this without taking everything that is presented into account and stating what the evidence shows objectively and not subjectively is much more important than being impartial because this is an issue that the world is facing today whether or not you see it or believe it, it's happening. Without speculating as to what ""really"" happened, through what both sides actually presented as evidence, the witness never proved that anyone else outside of her sibling and friends actually saw or knew about the acts she claimed were DV and on the contrary multiple pieces of evidence proved she had committed acts which were undeniably DV on top of all of her groups inconsistencies.
It doesn't help either that because the majority of the population doesn't really understand law let alone follow along all the details of trials in general, they have a false faith and trust in the legal system and their perception is that every trial is always fair and unbiased and whatever the outcome and ruling is it must always be right and correct without a doubt, when in reality it is exploited and taken advantage of all the time due to it being operated by people who can be biased and/or corruptible, as well as the abundance of gray areas like interpretation, arguable semantics, limit of scope, court deadlines and statutes.
Everything i have just laid out is not opinion it is exactly what happened and it is also well documented, so people who come in and say arbitrary statements like yours without actually knowing what's going on are the problem with this situation to begin with, if you don't actually know what is happening don't even say anything.",2021-03-06T21:22:56Z,0

Grievous defined as severe or serious.¬†8)¬†¬†¬†I didn‚Äôt say that she needs to be hospitalized to claim domestic abuse. I said that the injuries that¬†¬†would have required a hospital.

He never said she was ‚Äúlike an angel of mercy‚Äù, but he did say that while she helped and got angry if he broke his sobriety, she would also drink in excess with him there, pour him whiskey shots and cut him lines of cocaine. 10) Actually, most people who have researched the case have seen the same inconsistencies. But if you want to continue to assume that anyone who sees the inconsistencies with Heard‚Äôs allegations and issues with the judgement are delusional or whatever you want to call it, even when providing you with examples that you look up and see for yourself, please continue wearing your rose-colored glasses‚Ä¶maybe buy a second pair that is less opaque.

124,UgzWwBhbf5J4_vowArl4AaABAg,Luna Wolf,"@hexum7 For some reason I am having trouble with commenting, but here you go: 1)¬†¬†Depp did have a different story when they were still in a relationship. Since this went to court, his story (including the fact that he covered for her) has not changed. Unlike hers, which would know¬†¬†had been following the case. 2) I didn‚Äôt write the Depp was faultless, as I said I have been looking at her case and her allegations on commenting on that the Judge‚Äôs written reasoning. I do believe Depp has more drug issues than he alleged but the does not make him an abuser. 3)¬†¬†I didn‚Äôt say Depp needed to describe the monster for the judge¬†. What I said that the Judge¬†¬†that ‚ÄúDepp described the monster‚Äù in his judgment, but the examples Nicols gave do not back up his own statement. After reviewing the judgement, I realized that I misquoted the Judge, Nicols said ‚Äúnot ‚Äú‚Äù. 4) ¬†I never said a witness said they saw her without injuries. I said two of her witness contradicted Heard in regards to makeup used to cover ‚Äúbruises‚Äù in general and for a specific incident. Reminder these were NGN‚Äôs witnesses (supporting Heard), it is in their best interest for you to find them just as credible as Heard. 5)¬†Depp admitted to their being times where he acted in self-defense however, he did not admit to abusing Heard. And before you argue that this is Depp‚Äôs stance or that it was mutual abuse (which is a myth, google it), recall that Nicols stated that Heard‚Äôs violence was relevant because if Depp acted in self-defense it was not abuse.",2021-03-18T18:48:26Z,0

But at least those tapes had a huge impact on public opinion, which I believe to be just as important - if not more - than a judge's verdict in this case. After all, it's the public opinion that Amber weaponized against him, costing him his career (well, obviously his poor work ethic on recent sets like PotC 5 didn't help...) and it's what matters to big movie companies.
If he can clean up his act a little, get the help he needs and keep public opinion on his side, I'd say he can still get back what he's lost. 
But I must admit that Amber still has much more support than I was expecting given the evidence against her. I thought she was just a random spoiled pretty girl but so many people seem so determined to protect her that I've wondered if maybe she has the Illuminati on her side or something and no one told me, lol.

I can't remember if he meant just hitting her in any capacity (suggesting that he never did so far) or if he meant causing her serious injuries, but at least I didn't get the impression that it was something that happened on a regular basis (he mentioned throwing something at her ""only one time"" in retaliation so at least not often enough that he would lose count).

The percentage of people who pirate because they have some reason to not want to give money to the creators is utterly dwarfed by the percentage of people who pirate simply because they have no moral issue with doing so. And those people (again, the vast majority of pirates) were never going to pay to see the thing anyways. 

This is part of why you rarely see studios get up in arms over pirating like they did about a decade ago. They still don't like it, but time has proven that if it hurts them at all it's so minorly to not be worth sinking time and money into trying to stop. Heck WB themselves (or at least their HBO arm) figured that out early and flat out said they didn't care if people pirated Game of Thrones at its height, because as far as they were concerned it was free word of mouth marketing being done by people who weren't going to pay for it anyways.",2021-03-01T15:47:17Z,16
