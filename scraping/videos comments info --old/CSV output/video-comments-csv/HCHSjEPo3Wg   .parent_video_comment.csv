0,UgwTHLh8liPZHhfrTAF4AaABAg,WB is not firing amber heard from aquaman or Johnny Depp from fantastic beast. WB generally don‚Äôt fire actors based on what happens in there personal lives unless it‚Äôs something so big they cannot ignore. The only studio I can see taking issue with stuff like this is Disney being a family oriented brand and all.,Tasheena Johnson,0,2020-04-06T14:14:09Z

4,Ugwkg2_9P4F8tN1bvVd4AaABAg,"I think WB needs to not give a crap about Hollywood rumors and hearsay. The fact is both of them are pretty extreme characters with the drugs, violence, and other crap they both did to each other. I don't think it matters who has recent recordings of who because it doesn't really track.  I think she and Depp need to just settle outside of court and go their separate ways and call it a day. The more they go at each other the more their careers suffer.",Unworshipediety,0,2020-03-30T19:15:26Z

11,UgxBoLkLaeFthoQq7i14AaABAg,"Don't trust WGTC, but i do believe Amber will be dropped from Aquaman 2 due to the Johnny Depp allegations and it's also because of those allegations that's made Aquaman 2 my least most excited for DC movie that and also it's because i haven't heard any production news that should get me excited, but since i loved the first Aquaman and i love Jason Momoa as the character i'm not crossing Aquaman off my list of DC movies to see.








oh and yes, i'm one of the people that wants Amber fired off of Aquaman 2 #Aquaman2 #RemoveAmberHeardFromAquaman2",Dark Claw,2,2020-03-30T12:47:35Z
