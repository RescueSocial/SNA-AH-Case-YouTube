You are a hypocrite and are only offended by what you disagree with. When those you like do the same thing as those you attack, you go and defend them for it. Once more, this shows everyone that they cannot take you seriously anything you say, as all you care about is your personal political ideas and preferences ahead of caring about anything of substance.

41,Ugwv7N_BcJmrc76XrPR4AaABAg,"""Freedom of speech"" is out of vogue in those circles. Instead, they want freedom from speech. What really bugs me, is that they think they're creative and artistic, when they require a ""safe space"" to protect them from controversial people and art. Rampant commercialism can kill creativity, but it's nowhere near as lethal as cowardice.

I looked a bit into _Holy Terror,_ because of this. I hadn't read it, and still haven't. From what I can tell, he may have gone a bit overboard, and his attempt to fit it into the genre of WW2 propaganda comics seem to have failed. However, I'd have to read it, to know if it's Islamophobic. From experience, I know that there are people who will accuse you of being an ignorant Islamophobe when you're simply quoting the Quran. You can say a lot of nasty things about jihadists, without being an Islamophobe.

Jihadist leaders actually know their theology very well, and there really are Quran verses and hadiths that support their views; saying nasty things about jihadists will usually involve mentioning their ideology, and therefore aspects of Islamic theology. This can be done, without criticizing Muslims in general. I have multiple Muslim friends; they generally agree with me that much of jihadist ideology is based in serious, Islamic theology. They disagree with that theology, and have no qualms about criticizing it, to the extent of ridiculing the idea of getting 72 virgins in Paradise as a reward for murdering people. We agree completely that the afterlife must be full of very disappointed jihadists.

Of course, there are always people who either refuse to acknowledge any kinship to evildoers, and others who feel that any criticism of anyone that shares any traits with them is a personal attack on them. In fact, these people seem to be multiplying at an alarming rate. As I said, I don't know whether this is the reason for the accusations against Miller. The odds are pretty good that it is, though...

As for 'misogyny' in _Sin City..._ What the fuck? It's set in the seedy underbelly of Las Vegas, and people think scantily clad women is out of place? The fact is, most of the women in _Sin City_ have taken control of their situation, within the framework of their ""sinful"" surroundings. They're in control of their own role and their own sexuality. This is a big part of what _Sin City_ is about. You can disagree, of course, and claim that, no, these women aren't actually in control. However, only a complete moron can fail to recognize that Miller's message is in complete concordance with a large section within feminism. If it's ""misogyny"", they should clean up their own camp, first, before going after people who have simply agreed with feminist positions.",Erik Jarandson,0,2021-08-01T01:03:04Z

I could quite literally register for nearly every convention of almost any type and turn around and cancel without losing a single cent and ""screenshot"" pictures of my ""Cancellations"" all day long... I could even go back in and register again as a different person and capture that too.... this is so much actual bullshit and I know this to be true because I have run several large sci-fi conventions in the past.  not only that, but let's assume that there is an equal distrubution of fans within Twitter as there is in the general populace... considering that Twitter has 18 million users in the UK out of 68 million total, that is just under 1/3 total population... then you must also consider the extreme bias shown in the ""Twitterverse"".... I would say at very best, Thought Bubble may have lost 20% of their total attendees by keeping Frank Miller.... As a promoter, who would like to have everyone come but understand if they don't, these are still acceptable numbers because I would still be serving 80% of the fanbase I am serving... 

Furthermore, if Shortbox or ANY other creator that is receiving outreach assistance and being recognized were to bite the hand that is feeding it, they would find themselves back out in the cold and fending for themselves again... If they don't want to deal with the rules to be helped/recognized, then they can go out and help themselves and make their own conventions... the funny thing is that their shit won't sell because they are not creative and skilled enough to do things on their own, much less garner enough PAYING attention to have such a convention of their own.

Don't like that Twatter?!? Prove me wrong!!! Organize your own convention with only the artists and ""creatives"" you deem to be ""allowable"" and then show off your sales... Prove that you have such a large and ideological audience to actually rival these other ""big name conventions"" and I will gladly concede my point and grovel in abject supplication to your superior wisdom.... Common Twatter mob... ***DO IT*** Prove me and all the other ""Man babies"", and -ists, and - phobes to be the heinous creatures you claim we are... actually put out some hard evidence that you are so very great and wonderful and have a better and more well attended convention than any other big convention ever!... I am not the least bit worried because I know that you CANNOT do it... you lack the skills, intelligence, and ability to get off of your dead asses and honestly appeal to the real fanbases that spend the money using only your ""approved guest"" list...

While it's not outright Islamophobic, but it tells about explosions on the protag's city. The context is, they're kicking ass of terrorist's organization who happens to be Islamic, which is, understandable, and keeps happening.
He might condemn the terrorism at that time, it seems farfetched that he himself is Islamophobic. The story of the Holy Terror is in the context of warzone by those religious extremists.

I live in Indonesia, my country has been wrecked by these extreme religious organizations from time to time (Bali Bombings, Jakarta Bombs and all that shit) and mostly they were done by the extremist branch, and I myself am an ex-muslim. The hypocrisy of those screaming ""Islamophobic"" is that the majority muslims being ""NonIslamophobic"" themselves, they reject local cultures, they dislike if people get out of Islam but screaming hooray like crazy if people convert to Islam.  There's been a lot of Religious Blasphemy Rule that is easily used to silence the minority in ""Most Majority Muslim"".

I'm still pissed off that those ""wokeries"" scream about Islamophobic but don't scream to the Muslims for the otherwise.

262,UgzlbmzvDSrzCk1cTQZ4AaABAg,"I would like to recall something that happened many years ago in the frame of an historicaly important event for the UK:
In the year 1941 the Gestapo raided Pablo Picasso¬¥s floor in Paris where he lived, they believed him to be in league with the french resistance (which he was). While they registered his place the Gestapo commander carefully studied his brand new mural: Guernica.
Then he asked Picasso: ""You did this?""
Picasso answered to the face of a commander on Hitler¬¥s secret police: ""No, it was you guys.""
While the officer was surely enraged neither he nor his men could do nothing about it unless they found evidence of partissan activity, wich they didn¬¥t found so they just leaved Pablo alone after a while.
The reasson why they could not touch Picasso was because they where under explicit specific orders fron the Fuhrer himself: Pablo Picasso was as many other artists living under the reich UNTOUCHABLE. Adolf didn¬¥t liked his art, in fact he despised it, but he recognized him as a true artist and as such he commanded his forces to never lay a finger on him.

Adolf Hitler had full tolerance and respect for any artist whose political thinking where the exact opposite to his and in fact protected Picasso with all his might from the ignorant mobs that where his own personal bullies.

However, nothing is ever black and white, and there is a line to everything, I feel. In this case, I would suggest you take the time to read Holy Terror, Frank Miller's conversations with Jim Lee regarding women in the All Stars Batman & Robin run, and his statements on some of the groups mentioned in your video - those things are legitimitely vile, and as the whole Kevin Smith saga has shown us (even if Smith is not on the same level of quality that Miller used to be), no one's work supercedes how they behave as people. Enourmous victim complexes are a problem in our day and age, but if there is a person who should not be given a venue, it is definitely Frank Miller.

Everyone has peers but those who do so to step on another to try to climb to the greatest. If not imaginary heights tend to build their stairway to success out of sand and dust. If not sand then wet sand and sink down quickly or go so high that their fall will be. Just the beginning of the whirlwind of discontent that could have been avoided by not using childish and petty underhanded tactics. By working hard to achieve a lasting goal and actually help enrich the literary world. Instead be disregarded and cast away from thought and memory or used as an example of how not to do something. Let alone how not to go about doing the things to gain a richer life and more fulfilled existence.

406,UgySu_SV8yozjHge7Xl4AaABAg,"Frank Miller could have his own online convention. On Twitch? Or YouTube. Livestreams, fundraising, and autographed giveaways.

Regain positive publicity. Clarify his stance on the accusations. See if he's willing to make amends with the Muslim community. Or at least one specific one. Seems pretty easy.

And, the best part of it is, he could have the autographed giveaways be eligible only if you retweet your favorite moment of the online convention.

Invade Twitter. Make them lose their minds. I'm just surprised no one is running counter culture movements on their home turf.

I....I kind of agree. This ""woke libtard"",or however you view me as, actually has a love for Frank Miller despite not agreeing with his politics. In fact, you can say he's partly an inspiration.

 I'm a trans woman, but I'm a trans woman who named herself after one of Frank Millers characters. I own a copy of Dark Knight Returns, and I love it. 

I also say this as a wrestling fan who has given into the facts that some of my favorite wrestlers are problematic. How Ric Flair didn't get Metood, or how he and the other old timers escaped the Speaking Out movement, is a mystery that will never be solved. Hell, even Steve Austin was a domestic abuser, though he seems to have straightened out today. 

I may have gone off track, I just mean, for this once, I'd agree with you. Hell, despite Frank Miller propably hating that I exist, I would meet him.

I may not like his views, but his early work can be considered an inspiration for me.

I was curious as to why Holy Terror was being called Islamophobic. So I went and read the book, and MY GOD are people dumb....

The Comic never called out Islam or Muslims in general, but the Al-Qaeda, who in the name of Islam committed horrible acts including 9/11, I never really saw any Islamophobia other than just naming one of the Terrorists ""Mohammed"", which to be fair is a common name, but other than that all I read was Batman and Catwoman rip-offs just going Punisher and killing them just as they were about to blow up a city,(they already blew up the symbol of justice in that City) and literally nothing else...

People who say that this book was as they so put it ""Islamophobic"" really didn't even try to read the damn comic or understand where this story came from.. and to associate Al-Qaeda as Islam is an Insult to the religion of Islam that I can't bear to accept.
Look I get that people may misinterpret this book and that Christianity ain't exactly clean(more in reference to the Crusades and other things) but that doesn't mean that You should the ""Al Qaeda"" represented Islam when what they did was an outright offense to the religion itself. Islam was always about love and acceptance of other cultures for me, and not what Al Qaeda was...

The Man, the Boy, and the Donkey
Aesop
A man and his son were once going with their donkey to market. As they were walking along by his side a countryman passed them and said, ""You fools, what is a donkey for but to ride upon?"" So the man put the boy on the donkey, and they went on their way.
But soon they passed a group of men, one of whom said, ""See that lazy youngster, he lets his father walk while he rides.""

So the man ordered his boy to get off, and got on himself. But they hadn't gone far when they passed two women, one of whom said to the other, ""Shame on that lazy lout to let his poor little son trudge along.""

Well, the man didn't know what to do, but at last he took his boy up before him on the donkey. By this time they had come to the town, and the passersby began to jeer and point at them. The man stopped and asked what they were scoffing at.

The men said, ""Aren't you ashamed of yourself for overloading that poor donkey of yours -- you and your hulking son?""

The man and boy got off and tried to think what to do. They thought and they thought, until at last they cut down a pole, tied the donkey's feet to it, and raised the pole and the donkey to their shoulders. They went along amid the laughter of all who met them until they came to a bridge, when the donkey, getting one of his feet loose, kicked out and caused the boy to drop his end of the pole. In the struggle the donkey fell over the bridge, and his forefeet being tied together, he was drowned.

It's a heavily exaggerated take on some issues that, to be blunt, did crop up both then and some time after. Suicide bombings, mysterious benefactory, non-zealous but compliant followers, and even the ultimate warning that there was far more at play than just the bombs going off in front of your eyes.
