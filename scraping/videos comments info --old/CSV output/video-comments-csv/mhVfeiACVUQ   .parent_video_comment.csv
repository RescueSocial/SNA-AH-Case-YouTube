1,UgxCe--T7rhP6xWhEoJ4AaABAg,She‚Äôs so stupid and so is the people who still think or even just say she‚Äôs what‚Äôs best for the movie.,Manda,0,2021-08-07T14:07:59Z

3,Ugw9KB9i0kcQasPw2qx4AaABAg,Anyone supporting her should go to hell and sit on a pointy hot coal and burn well there.  Also...at this point....any parents that take their kids to see this movie....knowing that it is supporting a known abuser....is not setting a great example for their children. At no point would I want my kids to watch her in anything.....or looking up to her as a role model. Gross.....just gross.,Ruby Sultra,0,2021-08-05T12:44:13Z
4,UgzCxDRHk-kp1ijQniJ4AaABAg,I don‚Äôt remember a movie ever getting backlash and out cry like the one Aquaman 2 is receiving. So to say they can‚Äôt give in to the public due to doing what is right for the movie is a farce. To ignore facts and evidence is a slap to the face of the consumer and says how much they think of our intelligence. In this day and age of pirating one would think you would do anything to put out a product that all consumers we be happy with. I wonder how much Amber was paid to get caught on CCTV camera snuggling up to Elon Musk while married to JD or when she admitted to being the abuser on recording while not implicating him in any abuse towards her (which she would do in a heart beat if it happened). Yup we got a paid smear campaign going on! :P,Chilltown Allstar,0,2021-08-03T02:20:46Z
5,Ugy3YxIO6HM-VroUMFR4AaABAg,"AH is a narcissist liar and Violent Abuser, has been proven! What if JM was accused would he be fired, yes! Innocent until proven guilty and it‚Äôs been proven JD is not an abuser! She‚Äôs made a mockery of DV victims!",Joanna Hamlin,0,2021-08-02T21:29:39Z
6,Ugy6YBJZTtc8k_VtEKl4AaABAg,"The morons are only looking at the petition and the almost 2 million signers and think that they‚Äôre only going to lose about a $30 million but they‚Äôre absolutely failing to look at Johnny‚Äôs Instagram Account which has almost 23 million followers. They‚Äôre looking at a potential loss of at least $345 million if not more.

The numbers are based off of $15 per ticket.

And the numbers don‚Äôt include multiple viewings by the followers which could push it up to $690 million or more.

The paid campaign is going on A.H.'s assumption it is bots who are going against her! This producer is blind for whatever reason and all we can hope is that it fails dismally even to the detriment of the other good actors!!! A sad event but as you say such is life!!!!

32,UgybY_o_0ps6zBUFDeN4AaABAg,"Unbelievable that anyone would back up and abuser just because she's a female I wonder what is in the producer's (ex: Peter Safran) background that causes him to think it's OK to hold up a female perpetrator as a role model to all the children through the world, who are able to see the movie...and then want toys that replicate the abuser. If it were the man who was the abuser, would he be held up as a role model to children? They don't need her in that movie just because she was in the first movie. As we have seen, actors are dispensable-even well-loved and talented actors such as Johnny Depp..anyone can take their place-happens all the time. HOWEVER, There's  a connection somewhere, that makes the studios and producers insist on keeping a female perp on the movie",Amanda Plants,8,2021-08-01T19:30:19Z

Without you Jon and the other amazing creators out there I really don‚Äôt think the tides would have turned in Johnny‚Äôs favor. I give you and the others and especially The Real Laura B so much gratitude for all the work you‚Äôve put in. It shows we can come together in a community and make positive changes.
