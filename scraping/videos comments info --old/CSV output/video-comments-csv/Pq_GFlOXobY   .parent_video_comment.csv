260,Ugzg_gRXuVukeyIYgb94AaABAg,"Aquaman is a really good film and shows what route DC should have taken to get to Justice League.

They tried to rush to the team-up film to establish themselves as a rival to Marvel. Never ever should've done that. Even the Snyder version of Justice League still isn't particularly good. It's better, but the characters are still underdeveloped (particularly Aquaman) 

Superman needed to stay dead a little longer as well. Put Aquaman and Shazam after BvS, then do Justice League followed by the WW sequel, Cyborg, and Flash films. (That was the route they should've taken)

The biggest wrench was Suicide Squad. They wanted a Guardians of the Galaxy rival and made that instead of making this or Shazam earlier.",Kori Jenkins,3,2021-03-19T11:19:38Z

And he seized the dragon, the original serpent, who is the devil and Satan and bound him for a thousand years.And he hurled him into the abyss."" So here the trench is the earth and those creatures are Satan and the demons, and he's throwing them into their abyss. Hollywood parallels Bible prophecies in these particular movies the immortals (Jesus and his co-rulers) battling it out with Satan and his bad angels the demons that sided with Satan. Then there is ""Star Wars"" (war in heaven) of course hollywood had to trump it up to drive sales of the movie, that paralleled another Bible prophecy in 1914 when worldwar1 started, that's when Jesus  began to rule in heaven Revelation 12:7-9 ""And war broke out in heaven. So down the great dragon was hurled, the original serpent, the one called Devil and Satan who is misleading the entire inhabited earth, he was hurled down to the earth and his angels were hurled down with him."" So the heavens were cleaned out of those trouble makers. And did anyone who watched this noticed they used a particular time span which hollywood refers to often a 1,000 yrs and that's how long Jesus rule will be a 1,000 yrs.Yes the most powerful elites of the world who also control hollywood know about Bible prophecies too and like to parallel them.",mycameo12,0,2021-02-16T13:36:51Z
