24,Ugi13bUVXym-tngCoAEC,I met Jennifer Coolidge once at a night club on High Street in Columbus OH in late 2009-Early 2010.. She had a stand up show at The Funny Bone at Easton Towne Center (Huge mall owned by Arnold Swarzenegger & Sylvester Stallone) and after the show she went clubbing. She was so friendly and down to earth. She took a picture with me on my BlackBerry but she didn't like the way it turned out so we ended up having to take 3 before we found one she said she was cool with me posting on Facebook. I've met several movie stars in my life but she was by far the coolest..,Zac Carpenter,14,2017-05-07T03:18:13Z

28,UgguQedgBk-16ngCoAEC,"I enjoyed this film... especially since it was free! I think I may have been swayed a bit by Heather Graham. In fact, I really like all the female actresses in this film. It was fun to see ""Stiffler's Mom"" in a movie besides just American Pie. It isn't a deep thought provoking movie, but it was entertaining and had some good moments. I definitely hated the IRS guy, as I was supposed to by design. Don't want to spoil it for anyone, but I like the way it ended as well. I was hoping it would go in that direction, but wasn't sure until it did. All in all, cute and clever... BUT... Ladies, do NOT try this at home. You will get busted.",NorCalCorsello,4,2014-10-25T00:33:36Z
