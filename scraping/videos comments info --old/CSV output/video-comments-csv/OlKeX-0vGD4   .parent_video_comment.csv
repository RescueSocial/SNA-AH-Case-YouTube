1,Ugw_x1xNOiJiLZUNJsJ4AaABAg,"It's not their fault someone picked up the Woke knife with malicious intent. I mean we all know what it is, but they should know better by now. 

It's clear what's going on, and a simple statement from them with neutral tone could clear things up for the public.",James Moriarty,0,2021-06-16T22:35:10Z
2,UgzQTKDBnWR-QeB5Usx4AaABAg,"By my understanding AH violated her chance at privacy in regards to the donations when she started telling everyone that would listen that she made the donations.  By asking for proof of that from ACLU is not breaking any privacy because AH broke that chance of anonymous protection.  Its ludicrous to think otherwise, or perhaps its fraud?",Wanderer,0,2021-06-12T16:31:24Z

8,Ugz_M_zRh-97l_pQ0uF4AaABAg,"Even though there are obviously some bad apples here I would like to think that the ACLU was a good non profit, they used to have a good name and helped a lot of children, but this has tarnished their name so badly I would be shocked at anyone choosing to donate to them now! That's not cool but it's true, I wager that all of this, with everything that has come out ( and even before these emails and what not came out because of their refusal to say weather or not AH had donated her divorce settlement was already making them look bad) has and is going to loose them millions in donations, I can't help but wonder who is really getting the short end of that stick! They should fire some people very publicly and distance themselves from AH at any cost!!",Nichole Shackelton,4,2021-06-08T18:57:23Z
9,UgwVrFFBatvmbwucLEd4AaABAg,"Jhonny Depp is trash. 
He needs rehab for his drinking and drug problems since he took 7 ecstasy pills then cause millions of damage when he destroyed the pirates set, he also cut his finger off while destroying the set and tried to blame it on Amber Heard. 
He‚Äôs a liar with multiple mental issues. 
Don‚Äôt come for me, Disney is the one who released these legal statements üëç",Gilby Rodriguez,1,2021-06-08T13:18:49Z
10,Ugxw4_44rTwBSu9QOZB4AaABAg,It's a pity that the judge in Virginia couldn't take them to task over this.  Their reluctance to co-operate and produce the required documentation only confirms their collusion with AH and therefore it can be taken as truth and confirmation that no payment was made by AH to anybody.  Their refusal to be compliant just amplifies their guilt and their part in the illegal or immoral activities.  Somebody has something to hide!!,Julie Goodall,3,2021-06-08T13:09:26Z
11,Ugy5-zJoRXnw_7t1d3R4AaABAg,"The case against JD was an embarrassment to humanity and the modern moral culture that we‚Äôre supposed to be fighting to build.  It‚Äôs been used as an example of the need for female empowerment in the face of male power, toxic masculinity, etc. ... but is a lie and a complete premeditated scam by a selfish brat with mental issues who cares so little about victims‚Äô rights and dignity that she‚Äôs willing to plagiarize the true story of an actual victim for her own financial gain.  Amber Heard MUST be held fully accountable for her false accusations and for deliberately misleading the public to support her scam.",David KÊùéË™†ÂΩ¨,0,2021-06-08T07:58:49Z
12,Ugzfiw8BphQAomcjloJ4AaABAg,The ACLU wrote the op ped.... they are hiding something more....definitely helped AH ...If they didn't do anything wrong and they are not hiding anything ....turn in all that is requested of you to the court.

14,UgyJbh5c1JZopkJpQft4AaABAg,"I have seen other comments saying this, if they have done nothing wrong why don't they want it in other court cases, as for the harassment until I see it I don't believe it, & if they did nothing so obviously wrong people would not be harassing them, basically they are saying yes we did all this stuff, tried to make you look bad but we don't like the harassment now we have been found out...yes we know JD got harassed substantially as well as his kids but now we are getting harassed, yeah shut the F up ACLU you reap what you sow don't give them an inch JD they obviously lost there way & given what I heard they support(as well as AH)do not give them mercy (my opinion)",PICK&MIX GAMER,6,2021-06-07T09:35:08Z
15,UgwQGQ8l-WU8Nn7Ns9Z4AaABAg,I think the issue is that AH is or was an official figure for them. Their demands for confidentiality is illegal. There is nothing to negotiate. They are a public entity. Not a private one.,Sirius Enigma,16,2021-06-07T07:51:38Z

21,UgyR0EVihaz__S9USLJ4AaABAg,"If ACLU have nothing to hide, and its all above board, they have no need for a confidentiality agreement.  The fact that the ACLU tried to get involved with the case 'as a friend of the court', negates their statements that because the donations by AH were not mentioned in the op-ed, they shouldn't have to provide any documentation about it.    If they can be soo corrupt in this case, makes you wonder how many other cases have they got involved with, and how many other lies they have told.",Kaytee,31,2021-06-07T00:53:23Z
22,UgycM6ROLsDItVJNQNJ4AaABAg,Mr Ben Wizner and Anthony Romero of ACLU who want to have an NDA on the information about Amber Turds donations have already exposed that she didn't give any by this exact response. lol. It makes me laugh how common sense is lacking here. Because if she did actual make a donation it would be happy news and no need to suppress this information. The fact that they need an NDA on it already confirms that this information will be harmful against Amber Turd. What a bunch of dumbf*cks.  Anyway Johnny Depp will have his justice!!! It's just a matter of time.,GreaterBayArea Hero,0,2021-06-07T00:44:45Z
23,UgypNmrGoc8NtVNBy394AaABAg,Now ACLU are trying to call the shotsüò°üò° The emails are out that shows the ALCU are responsible for the op-ed. How dare they try to destroy a person life and career? I hope they are sued,Carolyn Dee,0,2021-06-06T23:24:28Z

25,UgxqjOavnkT905SKJkB4AaABAg,Wow! The last part was silent. But the first part shows quite clearly that the ACLU was bargaining in bad faith with Johnny's legal team.,karen berg,26,2021-06-06T23:03:16Z
26,UgxnGWqMxpVHAahEO_Z4AaABAg,"I really don't understand why they even need the ACLU. This wasn't dropping change in a tin cup. Amber should have to prove she donated it. If she gave them millions, she would have proof. I send donations that are non deductible to multiple animal organizations. I have bank records, repeated letters of thanks that come in too.

29,UgyHC1VuvxbG0nNi5Z94AaABAg,ACLU had better respond to the subpoenas.
