0,UgyjY4E9Katy9EG8f8h4AaABAg,Loretta Thanks Jesus,"@CK Allen  It's so good to hear from you!  

I am genuinely happy that your girls are living their lives free to be who they were born to be.  Your update reminds of how God can make BEAUTY FROM ASHES.  He will give you HONOR, where there once was shame.   He will rebuild, raise up and repair whatever was taken from you.  Then He will bless you & your descendants in full view of everyone (all nations).  Isaiah 61 

Take good care of yourself always for you matter & you are Loved.",2020-11-24T03:24:14Z,0
1,UgyjY4E9Katy9EG8f8h4AaABAg,CK Allen,"@Loretta Thanks Jesus it took me a bit, to think and respond.  I‚Äôm safe.  As are all of girls.  

One is marine biology, U of Hawaii) & sending videos that send me into silent fits.  Wanting me to yell: Your birth certificate did NOT come with fine print that read ‚ÄúWill be in endless water with whales and chasing SHARKS!‚Äù

Another graduated college...backpacked Asia.  Taught English in Vietnam (to get home).  And has her calling, currently teaching English in Mexico...and will be coming home to attain a masters in education.  As soon as the virus allows her.

My youngest (only 17) fluctuates from military service to forensic science.  College is up on the air (with the virus).

For every hit I took...I poured it into my children...fighting hard for these girls to be free of MY abusive marriage.  I‚Äôm not always happy...with how strongly they are hitting the world, it takes my breath away.  But smile (anyway).  ‚ù§Ô∏è",2020-11-24T02:25:26Z,0
2,UgyjY4E9Katy9EG8f8h4AaABAg,CK Allen,"Loretta Thanks Jesus Amber Heard disrespects all women.  And our daughters & granddaughters.

Surviving abuse is hard.  Not allowing abuse is amazing.

We all have our superhuman powers.  I would hate to think MINE was: 6 months on crutches, two root canals, mending broken fingers, or hiding bruises!  What a waste. 

But thank you for your sentiment.  I remain as soft spoken as I ever was, and work with special needs kids and horses.  Am a little quieter and reserved (from strangers) then I was at seventeen...but enjoy my quiet, rural life ‚ù§Ô∏è",2020-09-19T04:40:49Z,1
3,UgyjY4E9Katy9EG8f8h4AaABAg,Loretta Thanks Jesus,I cried just imagining your pain & pray you are in a safe place now.  Amber Heard has no right to disrespect courageous women (like YOU) & the MeToo progress with her vengeful lies.,2020-09-14T09:50:42Z,1
