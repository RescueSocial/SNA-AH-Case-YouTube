19,Ugw-vWGLzqghiZSM2Qd4AaABAg,Something Else entirely,"That's kinda sad for Johnny in a sense, idk how or why he loves her but he stated he did many times even during all this chaotic situation. It would make sense that Johnny pressed forward and expose her especially if he had the evidence for it, shake up the metoo movement and the double standard view of abuse really well which is probably needed more than anyone wants to admit, but yo do so he has to continue exposing the woman he ""loves"" (love is a fickle bitch so I say that loosely cuz everyone can love differently) and if he continues to love her, he might be kinda stabbing himself in the heart knowing hes exposing her and it will lead to a lot of negative backlash for her, so the sad part for johnny would be it coming down to whether he did or still does ""love"" her and whether he can push the truth out knowing it can and will destroy her life if everyone (white knights, metoo, Hollywood, etc.) Cuts the double standard bs of women are abused but men never are abused mentality. For the sake of real abuse victims I hope he pushes the truth out, a fake victim only adds more scrutiny onto real victims, real victims man or woman could learn that johnny who was abused stepped forward even though he ""loved"" her, even though he didnt want to hurt her, it might encourage real victims to step up too. If all these movements continue to support amber even with evidence that she is in fact the abuser, then the victims will learn that men are expendable victims and ""real"" victims could make it harder to prove they are victims when people push the double standard on them ie. Johhny has evidence about his finger being cut off, metoo or anyone else didnt care, people can start using that against victims. Sorry for the long ass reply and endlessly adding onto my point, 

tl;dr johnny should come forward with the truth to show that real victims should be heard, even if any ""love"" for amber from him exists and might hurt him in thatsituation",2020-03-06T17:56:04Z,3

Yes, people say some horrific shit.  yes it is fine to fight back but to say that he is not a victim is disgusting. She has a HISTORY of domestic abuse to her other partners and went to jail in 2009 because of it. Johnny does not. He is not perfect he struggles with drugs and alcohol. People are not enabling him, they want him to be heard for his pain and suffering at the hands of this woman.

I had the emotional and mental abuse that came before the hitting. The jealousy and control over who I hung out with or where I worked.

32,Ugy9QbrvZZnI7gaE3VR4AaABAg,lisa richards,"doctordetroit84  , If that is the case, you know then that the APA discussed removing NPD out of the DSM-V, because of its traits in other cluster BPDs.
They were considering it. Keep reading this:
I believe Amber‚Äôs narcissism also swings to vulnerable narcissism, because of her constant need to claim victimhood fir attention‚Äî
She claimed victimhood, in writing op-Ed‚Äôs in 3 major newspapers; speaking at the women‚Äôs march as a ‚Äúvictim;‚Äù her conversations with Johnny, where whe  he doesn‚Äôt agree with her, she repeatedly says, ‚ÄúStop attacking me!‚Äù
She is the perennial victim.
Add this one also: Even if she has to put make-up on and fake a bruise, and call People magazine to do a photo shoot.
Like any narcissist, she needs constant attention, but her attention comes from victimhood.
She is a victim when Johnny leaves the room. She criticizes him for it, and she tells him he victimized her by doing that.
That is classic vulnerable narcissism.
I understand that perpetrators often pretend to be the ‚Äúvictim,‚Äù but she clings to that identity, yet she exhibits extreme narcissism at the same time.
If you are really a therapist or psychiatrist, you know that there are grandiose narcissist, that swing between grandiose narcissism, and vulnerable narcissism.
There is no way that is not accurate.",2020-03-06T06:03:12Z,0
