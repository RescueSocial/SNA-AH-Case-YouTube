The question is, does Heard listen to her lawyers or does she believe she knows best and is just ordering them around ? Is this why that first team quit the job ?",Noel Whinyates,0,2021-06-17T02:34:17Z

2,UgxWXOSCOgNf21VzfvB4AaABAg,"I think there is also the fact that lawyers can basically only advise some clients who will insist on them filing suites which are not wise to bring forth.  However in the case of her lawyers, I believe it is more of greed.

I look forward to hearing your response to AH'S teams rebuttal to JDs request to have the trial pushed back due to the Fantastic Beasts 3 shooting schedule and her denial of that request. Also, with her counterclaim of $100M against JD, can JD file another claim of slander against her for stating that JD is manipulating the internet with trolls and Russian bots to harass her and destroy her career? Can he counter to her counterclaim?

Fantastic analysis this case, as usual! Keep up the great work you're doing! I'm also happy to see you're a Harry Potter and Marvel fan (by looking at the pillows on your couch)!

22,UgzX3R2JIXjPZ5hdAZl4AaABAg,"I have said for years. There are attorneys and there are lawyers. The difference is, an attorney lives by the oath made when becoming a member of the bar. A lawyer, while starting out with the best of intentions, at some point, chose to let their ethical compass slip and can now bend, break, the rules, commit perjury, allow their client and/or their witnesses do the same. I became a paralegal to help families and to try and protect children. I‚Äôve seen both good and bad attorneys. I refused to work for any attorney who thought it was ok to bend the facts and create fairy tales in Court. It is so disappointing to see what has happened to the legal field. Mr. Waldman, in my opinion, is an attorney I would have been proud to work with. He represents what a true attorney should look and act like. No Judge is going to be happy to see 93 or however many pages her team filed with the Court. They are people just like us. They have some idea of what the basis of this case is. I only hope that they shut AH down. She and her team are wasting Court resources. There are so many legitimate trials that the Court could be addressing instead of playing Amber says. Mr. Waldman did an awesome job responding to her nonsense.",Laura Peterson,0,2020-09-05T19:00:30Z

Its been over 25 years since my days of school but I do remember thinking how much more interesting the lectures etc would have been if the teacher had more ease about herself.  You have that ease.  Thanks for sharing your insight, I do not have time to be reading and searching the internet to find out information on cases I am interested in so, you make it so much easier by keeping me up to date.   If I didn't spend my teen years wanting to spend my life with Johnny Depp (Rick Springfield was my second choice üòê) I probably wouldn't take too much interested in this case until the end... So, thank you, greatly appreciated‚ù£‚ù£",Sandra,7,2020-09-03T20:16:44Z

I expect to see a lot of (forgive me) sh!t thrown out in the hope that something will stick to JD or Adam Waldman. If AH isn‚Äôt reined in by her legal team I believe her ego will get the better of her and she will make public comments that damage her more than she already has.
