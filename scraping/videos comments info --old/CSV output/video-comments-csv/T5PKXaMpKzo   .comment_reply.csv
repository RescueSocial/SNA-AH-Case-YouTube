And my strong belief in her has nothing to do with feminism but the evidence and how Depp and Heard interacted with one another. He's a paranoid drunk and sniff sniff Cocaine addict.

This specific incident they talk about in that phone call was talked about with greater detail by Heard, and corroborated by witnesses:
Johnny Depp attempted to push Heard's sister down a flight of stairs, and she hit him in self-defense to prevent this. (Verified, look into it).
She then never attacked him on any other occasion.",2020-03-25T20:15:38Z,0

I think its also worth mentioning that this conversation is from 2015....he was dragged through the mud, but didn't use this (or something comparable) against her. To me, thats just more proof of who the victim is. Abuse victims are often very hesitant to speak against the abuser.

41,UgyI2TNsH76cj0rKdPt4AaABAg,Alex Sattar,"Jorgi Harwood not saying you‚Äôre the type of feminist who‚Äôs sexist or anything (the feminazi type), but Majid does have a point. 

The feminazis that you claim are far and few in between are the ones with influence over (or are journalists of) mainstream media, at least in the UK. The Guardian, The Times, The Telegraph, The Sun (this one is the one Depp is suing because they called him a ‚Äúwife-beater‚Äù), the frickin BBC, and the Independent have all recently released articles siding with Amber Heard and/or victim blaming Johnny Depp saying he should just keep his mouth shut and move on.

I‚Äôve seen many real feminists like you all supporting Johnny Depp and calling for true justice against Amber, which is good, and as a man myself I‚Äôm grateful for people like you. But, when feminazis are given so much power that they are granted the ability to write for, and publish articles for MAINSTREAM media (not some fringe, alt-right or Ctrl-left media group), I‚Äôd have to strongly disagree that the feminazis are far and few in between.

Remember that these articles spewing misandrist rhetoric have to be okayed by an editor before publishing. They haven‚Äôt been snuck under the radar. They‚Äôre being fucking sponsored by the mainstream media.

None of this swearing is directed at you. It‚Äôs at the frustration of the blatant sexists that are sponsored in mainstream media.",2020-07-31T15:18:38Z,0

He can cry. It also means treating woman with respect and holding them accountable when they do something wrong. Stopping the victim complex and saying ""she's a woman, she's capable of harm and she should be held accountable. Sorry, but your just not right. Every single feminist I know sharing the we stand with Johnny #. I saw feminists arguing over how long she should have in prison.

But this isn't the apocalyptic outbreak like media outlets are posting up that's only serving as clickbait for views. 

But it's absolutely important that everyone remains calm. Practice health care by cleaning yourself up and your home. Wash your hands frequently whenever you get back home after being out in the general public. Refrain from touching your face/mouth/eyes/nose while outside as surfaces in the public won't be quite sanitized. And remain at home if you feel sick to limit the spread of infection, if however you are developing other health complications that includes difficulty breathing to the point you feel like choking, contact your primary care provider to set up an immediate appointment do they can properly get you checked in without risk of it spreading. Don't simply ignore if the illness feels worse or doesn't subside within days because that's how these viruses turn potentially dangerous.",2020-02-06T08:04:22Z,0

He says he always leaves because he doesn't want to get so angry that he would hit her (not that he did hit her), which sounds like the mature thing to do especially when she is throwing pots and pans, vases, cans and gets physical with him. From the tapes, neither him or Amber claims that Johnny is the one who gets violent. She's complaining about him always leaving, which makes sense because she repeatedly gets violent with him. Plus, she threw a vodka bottle at him that cut off the tip of his finger, punched him in the face repeatedly and pooped in his bed. This doesn't sound like a case of mutual abuse.

But here, he clearly holds back when it's about her.

Phil used to be unbiased but his double standard is becoming more and more apparent.

I would say this started with the Maga hat kid story where he immediately trashed the kids and praised the native man even though there was no evidence that the kid was the abuser.

He just saw maga Hat and a Native and immediately came to the conclusion that the maga hat kid was the abuser and the native was the victim. And trashed the kid with any name under the sun.

Of course he retracted this when the truth came out. 

But it shows that when things align to his leftist mindset, he takes his fur gloves off and goes all guns blazing. But when it's not, he will still try to give the facts, sure, but his opinion is much more reserved and toned down.

If roles were reversed. He would have trashed talked Johnny big time. (And he did before this audio came out. He trashed Johnny a lot)

But if the abuser is a woman. He moderates himself.

It's good that he at least covers the story unlike mainstream media.

414,UgznQwft5VZM7qJroZF4AaABAg,Phoebe,"Frank Rauen, it was a male feminist who coined the term ‚Äútoxic masculinity‚Äù. He was referring to how society restricts men and puts them down for expressing emotions other than anger (if you cry you need to ‚Äúman up‚Äù. Bottle it all up or punch a wall if you must). This is how he felt and what he observed. Ultimately, if a man becomes too invested in toxic expressions of masculinity he can become a threat to himself and others. So, we have significantly higher rates suicide and violent crime among men.

This isn‚Äôt to to say that toxic masculinity is the only reason people are violent, people can be violent for all sorts of reasons and women can be violent as well but there are higher rates of violence among men. So, maybe there‚Äôs a problem with the way we socialise boys and what we pressure men to be rather than there being something intrinsically more violent about men. The concept of toxic masculinity forces us to address our culture and how we all may be contributing to the formation of violent men rather than just blaming testosterone, which really is dehumanising and paints men as biologically toxic.

Toxic masculinity is a societal problem, which means that everyone can contribute to it, women included. If a woman ever tells you to man up, she‚Äôs very much part of the problem.",2020-02-06T17:06:26Z,2

""If you're saying people infected with Ebola don't recover because there's no cure, that doesn't make sense.""


As i said, after certain point. Like if bleeding has started, chances are almost zero. And yes, there is no cure right now for ebola. Symptoms are being treated and alleviated to give time to immune system to fight off the disease. But ebola was a bad example, my bad.


""And yes the mortality rates of HIV/AIDS are extremely high because drugs may extend your life but you're still going to die from it unless it's cured, correct?""

No, not really.
If HIV-positive person undergoes ART and takes medication daily, then virus load can be decreased to levels where it is not being transmitted or detected and he/she basically can live normal life, but treatment has side effects and it is probably no readily available everywhere.

For death rate of aids. It is around 2% in 2018, according to who

Those numbers are estimations probably, so it is might be higher and as you know you don't really die from aids, so misreporting is also quite possible among other things.

Beside that, this statistic tells us that measure such as ART work at keeping virus levels down and keep more people from dying. But none of those people are truly cured, so i guess using your method I should take 770000 number and number of babies who were cured by 2018 (which is like, 3-4? i really don't know stats for that) and would come to conclusion that mortality rate is astronomical. Right? I really wish to see the formula or where your getting this from.

620,Ugzp_N-o4MhOo1vWnW54AaABAg,Stephanie L,"@Cheshire how do you *not* understand what I'm saying? Infected people haven't died *OR* recovered so you don't know the true mortality rate until that happens.

If you're saying people infected with Ebola don't recover because there's no cure, that doesn't make sense. If they *had* Ebola and survived then they *did* recover.

Same with the death rate from anything - if you don't have the data then you can't determine the true numbers. 

And yes the mortality rates of HIV/AIDS are extremely high because drugs may extend your life but you're still going to die from it unless it's cured, correct?

I have a degree in management information systems & I also have a certificate in pharmacy tech and pharmaceutical compounding so please do not speak to me as if I'm uneducated or ignorant.

Because currently its sounds non-logical to me. According to ur method something like ebola has close to 100% mortality rate, because after certain point there is no proven treatment to recover from virus. While in reality mortality rate is 50%.

If we take something like HIV - mortality rate is 99.99% according to you method, because there is like what, 5 people who completely recovered from HIV.",2020-02-05T01:09:15Z,0

Elevating her to a status that seems she didn't deserve and was harmful to real victims of abuse and I hope this brings light to to the issue of violence against men, as it happens but is not talked about and rather in those cases the male victim is ridiculed and laughed about. He's a man, he can't be seriously hurt by a woman, right? He is just being dramatic, a baby, right?  If we care about equality why don't we properly care about true equality?

Essentially, by making the system a two-party lane, it filters out all standouts and upcoming threats, by ensuring the people responsible for each winning candidate have the say on who wins next. I mean- if we had a truly diverse and branching political party system, the candidates with the best ideas might actually win, rather than the ones with the most airtime. Fixing our corrupt system would have to be applied all across the board: our parties, our processes, our laws, our financial system, and our media.

Over a decade ago I was in an abusive relationship where my ex at the time use to slap me for the most trivial of things, I told her to stop being physical, and at first she's say ok but then would forget about it the next day. She was also exploiting me financially and would get physical with me if I didn't support her excessive shopping.

You really REALLY have not been in an abusive relationship. If you think a slap is not a big deal, here's a reality check IT IS. I still remember the days where my cheeks were bright red. AND even after I did break up with her, she started stalking and harassing, myself my friends and my family for months. 

She thought she had that power over me, because I let her have that power over me with her physical abuse. I made the mistake to not break it off the first time it happened and it evolved into one of the most traumatic experiences in my life. So get your head out of your ass, and wake up to goddamn reality; A Slap is abusive. If you can't accept that. I think you need to take a good hard look at yourself.",2020-02-04T02:47:26Z,0

You recognized how inherent sexism affects women of lower economic classes, and you're right, so I really did not mean to make that point.

1053,UgyZ0rEFhnJgz9hNDO54AaABAg,J DeLuca,"@Eagle 367 You're more than welcome to do your own research. I base mine on what I've found. I've presented my information, and my conclusion is that unions are outdated. They've served their purpose, now they are just fat with the gluttony they ironically oppose. 

Amazon actually pays pretty well compared to other jobs. And if you don't like it, quit. It really is that simple in a free market. Corporations should not bend to government or union regulations. Those tend to slow progress and cut profits in the USA atleast. Try researching opposing opinions to what you believe. Sitting in an echo chamber does you no good. 

But again, try asking your steward about unions being competitive. Or ask any union worker how unions are competitive. Why did my plant lose 16,800 union jobs in 15 years? Answer: Union greed. They wanted more, but got less in return. And that's not anecdotal, it's factual. If the work can be outsourced cheaper, it will be. Where's the protection there? ""Sorry, but were laying off roughly 17,000 workers"". 

The union paradox: If unions are so great, why doesn't every company have one? If unions help balance the budget and ensure fair workplace practices, surely every company would be on board, right? Unions don't offer much in return for profits: no time studies on jobs and no ensurement of production. No cracking down on bad employees. In fact, the union will fight tooth and nail for shitty employees. It's already difficult to actually get fired from a real job nowadays (making your claim definition *anecdotal*), add a union on top of that and bad behaviour is glorified instead of reprimanded. These are the hard facts that happen everyday within unions. My guess is you are not in one, so it's hard to take anything you say seriously.",2020-02-04T07:16:30Z,0

However I think the hate against the phrase has to do with a misunderstanding, it's not masculinity that is toxic, its toxic traits ingrained into masculinity at the societal level. And yes there is ""toxic femininity"" if you want to use the same phrasing. There can even be like toxic whiteness or toxic blackness, such as white people tend to be seen as more xenophobic or black people are seen as being more homophobic. Its toxic aspects of a culture, and adds like galettes are not meant to demonize men but to address toxic aspects of what society sees as masculinity. Yes there is toxic femininity too, for example women putting other women down for not meeting social standards for women, straight women often feeling owed sex whenever they want by their male partners because men are supposedly always wanting sex, etc. Many of which most people would say ""that's internalized misogyny"" and they would be right, but that's also what toxic masculinity is, its toxic traits that many men internalize because society attributes them to men, such as many men say homophobic things at even the slightest possible idea that they might be gay, or even refusing to hug friends cuz ""that's gay"". That's not something that's actually inherent to being a man, but it's a toxic trait that is internalized by many men as a part of their masculinity",2020-02-04T01:33:34Z,1

Its creates a narrative that people and the culture consciously and subconsciously believe. Believe by definition means to accept as true. when you say Believe women the subliminal assertion is that what shes saying is true. You talk about putting in the work and understanding the nuance, well this isnt my first rodeo.

No argument- she sounds like a total nutjob.

She sounds to me like a temperamental asshole. I definitely would not get a beer with her. But does that mean she should lose the right to work as an actress....? I say, at the moment, emphatically no.

Especially considering that tape was apparently made in 2015. People can mature and evolve. (are you willing to *assume* she hasn't...? Suppose she has...Who makes THAT call...?).

I don't believe any healthy culture holds its artists to stringent ""moral"" standards- history shows it's a slippery slope- and black-listing Heard WOULD be a moral punishment by the culture.

I was simply pointing out that calling for someone's without knowing all the facts is what caused Depp to lose his job and reputation in the first place. And now everyone suddenly wants justice for him and her head on a stick. It's a cycle. And continuing it will do more harm than good.

My point wasn't about her, but about the cancel- and outrageculture (using Depp and Heard as examples). People are now doing to her what was done to him. It doesn't solve or fix anything.

Heard abused her previous ex before Depp. Listening to the whole hour of audio tells you absolutely everything you need. That anyone is saying 'we'll never know the whole story' now is complete bull. No one was saying that when Heard made her claims.


 Never once in the tape did Heard accuse him of being physical at any capacity, he admits to pushing her once to stop her. She only accuses him of leaving the room during every argument. She is the one constantly being physical and 'losing it', and emotionally abusive too if you pay attention. She throws a xanax his way when the argument isn't going her favor, when he clearly doesn't need one. That's psychological manipulation and abuse of medication on a frightening level. Even Heard's parents sided with Johnny, were afraid of their daughter, and were sympathetic towards him in the leaked text messages from 3 years ago. There is no question who's the villain here. Not to mention all the logistics of Heard's claims not adding up at all if you do the research. The evidence is astoundingly clear.
