12,UgwmY8MCz0DFsu8vOvJ4AaABAg,SketchFlygirl,"@TIm Smith There are arguments and fights. I have and seen both due to have friends with ""difficult"" backgrounds. ""Difficult"" backgrounds doesn't make a person. He still doesn't show any history of hitting any individual. Amber Heard does. 

And people with self-hate do not act like he does. I know many who do.",2020-07-22T02:32:00Z,3
13,UgwmY8MCz0DFsu8vOvJ4AaABAg,TIm Smith,"SketchFlygirl Johnny has history of violence towards his partners often hidden from the public 
He had many heated arguments with his girlfriend Kate Moss and one occasion his behaviour was so violent that the police were called, he was arrested, charged and fined $9,000+, September 1994. 
Similar happened in Australia, he violently assaulted Amber, smashed the hotel causing damage in excess of $50,000, he was lucky no one called the police, he got away.
Seems he‚Äôs suffering from an inferiority complex and self-hate, it would explain his odd behaviour of self harm. He‚Äôs actually from a very difficult and humble background, probably finds difficult to adjust and socialise with other celebs, turning to alcohol and drugs is his way of coping.",2020-07-21T23:04:35Z,2
