I took out a restraining order &amp; never spoke to my abuser again. Let alone meet the man I\u2019m afraid of. He continues to stalk me but that\u2019s a long story. Before then I would go back &amp; forth to him for 2yrs but I was still in that fog of \u201cis it really happening\u201d sure id called the police a number of times in highly abusive moments but always dropped supporting a prosecution as I was still not at a point of clarity, I was still living with my manipulator/abuser but by the time I left him &amp; took out a restraining order, I was very very sure as to what had happened, he was an abuser &amp;  it/he won\u2019t change. You have reached a certain amount of clarity, reality has broken through for you to reach the step in which you take an order out, you are no longer living in the abuse, in the daily manipulation. So why would Amber then meet Depp? Also it wasn\u2019t like Depp was coercing and harassing Amber into meeting in San Fran. I could understand the meet more if any of that was present but as far as I\u2019m aware, Amber took those steps to meet him? It is impossible to fully psychologically recover from abuse so it\u2019s surprising to me you\u2019d go public with all the allegations shortly after the relationship ended, it\u2019s hard to process, to take the step to even talking to a singular person about an abusive relationship. It took me a very long time, I\u2019ve been a recluse 5yrs no social media etc &amp; I was once v sociable. I still don\u2019t talk to anyone I know/knew. After 5yrs of not being with my abuser. I still can\u2019t come out with it openly as myself. I\u2019m an anxious ghost of the person I once was. So for a victim to come out so boldly knowing the whole world will be watching is quite alien to me. Yes, we are all different. But I could not imagine the fear a victim would have taking on a worldly celebrity with these allegations, her deposition did not seem authentic it felt acted. Ive been through the stuff that Amber is claiming &amp; when asked questions, my answers all come splurging out in a jumbled mess of articulated emotion with physical symptoms of stress being uncontrollable. I hate to say this, but in my opinion &amp; I\u2019m not claiming my opinion to be factual but I can\u2019t believe Amber Heard, her deposition seemed so calm, calculated. The way she was eating to give herself time to think of answers to questions was odd. Something felt very off. I believe Johnny is the victim of domestic abuse here. That video that surfaced of him, yes he was slamming doors &amp; yes abusers do that but normal people also do that in times of extreme stress &amp; frustration. If I was settled with 7million. I would get some therapy move away &amp; move on. Its us women down here without the financial resources &amp; power are the ones that need change towards domestic abuse &amp; I\u2019m not diminishing the fact that famous women do go through these horrible abusive relationships but they have a lot of options open to them to further their healing &amp; that\u2019s what it should be about, healing. Defecating in his bed? I mean gender reverse that, if a man defecated in a woman\u2019s bed it would most likely be brandished a form of abuse to add to the pattern of abuse. Sh*<b>***</b> in somebodies bed to me can not be considered a \u201charmless prank\u201d Victims do anything to avoid escalating abuse. Everything &amp; anything you do will be used against you. Abusers do nasty things &amp; love to brandish it a joke. So she allegedly suffered all of this abuse, yet had the fearless gumption to take a dump in her abusers bed? Also separately, the Marilyn Manson situation. I can not comment at all. I\u2019ve been a die hard fan since I was a child, it\u2019d be totally biased. But just to add my abuser did not have any prior relationships that were abuse free. So it\u2019s a conundrum that Marilyn &amp; Ditas 7yr relationship included no abuse. Can abusers change according to who they are with, I don\u2019t know but most commonly not. Apologies for the long essay.\u270c\ufe0f&amp;\ud83d\udc95",
