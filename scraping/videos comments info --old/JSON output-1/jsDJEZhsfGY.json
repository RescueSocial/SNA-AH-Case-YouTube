No.  A victim doesn&#39;t roll her eyes when she just got slammed against a wall, pinned by her neck and told she is going to be killed.  If her version were true, then she would be a frightened victim who had been subjected to violence, a &quot;hostage&quot; situation, and rape for 3 years.

That whole story is garbage.<br><br>Her claim is one minute she&#39;s in the bathroom with Johnny taunting her, next second she&#39;s asking Jack to go somewhere.  Where was Jack?  He was in the kitchen.  So she&#39;s in the bathroom asking Jack who is in the kitchen to go somewhere to get him out of the way.

(They also discuss this in the tapes, and Amber never mentions the rest of the story she tells here or claims she was defending herself.) Again, this doesn&#39;t line up with the story.  The story is that Johnny dumped wine in her lap, she went to change, he slammed her against the wall and pinner her by the neck, she rolled her eyes at him and he taunted her.  So didn&#39;t she just have a scuffle a few minutes ago, not weeks ago.  Her stories don&#39;t make sense.  They aren&#39;t cohesive.
