Yeah he had the beginnings of COPD, but smoking didn&#39;t kill him. And so what if you blew loads of money on wine, if I was rich, I would probably be the same. So Johnny don&#39;t listen to the shit people have said about you. I was a victim of serious domestic abuse, and I think I can spot a violent man in 10 minutes. It needs no qualifications to be in the fault finding game, and nobody can make you sad, upset or depressed without your permission. So, Johnny, fuck &#39;em all. Life changes everything is temporary, happiness, sadness, success, it all ends. You had also just lost your mum and I don&#39;t think you got the time to grieve when everything went wrong. But the Hollywood Vampires are great, I love your cover of Heroes. So basically surround yourself with good people, people who really care. I would love Alice Cooper on my side, even though he used to scare the shit out of me when I was a kid! But he&#39;s a good guy. So take care Johnny, Betty Sue is looking out for you too. X",
