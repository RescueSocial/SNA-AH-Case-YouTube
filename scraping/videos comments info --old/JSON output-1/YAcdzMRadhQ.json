Neither the women nor most of the people blamed for simply accepting their testimony will have any understanding whatsoever of the history of postmodern philosophy. The misconceptions are understandable but unfortunately derive from populist stereotypes and caricatures of postmodernism by those who for whatever reason oversimplify and distort the very subtle, nuanced and highly sophisticated views of language, truth, power, identity and gender usually involved. The culture wars spoken about are linked to postmodern philosophy only to the extent that they arise within postmodernity, which is something different. Moreover, the particular concern for victims, oppression and injustice has in some postmodern contexts increased but the form these take in the video seem like a stereotype of a certain trajectories of feminist and post-colonial thinking. Ideology is not the name for a view that is wrong for being such, it&#39;s everywhere, whatever your view. And while some philosophies that are postmodern are concerned with these things, the mixing of the ideas of different thinkers and the claim that postmodernists believe education and listening are the solution to problems sounds way too modernist.",
