But Amber Heard fired from Aquaman 2?\nWe know that both are the DC royalties with such powerful and fierce roles but despite this they haven\u2019t shared the screen yet.\nAccording to Dnaniel Richtman, Gal Gadot is eager to work with Amber Heard in the DCEU. If the Wonder woman is eager to work with Heard and this leaked news is true then we will get to see some great some stuff where both these badass princesses will kick some ass. \nWe can also maybe see rivalry as both Altanteans and Amzoneans share a long history of conflict in dceu comics. \nAs Aquaman 2 is in pre-production so we might not see them sharing a scene this soon, but we might see a scene between them in future DC movies slash series.\nIt was also rumored that Emilia Clark will replace Amber Heard\u2019s role as Princess Mera. And the great Khal\u2019s great khaleesi is getting more support for this role to see the great chemistry again. Depp\u2019s fans signed a petition to Warner Bros with over a million signs. Yes!!
