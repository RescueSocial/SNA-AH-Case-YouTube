And I don't know what happened [in his private life], and I don't know if it was fair, him losing the job, but I just knew that the show was going on, and I would've loved to have talked to him about it if I had the chance, but I just don't know him in that sense.\n\nMikkelsen is set to bring to life the dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald in the as-yet-unnamed third installment of the Harry Potter spin-off franchise. As far stepping into a new role that was already established prior by a different actor, Mikkelsen plans to make it his own.\n\n\n#JusticeforJohnny\n#AmberHeard\n#JohnnyDeppNews",
