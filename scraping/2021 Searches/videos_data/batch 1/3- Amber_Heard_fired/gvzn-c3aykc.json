This has also put Mads Mikkelsen atop the list of actors being considered to replace Johnny Depp in the David Yates-directed Fantastic Beast 3, the third installment of the Harry Potter spinoff based on the JK Rowling fantasy franchise. And now nearly 1 million moviegoers have signed a petition for Heard to be fired from her role in the Aquaman franchise.\n\nO N  T H E  P A N E L:\n\u25b6 Chris Fagan @chrisfagan1980\n\u25b6 Amy Newman @amy_n_newman & @amy.n.newman\n\nC O M M U N I T Y   C O N T A C T:\nSubmit a trending topic for us to talk about here: \nhttps://www.t3medias.com/contact \n\nB L O G   &   P O D C A S T\n\u25b6 T3MEDIAS Website: http://bit.ly/2ICYWyH\n\u25b6 iTunes: https://apple.co/3ccE1is\n\u25b6 Soundcloud: https://bit.ly/35HeT1P\n\nW A T C H   C O N T E N T:\nT3Medias Episodes Every Wednesday around 11AM CST\nWe Got Your Mail Every Saturday around 11AM CST\nWHY IS THAT TRENDING? | REACTIONS | REVIEWS | THE BINGE\n\nS U P P O R T   T H I S.
