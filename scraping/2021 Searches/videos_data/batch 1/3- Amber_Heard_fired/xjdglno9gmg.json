            "description": "Johnny Depp FIRED! Will Backlash Hurt Amber Heard's Aquaman 2 Role?\n\nWB fired Johnny Depp from Fantastic Beasts Friday, which created a groundswell of support for him from sympathetic fans online.\n\nThis is probably going to cause legions of people to dislike Amber Heard even more now, and with additional legal drama coming, this is going to remain ugly for a long time, with both Johnny's AND Amber's reputations getting dragged through the mud.\n\nDoes that mean WB may eventually be forced to reduce Heard's role in Aquaman 2 as Mera? Or even in the Snyder Cut?\n\nI discuss in this video, so check it out.\n\nPlease subscribe to the channel and leave a comment below!\r\n\r\nFOLLOW ME ON TWITTER: https://twitter.com/HiltonCollins\r\nFOLLOW ME ON INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/hiltoncollins/\n\n#johnnydepp #amberheard #justiceforjohnnydepp",
