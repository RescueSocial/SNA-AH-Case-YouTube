The studio seems resistant to cancel culture and often sticks by its talent when drama arises. \n\nAfter all, they didn't fire Ezra Miller or Johnny Depp, and they haven't fired Joss Whedon or Geoff Johns from other studio projects either, at least not as of now.\n\nI discuss in this video, so check it out. \n\nPlease subscribe to the channel and leave a comment below!\r\n\r\nFOLLOW ME ON TWITTER: https://twitter.com/HiltonCollins\r\nFOLLOW ME ON INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/hiltoncollins/\n\n#amberheard #aquaman2 #aquaman",
