But still, the fans were absolutelly upset and mad as they can't imagine their\nfavorite movie without Johnny. Moreover, many people believe that it was just unfair to fire\nhim as Johnny Depp has had a long working relationship with Disney. The main reason\nwhich made kids\u2019 favorite channel cut ties with Johnny was his recent court cases in both the\nU.K. and the U.S.. The problems between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard made a lot of\nmess and as a result, Amber\u2019s allegations of domestic violence and ongoing legal troubles\nreportedly cost Johnny Depp his Oscar-nominated, starring role in the multibillion-dollar\ngrossing Pirates of the Caribbean franchise.\nIt\u2019s been already said a lot about how difficult Johnny Depp and Amber Heard\u2019s break up is\nas the nightmare for these two began in 2016. Since that year they've been legally fighting\nagainst each other, accusing each other in inappropriate behavior, violence,\nlibel and many other things. Moreover, 2020 wasn't really easy for Johnny Depp. It was full\nof libel trials against News Group Newspapers, the publisher of The Sun, in court over a\n2018 article in which they called him a \"wife beater\". During the trial Depp denied he's being\nviolent to Amber and also accused Heard of having extra-marital affairs with James Franco\nand Elon Musk, which Heard also denies. However, no matter how Depp tried, the court\nruled against Depp in the libel trial.\nDue to recently highlighted personal issues and allegations made against the famed actor,\nDepp has been dumped by many major film studios. It all began with the fact Depp\nannounced that he had been 'asked to resign' from his role as Grindewald in 'Fantastic\nBeasts 3'. He posted on his Instagram: \"I wish to let you know that I have been asked to\nresign by Warner Bros. from my role as Grindelwald in 'Fantastic Beasts' and I have\nrespected and agreed to that request.\" He continued, \"... I intend to prove that the\nallegations against me are false,\" Depp added. \"My life and career will not be defined by this\nmoment in time.\"\nAnd then Walt Disney Pictures who said \u2018goodbye\u2019 to Johnny Depp. According to a\nWashington Post report, Disney is said to have dropped Depp from the Pirates franchise just\nfour days after Heard\u2019s incendiary 2018 op-ed in the same publication, in which she claimed,\nwithout naming Depp, that she was the victim of domestic violence. Depp\u2019s lawyers claimed\nthat the actor\u2019s removal from the multibillion-dollar grossing franchise was because of her\nallegations.\nIn 2018, Disney production chief Sean Bailey confirmed that Depp was no longer a part of\nthe franchise\u2019s future plans. He told The Hollywood Reporter, \u201cWe want to bring in a new\nenergy and vitality. I love the Pirates movies, but part of the reason writers Paul Wernick and\nRhett Reese are so interesting is that we want to give it a kick in the pants. And that\u2019s what\nI\u2019ve tasked them with.\u201d\nMoreover, some people think it was not the only reason for Disney to \u2018break up\u2019 Johnny\nDepp. Another reason for his removal could be the fact that Disney couldn\u2019t afford him\nanymore. According to Forbes, Depp\u2019s salary, including a healthy profit percentage, reaches\nclose to $100 million per Pirates film. Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales, the\n\nseries\u2019 fifth film, registered a box office haul of almost $800 million, well below the over $1\nbillion totals of the franchise\u2019s second and fourth films, and the $963 million haul of the third\none. Disney is looking to save $90 million by recasting Depp, the report said.\n...\nNow I want to know your opinion.
