            "description": "#JohnnyDepp #AmberHeard #metoo #timesup\n\nHey everyone!  I'm currently working hard, learning new software for better visuals (preview at end of video), and continuing to break down info and evidence as much as I can.  But for now, I'm taking a quick break from working on my next series of videos to bring you a much needed update in the Johnny Depp vs Amber Heard case.\n\nIn this video I'll update you on several important motions and hearings over the past several months.  I'll also show evidence and witness testimony, some of which you likely have not seen yet.  Including Amber's dad threatening to kill Johnny over money, and texts between Amber's parents and Johnny in which they attempt to explain to him why Amber made up the story about abuse.  I'll put time stamps below in case you want to skip to those parts.\n\nThanks for watching!\n\nLink to all submitted documents -\nhttps://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/circuit/high-profile-cases\n\nNEW EVIDENCE TIME STAMPS -\n\n6:38 - David Killackey Testimony - (Amber's father threatens to kill Johnny Depp over money)\n\n11:02 - Amber's parents texts to Johnny Depp, after Amber publicly accused him of abuse.\n\nAnatomy of a Lie! - Video -\nhttps://youtu.be/6q9xjN3S8ww\n\nTwitter: @ThatBrianFella",
