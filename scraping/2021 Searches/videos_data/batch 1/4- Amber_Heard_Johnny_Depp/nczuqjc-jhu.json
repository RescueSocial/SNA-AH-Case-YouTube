KEEP IN MIND IT DOESN'T INCLUDE ALL THE EVIDENCE JOHNNY DEPP HAS. There's just too much for one video.\n\nPlease, I highly suggest you check out Brian's channel (IncrediblyAverage) and take some time to watch all of his videos, some being used in my video. You'll know everything. \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffc https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCg0C-N_MPYYOXyF4T3jMxNQ\n\nMy Twitter & Instagram \ud83d\udc47\nhttps://twitter.com/winonasrider\nhttps://www.instagram.com/jadoredepp/\n\n#JusticeForJohnnyDepp  #amberheard #metoo \n\nThank you for watching, any support will be deeply appreciated.
