            "description": "Surprise surprise! Amber Heard just announced in her recent personal instagram post that she is now a mother! Well, it is inexplicably hard to believe, especially for a woman who has been the subject of many rumors and negative spotlight lately. Now she just announced that she is a mother? Just when you thought this Johnny and Amber situation cannot get any crazier, Amber gives you a pretty hard to beat plot twist! But who is the father of Amber Heard\u2019s baby? How did she get away with having this child without the paparazzi finding out? Did this affect her Aquaman training? And most importantly, how on earth did this happen? A lot of rumors and sources are saying that Elon Musk might be the father of this baby. Well, the timeline between the mega businessman and the Aquaman star is a little messy, especially because this happened in the midst of the Johnny Depp and Amber Heard divorce process, but who knows if they might have rekindled their romance during this time period? Amber Heard had dated a series of men (and a woman) in these years after her split with Johnny Depp, but during all this time, no one really knows who the father of her newborn is. So is Elon Musk really the father of her daughter? Let\u2019s find out in this video! But before everything else, make sure first to hit that subscribe button and notification bell for more updates. Now, let\u2019s dive in!\n\nFirst, let\u2019s have a little recap. Amber and Johnny met in 2011, when they filmed their movie together, The Rum Diary. The former couple got married in a private ceremony, and lived their romantic marriage for over a year before everything came crashing down. In 2016, Amber decided to split with Johnny and made him out to be all sorts of bad things. This shocked a lot of people, especially fans at that time, and people were not easy to side with Johnny. This is a case that people are really sensitive about, especially with all the details involved. However, when some evidence surfaced that proved Amber wasn\u2019t telling the truth, fans easily lost their sympathy for Amber Heard and sided with Johnny instead. This evidence included Amber having affairs with actor James Franco and multi-billionaire Elon Musk. The evidence also showed Amber admitting that she was really the one who hurt Johnny Depp, and that she never really donated her divorce settlement money to charity. But the real chaos started when first, news publisher The Sun called Johnny Depp a very bad name that affected him deeply. Johnny Depp was not just offended by this, he was furious, and so he filed a case against the news company. However, unfortunately for his team, he lost this suit in court. But this messy predicament did not end at that. After he lost this libel case, he was relieved of his recurring role as Grindelwald in the blockbuster film trilogy Fantastic Beasts. In its third installment, Johnny was banned from reprising his role. This upset many fans, of course, but other than that, the issue was ignited even more when Amber got an op ed article written in The Washington Post in 2018 explaining thoroughly her situation.\n\nThe recent filming of Aquaman 2 has stirred new negative comments against Amber Heard, and she even trended on twitter, and not in a good way. Many fans still want her out of the DC Extended Universe new film, as her former husband Johnny Depp was out from Fantastic Beasts 3 and even from Disney\u2019s Pirates of the Carribean series, the films where basically Jack Sparrow is the lead. And now, Amber Heard has been brought into the spotlight once again.\n\nAmber Heard dated a few men and a woman after her divorce with Johnny Depp. In 2016, she went public with multi billionaire and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, whom she dated for a year. Then after their official split in 2018, the actress moved on with art dealer Vito Schnabel and \u201cIt\u201d director Andy Muschietti. Many fans speculate that Amber and Bianca, if they are still together and are just keeping their lives out of the limelight, may have decided to have a surrogate baby so they can live as one happy family. But there are stronger beliefs that Elon Musk is actually the father of her baby. \n\nNevertheless, despite Amber\u2019s new announcement, people just hope that the judges won\u2019t bite on this bait she apparently made to lighten her trial. Johnny Depp had gone through a lot because of this roller coaster marriage and he deserved justice. As for Amber\u2019s baby, we just hope she grows up well. \n\nThat\u2019s all for today, thank you so much for watching and don\u2019t forget to like, subscribe, and hit that notification bell for more videos like this, and we\u2019ll see you on the next!\n\nRelated videos:\nDepp DISSED by DISNEY CONFIRMED!
