If you've been here before, welcome back and thanks for stopping by.\n\nNote: I am aware that Johnny is now suing Amber for defamation.  That news broke as I was constructing this video.  However, I still feel this video contains some very important information, maybe now more than ever.\n\nThis is Part 1 of a video focusing mainly on the night of May 21st, 2016.  I should be finishing Part 2 in the next few days, so please be patient.  This has taken longer than I anticipated.\n\nThese videos (part 1 and 2) will play like one large video when watched back to back.  So until part 2 is uploaded, please try to not jump ahead with any reckless speculation.  Whereas part 1 exposes some lies and inconsistencies in stories told, part 2 really brings it all full circle and will expose (what I believe to be) some really big lies.  So again, patience.\n\nThis video may come off as a little more speculative.  For that, I apologize.  However, like always, it is all rooted and backed by plenty of research and facts.\n\nThanks for watching!",
