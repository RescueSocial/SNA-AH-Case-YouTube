In this one, I'll show you never before seen evidence and surveillance footage from May of 2016.  I'll be breaking it all down.  Combining it with testimony and other evidence, I'll be showing why I believe Amber and her friends planned out a poorly executed, but somehow highly effective hoax.\n\nIt's been tricky keeping pace with all the new info.  To keep up with analysis as new info comes out, I've been using Twitter more than YouTube lately.  \n\nBut don't worry, I do plan on making more videos in the future, as this all continues to unfold.  I understand some would like for me to cover other cases.  I might in time.  However,  I feel like I can almost see the finish line, and I really want to see this through.\n\nThanks for watching!\n\nIf you want to follow me on Twitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/ThatBrianFella\n\n\nJohnny Depp & Amber Heard Abuse Claims (and the lies not talked about)\nhttps://youtu.be/mN1B-H7i0nE\n\n\nJohnny Depp & Amber Heard Abuse Claims: Questions you should be asking (Part 1)\nhttps://youtu.be/NfUvMF-kkXU\n\n\nJohnny Depp & Amber Heard Abuse Claims: Questions you should be asking (Part 2)\nhttps://youtu.be/0G22UXfpm9s\n\n\nJohnny Depp & Amber Heard Abuse Claims: A Little More TRUTH!\nhttps://youtu.be/MWuFYo3ncAs\n\nMusic: bensound.com",
