            "description": "Celebrities Who Defended Johnny Depp Against Amber Heard With PROOF\nThe court case between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard is raging on strongly, and it's anyone's guess how this is going to end. Not just because of how the case has gotten so messy, but because many people are standing up for Johnny Depp...and blasting Amber Heard at the same time. Throughout the trial/trials, Amber Heard has claimed that Johnny Depp has been abusive to her, but a lot of other people have stood up and said that Johnny \"isn't the type\" to do that, and some of the voices saying this have been pretty surprising.

A look at the situation with Johnny Depp and Amber Heard and how certain people have called her out over the years of the trial to say that her \"views\" on Johnny Depp are clearly flawed. Which of these celebs do you put the most credit in when it comes to defending Johnny Depp? Do you think that if more people stand up for him things will finally be swayed his way? Or is he in for a long and murky fight to the end?
