The UK judgment should be considered and regard should be given to the op-ed publications too, Depp did commit domestic violence against Heard repeatedly which resulted in Amber Heard threatened for her life and causing a huge trauma. \n\nThis declares a supplemental plea. For the matter of , Johnny Depp cannot win on any of his claims, thereby Depp\u2019s complaint against Heard should be dismissed as its whole.  This appeared in the Fairfax county docket in a filling on the 13th of April. \n\nNow, this matter has been brought forward from April 11, 2020, Amber Heard has apparently requested for the hearing which is to be held on the 28th of May, in front of Penney Azcarate. He was assigned the case by Chief judge Bruce White.\n\nAs Amber Heard was unsuccessful in shutting Johnny\u2019s Depp\u2019s suit in the past, this time she is trying to see far ahead with the new strategy. At the moment, Heard has nothing to lose and help her gain a sure-footed move in the US . \n\nMost of the factual information that was precluded cannot allow Johnny Depp to relitigate them. These statements cannot be claimed false either, nor can they be claimed actionable by Johnny Depp, this falls under the Virginia Defamation .  Therefore his claims are obstructed due to the and the plea filing states. \n\nIn this case, both the cases were different, one was defamation and the other was a case. The main difference between the two is that of the written word and of the spoken word. When it comes to Amber Heard, she left no stone unturned to prove Johnny wrong, and that\u2019s she has done both of them. She has also on many occasions spoken about Johnny and the domestic violence she faced because of him. \n\nOne of the new pieces of evidence that were revealed later is the Bodycam footage from the cops that Amber Heard had called on Johnny Depp. This bodycam is from the rampage that occurred in May 2016. In the , many of Amber Heard\u2019s allies and friends have given evidence from the incident. \n\nThey said that Johnny Depp hurled a phone at her face and had also thrashed the penthouse\u2019s kitchen. What Amber Heard\u2019s have claimed to be depictions of the damage done by Johnny Depp are quite different from what the police had observed and addressed.\n\nAmber Heard\u2019s friends had dialed 9-1-1 mistakenly twice, the first cops to arrive have given some new depositions since the last month, claiming that they had seen no signs of vandalism, injuries, or crime scene. \n\nJohnny Depp\u2019s attorney addressed this cover-up and countered Amber Heard\u2019s allegation the night of the rampage, a chaotic, messy crime had been reported by Amber Heard and her allies although the LAPD\u2019s bodycam proved the testimony wrong, he had stated. \n\nThis leads us to another point which is that Amber Heard has made a lot of cover-ups. The rampage night was not the only cover-up by Amber Heard, she has exaggerated and on many occasions made false claims. \n\nThe bodycam is the lead that tells us that Amber Heard has been provided by her team with all the stories.The UK case can be noted as having a few flawed logic in the verdict, the appeal had been denied partly, the reason being that Johnny\u2019s team failed to present the evidence early. \n\nThis incident has always been highlighted by Amber Heard and she has voiced her views on the same, saying that Johnny Depp was in a rage, beat her, and tore the house apart. When the police arrived, she didn\u2019t look like she was assaulted nor did the house look \u2018torn apart. \n\nThe dismissal is a possibility however shocking it is, however, Depp\u2019s team can go about it with the new set of evidence to fight the .  \n\nWhenever the audience speculates and forms their opinions on the legal battle between Amber Heard and Johnny Depp that\u2019s when a twist hits, this seems like a loop. \n\nThe date for the main defamation date is in April 2022, this again leaves us on such an open note.
