            "description": "Here's the audio where Amber Heard mocks Johnny Depp for calling for help while she was abusing him, she then loses her temper and fully admits to abusing him but proceeds to shame him again. \n\nFans of movie star Johnny Depp have demanded their idol\u2019s name be cleared, after his ex-wife Amber Heard apparently admitted to hitting and throwing objects at him in a leaked audio tape. Heard has accused Depp of domestic abuse.\n\nIn an audio confession leaked to the Daily Mail, Heard admits to hitting Depp with pans, pots and vases. The conversation took place during a therapy session in 2015, as the tinseltown pair attempted to save their tumultuous marriage.\n\n\u201cI'm sorry that I didn't, uh, uh, hit you across the face in a proper slap, but I was hitting you, it was not punching you. Babe, you're not punched,\u201d Heard tells Depp, attempting to explain a violent outburst the night before \n\nTypical abuser behavior. #JusticeForJohnnyDepp #TimesUp #MeToo #Abuse #AmberHeard\n\nWatch the full 1 hour video here https://youtu.be/aca0KWoHtqQ\n\n\n\nShare The Joy",
