            "description": "#JusticeForJohnnyDepp #AmberHeard #Metoo #Timesup\n\nHey everyone!  This audio was first reported on by The Daily Mail.  They obtained a 31 minute recorded phone call between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard.  This was during their divorce in 2016.\n\nThis new audio comes fresh off of last weeks discovery of a separate audio conversation in which Amber admits to abusing Johnny Depp on multiple occasions (uncensored link below).  This is not the entirety of the new audio.  I chose to pick some key points to speak about and give important information about them.\n\nHowever, this is a completely uncensored version.  Warning for foul language.  I will consider uploading the entire audio (uncensored) at some point.  But if you want to listen to the whole thing uninterrupted, I'll post the link to the Daily Mail article below.\n\n\nDaily Mail Article:\nhttps://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7966723/Amber-Heard-ridicules-Johnny-Depp-claiming-hes-domestic-violence-victim.html\n\nAmber's first audio confession (uncensored)\nhttps://youtu.be/aca0KWoHtqQ\n\nThese next 2 videos cover IO Tillett Wright's Lies mentioned in this video.\nI'm probably most proud of these 2 because I really got to flex my investigation skills in them.\n\nThe Lies Not Talked About:\nhttps://youtu.be/mN1B-H7i0nE\n\nA Little More Truth:\nhttps://youtu.be/MWuFYo3ncAs\n\nTwitter:\n@ThatBrianFella",
