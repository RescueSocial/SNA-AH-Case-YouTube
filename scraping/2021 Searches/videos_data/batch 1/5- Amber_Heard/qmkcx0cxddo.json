            "description": "Johnny Depp has notched a victory in his lengthy legal battle against ex-wife Amber Heard. A New York judge has partially granted a petition from the \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" star to determine if Heard donated the entirety of her $7 million divorce settlement to the American Civil Liberties Union and to Children's Hospital Los Angeles, as she pledged. As a result of the ruling, the ACLU must release documents that confirm whether or not Heard followed through on the donation promise, which has become a point of contention in the former couple's legal saga.\u201cMr. Depp is most gratified by the Court\u2019s decision,\" Depp's attorney Benjamin Chew said in a statement to USA TODAY. USA TODAY has reached out to Heard's attorney and to the ACLU for comment. In November, Depp lost a libel lawsuit in London against the publisher of The Sun tabloid, which had labeled him a \"wife beater\" in a 2018 headline after Heard accused him of abuse in Los Angeles in 2016 as they were ending their short, volatile marriage. The case pitted Depp against a powerful tabloid and its editor, with Heard as their star witness. In March, Depp was refused an appeal after his lawyer Andrew Caldecott argued that Heard's donation pledge was a \u201ccalculated and manipulative lie\" that \"tipped the scales against Mr. Depp from the very beginning.\"Caldecott also alleged one of Heard's intended charitable beneficiaries, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, wrote to Depp's business adviser in 2019 saying Heard had not made any payments. Lawyers for The Sun's publisher rejected the arguments in court in March, saying Heard did not lie about the donations because she was pledging to pay the sums over 10 years. She had made \u201ca number of payments already in pursuance of these pledges,\" said Adam Wolanski, representing News Group Newspapers. Johnny Depp loses bid to appeal UK court ruling that he assaulted ex-wife Amber HeardThe High Court ruling came after a three-week circus-like trial in July, during which Depp and Heard both took the stand and both were damaged by lurid testimony about drinking, drug use, fighting and room-trashing. The judge ruled that \"the great majority\" of Heard's claims of abuse, as presented by the tabloid's publisher in its defense, were mostly true. Proceedings now move to Virginia, where a separate case arose after Heard published a column in the Washington Post in December 2018, proclaiming herself a victim of domestic abuse and suggesting, without actually using his name, that Depp was the alleged abuser. Three months later, Depp filed a lawsuit in Fairfax County (where the Post is printed) seeking $50 million and accusing his ex-wife of defaming him with \"hoax\" allegations of domestic abuse. Heard shot back by filing more than 300 pages of documents in Virginia, expanding on the abuse allegations she lodged against Depp during their divorce in 2016, claiming Depp regularly beat her up before she married him in 2015 and continued to do so during their 18-month marriage.\n\n\nAll data is taken from the source: http://usatoday.com\nArticle Link: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entert...\n\n\n#depp #newsdaily #usanewstoday #bbcworldnewstoday #newstodayabc #cnnnewstoday #",
