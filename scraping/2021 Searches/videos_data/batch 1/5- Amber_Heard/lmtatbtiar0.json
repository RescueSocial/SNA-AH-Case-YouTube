            "description": "In 2020, Johnny Depp lost his libel case against News Group Newspapers who produce The Sun. Depp claimed The Sun's article in 2018 which claimed he was a wife-beater and had abused Amber Heard, was false. \n\nMany were confused when the High Court ruled against Johnny Depp, even though there was proof that Amber Heard had assaulted him. A voice recording surfaced of the pair talking and Heard admits to hitting Depp. Many called for Amber Heard to go to jail and the hashtag #justiceforjohnnydepp began trending.\n\nHowever, a lot of people have misunderstood the case. Despite involving domestic abuse, this was not a criminal trial but a libel trial. This means neither Amber Heard or Johnny Depp were on trial. Johnny Depp was only suing The Sun and Amber Heard was simply a witness to help The Sun's case.\n\nUnlike in a criminal trial where one must prove guilt 'beyond reasonable doubt', in this libel case The Sun only had to prove it was 'more likely than not' that what they had reported was true; that Depp had abused Amber Heard.\n\nPlease subscribe for more simple explanations of UK law cases!
