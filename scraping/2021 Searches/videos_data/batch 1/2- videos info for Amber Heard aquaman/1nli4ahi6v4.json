            "description": "Emilia Clarke SPEAKS OUT On Being Amber Heard's Replacement In Aquaman 2!!!\nUnfortunately, lots of things have been moved around due to the incidents that had taken place throughout 2020. What I mean by this is there were a lot of comic book movies that were supposed to be released, but unfortunately, this did not happen. But looking on the bright side of things, it just may be that this will not be the same case for the year 2021, as comic book movies may just make their normal appearances yet again, along with other movies in general. Aquaman 2 is one that just may be making its appearance to be the big screen, but there seems to be a bit of a problem with one individual cast member, and by now I think you can guess who I am talking about.
