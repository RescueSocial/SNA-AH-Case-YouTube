            "description": "Following the ruckus brought about by their previous marriage, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard\u2019s careers were expected to crumble as they continuously face allegations and lawsuit cases here and there. Due to Johnny\u2019s defamation case against Amber, which is still ongoing up to this day, the two have been the center of attention in the past few weeks. However, there are many other factors that should be credited for their failed romance story to spiral into the top. For starters, As Johnny Depp lost his libel case filed against news publisher The Sun, he also lost his chance to reprise the role of Grindelwald in the upcoming third installment of the series Fantastic Beasts. But despite Johnny leaving, or being forced rather, to vacate his role, Amber Heard was set to continue on to reprise her role as Queen Mera in the upcoming second franchise of the DC Extended Universe movie Aquaman 2, entitled Aquaman and The Lost Kingdom. Both movies are set to premiere in 2022, and both movies are going to be under Warner Brothers. When Johnny was fired from the Fantastic Beasts film, many fans protested. This even upset the film writer herself, J.K. Rowling. However, both his colleagues and his supporters weren\u2019t able to rectify the situation. Soon enough, fans got over it a little, but not until Warner Bros. revealed the final cast list for their new Aquaman movie. It was announced that unlike what most fans expected, Amber Heard will be reprising her role as the Atlantean Queen Mera after all, and obviously, this angered a lot of fans, which led to a petition for Warner Bros. to recast Mera\u2019s role. Unfortunately for them, despite garnering over 1.6 million signatures for the petition, Warner Bros. still pushed through with Amber Heard reprising her role.\n\nYou might be wondering, aren\u2019t they afraid that their DC movie might lose tons of revenue just because of casting a simply notorious name in the industry right now? With everything that\u2019s going on in Johnny and Amber\u2019s post-divorce chaos, it is indeed safe to say that Amber\u2019s name is in the hot seat, and not in a positive way. Well, it turns out they are obviously risking it. Because even though Amber was able to keep her role, she seems to lose more and more of her supporters because of evidence against her that continues to surface, including her recorded phone call with Johnny where she admitted that she hit him, her allegedly having affairs with actor James Franco and Elon Musk, a long list of co-stars and even former partners of Johnny testifying against her lies, and the missing donation to charity that she claimed she would give after her $7 million dollar divorce settlement. \n\n1. Sophie Turner\nQueen Mera is a pretty and strong minded redhead who rules Atlantis. If there\u2019s anyone who quickly comes to mind when talking about redhead, superhero, and action, then there\u2019s only one obvious option.\n\n2. Karen Gillan\nKaren Gillan is another actress whom you can take one single look at and realize instantly that she is perfect for the role of Mera. \n\n3. Eleanor Tomlinson\nEleanor Tomlinson looks like she\u2019s a mermaid fresh out of water. Though naturally blonde, Eleanor has been known as the girl in red locks, due to her beautiful waves of ginger red hair that resembles that of Mera. \n\n4. Emily Blunt\nEmily is a well-known actress that has taken on too many roles, but seems to be too much at the height of her career to stop soon.\n\n5. Emilia Clarke\nWidely known as Daenerys Targaryen, Emilia Clarke is one of the highest paid actresses today. Well, landing a lead role in one of the highest grossing series of all time really is a huge, huge break, and Emilia obviously is at the height of her career. But, it clearly shows that the DCEU has its own extensive budget for huge stars, and it is indeed possible for them to cast Emilia as Mera. For starters, she had already graced us with her blonde Daenerys hair that turned out to be actually brown. So, what are the odds that she would pull it off as beautifully with red hair? Emilia is also a very beautiful woman, and swimming in Atlantis with a fitted ocean Queen costume doesn\u2019t seem impossible to picture. Apart from this, wouldn\u2019t fans want Emilia to reunite with her Game of Thrones co-star Jason Momoa?\n\nDespite all these great options, Warner Bros. went on with casting Amber Heard. Given the actress\u2019 predicament, it is a strange decision but one they seem to want to stick with. That\u2019s all for today, we hope you enjoyed that video and if you did, make sure to like, subscribe, and hit that notification bell for more videos like this.\n\nRelated videos:\nHeard PANICS as her INNER CIRCLE CRACKS!
