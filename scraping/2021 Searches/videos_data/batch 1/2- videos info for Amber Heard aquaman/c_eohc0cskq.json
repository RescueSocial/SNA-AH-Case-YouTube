            "description": "There has been a lot of talk about Amber Heard over the last however many years, mainly in regards to how her legal battle with ex-husband Johnny Depp has revealed some not so flattering things about her and how she treats those close to her. But even though that is a major focus of her life right now, her life on screen is obviously something she'd prefer to go and focus on. But sadly for her, outside of a certain superhero film, her exploits on screen just aren't much to praise. Which a more recent movie of hers proved. We'll break it down for you.

A look at the situation with Amber Heard and how a lot of her \"successes\" aren't what she would claim them to be. Does this help reinforce in your mind that she married Johnny Depp for status? Do you think that she needs to try and do something outside of the DCEU in order to make herself \"more accomplished\"? Does she even have that ability?
