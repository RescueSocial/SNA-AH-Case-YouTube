But after a few years into their marriage, toxicity grew which encompassed ruthless allegations and accusations against Depp, leading everyone to favor Amber Heard out of sympathy. This caused Depp\u2019s career, personal life, and mental health to deteriorate drastically for years together. \n\nNow back to the present, what is trending about Amber Heard currently?\nWe all know Amber Heard to play the role of Mera in Aquaman and how she did a marvelous job at it. But will she be in its sequel as initially planned is the big question on everyone\u2019s mind. Though many wish to not see her on-screen, due to her cheap ways of getting at Depp, the decision finally lies in the hands of Warner Bros. \n\nHow do we know about the fans not wanting to see her on Aquaman 2? \nWell, if the 1.8 million-plus signatures on the petition on Change.org on trying to get Amber Heard out of the movie wasn\u2019t enough proof of how badly the fans want her out, we don\u2019t know what will!\n\nBased on the situations she has been in in the recent past, you may assume that Warner Bros have removed or would be removing Amber from the cast list due to her false allegation scandal but rumors are stating otherwise. In fact, the rumors are quite far away from this reason and are stated to revolve around her health situation being breached.\n\nSo, is Amber Heard really facing some health concerns?\nThe freshest piece of news about the whole Amber Heard- Aquaman 2 situation entails her being asked to leave the cast due to certain health concerns she is facing. Rumour has it that Warner Bros have stated her not to be fit as she was when she played the role of Mera in Aquaman, and hence need her to get fit or she shall be replaced. \n\nIn actuality, the contract that entails the signature of the cast member playing the role of Mera states that the actor has to be in good form before the shooting. As Amber is known very well to play the blame-game, she directly blamed Johnny Depp for her health deteriorating and causing her to fall into depression which thus affected her body, causing her to place her role in Aquaman 2 at stake. \n\nThis may have brought a certain special cast onboard but it's more like a tug of war between the two right now, with the new entry almost playing the role of Mera while Amber Heard is left to get in shape before the shooting of Aquaman 2, or else would have to face the consequences of losing the role. \n\nThe fans have spoken out about them wanting Emilia Clarke to play the role of Mera as she seems to be the perfect suitor not just because of her amazing personality but also because she has caused flames to arise with her previous on-screen TV series with Jason Momoa. Yes, the Khaleesi has tons of talent and potential to conquer this role with class and make both Warner Bros and the fans satisfied. \n\nIn fact, in an article by Keith Flamar in Forbes, Emilia Clarke has been said to have signed that contract to play the role of Mera with Warner Bros. Why would Forbes lie right?\n\nTo add to this, Emilia Clarke has been seen out and about with a green costume and some dainty red locks complimenting her costume. Could this be another hint that we could take, that Emilia is playing the role of Mera?! We are as confused as you are now but secretly wishing this is true cause we kid you not, we secretly are wishing for her to make it to the big screens with Jason Momoa again. \n\nWill Amber Heard attract bad publicity to the movie?\nThere is a high chance that it may, which is why Warner Bros. seems to be trying to get rid of her in a subtle way so as to not face the brunt of the consequences. Her ongoing court case has been shifted from 2021 to 2022, thus giving her time to shoot for the film without facing any interruptions. But to add to the worries of her court case, Amber has been seen galavanting around the world on expensive yachts, especially Europe throughout the pandemic, leaving fans to put her sense of responsibility and accountability to test. amber heard aquaman 2 celebrity news clevver newsds\n\n#AmberHeardFired #Aquaman2 #JasonMomoa #JusticeForDepp #EmiliaClarke #JohnnyDepp #DeppandHeard #Depp #TheSpotlight #Spotlight",
