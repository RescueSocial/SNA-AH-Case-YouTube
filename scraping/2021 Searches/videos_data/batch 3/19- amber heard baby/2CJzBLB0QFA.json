            "description": "Johnny Depp SPEAKS OUT About Being The Father Of Amber Heard's Daughter... ?!\nOver the past couple years, just about every single story about Amber Heard has been tied to her ongoing court case with Johnny Depp. We don't say that lightly, either, we know that this is a case that has been getting lots of attention due to the fact that both sides are desperate to go and get their own kind of vindication of sorts. That's due to the fact that each side is accusing the other of. But amongst all of this though is a small bright spot that none can ignore, because Amber Heard...has had a girl.
