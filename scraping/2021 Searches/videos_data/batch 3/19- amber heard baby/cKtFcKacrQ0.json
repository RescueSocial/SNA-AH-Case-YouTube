In fact, I'll go on a little more. Raelynn is quadriplegic. She has a gastro-jejunal (GJ) tube. She has a vagus nerve stimulator (vns). She uses a shaker vest, nebulizer, and a cough assist machine daily to help her breath better.\n\nRaelynn\u2019s been to the doctor more times than the rest of our family combined!\n\nIn this whole situation, if we were looking for hope in our circumstances, we honestly wouldn\u2019t find much. Raelynn will probably always be in a wheelchair. She\u2019ll probably always be fed via a food pump. She\u2019ll probably never talk. And she has virtually no chance of getting better.\n\nI can\u2019t tell you how many times people have told me, \u201cGod can heal her.\u201d I\u2019ve actually come to find it a little funny when people say that (and I'm a pastor!). I know that God CAN heal her, and I know that God will heal her in eternity, but the point of life is not that we wouldn\u2019t have difficult circumstances.\n\nGod is using Raelynn exactly as she is right now. I see how much I\u2019m a better person because of Raelynn. I see the ways God has changed my family, the things He\u2019s taught us, the people He\u2019s put us in connection with, all because of Raelynn\u2019s problems. When I see how much God uses her disabilities, I see that God takes the bad things, the hard things, the hopeless circumstances of our lives and brings beauty, goodness, and hope from them all.\n\nThat's what this channel's about.\n\nWe post videos of Raelynn's life, seizures, and other disabilities to this channel three days a week (Monday, Wednesday, Friday).\n\nIf this sounds like something you could benefit from, please consider subscribing!
