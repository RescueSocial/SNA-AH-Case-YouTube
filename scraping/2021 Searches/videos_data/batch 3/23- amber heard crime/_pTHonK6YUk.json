I have been doing this type of work for the last 14 years with children\u2019s hospitals and bringing, hopefully, laughs and alleviation and distraction to kids that are severely ill,' said Heard, as the two-year anniversary of her May 2016 divorce filing with Depp approaches.After the celebrity pair, who initially got together on the set of 2011's The Rum Diary, finalized the details of their split in August of 2016, Heard said that she was forwarding the American Civil Liberties Union half of the $7 million total.\u00a0  She said the monies were forwarded 'with a particular focus to stop violence against women,' amid the allegations of verbal and physical abuse she aimed at Depp in their split.\u00a0The actress, who shares the screen with Cara Delevingne in the upcoming crime drama London Fields, issued a statement following the settlement stressing that finances played no role in the show business split.She said, 'As described in the restraining order and divorce settlement, money played no role for me personally and never has, except to the extent that I could donate it to charity and, in doing so, hopefully help those less able to defend themselves.'As reported in the media, the amount received in the divorce was $7 million and $7 million is being donated. This is over and above any funds that I have given away in the past and will continue to give away in the future.'",
