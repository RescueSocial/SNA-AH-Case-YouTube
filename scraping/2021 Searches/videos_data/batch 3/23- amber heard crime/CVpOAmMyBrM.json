            "description": "PARALEGAL REACTS TO AMBER HEARD caught in 4K LYING BY BODY CAM FOOTAGE!!! It's a WRAP\n\nWell, turns out @antphrodite  (the Psychic who did a video on this I reacted to) prediction came true... Amber Heard is caught in 4k! More like 480p, but caught none the less! The body cam footage from the day the police came to her house has been leaked and nothing is what she said it was. The house was perfectly clean and they sent the police on their way, saying all is well.. Can you believe it? I am SHOOK!! Speechless! I can't wait to see how Amber tries to get herself out of this one! She's busted the house. Funnily enough, Amber Heard just filed to try to get the entire case dismissed, citing the fact that Johnny lost his UK trial. I wasn't worried to begin with as it's completely ridiculous, but now I am 10000000% certain she will not succeed in getting the case thrown out! What are your thoughts on this?! I am still in shock! \n\nEmail: Debidooms@gmail.com\nInstagram: www.instagram.com/debidooms ; www.instagram.com/debidoesmakeup \nTikTok: debidooms\n\nSupport my channel (and demonetized content) by buy buying me a coffee! *no pressure* : https://ko-fi.com/debidooms\n\nMusic by Ryan Little - Greatest of Ease - https://thmatc.co/?l=4D478279\n\nLINKS TO YOUTUBERS COVERING THIS CASE!
