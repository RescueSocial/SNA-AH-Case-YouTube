A restorative justice response to sexualized harm continues to be a controversial proposition amongst many justice partners and victim service providers. Accordingly, we hope to engage the community in collaboratively contributing to the dialogue to better understand how we can best serve victims of sexualized violence with restorative justice services.\n\nThe Panelists: \nHost - Joellen McHard of Lanark County Community Justice \nALLAN EDWARDS, Correction Service Canada\nSHERI HALLADAY, Lanark County Community Justice\nMARK MACDONALD, Criminal Lawyer\nAMBER MONTGOMERY, Senior Caseworker, Collaborative Justice Program - Ottawa\nMAUREEN MCLEOD FRAZER, Coordinator, Sexual Assault & Domestic Violence Program, Perth & Smiths Falls District Hospital\n\nMusic from bensound.com",
