            "description": "Johnny Depp\u2019s estranged wife, Amber Heard, has now released text messages between herself and Depp\u2019s assistant to prove Depp engaged in a pattern of physical abuse against her. We discuss the text messages and what Heard stands to gain in spousal support with defense attorney Mike Cavalluzzi. We also take a look at the conviction of  \u201cThe Shield\u201d actor, Michael Jace who was convicted of second degree murder in the shooting death of his wife in front of the couple\u2019s two young sons, as well as the controversial arrest of a Bronx cabbie who killed a man for trying to rape his wife. We take a closer look at Canadian real estate heir, Blake Leibel\u2019s insanity plea and whether or not the DA will ask for the death penalty? Lastly, we\u2019ll delve into whether child pornography charges are appropriate when a 14-year-old boy films a sex act and distributes that video in a middle school to his friends in this episode of Crime Time hosted by Allison Hope Weiner. \n\nGUEST BIO:\nMichael \"Mike\" Cavalluzzi is one of the best criminal defense attorneys in Los Angeles County.
