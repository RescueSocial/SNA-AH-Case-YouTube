After revisiting and revamping, with some new material, I finally managed to complete the project! I hope you like it (and her) as much as I do.\n\nThe plot would be:\nLike in the comics, her father's a master thief. She follows suit and her criminal activity peaks interest from the Kingpin. After various cat-and-mouse pursuit that sees her captured, she makes a deal to undergo experimentation (gaining her famous 'bad luck' powers).The finale would see her attempt to bring down the Kingpin with these new abilities, regaining her freedom in the process.\n\nBlack Cat/Felicia Hardy - Amber Heard\nKingpin/Wilson Fisk - Vincent D'Onofrio\nSpider-Man/Peter Parker - I only included a costumed clip so it could basically be anybody... we don't need to see his face anyway.\n\n\nCheck out my other trailers and subscribe for more.\n\nEnjoy!",
