The Teen Mom OG reunion special ended on a dramatic note on Nov. 30, when Gary Shirley dropped a bomb on ex Amber Portwood, as they were both speaking to Dr. Drew Pinsky. Dr. Drew had asked Gary if he\u2019d be open to his daughter, Leah, seeking therapy, and he said she already was. \u201cYou probably didn\u2019t know this,\u201d Gary told Amber before she turned away from him in anger. \nClearly, Amber appeared to be upset by the fact that she didn\u2019t know this information, but Gary said Leah asked him to keep a secret. He then admitted that she gave him \u201cpermission\u201d to share the news during the reunion, which Amber thought seemed odd. \n\u201cIt\u2019d good [news] if I knew about it,\u201d Amber said after Dr. Drew tried saying it was a good thing. He also said that Leah might invite Amber to join her in therapy one day, and Amber said, \u201cI hope that one day when she feels comfort",
