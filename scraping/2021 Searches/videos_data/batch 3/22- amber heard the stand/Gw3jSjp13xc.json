A new document has been circulated which states a nameless party, conjectured to be Whitney Henriquez, Amber Heard\u2019s sister. \n\nIt\u2019s nothing but a subpoena!  Rumour has it that Amber Heard has paid or let\u2019s say bribed her sister, Whitney Henriques a hefty sum of 10,000 dollars to give false testimony, against Johnny Depp. Yes, you have heard it right! \n\nHow did the story of Johnny Depp and Amber Heard start? \n\nIn short, their story can be covered in four words - courtship, divorce, and domestic abuse.\n\nJohnny Depp and Amber Heard met on the sets of \u2018The Rum Diary\u2019 back in 2009. Soon after forming a warm camaraderie, the duo escalated their relationship and became lovers around 2012. Both of them split up with their then-partners in the same year. \n\nBut little did they know that this was soon about to make a turn for the worse. \n\nA fact to note here is that Amber Heard was arrested on the charge of physically assaulting her girlfriend Van Ree, which was later resolved, clearing the air. Van Ree defended her ex-girlfriend Amber Heard by stating that the police wrongly interpreted the actions and it was all just a misunderstanding. \n\nWell, let\u2019s just say something similar happened between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard, because just a year after their marriage, Amber Heard filed for divorce and accused Johnny Depp of physical assault. A temporary restraining order was also taken out against her husband.\n\nWhat\u2019s the status of the case so far? \n\nDepp has denied Amber\u2019s claims of physical assault and has filed a defamation suit against Amber Heard for a whopping 50 million dollars. And now Heard has finally filed her counterclaims, saying that she is the true victim here. \n\nLet\u2019s come back to the defamation case filed by Depp against his ex-wife. The case revolves around a 2018 article Amber Heard wrote in The Washington Post, about being a survivor of domestic abuse.\n\nDespite Johnny Depp\u2019s attempts to throw out the case against him, a judge has granted Amber Heard permission to file her 100 million dollar countersuit in response to the actor\u2019s suit.  \n\nJohnny Depp\u2019s Claims\n\nAmber Heard was the abuser in the relationship with Johnny Depp, as per the claims of his former personal assistant. As a result of this incident, Depp spent the entire time in the bathroom after his personal security intervened.  During the time the couple took a trip to Australia, due to frictions between them, Heard threw a bottle of Vodka at Depp and severed his finger. Now, let\u2019s delve into the testimony and the sum of $10,000 offered to Whitney Henriquez, Amber Heard\u2019s sister. This document is a subpoena, it states that the person to whom it is addressed has to take a stand, they will be answerable to the court. That is followed by a number of requests for documentation and communications. The amount paid, clearly hints that something is fishy\n\nIf one has to pay for testimony from someone they are close to, precisely their own sister, then the accusations are feeble, lack real evidence, and reasoning. \n\nTo explain what is mentioned in the document, here are two examples:\n\nRequest number 1:  All documents or Communications that refer, reflect, or relate to any physical or verbal (blank) in any form against anonymous and Mr. Depp.\n\nRequest number 2: All communications YOU and (blank) that refer, reflect, or relate to any physical or verbal (blank) in any form against anonymous and Mr. Depp.\n \nLastly, the documentation shows the amounts of monetary payments, gifts, or transfers in value of (blank) to you or for your benefit, with the connection of the defamation case, the divorce action, and or the Sun Case in the amount of $10,000 or more. An incident back from March 2015, gives a hint of evidence that Amber would have perhaps bribed Whitney to lie in the court against Depp. Henriquez justified the actions of Heard when she had allegedly punched Depp, which she defended by arguing that she threw her fist against him because she felt threatened by the possibility of Depp pushing her down the stairs.  clevver news  amber heard aquaman 2  celebrity news johhny depp case amber heard case\n\n#AmberHeard #JohnnyDepp #TheSpotlight #JohnnyDeppCase #AmberHeardCase #AmberHeardLiar #Aquaman2 #JasonMomoa #Depp #Heard",
