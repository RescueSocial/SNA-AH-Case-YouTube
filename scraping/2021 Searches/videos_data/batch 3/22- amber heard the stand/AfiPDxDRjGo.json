The miniseries is slated to have a total of nine episodes.\n\nSpoilers \u2018The Stand\u2019 is also titled \u2018The Stand.\u2019 It is the penultimate episode of the limited series. If the show follows the Stephen King book closely, then the upcoming episode will see Glen executed by Lloyd after he denies bending his knee to Randall Flagg. The episode may also see a dying Nadine prophetically telling Flagg that four men from Boulder would be his end. In the book, a livid Flagg tosses Nadine from the penthouse balcony, thus killing her instantly. The next episode might also see the Trashcan Man return with the nuclear weapon that Flagg wanted.\n\nTitled \u201cThe Stand,\u201d The Stand Season 1 Episode 8 is soon going to be released. The post-apocalyptic fiction has been getting mixed reviews since its premiere. This show is based on a book penned down by Stephen King. It went by the same name and was published back in 1978. The makers took very long to realize that the book is worth having a TV adaptation.\n\nThe Stand S01E08: In a world mostly wiped out by the plague and embroiled in an elemental struggle between good and evil, the fate of mankind rests on the frail shoulders of the 108-year-old Mother Abagail and a handful of survivors. Their worst nightmares are embodied in a man with a lethal smile and unspeakable powers: Randall Flagg, the Dark Man.\n\nThe Stand is a post-apocalyptic dark fantasy novel written by American author Stephen King and first published in 1978 by Doubleday. The plot centers on a pandemic of a weaponized strain of influenza that kills almost the entire world population. The few survivors, united in groups, establish a new social system and engage in confrontation with each other. In writing the book, King sought to create an epic in the spirit of The Lord of the Rings that was set in contemporary America. The book was difficult for King to write because of the large number of characters and storylines.\n\nIn 1990, The Stand was reprinted as a Complete and Uncut Edition. King restored some fragments of texts that were initially reduced, revised the order of the chapters, shifted the novel's setting from 1980 to 10 years forward, and accordingly corrected a number of cultural references. The Complete and Uncut Edition of The Stand is considered to be King's longest stand-alone work with its 1,152 pages, surpassing King's 1,138-page novel It. The book has sold 4.5 million copies.\n\n#thestand #thestand1x8 #thestands1e8 #thestandcast #thestandcbsallaccess #thestandpremiere #thestandepisode8 #thestandtrailer #thestandeps.8 #thestandengsub #thestandseason1 #thestandseries1 #thestandepisode8 #thestandseason1episode8 #thestandfullstreaming #thestanddownloadhd #thestandallsubtitle #thestandfullshow #watchthestandtemporada1cap\u00edtulo8 #watchthestandsaison1\u00e9pisode8 #watchthestandseason1episode8fullepisodes #watchthestandseason1episode8fullepisodes #watchthestandseason1episode8fullseries #watchthestandseason1episode8watchonline #watchthestandseason1episode8online",
