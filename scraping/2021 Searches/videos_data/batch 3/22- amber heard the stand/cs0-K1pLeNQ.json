            "description": "Exes Johnny Depp and Amber Heard both arrived at a courthouse in London on July 7 for the actor\u2019s libel case against \u2018The Sun,\u2019 which stemmed from allegations of abuse made by Amber. \u00a0 \u00a0Johnny Depp and ex-wife Amber Heard were seen arriving separately on July 7 to a London courthouse as the actor\u2019s libel trial against News Group Newspapers (NGN) and The Sun\u2018s\u00a0executive editor Dan Wootton began. Heard, 34, wore a red face covering and a black midi dress and heels, holding hands with two women as she made her way into the courthouse. Depp, 57, covered up with a black bandana and aviator sunglasses, and waved to photographers as he stepped inside for the first day of the three-week trial. \u00a0   \u00a0The Pirates of the Caribbean star is suing British paper The Sun\u2018s parent company and Wootton over an article they published in April 2018, which called him a \u201cwife beater\u201d and alleged that there\u2019s \u201coverwhelming evidence\u201d that he attacked Heard during their marriage. Depp vehemently denies the allegations, which include accounts of an alleged 14 separate incidences of domestic violence, like Heard\u2019s story about a fight that ended in Depp cutting off the tip of his finger (he disputes how he lost his finger). \u00a0In the April 2018 column, Wootton askedd how JK Rowling could be \u201cgenuinely happy\u201d with Depp being cast in the Harry Potter spinoff film Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald, considering the allegations made by Heard. NGN is defending the article as true, saying that Depp was allegedly \u201ccontrolling and verbally and physically abusive towards Heard, particularly when he was under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs\u201d between early 2013 and 2016, when their marriage ended.  \u00a0Depp is serving as the first witness in his libel trial. He tried and failed to block her from being in the courtroom during the court proceedings, according to our sister site, Deadline. However,\u00a0 throughout the trial, the court will hear from two of Depp\u2019s other exes, Vanessa Paradis and Winona Ryder. Both said that Depp was never violent toward them. \u00a0Depp has a separate libel lawsuit in Virginia, filed against Heard herself, over a 2018 op-ed she wrote for the Washington Post. In the piece, which never names her ex-husband, Heard wrote that she received \u201cthe full force of our culture\u2019s wrath for women who speak out.\u201d That trial is scheduled to begin in January 2021.",
