            "description": "Kiss Scene (Nadine and Flagg)\nHave passionate sex Scene (Amber Heard  and Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd)\nMaking love Scene From Series: \"The Stand\" (2021)\n\n\n\u2022 Original title: \"The Stand\"\n\u2022 Episode title (S01E07) \"Episode 7\"\n\u2022 Adventure, Drama, Fantasy \n\u2022 Creators: Josh Boone, Benjamin Cavell\n\u2022 Stars: Whoopi Goldberg, Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd, James Marsden \n\u2022 IMDb: 5,5/10\n\n\nThe Stand picks up the pace significantly in a crucial episode directed with flair and dread by Vincenzo Natali (Splice, Cube). There are still some odd changes to the source material in this hour.\n\n\nHow is Nadine not in Vegas yet? Wasn\u2019t she going 120 mph? Anyway, she finds a red carpet in the desert, and she\u2019s suddenly in Flagg\u2019s penthouse. She made it. She\u2019s finally with her King. They kiss, and she tells him about Harold. Now she can be his wife, and the two have passionate sex that gets more and more intense. She starts to sense something isn\u2019t right and realizes she\u2019s still in the desert just as she suddenly sees a demon form of Flagg. It\u2019s an odd, vague cut to commercial in that shocking moment that somewhat lessens one of the darkest scenes in Stephen King history. In the book, this is a brutal, violent rape scene (\u201cHe battered into her, invader, destroyer, and the cold blood gushed down her thighs\u201d) that traumatizes Nadine and leaves her catatonic. It may have been too dark for CBS All Access, but the way it\u2019s framed here feels like it mutes how much Flagg abuses even his \u201cQueen.\u201d\n\n\nBy this time, Nadine has finally reached the next phase of her destiny. Flagg transports her to his suite in New Vegas, where he has sex with her. It\u2019s all a beautiful illusion, though, as Nadine realizes too late. The edges of the fantasy dissolve to reveal that she\u2019s lying in the dirt, and Flagg is a demon. And while this scene also shifts to imply that Nadine is no longer consenting, it is an improvement upon the scene in the book, which is a violent rape scene.\n\n\nNadine is simultaneously reluctant and determined to get to Flagg, enticed of his protection and terrified of his ownership of her. She willingly goes, but it\u2019s also the result of years and years of conditioning on Flagg\u2019s part. He shrunk her world so that it seemed like he was the only person she had. He made her need him. She starts to have sex with him and then tries to stop, but he ignores her protests, and things turn violent and terrifying. She sees him for the monster he really is, but it\u2019s too late. He sucks everything out of her so that she becomes a floating, quiet, submissive shell. She has served her purpose: She\u2019s pregnant with Flagg\u2019s demon baby, and it\u2019s literally sucking the life out of her. Flagg\u2019s at his scariest here. His behaviors with Nadine have all the markings of an abusive, manipulative, all-consuming relationship.\n\n\nIt goes both ways, too. As already mentioned, Harold understands in his last minutes that it was his inability to let go of his humiliation and hatred that has doomed him, and once Nadine gets to the desert, she too has an awful moment of clarity when she and Flagg bang it out. Even Mother Abigail chastises herself for the sinful pride that caused her to forget that, \u201cI was not the potter, but the clay.\u201d As this series creeps toward the final showdown, Cavell and his writers are making it clear that the bigger battle for humanity\u2019s salvation is already underway, and the lines there for which side one should be on are as clear as day.\n\n\n\u201cThe Walk\u201d works as well as it does because it manages to pull these character and thematic moments together in an episode that is also captivating, and is bolstered by some gorgeous cinematography capturing the quartet\u2019s walk west (and a clutch use of Radiohead\u2019s \u201cI Promise\u201d during one such portion). The performances of Marsden, Adepo, Kinnear, and Bedard represent an emotional high-water mark for the series, with all four actors using the history of the previous six episodes to fall into an effortless rapport as a group.\n\n\nOn the flipside, like Harold\u2019s motorcycle, Teague hits a wall with his performance this time around, as his magnificent crescendo in last week\u2019s \u201cThe Vigil\u201d didn\u2019t leave him anywhere to go in the early moments of this episode. And while Nadine\u2019s lightening-fast gestation of Flagg\u2019s demon-baby does hit the whole, \u201cthe future is what you make of it\u201d theme a little too squarely on the head, her corpse-like complexion at the end of the episode.\n\n\nThe Stand Season 1 Episode 7 | The Stand 1x07 | The Stand S1e7 \n\n\n#Thestand\u200b\u200b #AmberHeard\u200b\u200b #AlexanderSkarsg\u00e5rd\u200b #TheStand1x07\u200b #TheStandpromo\u200b #TheStandcast\u200b #TheStandpreview\u200b #TheStandsynopsis\u200b #TheStandspoilers\u200b #TheStandreleasedate\u200b #TheStandairdate\u200b #TheStandHDQuality\u200b #TheStandSeason1\u200b #TheStandEpisode7\u200b #TheStandSeason1Episode7\u200b #TheStandBestSeries\u200b #TheStandCBSAllAccess\u200b #TheStandFullEpisodes\u200b #TheStandOnline\u200b #TheStandFreeOnline\u200b #TheStandFullFree\u200b #TheStandSeason1Episode7Online",
