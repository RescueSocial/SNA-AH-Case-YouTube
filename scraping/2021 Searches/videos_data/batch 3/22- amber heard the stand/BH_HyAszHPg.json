            "description": "LONDON (AP) \u2014 Johnny Depp gave evidence in a London court on Tuesday, denying claims that he hit ex-wife Amber Heard and accusing her of assaulting him and depicting him as a \u201cmonster.\u201dDepp sat in the witness box in a wood-paneled High Court courtroom on the first day of his libel case against The Sun over an article that branded him a \u201cwife-beater.\u201d The \u201cPirates of the Caribbean\u201d star began by taking the court oath and giving his full name: John Christopher Depp II.Depp is suing the tabloid\u2019s publisher, News Group Newspapers, and its executive editor, Dan Wootton, over an 2018 story alleging he was violent and abusive to model-actress Heard during their short, tempestuous marriage. Depp strongly denies the claim.Depp said Heard had \u201csaid to the world that she was in fear of her life from me, and I had been this horrible monster if you will. Which was not the case.\u201dDepp, 57, and Heard, 34, met on the set of the 2011 comedy \u201cThe Rum Diary\u201d and married in Los Angeles in February 2015. They divorced in 2017, and now bitterly accuse one another of abuse.Depp and Heard arrived by separate entrances at the neo-Gothic court building on the opening day of the three-week trial, one of the first to be held in person since Britain began to lift its coronavirus lockdown. Both wore face coverings over their noses and mouths. Proceedings have been spread over several courtrooms to allow for social distancing.Witnesses are scheduled to include Depp\u2019s former partners, Vanessa Paradis and Winona Ryder, both of whom have submitted statements supporting him.Depp\u2019s claim centers on an April 2018 story in The Sun headlined: \u201cPotty - How can JK Rowling be \u2018genuinely happy\u2019 casting wife beater Johnny Depp in the new Fantastic Beasts film?\u201dWhile Heard isn\u2019t on trial, the case is also a showdown between the former spouses, who accuse each other of being controlling, violent and untruthful.Describing one incident in which Heard claims he hit her, Depp said the opposite was true.\u201cAs things tended to do, (it) escalated and got physical, ending with a bit of assault. Ms. Heard struck me,\u201d he said.He painted himself as a peacemaker who tried to de-escalate things.\u201cWhenever it would escalate I would try to go to my own corner, as it were ... before things got out of hand,\u201d he said.The Sun\u2019s defense relies on Heard\u2019s allegations of 14 incidents of violence by Depp between 2013 and 2016, in locations including Los Angeles, Australia, Japan, the Bahamas and on a private jet. He denies them all and says Heard attacked him with items including a drink can and a cigarette. He also claims that on one occasion Heard or one of her friends defecated on his bed.\u201cShe was the abuser, not him,\u201d Depp\u2019s lead lawyer, David Sherborne, said in a written statement.\u201cShe is a highly complex and aggressive individual who suffered extreme mood swings, would provoke endless circular arguments, and fly into violent rages.\u201dThe case is set to put the two performers\u2019 complex private lives under a microsco",
