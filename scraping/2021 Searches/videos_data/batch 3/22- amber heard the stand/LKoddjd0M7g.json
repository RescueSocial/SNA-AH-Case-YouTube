You know it's the right thing to do.]\n[Amber: I want to help him, to help everyone here, but Sofia... I'm not sure I can. I'm starting to think there's a reason why you get to be story keeper, and have a special amulet, and I don't.]\n\nAmber:\nEvery day I watch you give your all to those in need\nEvery place we go you make things better with your good deeds\nYou're the one who saves the day of that, there's no doubt\nYou're so strong, a natural hero inside and out\n\nBut that's not who I am\nThough it makes my heart break\nThat's not who I am\nI don't have what it takes\n\nSo today I caused Nothing but trouble, can't you see\nEvery place we've gone I've been thinking only of me\nI'm the one who let harm come To all our new friends\nI was wrong to think that I'm brave, It was all just pretend\n\n'Cause that's not who I am\nThough it makes my heart break\nThat's not who I am\nI don't have what it takes\n\n[Sofia: But that's not true, Amber. There's so many times I've seen you do the right thing.]\n[Amber: You have?]\n[Sofia: Yes. You rescued Dad and James from the jade jaguar. You went after Mom when you thought she was taken by Selians. You even helped fix Clio and Hildegard's friendship.\n[Amber: I guess there were times when I put others first.]\n[Sofia: Yes. You do have it in you, Amber.]\n\nSofia:\nYou're the one I've counted on to stand by my side\nYou're so strong, a natural hero when you reach deep inside\n\n'Cause that's just who you are\nWe all make mistakes\nThat's just who you are\nYou've got what it takes\n\nAmber:\nYes, that is who I am\nI'll fix my mistakes\nAnd I'll come through, do all I'm meant to do\n'Cause that is who I am",
