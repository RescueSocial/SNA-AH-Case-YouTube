            "description": "(19 May 2017) BLOOM DEFENDS DEPP AT 'PIRATES' HOLLYWOOD PREMIERE\r\nOrlando Bloom defended Johnny Depp as \"one of the most private and stand-up people I've ever met\" as the fifth \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" movie held its Hollywood premiere on Thursday (18 May) at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles. \r\nDepp has faced recent scrutiny for his messy divorce from actress Amber Heard and a lawsuit filed by his former business managers that claims he fell into financial trouble due to a lavish lifestyle that cost more than $2 million a month. \r\n\"You know, listen \u2013 the man that I know and love is the man who is here tonight and is on form and does everything the right way,\" said Bloom, who starred in the first three \"Pirates\" movies with Depp. \r\n\"People go through all kinds of weird stuff in the world. And it's just a shame that it has to be dragged out into the public. Because God knows he has been one of the most private and stand-up people I've ever met.\"\r\n\"Pirates\" franchise producer Jerry Bruckheimer blamed the news media for Depp's troubles. \r\n\"Oh, he's the best. And unfortunately the media kind of picks on certain people. And it was his turn in the barrel,\" Bruckheimer said. \"But he's a fabulous guy and a great artist. And he's here and he's excited to be here for the premiere.\"\r\nThe Captain Jack Sparrow actor signed autographs and posed for selfies with fans dressed like pirates on Hollywood Boulevard. \r\n\"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales\" also stars Javier Bardem, Geoffrey Rush, Brenton Thwaites and Kaya Scodelario.  \r\nBloom's returning role as Will Turner in the new movie is small - and he acknowledged his fee for joining in hinged on showing up to the movie's premieres. \r\n\"They kind of told me I had to. It was part of the deal. It was like 'Bro, we're going to pay you this. And you're going to do two days, but you're coming to every premiere that we do. OK?' I was like, 'OK!' So \u2013 but it was great, because to be honest, we shot this 2 and a half years ago. That was a time where I was having really precious moments with my son, didn't want to really leave him,\" Bloom said. \"So when I was like, OK, I did shoot two scenes over three continents, and I was all over the place. But it's great, man. I mean, these movies \u2013 I had a nice emotional hook for my son, to send him off of the journey, and at the end I get to kiss Keira Knightley. It couldn't be worse, right? How bad could it get?\"\r\nSpanish actor Javier Bardem plays a character new to the franchise, the undead Captain Armando Salazar. \r\nHe remembers play-acting as a pirate as a child - along with being Darth Vader's spaceship. And now that he's in the Disney family, maybe there's another franchise in his sights. \r\n\"Yeah, yeah \u2013 of course. I am a kid. I'm a boy. So I remember playing \u2013 I remember playing pirate, warriors, and also I remember playing spaceship \u2013 Darth Vader's spaceship. Not Darth Vader, but the spaceship. Which is very weird for a kid,\" Bardem said. \r\n\"Yeah \u2013 the whole noise, and the whole thing. So I guess I'm trying to get into the 'Star Wars' franchise now. ... Yeah, I could do that. I know some people now.\"\r\nBrenton Thwaites plays the son of Orlando Bloom's character. \r\nHe says he's not sure if \"Pirates\" could continue as a franchise without Depp at its center. \r\n\"I mean, I think all of the fans including myself really want to see what Captain Jack Sparrow is up to you in the next movie. In this one, I think he is deeper, darker, funnier,\" Thwaites said. \r\nBoth he and co-star Kaya Scodelario became parents in the time since filming ended and the movie premiered. \r\nGeorgia     23 May 2017     \r\nDenmark 24 May 2017     \r\n\r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives \u200b\u200b\r\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/2771eeb36791205c018ef2beecb14a54",
