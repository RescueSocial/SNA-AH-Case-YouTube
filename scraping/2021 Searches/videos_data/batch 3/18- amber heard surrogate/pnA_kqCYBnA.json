            "description": "California sets Sept. 14 date for Newsom recall electionAmber Heard is putting a proudly feminist spin in sharing the news Thursday that she is celebrating the arrival of her baby daughter, Oonagh Page, reportedly born via surrogate. Among other things, Heard\u2019s news allows her to briefly put aside her ongoing legal battle with ex-husband, Johnny Depp, which has made her a regular target of rabid online vitriol from the actor\u2019s \u201c#JusticeforJohnny Depp\u201d fans. Heard\u2019s news also comes several months after winning her latest legal fight in a U. K. court, which addressed the \u201cconsiderable\u201d evidence that Depp battered her on multiple occasions during their turbulent relationship and marriage. The 35-year-old \u201cAquaman\u201d star tweeted that she was \u201cexcited\u201d to share the news that she had been able to have a baby \u201con my own terms.\u201d That is, without needing a \u201cring in order to have a crib,\u201d she said in a series of tweets. Page Six reported that Oonagh was born on April 8 with the help of a surrogate after Heard was told she would never be able to carry her own baby. Oonagh is a traditional Irish name, while Paige honors Heard\u2019s late mother. Heard said Oonagh\u2019s birth marks \u201cthe beginning of the rest of my life\u201d and explained how she decided she wanted to have a child four years ago. In addition to the reported medical issues that prevented her from carrying a baby to term, the timing may not have been on her side. Starting in 2016, she became mired in the legal fall-out of her bitter divorce from Depp. In saying she wanted to have a child on her own terms, Heard tweeted, \u201cI now appreciate how radical it is for us as women to think about one of the most fundamental parts of our destinies in this way.\u201dA friend told Page Six that \u201cAmber is besotted\u201d with Oonagh. \u201cShe always knew that she wanted to be a mom, and this is her greatest wish come true.\u201dThe source amplified Heard\u2019s effort to encourage women to talk openly about their struggles with fertility and to pursue opportunities to overcome challenges.\u201cThe most important thing for Amber is that she\u2019s open about Oonagh\u2019s birth,\u201d the Page Six source continued. \u201cThere are so many women who feel they can\u2019t talk about their fertility and are worried and embarrassed; Amber wants them to feel supported and realize that there are a multitude of ways to have a baby even if you have fertility issues.\u201dHeard is currently in a relationship with cinematographer Bianca Butti, whom she has been dating since January 2020, Page Six said. She had the baby on her own, however, and is Oonagh\u2019s sole legal parent. She is next set to star in \u201cAquaman 2.\u201dJohnny Depp, right, arrives at the High Court in London, Wednesday July 8, 2020.
