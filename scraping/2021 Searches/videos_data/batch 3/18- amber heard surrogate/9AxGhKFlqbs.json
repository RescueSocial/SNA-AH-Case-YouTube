            "description": "After a decade wait, Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3 finally released to fans in 2018. However, not all was as expected. Now a Nintendo Switch Exclusive and in the hands of developer Team Ninja, the experience is quite a bit different from the prior 2 games. In this video, we'll go back and look at every aspect of Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3. For example, we'll discuss initial fan reactions to the announcement trailer and how the game was received after release. We'll also take a very in-depth walk through the storyline of MUA3, the dlc, all the additional content, and how the game compares to the prior ones. Basically, we're talking about everything! Btw, this is a SPOILER FILLED retrospective review of the game, so make sure you've beaten the story before watching.  We have a ton to discuss, so I hope you'll join me in revisiting Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3 :)\n\nAlways Nerdy is a Youtube channel dedicated to all things nerdy and Marvel, with a focus on Marvel Gaming properties such as Marvel's Avengers and the Marvel Ultimate Alliance series.
