            "description": "This video answers the question: Are people who are married better off? We see research which further indicates that married individuals enjoy certain benefits over those who are unmarried. For example, better mental and physical health, increased happiness, and better economic position. A more detailed look into literature reveals conflicting findings around the association between marriage and happiness. We see a community of men (including the \u201cMen Going Their Own Way\u201d [MGTOW] community) and women who have decided marriage is not a good deal from a cost-benefit perspective. The relationship between marriage and happiness is actually quite complex and it underscores the importance of understand difference between correlation and causation.\n\nHawkins, D. N., & Booth, A.
