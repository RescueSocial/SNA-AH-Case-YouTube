Beth Shapiro explains the science of de-extinction and Jurassic Park, and asks if it\u2019s a good idea at all.\nSubscribe for regular science videos: http://bit.ly/RiSubscRibe\n\nBeth's book \"How to Clone a Mammoth: The Science of De-Extinction\" is available to buy now - https://geni.us/q7dE29\n\nCould extinct species, like mammoths and passenger pigeons, be brought back to life?  Beth Shapiro, evolutionary biologist and pioneer in ancient DNA research, takes us through the astonishing and controversial process of de-extinction. From deciding which species should be restored, to sequencing their genomes, to anticipating how revived populations might be overseen in the wild, Shapiro explores the extraordinary cutting-edge science that is being used to resurrect the past.\n\nBeth Shapiro is an American evolutionary molecular biologist, working as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Ecology & Evolutionary Biology at the University of California, Santa Cruz. She researches mammoths, dodos, and other extinct animals using ancient DNA and statistical models, giving us a glimpse back in time.\n\nSubscribe for regular science videos: http://bit.ly/RiSubscRibe\n\nThe Ri is on Twitter: http://twitter.com/ri_science\nand Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/royalinstitution\nand Tumblr: http://ri-science.tumblr.com/\nOur editorial policy: http://www.rigb.org/home/editorial-policy\nSubscribe for the latest science videos: http://bit.ly/RiNewsletter\n\nProduct links on this page may be affiliate links which means it won't cost you any extra but we may earn a small commission if you decide to purchase through the link.",
