            "description": "Just for a moment, put yourself in their shoes. Bruce and Denise Morcombe were like any other parents. Then their 13-year-old son, Daniel, was abducted from a bus stop on Queensland's Sunshine Coast. As days and weeks turned into years, they chased every lead - no matter how small or grim - they often scoured bushland for Daniel's body. Well, they've found their boy now, buried just 40 kilometres from home. And, finally, a man will face trial, accused of his murder. But the Morcombe's journey isn't over. They're now trying to protect other children because no one should go through the hell they've suffered.\n\nReporter: Tara Brown\nProducer: Stephen Taylor",
