            "description": "Neil Rockind is a Michigan Criminal Defense attorney and proponent of Killer Cross Examination.  The case involves an allegation of drug delivery and drug possession.  The witness claimed that our client delivered drugs to him.  Here is an excerpt of a cross examination of a cooperating witness in a recent case where I took a particular approach due to the witness\u2019s conduct on direct examination.  Rather than conduct an animated, \"fiery\" cross examination, my tactic was to remain understated and deliberate, allowing the jury's attention to remain on the witness.",
