Prosecutors say that Rittenhouse, then 17 and from Illinois, was a vigilante looking for a fight. He, like other right-wingers, went to Kenosha, Wisconsin ostensibly to protect property. This happened as protests over police shooting local man Jacob Blake turned violent. Rittenhouse\u2019s attorneys assert he was acting in self-defense.

The other is that he was closely linked to the violent, far-right Proud Boys organization.\n\nKenosha County Judge Bruce Schroeder said an appellate court would reverse him if he allowed these in trial. The evidence was too prejudicial, he said. He left it up in the air whether he would allow footage showing someone identified as Rittenhouse discussing a Black man exiting a CVS pharmacy.
