            "description": "Over the last several years, Johnny Depp has been working hard to try and clear his name in all the ways that matter. Not the least of which was that he was accused of being to his now ex-wife of Amber Heard and has been trying to show in court and in the public eye that this was false. The problem though, was that he was getting punished by various people for \"failing\" to do so, including losing key roles in key films he was meant to be a part. But now, things are changing, and he's very happy about it! We'll break it down for you.
