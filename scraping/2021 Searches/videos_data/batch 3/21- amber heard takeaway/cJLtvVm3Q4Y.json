Thank you, Barb, for taking those pictures of us together. As we go over to the answer sheet, the one picture is one of our CCO Club members, Barb, who goes to a lot of our live events that we have during the week. The other is the great ribbons that you get at the conferences when you go to a regional or a national. I kind of think those are like gold stars, they\u2019re pretty fun. \nA: The other thing that I enjoy about the conferences is the education that we get. Mind you, there were a lot of different lectures that you could attend, but some that stood out for me that I went to was one by Leonta Williams, she goes by Lee. She did Coding Inpatient 101: The Transition from Outpatient to Inpatient Coding. She specifically talked about the transition from outpatient to inpatient coding. She did it on a pretty basic level so she went over the different things in ICD-10 and PCS that we needed to be aware of. I found it an excellent, excellent lecture. \n\nPhysician Queries \u2013 This is a big thing with inpatient and now it\u2019s becoming more prominent with outpatient. So, Amber did an excellent job of giving us the rules, the steps that you could use to not lead your provider. I enjoyed that quite a bit. I\u2019ll take away the information that I got from that and share that in some of the things in the future for CCO.  \nAn additional one by Michael who is like a mainstay in all of the events, he did Risk Based Compliance Audits vs Forensic (Error) Audits - Understanding the Difference. So, risk audits versus forensic (finding errors). I really honestly didn\u2019t realize that there was much of a difference between the two, but he was able to clarify that. That was a really, really good one. \nThen, Brenda Edwards who is a fantastic speaker as well, did, Is Your Physician Ready\u2026 Coding, Communication, and Documentation. Again, this is really valuable for those coders that are in the trenches. This was just a snidbit; I don\u2019t even know how many lectures were going on at one time. I know that there were probably 10 at a time that you go to choose from and they run you through pretty quickly. \nSo, again, the education is really, really valuable and diverse that you get into both the national conferences and the regional. This was a regional conference for St. Louis. I think they just got done with one in Hawaii prior to that, now they\u2019re getting ready to do one in Utah.  \n\nRead more at the CCO Blog:",
