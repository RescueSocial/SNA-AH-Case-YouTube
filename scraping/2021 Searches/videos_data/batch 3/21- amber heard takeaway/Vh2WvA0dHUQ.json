            "title": "BISI Webinar: Professor Sami Zubaida 'Reflections on Culinary Iraq'",
            "description": "Professor Zubaida presents his childhood and boyhood memoirs of growing up in a Jewish household in Baghdad in the 1940s and early 50s, with particular reference to food and drink. The shape of the house and the kitchen, the kitchen equipment, the division of labour. Shopping, meal sequence, days of the week and seasons, weekends (Sabbath) and festivals, entertaining and conviviality. These domestic aspects will then be placed in the context of a culinary map of Iraq, regions, communities, and classes, as well as the broader Middle East.\n\nSami Zubaida: Born and schooled in Baghdad. Further schooling and higher education in England, then an academic career.
