Well, these footages just might change your mind, especially when the\nfootage is accompanied by a miracle, just like number one so stay tuned for that. Here are 10 angels\ncaught on camera.\n\nNumber 10. Angel on the Football Field\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQzuOIXqiSg\nOn November 7, 2009, Doug Luaders was set to coach a JCYA youth football game in Fenton, Missouri.\nThat very same day, a photo was taken on the field showing two smiling boys celebrating their win. But\nthe disposable camera also seemed to capture a white shadowy figure floating right alongside the\nbeaming boys.\nWhen Doug saw the photo, he was completely blown away. You see, Doug\u2019s 20-year-old son was\nsupposed to be his assistant coach that day. But on his way to the game, Kyle passed away in a horrible\ncar crash after his vehicle collided with a semi-truck. The mysterious photo became public. Doug, and\nmany others in their community and beyond, believe the white angelic figure was Kyle, who was on his\nway to the very football field where the picture was taken.\nI hate being cynical, and I\u2019m happy that Doug found a certain level of solace on the photo, especially for\nwhat happened to his son. But then again, is it just me or does the \u201cangel\u201d look more like a blurred\nextreme close up of a mosquito? Believe whatever you want to believe I guess.\n\nNumber 9. In-flight Angel\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bK_cpftcrI\nSeven-year-old AAsher Lisles dreams of being a famous photographer. Every time he sees his mom\nholding her phone, he immediately takes it and starts taking photos. He takes some great photos, mostly\nof random things. But one photo he took while on a plane ride home from Washington may just make\nhis dreams come true.\nAAsher, who was born with Down Syndrome hence the two uppercase A\u2019s on his name which, according\nto his mom, represents the extra chromosome, which is quite clever I must say, was with his mom on\nthe plane ride home from visiting his older brother. There was a lot of turbulence at the time, during\nwhich AAsher asked for his mom\u2019s phone and started taking pictures.\nWhen Kerri, AAsher\u2019s mom, got her phone back, she started going through the photos her son took,\neven deleting some of them. But when she got to this particular photo, she was dumbfounded.\nHonestly, it took me off guard as well so I\u2019d rather you just look at it for yourself than describe it.\nKerri thinks it\u2019s Asher\u2019s guardian angel looking after him while in flight. But what do you think?\nComment down below.\n\nNumber 8. Angel in Ghana\n\n\nDo you believe everything you see in the news? If your answer is yes, then this next news clip will\ndefinitely make you believe in angels.\nA Ghanaian News Channel reported on a strange sighting in Dansoman, Ghana. In a segment called \u201can\nencounter with the dead\u201d, a man was telling a story of a very strange event that happened to him. He\nsaid that he saw, and was able to film, a strange flying creature frolicking in the clouds above him. This\ncreature, which he believes to be an angel, can be seen flying in and out of the dark clouds, as if playing.\nAgain, of course, the footage is very grainy and the flying creature could be anything. It could even be a\nhoax for all we know. But then again, if the story was good enough for Ghana\u2019s national TV, then there\njust might be something to this very strange sighting\n\nNumber 7. The Mosque Angel\n\nMost people think that angels only exist in Christian religions. But the fact is, they appear in the stories\nof many religions around the world. Angels play a major role in Islamic religions. According to their\nreligion Allah sends the angels to every Mosque to shower his blessings on the people. Islamic belief in\nangels is so prevalent that any paranormal activity seen in mosques are almost always attributed to\nangels of Allah. This clip is no exception.\nMuslims offering prayers at a Mosque in Azerbaijan were surprised by what they described as an \u2018Angel\nGhost\u2019 offering prayers. Some were convinced that it was an angel and others believed it to be a ghost.\nThey preferred the Angel approach as it appeared to be praying, and they believe that a ghost cannot\noffer prayers but an angel can.\nThe video was shot using a phone, hence its grainy quality, making others think that the so-called angel\nmay be a trick of the light. But then again, if said video strengthens someone\u2019s faith and its effect os\noverall positive, it doesn\u2019t really matter if it\u2019s real or not, does it?",
