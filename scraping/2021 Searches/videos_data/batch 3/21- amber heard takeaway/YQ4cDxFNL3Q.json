            "description": "Washington Post journalists who covered the 2020 campaign reveal their top takeaways and preview what to watch for in 2021.\n\nPolitics and accountability anchor Libby Casey interviews thirty-six colleagues about their work, including political reporters assigned to cover the campaign, the Washington Post\u2019s director of polling, and The Washington Post Fact Checker. They talk about the challenges facing President-elect Joe Biden to unite and run the country, questions surrounding the future of both the Democratic and Republican parties, and the need for Vice President-elect Kamala Harris to show Americans what she offers to the electorate. \n\nThe Washington Post journalists also focus on President Donald Trump and his continued role defining the Republican Party, even after he leaves office on January 20th, 2021. The journalists share their goals going forward, including closely covering Hispanic and Asian voter registration, and why the \u201cyouthquake\u201d predicted by Bernie Sanders didn\u2019t turn out at the polls. They also discuss their concerns about misinformation and the country\u2019s divisions. The team digs into polling and discusses how it should be used in political coverage. Libby Casey also asks how the reporters did their jobs amid the coronavirus pandemic, which restricted travel and meeting with voters. \n\nFeaturing: Dan Balz, Philip Rucker, Eugene Scott, Arelis Hern\u00e1ndez, Amber Phillips, Cleve Wootson, David Weigel, Jacqueline Alemany, JM Rieger, Michael Scherer, Robert Costa, Tom Hamburger, Martine Powers, Lenny Bronner, Emma Brown, Scott Clement, Rhonda Colvin, Matt Viser, Karen Tumulty, David Fahrenthold, Glenn Kessler, Michelle Ye Hee Lee, Jose Del Real, Joyce Koh, Chelsea Janes, Vanessa Williams, Amy Gardner, Aaron Blake, Caroline Kitchener, Jeremy Bowers, Colby Itkowitz, Philip Bump, James Hohmann, Annie Linskey, Ashley Parker, and Amy Wang. \n\nFollow us:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/washingtonpost\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/washingtonpost/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost/\n\nSubscribe to The Washington Post on YouTube: https://wapo.st/2QOdcqK\n\n#washingtonpost #journalism #2020takeaways",
