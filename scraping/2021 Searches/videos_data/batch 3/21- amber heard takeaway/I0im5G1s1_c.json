            "description": "SUVs and trucks took over the car market long ago, now everyone wants to make luxury SUVs. The Maserati Levante is the perfect example of the me too SUV. Tons of off the shelf Dodge parts, thrown together on an existing platform, then sold with mild to wild price points. You can pick up a brand new Levante for anywhere between 87 and 200 thousand dollars. I borrowed this 2017 Levante S from Walser Audi of Wichita to review it, and decide if it fits into the new Turo rental fleet. After driving it, I'm less sure than I was just thinking about it.
