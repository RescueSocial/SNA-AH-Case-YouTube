            "description": "Today Amber Heard first statement on social media after confirming she did not donate the 7 million (even lied under oath) ended up being a victim mentality post. She is a joke. Imagine lying to the public for the past 4 years then posting about being hated for lying. Like girl, get off of social media if you have a problem with people hating you for the horrible things you've done.\n\nThe only person Amber cares about is herself. She is still on this witch hunt to prove Johnny is behind the hated online which he is not. \n\nI am not a bot, I'm not even really a Johnny Depp stan. I see the discrimination going on and I know abuse has no gender. \n\nThis is an opinion video, so always go do your own research and tell me your opinion.\nDon't forget to sign up!\nhttps://www.change.org/p/dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2",
