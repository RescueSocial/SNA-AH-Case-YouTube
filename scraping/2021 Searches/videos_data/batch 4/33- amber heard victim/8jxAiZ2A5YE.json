I have travelled the world extensively demonstrating my extraordinary ability to thousands during live shows, private readings, and YouTube videos, where anything can happen and shockingly detailed. I have scared myself at times with the level of accuracy I deliver, check out my past videos. I am fascinated by Meghan and Harry's antics since they departed the royal family. That is why I started my YouTube channel and of course it demonstrates my ability to give extraordinary insight into Meghan and Harry\u2019s lives. They are ideal material for such talented psychics because you never know what is coming next and you certainly cannot predict them unless of course you are watching my videos! \nSince launching my channel September 2020, I have been amazed at the level of views and subscriptions I have received in such a short time, my channel may be new but as a psychic I have been reading professionally for over 30 years, so I thank you so much for your lovely comments and clicks!!!! As you can see my channel continues to evolve as do my technical skills. Anyone will know that editing and running a YouTube channel is very time consuming and quite hard work at times, but I absolutely love it, I really do!! Very kindly I have had more than a few requests to attach a link so you can buy me a coffee??? I felt uncomfortable at first, but the truth is I have some wonderful subscribers who see me as a new friend. You feel like you are getting to know me, as I do you. I listen to my subscribers, and I love to interact with you through my videos, live chat, and comments so even though it makes me a little uncomfortable to accept a coffee, apparently it makes you feel good. For a lot of viewers, you will no doubt be in some financial difficulty, and I am afraid buying me a coffee will not bring you financial gain. Other less reputable psychics will claim if you donate you will get thousands back in karma. Life doesn\u2019t work like that unfortunately, otherwise I\u2019d be a rich woman. Keep your money to yourself. A nice comment from you will suffice and feels just as good. Now for those wanting to buy me a coffee- I do not drink fancy coffees! However due to a medical condition that makes my mouth goes extremely dry (you can tell in my videos sometimes) I love nothing more than a sugar free slush puppy. As I drink quite a lot, I\u2019ve gone off certain cordials and juices, but I always enjoy a slush puppy\u2026. So, here\u2019s the link guys.\nhttps://www.PayPal.me/guesswhat45\nbut I stress it\u2019s not necessary, so I thank you endlessly from the bottom of my heart x. \n** Please note, all opinions expressed are my own.
