The pregnant woman is followed home by the rider and other witnesses before she's shot dead in the street after reportedly getting a gun from her house (2:13). No one is charged in the case.\nAnd a New Jersey cop is arrested after allegedly killing a pedestrian in a traffic crash, leaving the scene, then returning to retrieve the victim's body, bringing it home to mom's house, then bringing the body back, where police arrest him at the scene (28:38). He and his mother and a passenger are facing charges.\nAttorney Phillip C. Hamilton joins host Ana Garcia.\n\nPhillip C.
