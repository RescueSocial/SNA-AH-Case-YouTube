He is the eldest of the four actor brothers in the Baldwin family. The actor said he did not pull the trigger and dispatch Hutchins, 42, and injured Souza, 48. The firearm he was holding, which Baldwin believed to be safe, went off during rehearsals for the western. This action was not in the Rust script. The incident shocked Hollywood and prompted a reckoning over production safety and the use of weapons on set. Baldwin responded to comments by fellow actors, such as George Clooney, who said they checked weapons themselves, saying: \u201cThere were a lot of people who felt it necessary to contribute some comment to the situation\" \"My protocol was to trust the person that had the job.\u201d\n\nThe Behavior Panel is a group made up of the world's top body language and behavior experts, Mark Bowden, Scott Rouse, Greg Hartley, and Chase Hughes.
