            "description": "Amber Heard was got caught lying. Do you think she should deserve second chance. These celebrities caught her lying. Find out more about watching the video.\n\n\nFamous film and television actress Amber Heard is being called out for lying on numerous occasions by various celebrities. One such celebrity is her ex-husband and Golden Globe winner Johnny Depp. \u201cThe Pirates of the Caribbean\u201d actor who sees himself drawn towards controversies and legal battles had once filed a 50 million defamation case against ex-wife Amber Heard at the time of their divorce. According to sources, the defamation case has witnessed some recent happenings wherein Depp and his team has issued a legal notice to Amber Heard\u2019s ex-boyfriend and one of the richest space enthusiasts in the world, Elon Musk.\n1- One of these well-wishers is Vanessa Paradis, the former partner of Johnny Depp who was the first celebrity to openly support Depp and expressed her doubts regarding Amber\u2019s allegations in May 2020 wherein she accused Johnny of being extremely violent. She even supported Depp\u2019s defamation case against Heard by issuing a statement. In that statement, she claimed that she has known Johnny for 25 years and has never faced a problem with him. She also stated that Johnny has always been a reverent and caring partner to her and a doting father to their two children. Vanessa also went on to call Amber\u2019s allegations against Depp to be completely false and baseless.\n2- Winona Ryder too, another former partner of Johnny Depp came forward to publish a declaration in support of him in the matter. Ryder clarified that Amber has been unreasonable with her allegations and the Johnny that she has known for so many years, is not even one percent close to what Amber falsely described him as. Winona has always considered him as his closest friend, more like family and thus, she knows him better than anyone else. This would make her the perfect person to testify in favor of Johnny since she knows that he is innocent and far from being violent or abusive.\n\nJohnny Depp fans have not wasted a single minute to come out in support of their favourite star as soon as this controversy came into limelight. His fans tweeted that they cannot wait for Depp to get justice and strict action to be taken against Amber. Not only the fans, even celebrities and colleagues have shown their support to Johnny Depp, implying that they know him personally and he has never had wrong intentions. During the two-year marriage of Depp and Heard, Depp was often shown in bad light by the media but his well-wishers knew better and never left his side.\n3- Sharon Osbourne is a celebrity who is known to have no filters in her mouth and speaks her heart out without any hesitation and fear of judgement. In an interview in November 2020, Sharon suggested that according to her, Amber should have been scrutinized and blamed equally by the media for this entire situation as a marriage is supposed to be a two-way street. She believed that Amber should stop playing the victim card even though she was at fault in numerous situations. Sharon also drew a comparison between the relationship of Johnny and Amber and her relationship with her husband Ozzy Osbourne.\n\nSo, will Johnny be able to prove that Amber has been lying all this while or is it ultimately both of them who are responsible for this chaos equally? Only time will tell.\nThat\u2019s all for today. I hope you liked the video.
