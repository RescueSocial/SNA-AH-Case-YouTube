She was arrested for assaulting her partner before Johnny, and she should be in prison right now for what she did to him.\n\nAfter she chopped off part of Depp's finger, which thankfully they were able to reattach, he got MRSA twice and was in serious danger. It is really sad the way society turns a blind eye to male victims of domestic abuse.\n\nI'm disgusted to find out that she is getting additional screen time as Mera in the Justice League Snyder Cut. She shouldn't be portrayed in films as some sort of hero for young girls to look up to. She shouldn't be in films at all. She should be in jail.\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\n\"You can please tell people that it was a fair fight, and see what the jury and judge thinks. Tell the world, Johnny, tell them Johnny Depp, I Johnny Depp, a man, I'm a victim too of domestic violence.. and see how many people believe or side with you.\"\n-Amber Heard\n\n#JusticeForJohnnyDepp\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\n1 in 4 men have been physically assaulted by an intimate partner at least once in their lifetimes (slapped, shoved, etc).\n(Approximately 40 million men)\n\n1 in 7 men have been SEVERELY attacked by an intimate partner at least once in their lifetimes (shot, stabbed, burned, choked, etc).\n(Approximately 23 million men)\n\nNearly half of all men have experienced psychological abuse from an intimate partner (threats, stalking, manipulation, humiliation, economic exploitation, etc).\n\n(USA numbers) Male domestic abuse goes mostly unreported because of the social stigma attached to it, but it's almost a certainty that you know at least one man who has been a victim of it.
