            "description": "Amberlynn Reid's audience is often frustrated by her lack of accountability. She has a tendency to make excuses, blame other people and seemingly does not take responsibility for her actions - while simultaneously looking for sympathy.\n\nThis has lead to her being accused of possessing a \"victim-mentality,\" even earning her the nickname \"Victimlynn\".\n\nIn this video we'll be discussing what the victim mentality is, where we can see it in Amberlynn Reid, and how it might be sabotaging any hope Amberlynn has at succeeding on her weight loss journey.\n\nWe cover Amberlynn Reid's general attitude toward her audience, the moment she quits Optavia, the \"Binge Monster\", 100 days of uploading, and most importantly the toxic mindset standing between Amberlynn and her health.\n\nMy hope is that with a greater understanding of the mindset and psychology of weight loss we all might be able to learn how to manage our weight and the obesity epidemic more effectively.\n\nWe all have a tendency to make excuses and rationalize away things we don't like - but ultimately the more we take ownership of our actions the more power we possess to change our behavior.\n\nThanks for watching - let me know if you have any suggestions for my future videos!\n\nSong: Puddles - Stanley Gurvich\n#AmberlynnReid #weightloss",
