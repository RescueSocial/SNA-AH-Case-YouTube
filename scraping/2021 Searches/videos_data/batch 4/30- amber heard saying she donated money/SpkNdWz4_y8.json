            "description": "Amber Heard's Sister EXPOSES Her For Lying! \nSince Johnny Depp's attorneys provided video recordings of his ex-wife being abusive against her in his libel suit towards a British tabloid, Amber Heard's sister denied lying before a London judge. On Thursday night, his legal team got the video from a \"confidential\" source, just hours after Whitney Henriquez testified in court that she had never been targeted by Heard and was not afraid of her.\n\nDepp, 57, is suing News Group Newspapers, the publisher of The Sun, and Dan Wootton, the newspaper's executive editor, for calling him a \"wife be*ter\" in an April 2018 post. Depp has testified in court that he was the one who was harassed by Heard and that she has a history of violence against him.\n\n\ud83d\udc97 Hope you liked the video and would consider leaving a like and telling us what you thought in the comments!\n\nHere on Viral League we are all about the latest celebrity drama!
