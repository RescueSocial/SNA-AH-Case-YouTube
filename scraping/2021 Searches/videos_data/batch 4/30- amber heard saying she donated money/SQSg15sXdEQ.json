            "description": "This video answers the questions: Are they ways to counter-manipulate a narcissist? Are there ways to keep the peace with a narcissist?\n\nNarcissism:\n\nThere are two types of narcissism: With grandiose narcissism we see characteristics like being extroverted, socially bold, self-confident, having a superficial charm, being resistant to criticism, and being callous and unemotional. Vulnerable narcissism is characterized by shame, anger, aggression, hypersensitivity, a tendency to be introverted, defensive, avoidant, anxious, depressed, socially awkward, and shy.\n\nNarcissistic personality disorder is a Cluster B personality disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual. It has nine symptom criteria, five of which are required for a diagnosis.\n\n1: Grandiose sense of self-importance \n2: Fantasies \n3: Special or unique\n4: Requires excessive admiration \n5: Sense of entitlement \n6: Manipulative \n7: Lacks empathy for others \n8: Often envious \n9: Arrogant attitudes or behaviors\n\nAmerican Psychiatric Association.
