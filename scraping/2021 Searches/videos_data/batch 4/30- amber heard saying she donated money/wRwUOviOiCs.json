I would like you to cover this in a future topic.\" Well Jake thanks for the donation and topic request. I'll cover it in just a sec but let me first tell everyone about today's sponsor ABC Circuits: Anyways, now back with the show. first let me read some of the quotes from the conversation so that everyone knows what happened and I quote: \"\u201cAfter you got f\u2014ing physically violent with me . . . I texted Travis and I said: \u2018Come up here,'\u201d Depp says in the recording. \u201cI know! Come and save me,\u201d Heard says, mocking Depp. \u201cContinue . . . Travis to the rescue.\u201d \u201cCome what? Save me? That was the last one,\u201d Depp says. \u201cYou can go.\u201d At another point in the conversation, Depp says: \u201cI told you to tell Travis that you punched me in the f\u2014ing face, and you said, \u2018No, I didn\u2019t, what the f\u2013k are you talking about?\" \u201cI didn\u2019t punch you, by the way,\u201d Heard interjects. \u201cI\u2019m sorry that I didn\u2019t hit you across the face in a proper slap but I was hitting you. It was not punching you. \u201cBabe, you\u2019re not punched . . I don\u2019t know what the motion of my actual hand was, but you\u2019re fine. I did not hurt you, I did not punch you; I was hitting you.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t tell me what it feels like to be punched when you f\u2014ing have a closed fist\u201d says Depp. Then she fires back by saying \u201cYou didn\u2019t get punched. You got hit. I\u2019m sorry I hit you like this but I didn\u2019t punch you. You didn\u2019t get f\u2014ing decked. I f\u2014ing was hitting you,\u201d Heard tells Depp. \u201cYou\u2019re a f\u2014ing baby. You\u2019re such a baby,\u201d Heard says. Depp asks: \u201cBecause you start physical fights?\u201d At another point in the recording, Depp says: \u201cI do not want to leave you. I do not want a divorce, I do not want you out of my life. I just want peace. If things get physical, we have to separate.\u201d Heard says she can\u2019t promise she will \u201cbe perfect. I can\u2019t promise you I won\u2019t get physical again.\u201d \u201cGod, I f\u2014ing \u2014 sometimes, I get so mad I lose it. I can f\u2014ing promise you I will do everything to change. I promise you. I\u2019m not going to throw around divorce,\u201d she says. \u201cI love you and I want you to be my wife. And I want to be your husband,\u201d Depp responds. \u201cAnd I wanna be a good husband. If I haven\u2019t been, I\u2019ll do everything I can to find out how to be a good husband.\u201d Depp\u2019s lawyer told USA Today that Heard \u201crecorded her conversations with Depp.\u201d unquote. If you want to read more juicy tidbits to prove to yourself that the juice isn't worth the squeeze then follow the link down below. As for the fight between Heard and Depp she's obviously using shaming language by calling him a baby. I guess she's trying to tell him that if he were a real man he would be able to take some hitting, not punching from a woman. But he's a baby so it's just too much for him. He fights back by using logic back when she calls him a baby by asking her how he's a baby when she's the one that starts fights? He forgot the one main rule of relationships. You can't argue with crazy. Depp has already been in relationships without a break since 1983.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9 images licensed and paid for through BigStock.com.
