            "description": "Just days after Amber Heard and Johnny Depp reached an agreement in their divorce, the actress now claims to have plans on putting her entire 7 million dollar settlement to donation...\r\n...Amber explains that her donation will be divided equally between the ACLU, with a particular focus to stop violence against women, and the Children's Hospital of Los Angeles, where she has worked as a volunteer for the past 10 years alongside organizations like the Art of Elysium. Let\u0092s hope she sticks to her word!\r\nThe Voice's 11th season doesn't begin until September 19th 2016, but fans will get to see a sneak peek of the new coaches in action much earlier than that on NBC on August 21st, 2016. Miley Cyrus and Alicia Keys will be coaching for season 11 and word has it that the two have become 'best buds' to each other. The sneak peak also covers performances by Miley and Alicia themselves and fans are super-psyched!\r\n90s kids, prepare for two of your dreams merged into one. The New Kids On The Block boyband will be guest starring in Fuller House season 2! An epic blast from the past! In addition to that, fans can expect more surprises in season 2 with several other guest stars from old 90s sitcoms. Fuller House season 2 is set to premier later this 2016.",
