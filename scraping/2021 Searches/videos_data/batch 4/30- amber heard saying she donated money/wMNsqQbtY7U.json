            "description": "After Chad Wild Clay made the video \"WHO is LIVING UNDER My HOUSE! 24 Hour Extreme Hide and Seek Prop Hunt Obstacle Course Finds Mystery!\", Vy Qwaint created \"MELVIN VANISHED! Chad & Vy Trapped Underground Hatch Escape Room for 24 Hours Extreme Hide and Seek\" and Daniel uploaded \"MELVIN QUIT SPY NINJAS! Spending 24 Hours Spying on Hacker PZ9 Last to Leave Friends Challenge\" to the Exposing Project Zorgo YouTube channel, Chad and Vy explored underneath the underground secret hidden tunnel hatch that is in Regina's mystery room. We realized there was a door the led to another mysterious room! It was filled with weird clues and even an old 1980's Mac computer! Suddenly a hacker girl jumped out and scared us! We call her Hatch Girl. She was living underneath our safe house this whole time? Then she ran away and we had to chase her down! Melvin is missing and for some reason betrayed the Spy Ninjas. He took off his watch Daniel gave him and challenged him to a Battle Royale. Suddenly Hatch Girl won the challenge and defeated Melvin! Melvin is being like his old PZ9 self from Project Zorgo! Melvin decided to quit and leave the Spy Ninja safe house. We then did a lie detector test on Hatch Girl to see what her name was. We want to do a face reveal and unmasking on her too! We then decided to create a Spy Ninja rap official music video song about Melvin.
