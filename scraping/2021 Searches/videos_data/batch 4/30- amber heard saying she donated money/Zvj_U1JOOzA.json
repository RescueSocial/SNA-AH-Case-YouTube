Since then they've released a ton of music including a high profile mixtape with Pouya and their online following has increased rapidly. They just came into town on tour a few days ago and I was able to get them to come through the ONSOMESHIT store for an in depth interview in which we talked about some hard hitting stuff, namely race, religion and drug addiction. Incredibly, Pouya and Fat Nick showed up towards the end of the interview which was the first time these guys ever met him and we got Pouya to say a few words about them as well. I'm hyped on this interview and I hope everyone enjoys it!\n\nFollow everybody involved on Twitter:\n\n@suicidechrist\n@suicideleopard\n@onsomeshit\n@nojumperdotcom\n\nAnd make sure you follow Suicide Boys and No Jumper on Soundcloud:\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/g59\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/nojumper-1\n\n00:00 Drugs\n02:00 Lil Wayne\n04:00 New Orleans and being white\n08:00 Cousins\n09:00 Punk\n12:00 DJing\n17:00 Working sucks\n22:00 Creative process\n26:30 Black Smurf\n28:50 Pouya\n33:20 What influenced your style\n37:30 Drugs\n49:30 Advice to kids regarding drugs\n52:00 Religion\n1:00:00 Suicide?\n1:03:30 Tour\n1:06:00 Tattoos\n1:08:20 The n word and racism\n1:18:00 Pouya and Fat Nick show up\n1:22:00 Bleached assholes",
