            "description": "#JohnnyDeppAmberHeard #DoctorSoup\nAmber Heard in my opinion is a very big liar. It appears that Heard may have POSSIBLY(NOT confirmed) been inspired by the makeup done on her, for Zombieland, for her fake injuries. She alleged Depp injured her and threw a phone her. Johnny Depp has NO history at all of violence--yet Amber Heard continues to want to perpetrate this. \nCHARITY LINK: https://www.pledge.to/art-of-elysium-charity-stream-6744\nTWITTER: iAmDrSoup\nINSTAGRAM: ShelbyYoutube3",
