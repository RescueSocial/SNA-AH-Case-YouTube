You guessed it right, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard, courtesy of their messy, very messy, public divorce. Today, we\u2019re going to break down how Amber Heard was her own worst enemy, and ultimately destroyed her own career. \nLet\u2019s jump into it!\n\n\nClick For Spiciest Gossip\ud83c\udf36\ufe0f - https://cutt.ly/rxESG5f\n\nNewest Content By Poppin \n1]Bridgerton Season 2 - Details You Need To Know!\nhttps://youtu.be/_i2Rl3JpG6g\n\n2]iCarly Reboot - Who Are These 2 Brand New Cast Members?\nhttps://youtu.be/Hc0nSZZ0OTg\n\nSimilar Videos\n1]How Amber Heard Destroyed Her Own Career\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qHw0PtrdQI&ab_channel=ThisHappened\n\n2]How Amber Heard Destroyed Her Own Career\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEfWUbRfFR8&ab_channel=BingeWatch\n\n\nThe actress began her career in 2003 and saw her ratings improve during her married years. She got big films like Magic Mike XXL, Danish Girl, and Adderall Diaries. She was also cast on television and played a guest role in some shows.\n\nAmber Heard was initially told by her friends and family that an acting career would mean that she would have to sacrifice a lot. In fact, Amber was told not to come out as bisexual because people in the limelight often face backlash for not being straight. However, she held her ground, kept courage, and came out.\nBut, honestly speaking, not many people knew who Amber Heard was. Many film stars from the industry have also claimed of not knowing her until her infamous divorce case was the talk of the town. \n\nLike we said earlier, her marriage boosted her acting career, and landed her some pretty sweet deals. Let\u2019s look at some of the roles she landed. \n\nWell, for starters she was hired by the Warner Bros to play the role of Mera in Aquaman which was such a big deal for her as she had been playing smaller roles till then. This was also accompanied by her being the spokesperson of Loreal Paris, the world-renowned cosmetics brand. \n\nAlongside these major milestones she hit, she was also appointed as the ambassador for women\u2019s rights at ACLU. She also pledged half of her divorce settlement to the group. Those were truly some major accomplishments for her after her not-so-great kickstart in Hollywood!\n\nInitially, when news broke out about the divorce, and Amber\u2019s claims of domestic abuse, everyone was in favor of Amber and stood by her side, showering their support. In reality, she made a fool out of the public and her peers by playing the role of the victim. It was just a matter of time before the tables had turned and the truth was finally out about how Johnny wasn\u2019t as bad as he was portrayed by her and in fact, he was the victim himself.\n\nNow, how exactly did Amber\u2019s career come crashing down?\nThe truth about her defaming Johnny Depp, along with various other titbits of information led to media companies thinking twice before hiring her. For starters, the messy divorce proceedings and unwarranted drama almost cost her one of her major roles as Mera in the DC movie Aquaman, whose decision is still pending. \nNot only is this at stake but also placed her on the verge of losing the contract that she had with L\u2019oreal Paris. To make things worse, the promised donations that she had to make to the ACLU body, were allegedly never received. \n\nA funny twist to all these events is that she was a part of the ACLU community and was one who many times spoke against gender-related discrimination and crimes. Now, that\u2019s a total maneuver!\n\nSo, what exactly caused her career to come crashing down?\nNot going to lie, but all the virtual rotten tomatoes that are being thrown at her by the public after the truth about her actions was out, was completely her fault. Amber Heard had strategically planned all her moves carefully all along. \n\nShe had the prime goal of ruining Johnny\u2019s life as well as career, probably for his money as he was once worth 400 million dollars which kept deteriorating till it touched 150 million dollars as of now and is still dwindling due to the massive amounts he has to pay towards the lawsuit. \n\nDoesn\u2019t seem fair that all the backlash has to be borne by him, right?",
