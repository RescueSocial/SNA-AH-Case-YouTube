Fans took to Twitter to say;\n\nI\u2019m loving Blac Chyna as a music artist! I\u2019m getting my life!I don\u2019t know why I\u2019ve had Blac Chyna\u2019s Hollywood song in my head lately. It\u2019s catchy lol. \n\nHowever, we were quick to note that this new hit also seems to be hinting at her troubles in Hollywood and in the entertainment industry.Chyna\u2019s newest single is all about the model\u2019s glamorous world of Los Angeles and her possible new love interest. Here are some of the lyrics from her new song, Hollywood:\n\nThere\u2019s a shy boy lives on my street. He called me movies star. Got me a bougie pair of dark sunglasses. Wear \u2018em till the sun goes down on the car. Drivin\u2019 to Hollywood. I wish I could stay. Drivin\u2019 to Hollywood. Get out of the way.\n\nThroughout the video, Chyna is seen driving around town with pink and colorful outfits and with a new man on her mind. While this music video doesn\u2019t call out the Kardashians directly, Chyna does give out some hints throughout the music video.Chyna has also sprinkled in some inspirational messages in her song to let everyone know that she\u2019s okay despite all the legal lawsuits surrounding her. Some of these messages include:\n\nNever stop dreaming and live colorfully.\n\nThe music video also ends on a questionable note. By the end of the music video, we see Chyna park her car and walk away from the scene while someone opens the door to the passenger\u2019s side of the car. And at the end, we get a \u201cto be continued\u201d message on screen.Could this be a sign that Chyna is planning on leaving Hollywood once the lawsuits are over? Or maybe it\u2019s a sign that the mother of two still has a few surprises left for the Kardashian-Jenner clan.While we wait for the part two of Chyna\u2019s video, let\u2019s look at how the beef between Chyna and the Kardashians started.\n\nAccording to Chyna\u2019s personal attorney, the Kardashian family has been on a mission to destroy Chyna\u2019s career. As you all know, Rob and Chyna created a spin off show from the KUWTK show. This new spin-off show focuses on Rob and Chyna\u2019s lives. The show had a good following and lots of memorable moments for the two but was suddenly cancelled by Entertainment Tonight.Chyna went ahead to file a lawsuit against the production team and the network claiming that it was Kris Jenner who ultimately pulled the plug on the reality show.The second season of Rob and Chyna which did not air was especially important to Chyna since it showed the couple in a much better light. From working on their relationship together to taking care of their daughter, Dream, Chyna demanded the release of the footage for the public to see. \n\nAmong Chyna\u2019s allegations is a claim that Kris Jenner, Kim Kardashian, Khloe Kardashian and Kylie Jenner secretly defamed Chyna and illegally interfered with Chyna\u2019s highly lucrative content with the E! Network/NBCUniversal. Their alleged illegal interference caused the cancellation of Rob & Chyna. Bunim/Murray must produce the unaired season 2 of Rob & Chyna and KUWTK footage to Chyna within 45 days. The judge also ruled that unaired footage from KUWTK filmed in March 2017 must also be handed over. The unaired KUWTK footage shows Chyna and Rob working on their relationship and co-parenting their daughter, Dream Kardashian.\n\nChyna seems to be winning the court cases against the Kardashian-Jenner clan since three judges are already siding with her.Her attorney continued to reveal that:\n\nThe evidence reportedly corroborated Chyna\u2019s claim that Kris Jenner who is often called a momager, lied about an accusation that Chyna beat the s* out of Rob\u2019s face, then used that alleged fabrication to get the show canceled. \n\n#BluffCentral #BlacChyna #KUTK #RobKardashian #BlacChynaRobKardashian #BlacChynaHollywood #Hollywood",
