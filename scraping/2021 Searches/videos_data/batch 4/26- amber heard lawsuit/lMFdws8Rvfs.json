However, as grown-ups, we quickly realized that some of these toys were not the best role models for children. While some could have a bad influence and others were offensive, we were shocked to see a toy that was clearly dangerous. This is why we are showing you the 10 Most Inappropriate Barbie Dolls That Actually Exist. \n\nThe Oreo Barbie was created after a partnership with Mattel and Oreo. Everyone loves those cookies, but the company didn\u2019t know that it had a whole different meaning that was really offensive. That\u2019s because \u201cOreo\u201d is also a slang for black people who act white and forget their culture. And you shouldn\u2019t take it as a compliment when someone tells you that you are black on the outside and white on the inside.\n\nTattoos are becoming more and more common nowadays. But parents didn\u2019t think that they would find it on the dolls that their kids are playing with. These were only temporary tattoos but some grown-ups think that these toys encouraged children to get tattoos even though they were way too young. And those who weren\u2019t shocked yet just couldn\u2019t believe that a really inappropriate tattoo was part of the toy.\n\nStay tuned to hear more about the most inappropriate Barbie dolls that actually exist including the Teen Talk Barbie, the Barbie Video Girl, the Barbie Happy Family, the Barbie in a wheelchair, the Mexican Barbie, and more. Which doll do you think was the most inappropriate? Don\u2019t be shy to answer in the comments section down below. We love to hear what you think. \n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOur Social Media:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheThingscom/\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFor more videos and articles visit:\nhttp://www.thethings.com/",
