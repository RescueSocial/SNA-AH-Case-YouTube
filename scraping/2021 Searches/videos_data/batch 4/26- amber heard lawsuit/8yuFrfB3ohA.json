            "description": "Warner Bros. is \u201cfreaking out\u201d over its hit Harry Potter movie franchise\u2019s connection to Johnny Depp after Amber Heard\u2018s new court documents described in painstaking detail how he allegedly beat, choked and tormented her during their relationship, sources told The Post on Friday. \nDepp \u2014 who denies abusing Heard \u2014 is slated to star in \u201cFantastic Beasts 3,\u201d the next installment of J.K.Rowling\u2018s Harry Potter movies. The script has been completed, although filming, which was due to start this summer, has been delayed to the fall of next year. \n\u201cExecutives at Warner Bros. are wondering how to deal with the backlash of the Depp matter on the Harry Potter franchise,\u201d a source said. \u201cHigh-level female execs at the studio are extremely worried about working with Depp and the message it sends to the public, especially after the recent sordid departure of CEO Kevin Tsujihara,\u201d who last month announced he was leaving amid a casting couch scandal. \nELON MUSK SUBPOENAED IN JOHNNY DEPP LAWSUIT AGAINST AMBER HEARD \n\u201cThis is yet another blow to the morale of female employees at the studio,\u201d the source said. \u201cIf Warner Bros. continues to stick by Depp, it would reveal a lot about the values the company holds.\u201d \nWhile reps at Warner Bros. didn\u2019t respond to multiple requests for comment from The Post, insiders said executives are unsure how to proceed, since author J.K. Rowling came out strongly in support of Depp\u2019s casting in a previous Potter flick in 2017 after his marriage to Heard crumbled. \nVideo\n\u201cMany at Warner Bros. wish that Rowling hadn\u2019t come out so strongly behind Depp, because having made her opinion so public boxes them into a corner,\u201d a source said. \nRowling broke her silence on the controversy surrounding Depp\u2019s casting as the villain Grindelwald when she wrote on her website in December 2017, \u201cWhen Johnny Depp was cast as Grindelwald, I thought he\u2019d be wonderful in the role. However, around the time of filming his cameo in the first movie, stories had appeared in the press that deeply concerned me and everyone most closely involved in the franchise. \nJOHNNY DEPP SUES AMBER HEARD FOR $50 MILLION, SAYS SHE CHEATED ON HIM WITH ELON MUSK \n\u201cHarry Potter fans had legitimate questions and concerns about our choice to continue with Johnny Depp in the role. As David Yates, long-time Potter director, has already said, we naturally considered the possibility of recasting. I understand why some have been confused and angry about why that didn\u2019t happen.\u201d \nRowling added that while \u201cthe huge, mutually supportive community that has grown up around Harry Potter is one of the greatest joys of my life,\u201d she found it \u201cdifficult, frustrating and at times painful\u201d to remain silent on the Depp issue. \nReferring to Depp and Heard\u2019s divorce agreement, she added, \u201cHowever, the agreements that have been put in place to protect the privacy of two people, both of whom have expressed a desire to get on with their lives, must be respected.
