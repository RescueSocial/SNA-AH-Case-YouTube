            "description": "Steve-O Reacts To Bam Margera Arrested After New Lawsuit... (REAL FOOTAGE)!?\nThere is a lot going on right now with the movie Jackass Forever, and not exactly in the good way. Because there are two different people trying to file suit against the film for various reasons. One of them is PETA believe it or not. Who are furious at the fact that the movie goes and uses animals in ways that are harmful to them and are even forced to do damage to the guys in the film. But even more pressing is the matter of Bam Margera, who is suing them for a \"Wellness Agreement\" that he was forced to sign and that got him fired from the movie. But was that legal? We'll break it down for you.
