The documentary features Orlando Martinez, Dan Myers and Scott Smith \u2013 three detectives who were involved in the initial investigation of Jackson's death.\n\nOn June 25, 2009, American singer Michael Jackson died of acute propofol and benzodiazepine intoxication at his home on North Carolwood Drive in the Holmby Hills. His personal physician, Conrad Murray, said he found Jackson in his room, not breathing and with a weak pulse, and administered CPR on Jackson to no avail.\n\nOn August 28, 2009, the Los Angeles County Coroner ruled that Jackson's death was a homicide. Shortly before his death, Jackson had reportedly been administered propofol and two anti-anxiety benzodiazepines, lorazepam, and midazolam, in his home. Law enforcement officials charged Murray with involuntary manslaughter on November 7, 2011, and served two years of his four-year prison sentence, early release per good behavior.\n\nFrom Killing Michael Jackson\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/realstoriesdocs\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/RealStoriesChannel\nInstagram - @realstoriesdocs\n\nTo listen to some of the best new documentary filmmakers talk on The Doc Exchange podcast, click this link: https://podfollow.com/the-doc-exchange-a-real-stories-podcast\n\nContent licensed from DRG.
