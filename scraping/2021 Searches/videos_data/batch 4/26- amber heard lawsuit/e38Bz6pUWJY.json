            "description": "https://lawmanguitars.com/product/1974-pre-lawsuit-ibanez-model-2363-335-style-pro-setup-red-maxon-super-70s-humbuckers-case/\n\nToday, Lawman Guitars is Presenting...\n\nAn awesome 1974 Pre Lawsuit Ibanez Model 2363 Guitar with the super hot Maxon Super 70's Pickups.....it was a great year for these Pickups! This cool guitar has tons of player vibe, looks, and sound ...the guitar is Pro Setup and plays just great. I love this guitar. All the electronics have been gone over and everything is working on this cool guitar. See pics..\n\nThis guitar looks a lot like the more common Ibanez Model 2370... This model 2363 was only available in 1974. The switches and knobs are arranged slightly differently than the more common Model 2370 guitars.\n\nThese cool Guitars, Made in Japan, were modeled after the cool Gibson ES 335 Model Guitars. This guitar is as close to the Gibson as they could get. They were only made in 1974 . It is hollow except for the block under the bridge. The varitone switch activates two tone sounds. Bassy and more bassy. I think they probably improved the tone caps in the later models. I does look cool though..doesn't it?\n\nWhen we got the guitar, it was completely unplayable. The neck pocket had collapsed with the string tension over the year. Our Jeff the Tech has become quite the expert in rebuilding and reinforcing the malady and it plays amazingly now with awesome low playing action. See pics of the repair shown around the neck pocket in pics 8, 9 and 10. Other than that repair, this guitar is in beautiful shape. All original from stem to stern. I especially like the Star Tuners in Gold. All the knobs, tailpiece, Bridge, Tailpiece, strap buttons..you name it...all original and in great shape. Only superficial dings here and there. This guitar is in fabulous shape!\n\nThese guitars were designed to play 12 guage strings back in the day. I put a cool set of 10 gauge on it and love them. Great tone from the flats and you can put 9\u2019s on it as you wish, but I bet you will like the 10\u2019s better.\n\nWe didn't get it with an original case. We just got the shown Epiphone 335 Hard Shell Case in and it fits it perfectly.  Its as nice as the guitar. Beautiful Plush interior and even the accessory box are still with the case! Check those pics..\n\nThere is nothing that detracts from the big booming sound of this cool guitar...It has super super low action and it sounds HUGE....If you have never heard these Super 70's Humbucker Pickups...you are in for a treat...They sound great!!..\n\nIt looks good, sounds good, and plays good... it will all be pro-packed by yours truly...I do this alot and have not had one complaint.... It has a few nicks and scratches as seen in the pics but it is a solid 9 out of 10 Guitar.. But on a cool scale...its an 12 !!!!!!\n\nThe guitar is cool but vintage and used so its sold as is no returns. However, I have been hand picking my customers instruments for over 20 years now and they have all loved the guitars I found for them. This cool Ibanez is certainly not going to be an exception.\n\nThanks for checking out our cool guitar.\n\nLawman Mike at Lawman Guitars",
