            "description": "Johnny Depp's former business partners countersued the actor claiming his financial woes are due to his accessive spending and lavish lifestyle. Despite persistent warnings, the star's business partners said Depp spent more than $2 million a month, which led to his financial problems. The countersuit by Management Group comes about two weeks after Depp sued the company alleging it mismanaged his earnings. The lawsuit claims Depp spent more than $75 million to buy 14 homes, including a French chateau and numerous islands in the Bahamas.",
