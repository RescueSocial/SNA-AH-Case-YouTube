            "title": "Marilyn Manson Hit With 3rd Lawsuit, Sued for Alleged Assault and Rape by Ex",
            "description": "Previously, it was revealed that Marilyn Manson was being sued by \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 actress Esm\u00e9 Blanco, who claims she was raped and sexually assaulted by the artist. Along with that, the artist was hit with another lawsuit that accused him of similar acts. Now, a third lawsuit was filed against Manson by \u201cJane Doe,\u201d who says she dated the rock star in 2011.\n\nThe person alleges that while they were dating, Manson showed her a video depicting \u201cabuse of a groupie after a 1996 concert\u201d in Hollywood. The person in the video was allegedly threatened with a gun and \u201cforced to drink urine.\u201d\n\nSources that talked to TMZ claim the video wasn\u2019t real but was supposed to be a short film. However, that film was never made public. In her lawsuit, the accuser also said the movie was locked away in a safe. Jane Doe claims the movie made her \u201cafraid for her life\u201d and that Manson allegedly raped her and threatened her life after she returned to his house to give him back a key.\n\nManson has yet to address the new allegations against him, with the last time the artist posted on social media being in February 2021.\n\nsource: Deadline",
