Cher (Alicia Silverstone) and Dionne (Stacey Dash), both named after \"great singers of the past that now do infomercials,\" are pampered upper-class girls who care less about getting good grades than wearing the right clothes and being as popular as possible. But Cher, who lives with her tough yet warm-hearted lawyer dad (Dan Hedaya) and hunky, sensitive stepbrother (Paul Rudd), also has an innate urge to help those less fortunate -- like the two introverted teachers she brings together (\"negotiating\" herself improved grades in the process) and new friend Tai (Brittany Murphy), who starts out a geek and ends up a Cher prodigy. Cher also possesses her own sensitive side, and she is looking for the perfect boyfriend, whom she ends up finding where she least expected.\n\nCREDITS:\nTM & \u00a9 Paramount (1995)\nCast: Julie Brown, Stacey Dash, Elisa Donovan, Brittany Murphy, Alicia Silverstone\nDirector: Amy Heckerling\nProducers: Barry M.
