            "description": "LONDON \u2014 Lawyers for British tabloid The Sun urged a U.K. judge on Thursday to throw out Johnny Depp\u2019s libel claim against the paper because the film star allegedly failed to disclose evidence relating to his drug use.Depp is suing the newspaper\u2019s publisher, News Group Newspapers, and Executive Editor Dan Wootton over a 2018 article claiming the actor was violent and abusive to his ex-wife Amber Heard.The trial is due to open at the High Court in London on July 7. At a preliminary hearing on Thursday, The Sun\u2019s lawyers argued the case should be dismissed because Depp had failed to disclose text messages showing that he tried to buy \u201cMDMA and other narcotics\u201d while he was in Australia with Heard in 2015.Former partners Winona Ryder, Vanessa Paradis show support for actorThe newspaper\u2019s lawyer, Adam Wolanski, said withholding the texts was a breach of a previous court order requiring Depp to provide all documents from separate libel proceedings against Heard in the United States.\u201cThere is a real risk that the claimant has failed to provide proper disclosure to the defendants, and that the defendants cannot have a fair trial,\u201d he said.Wolanski said the issue of drug-taking was relevant because \u201cit is the defendants\u2019 case that drugs and alcohol had an influence on the claimant\u2019s behavior towards Ms. Heard.\u201dBut Depp\u2019s lawyer, David Sherborn, said the libel case was about \u201cwhether the defendants can prove that the claimant committed serious domestic violence and put Ms. Heard in fear. It is not about whether Mr. Depp asks for drugs.\u201dIn a witness statement, Depp said he had been \u201copen about my challenges with alcoholism and addiction throughout my life.\u201c He said drugs or alcohol never made him \u201cundertake violence against anyone.\u201dDepp, 57, and Heard, 34, met on the set of the 2011 comedy \u201cThe Rum Diary\u201d and married in Los Angeles in February 2015. They divorced in 2017.Each accuses the other of being abusive, and Depp is also suing Heard for libel in the United States.Depp and Heard are both expected to give evidence in person at the London trial, which was postponed from March because of the coronavirus pandemic.Witnesses could include Depp\u2019s ex-partners Vanessa Paradis and Winona Ryder, who have both submitted statements supporting the \u201cPirates of the Caribbean\u201d star.",
