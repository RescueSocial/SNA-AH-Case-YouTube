(KNWA/KFTA) \u2014 In the afternoon session of the first day of Josh Duggar\u2019s child pornography trial, the prosecution called their second witness.\n\nSpecial Agent Gerald Faulkner is a member of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) as well as the Internet Crimes Against Children (ICAC) task force.\n\nBut before the afternoon testimony began, Judge Timothy L. Roberts made his second apology of the day to the jury, as they were told to return at 1:20 p.m. and were not called back to the courtroom until nearly 1:50 p.m.\n\n\u201cI do mean what I say,\u201d he said to them, drawing chuckles for the second time that day and bringing a little much-needed levity to this otherwise incredibly serious case.\n\nHe went on to explain that issues arose regarding some exhibits to be presented in the afternoon, and that he felt the little bit of time spent then to handle matters would benefit all involved in the long run.\n\nAfter that, Assistant United States Attorney Dustin Roberts called Special Agent Faulkner to the witness stand.\n\nSpecial Agent Faulkner detailed his career with Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), which began in 2009. He explained that while their branch commonly handles immigration issues, they are also \u201cthe largest investigation arm of Homeland Security.\u201d\n\nHe also serves on a special response team that deals with terrorist threats, active shooter events, and other high-priority cases for HSI. He has also been a member of the Internet Crimes Against Children (ICAC) task force since 2010.\n\nWhen asked how many cases he has worked for them, Faulkner estimated \u201capproximately 1,000 cases,\u201d with several hundred of those related to online child pornography.\n\nThe prosecution went over some of the ground covered in Detective Amber Kalmer\u2019s morning testimony, regarding the details of when the peer-to-peer sharing of illegal material was discovered.\n\nSpecial Agent Faulkner detailed the process that occurs from that point, which includes flagging the IP address and confirming that the transfer in question contained material that violated federal or state statutes.\n\nThen, he explained to the jury, all of that information feeds into drawing up a probable cause affidavit.\n\nFollowing that, he stated the three specific details he looks for when investigating:\n\nAny and all electronic devices capable of file sharing.\n\nAny devices with child pornography present on them.\n\nDetermining whether someone was physically using a computer on the dates that crimes occurred.\n\nSketch of a witness giving testimony in the Josh Duggar federal child porn trial. | Artist: John Kushmaul\n\nDetective Kalmer, through the use of Bit Torrent software specifically for police use, determined that the peer-to-peer transfers in question occurred from May 14-15, 2019. The program is one that runs 24 hours a day, and she did not immediately discover that this has happened.\n\nShe contacted Special Agent Faulkner in June, and he officially accepted the case in July. Later that month, he stated that he had identified Ozarks Go as the internet service provider (ISP) of the flagged IP address.\n\nHe then served a summons for subscriber information such as the owner, dates of service, type of service, and physical address of the IP address in question. He noted that the response time for such a summons can vary from 3-4 days to 3-4 months.\n\nWhen he hadn\u2019t received a response by October, he inquired and discovered that Ozarks Go had attempted to contact him using an incorrect email address.\n\nOn October 31, 2019, Special Agent Faulkner and a team of agents planned to serve a search warrant at the physical location of the IP address. He explained in detail that the property in question had recently been split into two parcels, and that the physical address was incorrectly sending them to the wrong place.\n\nThe team of agents quickly discovered that the error was due to \u201coutdated, old mapping records,\u201d and this was confirmed when they arrived at a house with no internet service that Duggar had never lived at. Thus, the warrant was not served.\n\nThe HSI sent an undercover agent to Duggar\u2019s place of business, Wholesale Motorcars, the following week. The HSI then requested and received a search warrant, which was served at the car lot on November 8, 2019.\n\nA copy of the search and seizure warrant served was one of half a dozen documents the prosecution submitted as exhibits of evidence. Others included more documents and aerial shots of the vicinity of the car lot.\n\nSpecial Agent Faulkner then walked the jury through the steps of serving the warrant. A team of agents and computer forensics analysts surveilled the car",
