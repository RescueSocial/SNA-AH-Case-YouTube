Great Ormond Street was terrific, a great hospital.\" \u00a0Depp and Paradis split in 2012, after which the notorious hell-raiser began dating actress and model Amber Heard, who he met when they were both cast in 2009 movie The Rum Diary.  \u00a0The pair married in early 2015 but Depp\u2019s relationship with Heard ended acrimoniously the following year, with Depp paying $7 million to his former wife, a sum she reportedly gave to charity. \u00a0Depp has also enjoyed a string of other high-profile romances, including dalliances with Sherilyn Fenn, Winona Ryder and supermodel Kate Moss. \u00a0But his greatest love, he says, is parenthood. he says it gave him \"real foundation, a real strong place to stand in life, in work, in everything. \u00a0He added: \u201cYou cannot plan the kind of deep love that results in children.\u201d",
