Experience the fun, conviviality, intimacy, and spontaneity of joining Rick in his living room as he shares his personal, inspirational, and sometimes hilarious behind-the-scenes commentary. Each week he'll share his personal, inspirational, and sometimes hilarious behind-the-scenes commentary, followed by a Q&A \u2014 your chance to ask questions and interact with Rick.

And on this virtual tour, Rick links up some of his favorites. Glasgow captures the early 20th century \u2014 from a perfectly preserved old tenement apartment to Art Nouveau with a Scottish accent. Hidden away deep in the Sicilian countryside, the Roman Villa Romana del Casale shows off beautifully preserved ancient mosaics. In England, Ironbridge Gorge has several steel-and-steam sights that commemorate the birth of the Industrial Age. Bulgaria shows off its discredited communist art in a park full of stony comrades. The castle of \u010cesk\u00fd Krumlov, in the Czech Republic, has one of Europe's best surviving Baroque theaters, with special effects from the 18th century. And in France's Beaune, we'll ogle gorgeous paintings designed to comfort patients in a charity hospital. Our dinner tonight will be a French feast from Seattle restaurant Caf\u00e9 Campagne; for an equally tasty evening, order some takeout and support your favorite local restaurant.\n\n00:00 Introduction\n01:24 Rick's meal\n03:09 Classroom Europe demo\n10:53 Playlist start",
