We are going up to my dads cabin in the mountains to look for deer, moose, and foxes! but first we need to go through our vacation morning routine and get the kiddos all ready! \n\nAdley woke up super excited this morning and already has all of her clothes out, she just needs her Disney mini mouse luggage. Niko Bear wants to bring some toys with him, so we get his bag all packed and get some him some toys out of the ultimate toy room! And Baby Navey is just happy to here lol!! After the bags are packed (and Niko Bear and Adley have gone down the slide on Adley's bedroom club house), we load up the monster truck and get ready to hit the road.\n\nAfter a little driving, we take a lunch break picnic on the side of the road. No outdoor meal would be complete without some pretend play that a giant lava ball is falling towards us, or playing the floor is lava game! Back in the car, we finish our drive and reach the cabin! So good to see my dad!\n\nAs soon as we are out of the car, its time to go exploring with the kiddos! We check out the cabin, picking bed where everyone is going to sleep. We then go put out food for the wild animals to come and eat. That way we can watch them later when its their night time routine! We test out a sling shot my dad has, play tractors in the dirt and rocks with Niko bears toys, then jump on the four wheelers and go for a beautiful ride in the mountains. We find a like, on that is a lot like Pirate Island, and the kiddos throw rocks in the water with grandpa! Back on the 4wheelers, I find out that has grown up and had enough birthdays that she can now drive! When did this happen?!!\n\nBack at the cabin we watch chipmunks, humming birds, and foxes all eat by us while we have our dinner and play a new game before going to bed!\nIn the morning, we sneak outside to take some pictures of a mommy and baby deer, go for a ride through water on the four wheelers, and Adley plays a trick on my dad!\n\nAnd to end this double Best Day Ever, when we get back to our house, i try out a new look and give the family a fashion show! Do you think i look handsome?\n\n\n\\\\\\\\\nWatch Adley's last video: CRAZY BABiES at Adley's Day Care!!
