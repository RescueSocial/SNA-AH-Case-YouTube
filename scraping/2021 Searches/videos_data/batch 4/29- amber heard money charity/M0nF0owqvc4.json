(Note: Amber Heard is a famous actress in her own right, and has an upcoming role in Aquaman.)\n\"Her request is entirely unnecessary under the law and suggests a last-ditch effort to garner media attention and somehow further her public persona by virtue of proximity to Johnny Depp,\" the actor's team said in documents obtained by E! News. \"From the inception of this dissolution Amber has sought to build a case in the court of public opinion. Amber is now courting renewed media attention with this unnecessary Request for Order. Her application is not only a blatant attempt to extend her fifteen minutes of fame but also a waste of the Court's limited time and resources and an embarrassing grab for addition and unwarranted attorney's fees.\"\nAs of now, Heard's team hasn't responded. But again, she is literally donating the entire sum of her $7 million settlement to charity-which hardly seems like a waste of time.",
