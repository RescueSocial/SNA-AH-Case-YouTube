In memory of those 658 men and women, the Cantor Fitzgerald Relief Fund was born as a legacy to them going forward.  First, we helped the families heal. Then, we created Charity Day that helps hundreds of charities and gives direct financial aid to families with young children while taking nothing in administrative expenses during natural disasters.   In 20 years, with your help, we have raised and distributed over $357 million. Thank you for your continuing help and support of our important mission. \n\nYou can donate to the fund here: https://www.cantorrelief.org/donate-now/. From our family to yours, thank you for your support.\n\nFor additional information regarding the event, please contact the Charity Day Team by emailing charityday@cantor.com.",
