Lucky for her, Madison and her friend Delanie show up with snacks. The girls also open the new Trinity and Beyond series 2 mystery jewelry box! They splay some more kart racers on the switch and before she knows it, it's dark out and time for bed!\n\nCheck out our other Channels!!!\nBeyond Family Vlogs: https://tinyurl.com/beyondfamily\nBeyond Toys: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3IsdhojXIjTXuD1TPKgfrg\n\nFollow Us:\nFaceBook: https://facebook.com/trinityandbeyond\nIG: https://instagram.com/trinityandbeyond.yt/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/TrinityBeyondYT\nTikTok: BeyondFamily.YT\n\nAbout Trinity and Beyond:\nHey guys!
