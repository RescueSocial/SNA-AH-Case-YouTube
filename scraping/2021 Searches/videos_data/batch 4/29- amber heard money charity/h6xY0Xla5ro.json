I was very fortunate to have him as my teacher. He was the greatest helper of the honorable Elijah Muhammad.\"\n\n\"I would have given my life to protect his life, because of my deep love for Elijah Muhammed and him being his top student.\"\n\nUnfortunately, there was a time when Brother Malcolm separated from the Nation of Islams due to an aspect of Muhammed's personal life and choice of women.\n\nFarrakhan continues to detail a conversation with Malcolm that sparked this debacle and why his faith was shaken -- which later led to X's separation.\n\nIn Part 1 of their sit-down, Farrakhan also clarifies that he had nothing to do with X's untimely assassination and shifts focus on the Government and their never-ending attempt to harm The Nation.\n\n\"Today, Louis Farrakhan is the voice that Malcolm was.\" \n\nhttp://ysksk.com\n\n,\n\nSubscribe Here! http://bit.ly/SubscribeSU\nWatch the Best of Sway In The Morning! http://bit.ly/BestOfSITM\n\nCheck out More From Sway\u2019s Universe\nhttp://swaysuniverse.com\nhttp://twitter.com/swaysuniverse\nhttp://instagram.com/swaysuniverse\nhttp://facebook.com/swaysuniverse\n\n#SwaysUniverse\n\nAbout SWAY\u2019s UNIVERSE\nExclusive interviews from Sway Calloway and the Sway In The Morning/ SwaysUniverse.com team with some of today's biggest celebrities, like Kevin Hart, Kanye West, Eminem, Usher, Jessica Alba, Steve Aoki, Torey Lanez, Julia Stiles and so much more.\n\nPT 1.
