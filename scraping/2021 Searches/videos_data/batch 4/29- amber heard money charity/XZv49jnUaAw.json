If we reach $10,000 raised i will try and SING the classic Brown Eyed Girl...happy to embarass myself for the cause LOL. :)\n\nThere will be some auction items and people sharing their experiences in meeting Johnny Depp.\nThe ultimate goal is to raise as much as possible for the KIDS.\n\nCHLA CHARITY LiveStream - #JusticeForJOHNNYDEPP Community Support The Children\n\nAside from being a renowned actor, singer, musician, and writer - Johnny Depp has always had a charitable heart, whether it be dressing up as Jack Sparrow to visit sick kids in the hospital or privately donating his own funds to causes he is passionate about. \nAs part of his divorce settlement agreement between himself and his ex-wife Amber Heard, he agreed to pay $7 million dollars on her behalf, which would be split evenly between the ACLU and the CHLA. \nAs of January 7th, 2021 the public has received indisputable evidence which tells them that Amber Heard, who insisted the funding be given directly to her and not the charities for her to donate directly, failed to keep her promise to both the public and the Children\u2019s Hospital of LA and did not donate the $3.5 million. \nCHLA is a nonprofit that admits approximately 14,600 child patients every year, including those with cancer and long-term illnesses. They rely completely on their donors for financial support. As a group, members of the Justice for Johnny Depp community have decided to put together this page to be able to raise money so that the children get the attention and care they deserve.
