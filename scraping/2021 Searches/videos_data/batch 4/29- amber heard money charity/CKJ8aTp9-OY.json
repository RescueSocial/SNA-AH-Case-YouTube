She is currently #3 in the world! In this video, she shows us some of her best moves, including one that no other female on the planet can do! She fell more than 20 times before she nailed it, and her perseverance was an inspiration to everyone watching. Sky has partnered with Skateistan to help children throughout the world. Her biggest role model is Leticia Bufoni, because she can tear it up on the skateboard and also be a \"girly girl\" in everyday life. Sky also surfs, waking up at dark every day to catch the best waves. She lives in Japan to surf and California to skate. She is INSANE!\n\nVideo by Sandy Chase\n\nBuy my bestselling book, Born To Dance: https://www.amazon.com/Born-Dance-Celebrating-Wonder-Childhood-ebook/dp/B079VT1F7G/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=born+to+dance&qid=1556937518&s=gateway&sr=8-1\n\nPurchase Jordan Matter recommended photo equipment: https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/browse/jordan-matter-recommended-gear/ci/40519\n\nBusiness Inquiries: info@jordanmatter.com\n\nMusic licensed through Artlist.io\nSandy Chase 706815",
