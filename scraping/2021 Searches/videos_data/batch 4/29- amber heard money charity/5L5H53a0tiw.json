            "description": "Texas-born Amber Heard is one of the world\u2019s most recognisable actresses and models. \u00a0The 34-year-old made her film debut in the 2004 sports drama Friday Night Lights, but her big breakthrough came in 2008 when she starred in Never Back Down and Pineapple Express. \u00a0Since then Johnny Depp's ex has gone on to star in movies such as Zombieland, The Danish Girl and Aquaman. \u00a0The success of these films means that Heard has an estimated net worth of $9million, according to Celebrity Net Worth. \u00a0Most of Heard\u2019s fortune has come from her acting and modelling work. She\u2019s also been enrolled by L\u2019Oreal as a spokesperson, and was recently included in their #WomenMakeCinema series, a partnership with the Cannes Film Festival which pays tribute to women in the movie industry.   \u00a0When it comes to spending her fortune, she dedicates a lot of it towards her love for classic cars. \u00a0In 2015 she said: \"I spend all my money on classic cars; I've had loads. Right now, I have a 1968 Mustang and a 1967 Mercedes 250SL. I try to fix them up myself as much as I can, buying the parts on eBay.\" \u00a0Heard's enthusiasm for cars led to her appearing on Top Gear in 2011, when she took on the Star in a Reasonably Priced Car challenge. \u00a0There, she also spoke about her passion for guns, telling Jeremy Clarkson about her .357 magnum. \u00a0In 2009 she met Hollywood superstar Johnny Depp on the set of The Rum Diary.   \u00a0In 2015 the couple wed in the Bahamas but had separated the following year. \u00a0Their divorce settlement was reached by the summer of 2016 and finalised the following January.  \u00a0Heard received $7m (\u00a35.6m) as part of the settlement, which she donated to two charities; American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and Children\u2019s Hospital of Los Angeles. Heard wrote in a statement at the time that ACLU\u2019s share of $3.5million (\u00a32.8million) would be going specifically towards its efforts to combat violence against women.",
