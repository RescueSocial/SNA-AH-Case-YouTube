She was inspired while on a trip to Mexico with her father, after meeting a group of young kids playing soccer in a dirt field. They told her their greatest wish was to have grass on which to play.\n \nAmber couldn\u2019t get the kids out of her mind and this set into motion a series of ideas about how to raise both money and awareness, on a local and global level.  It was actually quite simple - every area of the world has a need\u2026and produces a product. What if one could benefit the other?\n \nThe happy result is Global Angel, a platform designed to offer high-quality goods that give back to the world, in just the way you choose. You pick the product; you pick the cause, because we\u2019re more than just an online shopping destination. We\u2019re a far-reaching, communal effort of compassion.\n\nHOW IT WORKS\nSHOW US YOUR HEART\nThe hardships of our world can be pretty overwhelming leaving many people, places, creatures and causes in desperate need of an Angel - it\u2019s often confusing knowing where to begin.\n \nGlobal Angel has streamlined the giving process by creating a platform allowing you to choose how you want to give back. We\u2019ve assembled a thoughtfully curated and ever-growing list of charities from around the world, many of which you may recognize and some that you might be interested in learning more about.\n \nThrough the purchase of Global Angel products, we can effect change together leaving a positive and lasting impression in our wake.
