            "description": "Johnny Depp settled his divorce with Amber Heard by giving her 7 million dollars and she gave the entire fortune away to charity. Heard asked for a divorce in May after claiming that Depp hit her and threw his mobile phone at her face. Heard asked that the 7 million be split between the ACLU's fight to end domestic violence and the Children's Hospital of Los Angeles. The actors met on the set of \"Rum Diary\" in 2011 and their relationship became a volatile one. Both of them released a joint statement after the settlement that read as follows, \"\"Our relationship was intensely passionate and at times volatile, but always bound by love. Neither party has made false accusations for financial gain.\"",
