            "description": "Into the Unknown! Frozen 2 Elsa Song (Cover) by Jazzy Skye! This is a Frozen 2 cover song when Elsa wakes up and hears the mysterious voice calling her into the Unknown and away from Arendelle.  The mystery and the call of the voice wakes Elsa and she puzzles out it's meaning and decides to explore.  The magic of the voice awakens and magnifies her powers and she sees the images of the enchanted forest and nature spirits while she sings and explores the intensity of her powers.  Answers and clues to her past and future unfold as the magic and power of her voice and Frozen power dance and sparkle around her.  Will Elsa find who\u2019s behind the voice and discover who is calling her?  Will Elsa be able to tame the nature spirits with her powers? \r\n\r\nElsa is such an amazing character and so is Anna.  Our kids loved playing these amazing characters in our parodies and skits. In honor of the awesome new \u201cFrozen 2\u201d movie coming out in theaters, we thought it would be fun to do a few Frozen videos for everyone. Kalia is our little Anna, and Jazzy is our Elsa.  Both Kalia and Jazzy had fun recording their voices in \"Into the Unknown,\" \"Do You Want to Build a Snowman,\" \"Let it Go.\"  Even Kade got into the action and will soon release his version of the fun and silly Olaf song, \"When I'm Older.\"  Should we have Jack sing \"Lost in the Woods\" by Kristoff? What\u2019s your favorite Frozen song?  \r\n\r\nThe Fun Squad kids at Kids Fun TV have had so much fun watching each new Frozen 2 trailer this year. We really love the new Frozen 2 movie. Elsa and Anna are such great sisters, and Jazzy and Kalia are such great sisters in real life also. Jazzy and Kalia had so much fun playing Anna and Elsa in these Frozen video. \r\n\r\nGo check out the new Frozen 2 movie in theaters! We have tickets for the opening night and we are so excited to see Elsa and Anna along with all of the other fun Frozen characters like Olaf, Sven, Kristoff, the trolls and the mysterious new characters they encounter on their journey! \n\nThanks to Masa Fukuda for the musical arrangement! \n\n\ud83d\uded2 NEW Fun Squad MERCH:  https://www.TheFunSquadStore.com\n\n\u2728 SUBSCRIBE Here \u2794  http://bit.ly/FunSquad\n\u2728 SUBSCRIBE To Our Family Channel Here \u2794  http://bit.ly/FunSquadFamily\n\n\ud83d\udc40 Watch More Videos \ud83d\udc40:\n\ud83c\udf1f Most Popular:  https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9bCxUcHuVU1HJ_-4JhMjU1MyN2GgEeWr\n\ud83c\udfb5 Music Videos:  https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9bCxUcHuVU3XV6ktNm_2ZZek2Ojb8fCr\n\ud83e\uddb8 SuperHero:  https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9bCxUcHuVU1C4nDa96OId4KM7P8Vq3Up\n\ud83e\udd23 Sneaky Jokes:  https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9bCxUcHuVU2qtT641LcOIvhjjdfDEdWk\n\ud83c\udfa5 Movies Recreated:  https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9bCxUcHuVU3F_CWWAGJbIzSFuC1z9hJ9\n\n\ud83d\udc4d Check Out Our Other YouTube Channels Here:\n\u25ba Fun Squad Family: https://www.youtube.com/c/FunSquadFamily\n\u25ba Jazzy Skye: https://www.youtube.com/c/JazzySkye\n\u25ba Jack Skye: https://www.youtube.com/c/JackSkyeOfficial\n\u25ba Kade Skye: https://www.youtube.com/c/KadeSkye\n\n\ud83d\ude0e Official Fun Squad Website:  https://www.TheFunSquad.com\n\n\ud83d\udcf1 Follow Us On Instagram:\nFun Squad: https://www.instagram.com/FunSquad_Official\nFun Squad Family: https://www.instagram.com/FunSquadFamily_Official\n\n\ud83d\ude0e \ud83e\udd29 Kids Fun TV \ud83e\udd29 \ud83d\ude0e:\nKids Fun TV, also known as the Fun Squad, is a family friendly, fun adventure channel by the Fun Squad Family.
