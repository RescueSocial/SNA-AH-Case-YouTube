The two have been fighting a legal battle for years now since their divorce in 2016. The reason being stated was irreconcilable differences, but later Amber accused Johnny of abusing her during their marriage!\nTwo Court of Appeal judges said the fame of Hollywood couldn\u2019t question the High Court\u2019s denial of his libel suit against The Sun newspaper's publicist for naming him a \u201cwife-be*ter\u201d in an editorial.\nJames Dingemans and Nicholas Underhill, who were the Justices for this lawsuit, said the earlier court trial was \u201cfull and fair\u201d. The trial judge\u2019s judgments have not been given even arguably to be corrupted by any error of approach or law mistake.\nThe law concluded that the appeal has no real possibility of success and no other compelling reason for it to be learned.\n\nIf you liked this video guys, please consider leaving a like and give us your thoughts in the comments! \n\nIf you are into the latest Hollywood news and the celebrity latest gossip, then you should consider subscribing to the channel!
