One such news that has taken away the thunder of the other news and buzz is the divorce and the legal battle of Johnny Depp and Amber Heard.\n\nThe legal battle between Amber Heard and Johnny Depp has been going on for years. It started in 2016, just a year after their marriage and since then, it hasn\u2019t had closure. But do you know, what is one thing that seems repetitive throughout this? It is the passing of blames and tampering evidence. \n\nRecently, a subpoena emerged and it suggested that it was addressed to Amber Heard\u2019s sister Whitney Henriquez. The fans conjectured that something which Whitney must have said would have been a lie and that Amber had urged her to do so. As a result, she was asked to appear before the court. Isn\u2019t this tampering evidence? The case is unending because of these games that have been played by Amber Heard. \n\nThroughout the years of the legal battle between Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, there have been so many celebrities that pointed out the elephant in the room - the idea that Amber Heard could be the  and liar all these years. All while, the audience kept blaming Johnny Depp. \n\nLet us go about the celebrities who spoke up against Amber and what their opinions are. \n\nThe first celebrity that we are going to talk about is Johnny Depp\u2019s ex-partner - Vanessa Paradis.  Vanessa Paradis defends Johnny in court and raises serious questions doubting the allegations made against Johnny Depp by Amber Heard. According to Vanessa, Johnny is a kind, attentive, generous, and  partner and a father.",
