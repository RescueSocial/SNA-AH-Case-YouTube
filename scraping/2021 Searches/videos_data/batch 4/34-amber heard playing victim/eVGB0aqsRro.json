He seemed very sincere and willing to listen to new ideas from entrepreneurs who have the same interest in movie producing and website design. I asked Jason if he could ask Amber Heard if she would be willing to sign her autograph onto a post card or give me few hours of her time over diner?\n\nJohnny Depp Is a Wife Beater Who Abused Amber Heard, British High Court Rules\nDepp admitted to prodigious drink and drug use during the case. He admitted to spending $30,000 on red wine each month and said he used large amounts of cocaine, which he said merely \u201cbrought him to a normal level.\u201d Depp lost a staggering $650 million he made at the height of his Pirates of the Caribbean fame and was left owing $100 million in taxes.\n\nI asked my friend's insight who works at Hooters regarding the false alleged abuse allegations brought by Mr. Johnny Depp who plays \"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl\".\nJust like it's title, lying to the British High Court was not a wise move.\nHere is why - Everyone knows that once a drug addict has got a taste of the highly addicted  white powder cocaine, there is usually only 30% chance that a rehab may cure all Depp's habits such as greed, dope user, sexually active predator and Depp is also known for inviting friends to his wild parties where everything goes.  Mr. Depp will even offer to his friends or a family member a free room onboard at his luxurious estate located in Australia as a token of his generosity so no public eye would know how many women Mr. Depp had sex with while his gorgeous wife was working on the set.\n\nThe truth is that Johnny Depp is just like Jeffrey Edward Epstein, an American financier and convicted sex offender who was killed by the guards to silence this predator forever....\nJohnny Depp is no different than Mr. Epstein who earned way too much money has turned a good man into a Pirate of nothing but tax frauds and wild sex.  An actor who makes this much cash with the film industry should have no problem paying all his taxes on time! His defense in the British High Court was nothing but just an act like any good male actor would do to win his case at all cost, even as to betray his best friend whom has giving Depp endless pleasure. \n\nAccording to our professional observation, Mr. Depp secretly recorded his girlfriend Amber as to trap her into a real abuse that we know happened by his burst of anger for not being able to perform in bed like a stallion would have if he was not so high on cocaine.\nUnfortunately, Depp was only able to pleasure Amber for 30 minute then thereafter, this monster would fall into a deep psycho stage of irrational behavior of a 17 year old child who is in need of breastfeeding.\nWe cannot let this real life Pirate of the Caribbean monster get away with a fabricated lie!\nOnce a drug addict has gone to a rehab center, the chance of a recovery is very slim because of the massive millions of dollars cache in Switzerland was Depp's ticket to file a malicious civil lawsuit against the SUN as newspaper over an article that called him a \"wife beater\".  \nIn this life time we would called it \"shit out of luck MF Depp\" finally got a real awaken of a reality is.  \n\nThis donkey did not even try to improve his educational background after he made his first movie that paid him $20 Million per movie but instead he wasted all his energy at consuming expensive wine that he owns a $75 million town in France. Unlike two super star actors like John Travolta and Tom Cruise have made a name for themselves by obtaining their pilot licenses ;even though, they did not attend college.   \n\nThink of how many struggling Americans we could have helped with $100 million dollars.\nSuppose each college student gets a $600 stimulus check. \n100,000,000 / 600 = 166,666 college students\nBut instead, Disney decided to help a high school dropout who wanted it all for free!\nGuess who will pick up this loser $100 million bankruptcy tax debt? the state of California where the majority of rich actors live.\n\nIt's official. Amber Heard will be returning to \"Aquaman 2.\" On Thursday, Heard confirmed to Entertainment Weekly that she would be reprising her role as Mera in the Warner Bros.\n\nAmber Heard deserves a Billionaire who would see no boundary between money & love, her business and her gorgeous girlfriends would always come first! Right Bianca Butti.\nWho needs a monster like Depp when you can enjoy endless tender loving and be treated like a Princess Mera.  \n\nhttp://www.celebrityscentsation.com/celebrity-perfumes/actors/amber-heard/guess-girl-perfume/",
