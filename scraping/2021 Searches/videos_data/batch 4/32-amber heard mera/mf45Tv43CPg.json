But by her appearance, she could not have been more than thirty-seven. The woman had not worked, slept well, visited a gym and a beauty salon, ate right and carefully controlled her figure.  From her late husband she inherited a huge company, which they started from scratch. She delegated all the management to her son, because she decided to live the rest of her life to her pleasure.  And now Mrs.Blake walked into her son's office, smiling a gorgeous white-toothed smile.\n\n\" Mom, you're kind of mysterious.  What is going on? Tell me,\" he smiled.\n\n\"Son, I am so happy to see you. You have no idea what happened. I have met the man of my dreams,\" Mrs.Blake exclaimed.\n\nAnd the mother dreamily told how she met her new man at the resort, and to their mutual surprise, they were from the same city.  \n\nMalcolm listened silently to his mother but did not share her enthusiasm at all.\n\n\"Mom, of course I understand. Love and everything. But let's not rush right into it. You're a mature, sensible woman. At least I hope so,\" he said  and smiled at her mother, but now she was frowning. This was not the reaction she had expected when she decided to share her joy. \n\nShe straightened up and said sternly, \"I devoted my whole youth to you. I gave you an education. And in one moment you want to destroy my happiness. In a month with him, I felt like a woman: loved and desired. What can I tell you, you have only contracts and work on your mind\".\n\nWiping away her tears, she got up and headed for the exit. At the door, she turned around and said, \"I made a reservation at a restaurant and I want you to meet him. It is very important for me, so I wait for you at 19.00. I will text you address.\"\nThe mother closed the door, and Malcolm realized that she was offended.\n\nMrs.Blake got in the car and took out some wet wipes to fix her makeup. Why was her son so callous? Couldn't even be happy for his mother. But okay, tonight they would get to know each other, and Malcolm would change his mind. \n\nShe started the car and drive to get ready for dinner. She visited the beauty salon, chose an outfit, had her hair styled, and barely arrived to the restaurant in time.  Her son was already there; his punctuality was indispensable. And Mrs.Blake's new lover was almost half an hour late.\nBut when he finally arrived, Malcolm almost choked on the water he was drinking. Mom talked about the man, but he was a young guy, younger than Malcolm. Dinner passed tensely. The son left an hour later, citing business. In fact, he couldn't stand the guy anymore. It was clear to Malcolm that Derek knew very well who his mother was and had decided to make his life easy.",
