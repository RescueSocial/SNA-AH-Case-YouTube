            "description": "Piers Morgan is once again putting Meghan Markle on blast. The British media personality wasn't a fan of the Duchess of Sussex's surprise appearance on \"Ellen\" this week, calling the collab a \"vomit-making\" \"cheese-fest\" that presented Meghan as a \"desperate reality TV star\" rather than a member of the royal family. Though Piers has been a longtime critic of Meghan and Harry's exit from royal duties, many fans were delighted to see the mom of two relaxed and up for some harmless fun.\n\n\u00bb SUBSCRIBE: http://bit.ly/AHSub\n\u00bb Visit Our Website: http://www.AccessOnline.com/\n\nGet More Access Hollywood:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AccessOnline\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/accessonline\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/accessonline\nSnapchat: OfficialAccess\n\nAbout Access Hollywood:\nAccess Hollywood is a nationally syndicated daily entertainment news show.
