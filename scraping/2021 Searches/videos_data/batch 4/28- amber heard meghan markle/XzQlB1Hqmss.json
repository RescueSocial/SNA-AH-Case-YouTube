In this episode, I explore the rise of the arm chair psychology channels using what many are talking about lately: Amber Heard and Johnny Depp's abuse allegations--the mutual allegations they have made of abuse. \n\n News of Amber Heard & Johnny Depp abuse allegations reached an all-time high during his libel trial against The Sun which branded him as a \"wifebeater,\" and for that reason, a lot of audio documents and testimony from witnesses have surface which alledge Amber Heard is the abuser, and that Amber abused Johnny Depp. \n\nAnd now, many psych channels have made videos about whether or not Amber Heard has narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) or borderline personality disorder (BPD). \n\nSo I thought it would be interesting to explore the credibility of some of these channels discussing this and their biases. I see a lot of channels never acknowledge that Johnny Depp, who chose to marry Amber after years of abuse, clearly has some sort of codependency or anxious attachment style--Johnny Depp that is. **That is my assumption.** \n\nSo as much as people are happy to dissect the psychology of Amber Heard and say Amber Heard is a crazy, splitting, borderline psycho with extreme borderline anger, jealousy envy, and fear of abandonment, which she is!, many channels also reveal their lack of objectivity and psychological professionalism in never acknowledging Johnny's codependent weaknesses to stay in an abusive relationship for so many years, which made me question how credible are some of these channels that look at relationships as one-sided, putting all the responsibility on one individual. It shows a lack of understanding of the nuances of intimate partnerships. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWATCH MY OTHER SMALL CHANNEL HACKS & TIPS VIDEOS:\n\nHow to Make $1000 on Youtube for Small Channels:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nW_p4mM3nMw\n\nHow I Officially Monetized in 3 Months:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pMibj4jzWA\n\nHow to Get Anything for Free on a Small Channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SY54DvpWdTw\n\n5 Hacks & Advice for New Youtubers: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwOciJdc9Ao\n\nHow To: Free Hotels as a Small Youtuber\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFzQdO01CmQ\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nI wanna know who's still reading this description.
