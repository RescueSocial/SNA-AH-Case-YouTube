            "description": "Amber Heard Files Court Order to Get Johnny Depp to Pay Divorce Settlement\n\nGolden Heard petitioned for separation from Johnny Depp in May and their money related settlement was settled upon months back. However it turns out Depp has clearly neglected to pay Heard the rest of the $6.8 million owed by separation settlement the two gatherings settled upon. Listened, as far as it matters for her, isn't having any a greater amount of the deferral. Her legal advisors documented a court arrange on Wednesday to compel Depp to pay the adjust owed and kick up the pace on divvying up whatever remains of their advantages and property, as indicated by E! News and the Daily Mail, which initially reported the story. \n\nHeard's group documented a Request for Order with the Los Angeles Superior Court this week as an approach to accelerate the rest of the separation procedures. The group likewise asked for lawyer charges totaling up to $35,435, as per E! News. Heard reported not long ago that she would give the aggregate of her separation settlement to two philanthropies, the ACLU and Children's Hospital of Los Angeles. Depp then took after that up and made the underlying $200,000 installment of the settlement to the philanthropies rather than Heard, something she hammers him about in the court records. \n\nIn the matter of why Depp has apparently slowed down on the settlement, it may need to do with Heard's late PSA on abusive behavior at home and her letter in Porter magazine about approaching as a survivor (not a casualty!) of ambush. Terms of the settlement incorporated a privacy understanding that deny Heard from castigating Depp out in the open. Despite the fact that Heard didn't name Depp in her PSA or open letter, Depp's group apparently accepts they're infringing upon the understanding, as indicated by the court reports Heard's legal advisors documented. \n\nThere's been a lot of forward and backward intensity between the two as each has had a go at sowing their own particular form of occasions in the press and the adventure is probably going to proceed, though with more course from the court.",
