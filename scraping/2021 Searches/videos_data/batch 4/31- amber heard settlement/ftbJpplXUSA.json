In this interview, Brian explains one of the reasons why Johnny Depp likely agreed to this record breaking $7 million dollar settlement with actress Amber Heard.  Brian surmises that there was likely additional evidence demonstrating abusive conduct by Depp of Heard, which gave 7 million reasons for Mr. Depp to want a non-disclosure/confidentiality and gag order.",
