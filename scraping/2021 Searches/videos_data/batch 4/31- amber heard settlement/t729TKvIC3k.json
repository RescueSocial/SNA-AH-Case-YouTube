            "description": "Depp and Heard met while making \u201cThe Rum Diary\u201d in 2011, a film based on a book by Hunter S. Thompson. They married in February 2015, but Heard filed for divorce just over a year later, and obtained a temporary restraining order against Depp after accusing him of hitting her. She said at the time, according to The Associated Press, that she had\u00a0\u201cendured excessive emotional, verbal and physical abuse\u201d\u00a0in the relationship.\n\nShe withdrew those claims the day before a restraining order hearing was scheduled, and the divorce was finalized with a $7 million settlement. In a joint statement, the two declared: \u201cNeither party has made false accusations for financial gain. There was never any intent of physical or emotional harm.\u201d\nBut the allegations did not go away. The Sun article appeared in April 2018. A few months later, Heard published\u00a0an opinion piece in The Washington Post\u00a0titled, \u201cI spoke up against sexual violence \u2014 and faced our culture\u2019s wrath. That has to change.\u201d\u00a0Depp is suing Heard for defamation in the United States\u00a0over that article, which he says led to him being dropped from the \u201cPirates of the Caribbean\u201d movie franchise.\n\nLater, Heard told the court\u00a0that Depp often put her in \u201clife-threatening\u201d situations. \u201cI had been for years, for years, Johnny\u2019s punching bag,\u201d she\u00a0added on Tuesday. On Wednesday,\u00a0she detailed an episode\u00a0in Australia in which she said he threw bottles at her \u201clike grenades or bombs.\u201d\nIn pretrial documents, Heard\u00a0listed 14 times\u00a0when she said Depp assaulted her.\nThe first occurred in early 2013, Heard said in\u00a0a pretrial statement, when the couple was sitting on a couch talking about one of Depp\u2019s tattoos. She said it had originally read \u201cWinona,\u201d in reference to Winona Ryder, his former partner, but that he had changed it to read \u201cWino.\u201d\n\nHeard said she had laughed during the conversation, and in response Depp hit her three times. \u201cIt felt like my eye popped out,\u201d\u00a0she added of the third strike, saying it knocked her off balance and to the floor.\nIn later incidents, Heard claims, Depp grabbed her by the hair, choked her, head-butted her and repeatedly punched her, on top of emotional abuse and other controlling behavior.\n\nShe also said that his behavior was \u201cso confusing because when he was clean and sober, he was wonderful and that part of him I loved so much.\u201d News Group Newspapers \u2014 The Sun\u2019s publisher \u2014 claims Depp\u2019s memory of the couple\u2019s time together has been impaired by heavy drug and alcohol use. He has admitted use of both at times in the relationship, but said his tolerance for substances was high.\n\nDepp denies the incidents. He told the court that whenever the couple had an argument he would retreat, sometimes hiding in bathrooms. \u201cI would try to go to my own corner, as it were,\u201d\u00a0he said when asked about one incident. \u201cI thought it was important that we separate before things got out of hand.\u201d Witnesses including a former estate manager for Depp and a former assistant to Heard have testified in his favor.\n\nDepp has repeatedly portrayed Heard as an aggressor, provoking arguments. In the incident in Australia, Depp told the court, Heard threw a vodka bottle at him, severing the tip of one of his fingers.\nHeard denies all claims that she was violent toward him, and said that Depp must have severed the fingertip himself, potentially in the process of ripping a phone off the wall and smashing it beside her face repeatedly.\nAt one point\u00a0Heard admitted she had thrown \u201cpots and pans\u201d at Depp, but said it was \u201conly to escape him.\u201d She also acknowledged hitting him once but only to protect her sister, who she thought he was about to push down some stairs. \u201cI will never forget it,\u201d\u00a0she said of that moment. \u201cIt was the first time after all these years that I actually struck him back.\u201d\n\nWe have got you covered with all of the celebrity news there is with all of the celebrity news latest updates.
