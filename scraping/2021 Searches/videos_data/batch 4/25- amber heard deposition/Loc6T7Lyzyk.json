            "description": "(7 Jul 2020) AT LIBEL TRIAL, DEPP BLASTS AMBER HEARD'S 'SICK' ABUSE CLAIM\r\nJohnny Depp said Tuesday that his ex-wife Amber Heard had made \u201csick\u201d claims of abuse and falsely branded him a monster, as the actor testified in a U.K. libel case that hinges on who was the aggressor in the celebrity couple\u2019s violent, toxic relationship \r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\nDepp is suing British tabloid The Sun over an April 2018 story headlined \u201cPotty - How can JK Rowling be \u2018genuinely happy\u2019 casting wife beater Johnny Depp in the new Fantastic Beasts film?\u201d\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\nThe \u201cPirates of the Caribbean\u201d star strongly denies Heard's claims that he assaulted her during their tempestuous marriage, and sued The Sun's publisher, News Group Newspapers, and its executive editor, Dan Wootton.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\u201cThese sick claims are totally untrue,\u201d Depp said in a written witness statement, adding that Heard's allegations hurt his career and had \u201cbeen a constant issue in my casting.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\nA three-week trial over his libel claims opened Tuesday. The trial is one of the first to be held in person since Britain began to lift its coronavirus lockdown.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\nDepp entered the witness box of the wood-paneled courtroom wearing a dark suit and tie, and began by taking the court oath and giving his full name: John Christopher Depp II.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\nHe told the court that Heard had \u201csaid to the world that she was in fear of her life from me, and I had been this horrible monster, if you will. Which was not the case.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\nDepp, 57, and Heard, 34, met on the set of the 2011 comedy \u201cThe Rum Diary\u201d and married in Los Angeles in February 2015. They divorced in 2017, and now bitterly accuse one another of abuse.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\nDepp and Heard arrived by separate entrances at the neo-Gothic court building. Both wore face coverings over their noses and mouths as they arrived. Proceedings have been spread over several courtrooms to allow for social distancing.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\nWhile Heard isn't on trial, the case is also a showdown between the former spouses, who accuse each other of being controlling, violent and untruthful. It is set to put the two performers\u2019 complex private lives under a microscope.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\nThe Sun's defense relies on Heard's allegations of 14 incidents of violence by Depp between 2013 and 2016, in locations including Los Angeles, Australia, Japan, the Bahamas and a chartered jet. He denies them all and says Heard, an actress and model, attacked him with items including a drink can and a cigarette. He also claims that on one occasion Heard or one of her friends defecated on his bed.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\nIn written witness statements, Depp said that in Australia in 2015 Heard severed the tip of his finger by hurling a vodka bottle at him. A photo of the bloody digit was included with his witness statement.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\nDepp claimed that on another occasion, Heard repeatedly punched him in the face on a private jet, forcing him to spend the flight locked in the plane\u2019s bathroom.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\u201cRage-filled violent incidents on planes were common with Amber,\u201d he said in the written statement.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\nDescribing one incident in which Heard claims he hit her, Depp said the opposite was true.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\u201cAs things tended to do, (it) escalated and got physical, ending with a bit of assault. Ms. Heard struck me,\u201d he said.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\nHe painted himself as a peacemaker who tried to remove himself from conflicts \"before things got out of hand.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\nIn a written statement, Depp alleged that Heard was \u201ca calculating, diagnosed borderline personality; she is sociopathic; she is a narcissist; and she is completely emotionally dishonest.\" \r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\nHeard alleges that Depp was prone to drink- and drug-fueled violent rages.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives \u200b\u200b\r\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/ead6d87c38b24f24824a7a8af3ed9f4f",
