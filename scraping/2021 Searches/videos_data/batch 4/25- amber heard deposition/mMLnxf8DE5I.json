            "description": "Family Guy is one of the edgiest shows on TV, but these deleted scenes stepped over the line! Subscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Screenrant\n\nFamily Guy is one of those shows that has never been afraid to push some buttons and get a reaction from it\u2019s viewers and critics alike. And that\u2019s why we love it! They will say just about anything about anyone, and make no apologies. But sometimes, certain scenes just prove too much for the network to handle, and there are a ton of jokes that never make it to air. Whether it\u2019s Peter with an offensive tattoo, a super graphic hallucination of Peter\u2019s behind turning into a fly and trying to eat Quagmire, Peter being present at the Roe V Wade Supreme Court case, or Cleveland and Peter doing ten rounds of chemotherapy together for no apparent reason. There was also the scene that had Meg being shot in the head at the dinner table, a joke about an Asian in-law, Peter finding out if Jillian is Jewish, Dr Hartmann eating Lois\u2019 tumour, Peter commenting on the race of Brian\u2019s girlfriend, a Leper colony doing the hokey-pokey, or Quagmire making a very weird comment about when his daughter will turn 21. It doesn\u2019t stop there, as with a scene with Jesus trying to pick up a girl, a political joke about how iPads are made, a cutaway during the already controversial Stroke episode, a scene with a missionary that might have offended some, a bit where Joe runs over a squirrel, and of course, about a million jokes about Mort that were never made it to air. All those and more remind us just why Family Guy is still one of the edgiest shows out there!\n\nCheck out these other awesome videos!\n\n25 Twisted Family Guy Facts That Will Surprise Even Longtime Fans\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRB0kgJi16Q\n\n25 Family Guy Fan Theories So Crazy They Might Be True\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiLA0R0_sgo\n\nOur Social Media:\nhttps://twitter.com/screenrant\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ScreenRant\nhttps://plus.google.com/+ScreenRant\n\nOur Website\nhttp://screenrant.com/",
