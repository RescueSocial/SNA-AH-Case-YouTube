While he claimed he had an overall happy and average childhood, many describe Bundy as having a difficult childhood. He spent his early years with his maternal grandparents, who raised him as their son. Bundy was said to have thought his mother was his sister, according to a prison psychologist who once interviewed Bundy, in the documentary \"The Ted Bundy Tapes.\" He apparently didn't find out who his birth mother was until later in life. Along with this, a forensic psychologist and FBI and law enforcement consultant stated that Bundy exhibited signs of conduct disorder as a child.\n\nThis was further amplified as a young Bundy began to avidly view violent pornography. He stated in his final interview that he felt the need to take in more extreme content to give himself the same feeling until he finally realized what he had to do to take it to the next level.\n\nWhile his first attack occurred early in 1974, his first killing occurred on or around February 1st of 1974 from that point on through the year 1978, according to his own confession, he killed, kidnapped, and assaulted more than 30 women in seven states, while escaping from prison twice. After his final arrest in 1979, Bundy insisted on acting as his own attorney and even cross-examined witnesses during his trial. However, he was found guilty of murder and was sentenced to death via electric chair.\n\nOver the next ten years, legalities would play out. Bundy even was married during his imprisonment and had a child. However, he was later divorced and was executed by electric chair at 7:06 a.m. on January 24, 1989, at Florida State Prison in Starke, Florida.\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/observeentertainment\nObserve Merch Shop: https://teespring.com/stores/observe-4\nAudible Trial Link: http://www.audibletrial.com/observe\nSubscribe: http://www.youtube.com/c/ObserveWithLogan?sub_confirmation=1\n\nMUSIC BY AMARIA: \n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n\"Funky Souls\" | \"Elizabeth's Groove\" | \"Lovely Swindler\" by Amari\u00e0 https://soundcloud.com/amariamusique\nCreative Commons \u2014 Attribution 3.0 Unported  \u2014 CC BY 3.0 \nFree Download / Stream: http://bit.ly/Funky-Souls\nMusic promoted by Audio Library https://youtu.be/jFMCyqKF-EE\nLovely Swindler by Amari\u00e0 https://soundcloud.com/amariamusique\nFree Download / Stream: https://bit.ly/lovely-swindler\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\nBusiness Email: observe.contact@gmail.com",
