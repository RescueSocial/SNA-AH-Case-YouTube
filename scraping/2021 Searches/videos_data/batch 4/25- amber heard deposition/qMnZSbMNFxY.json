Throughout the rigorous battle between Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, it has been seen that the ultimate goal of his ex-wife, Heard, is to destroy his career. He has been dropping hints against Heard yet it seems to have gone unnoticed. I\u2019ll fill you in on all the details, but first, don\u2019t forget to like and subscribe.\n\nJohnny Depp and Amber Heard got married in February of 2015, but unfortunately, this was a marriage that did not last long as the two finalized their divorce in 2017. In just 15 months of marriage, many had discovered in the end that there was something off between the two in their marriage since it culminated in a bitter, nasty divorce. \n\nIt seemed that Johnny Depp could have been crying out for help when they made an appearance in their apology video that was released when Heard got into some pretty big trouble for smuggling their dogs to Australia. Shortly after the incident, there was something that many were very upset about. If you paid close attention to the apology video, you could see how uneasy the two looked together. Since then, many speculated that Depp was forced to appear by Amber\u2019s side in her apology video. Depp seemed a bit off as he tried to hide the fact that they were both going through a rough patch. Speculations towards the couple arose, as something more seemed to have happened outside of the puppy smuggling incident that took place in Australia. \n\nTheir marriage had fallen into a downward spiral after the unfortunate legal incident. Instead of a civil split, the divorce quickly sprawled out of control for both of them. Tensions, accusations, and even legal measures had taken place, ever widening the already great gap between the two. Amber Heard started accusing Depp of several different things, successfully obtaining a restraining order against Johnny Depp. Amber claimed that she was forced to live her life in fear. However, in 2016 an \u201cI want to go home\u201d statement from Johnny Depp was another warning sign from him when his and Heard\u2019s divorce was in the works.",
