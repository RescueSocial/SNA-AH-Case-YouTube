            "description": "Aquaman 2: Amber Heard Shares Excitement For Controversial Return in DCEU Sequel\n\nThe DC Extended Universe is quickly ramping up a massive, new slate of projects that are set to release over the next couple of years starting off with Wonder Woman 1984, which hopes to debut in theaters before the end of 2020. Amongst other exciting sequels and debut franchises will be the much anticipated Aquaman 2 continuing on from 2018's Aquaman, which became the highest-grossing DCEU movie to date and the first to cross $1 billion at the global box office.\n\nInformation regarding this sequel is scarce at the moment due to its release being over two years away, although James Wan is confirmed to return as the director. The film's starring actor Jason Momoa will additionally be taking on writing duties with David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick as he suits up for his fourth appearance as the King of Atlantis, and he will serve as an executive producer on the film as well.\n\nMore news has arrived on another star from the first movie to confirm her return for the sequel, even though it comes alongside some major controversy.\n\nIn a new interview with Entertainment Weekly, DC Extended Universe star Amber Heard confirmed that she will return as Mera for the upcoming untitled Aquaman sequel. Heard also revealed that the film is hoping to start on production sometime next year, and she said\n\n\"I'm super excited about the amount of fan love and the amount of fan appreciation that Aquaman has acquired and that it has garnered so much excitement for Aquaman and Mera that it means we'll be coming back. I'm so excited to film that.\"\n\nThis news arrives following reports that Heard was included as a part of the reshoots for the Snyder Cut of Justice League. It also comes in the midst of an ongoing legal battle with her ex-husband Johnny Depp, which has led to petitions for her removal from the movie and has been signed by over 1 million people this far.\n\nEven though actor's off-screen lives usually don't factor too much into studio decisions on casting, as is usually the case with fan petitions, this is an extremely interesting case considering the circumstances of Amber Heard's legal situation at the moment. The UK courts recently ruled in her favor against Johnny Depp, even considering the mountain of evidence that she may have been the one in the wrong, and the cries from fans to see her replaced as Mera in the DCEU have been overwhelming.\n\nNevertheless, Heard seems excited and grateful to be a part of the upcoming Aquaman sequel, which is currently in its earliest stages of development. She joins Jason Momoa and Patrick Wilson as the only confirmed cast members to return for the sequel, which is set to expand mightily on the world beneath the ocean waves. The central plot of Aquaman 2 will explore the far reaches of the other Seven Kingdoms of Atlantis, and it will be exciting to find out more details as they come.\n\nThe untitled Aquaman sequel is hopeful to begin production in 2021 as it prepares for worldwide release on December 16, 2022.\n\nDisclaimer -\n\nvideo is for educational purpose only.
