            "description": "Full unedited video provided by the certified court videographer.\n\nVideo deposition taken of Homestead Police Officer Alejandro Murguido on October 11th, 2017.\n\nPay attention to the inverted cross he has pinned to his shirt. Was he trying to send a message?\n\nWe talk about two incidents. One Murguido claims happened on July 27th, 2012. This incident never happened. \n\nThe second incident occurred on October 29th, 2012. We had a consensual conversation, then I left and he chased me down. A recording of the conversation is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUS5EzZpwEg\n\nMurguido file a false stalking injunction against me on February 28th, 2013. On the second page of the document you can see his statement of the conversation in the first paragraph of his narrative. His deposition answers nearly perfectly followed this:\nhttps://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3227642-12-First-Stalking-Injunction.html\n\nWhat is most obvious as to Murguido's perjury in deposition and in his sworn statement(s) is that: 1) He never asked me to leave even a single time; 2) I never said I was going to get him and he would see; 3) I never threatened him other than to file a complaint; 4) I never said that I was following him around; 5) I never whistled at him; 6) He never asked me if he was in a police car; 7) He never claimed that under certain situation he was allowed to run through stop signs or speed; 8) I never said I didn't care that he was in a police car; 9) I never said anything about his driving habits in his neighborhood; and 10) He never told me to go to IA and file a complaint if I had a problem.\n\nIt will be interesting to see him on the witness stand as his credibility is impeached.",
