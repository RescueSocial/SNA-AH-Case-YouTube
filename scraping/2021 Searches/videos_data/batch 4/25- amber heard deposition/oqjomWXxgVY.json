            "title": "Jeep Fire & Wrongful Death Case: Deposition of Former Jeep Executive about Gas Tank Location and Re",
            "description": "We traveled to the Florida coast to take the deposition of this former executive, who worked for Fiat Chrysler Automobiles for many years and retired just after the recall of the Jeep Grand Cherokees and Jeep Liberties.  He had been involved in the decisionmaking about the Jeep \"recall\" that had to be done because the gas tanks were getting crushed in rear impact.  He was a high-ranking adviser to Chairman and CEO Sergio Marchionne, who made the ultimate decision regarding trailer hitches.\n\nJeep manufactured and sold millions of SUVs with gas tanks located in the extreme rear of the vehicle, behind the rear axle and right next to the plastic \"bumper.\"  These gas tanks are exposed to rear impact, like the gas tanks on the 1970s-era Ford Pinto.  When these Jeeps get rear-ended, the plastic gas tanks can rupture, spraying gasoline on the roadway and on both vehicles.  If the gasoline catches fire and the people can't escape in time, the occupants the Jeep and the other vehicle can burn to death.\n\nThis has happened over and over again.\n\nIn 2013, the company that owns Jeep, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (\"FCA\"), finally agreed to recall at least some of these Jeeps with exposed gas tanks.  But FCA did not buy the Jeeps back or move the gas tank.  Instead, FCA offered free trailer hitches to some Jeep owners.  That did not fix the problem\u2014and FCA knew that it wouldn't.  Just two years before, an FCA executive had testified under oath that \"the tow package does not protect the tank.\"\n\nThe Jeeps with exposed gas tanks are the 2002-2007 Jeep Liberty, 1993-2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee, 1993-2001 Jeep Cherokee, and 1987-2007 Jeep Wrangler.  Millions of these Jeeps remain on the road.\n\nFCA has refused to take any further action.  FCA claims that thesee Jeeps are \"absolutely safe.\"  In our pending litigation against FCA over these Jeep fires, FCA denies any wrongdoing.  FCA refuses declines to accept any responsibility for the hundreds of Jeep fires.\n\nFor more about Jeep fires and explosions, visit https://butlerfirm.com/jeep-fires-explosions/\n\nFor more about wrongful death cases, visit https://butlerfirm.com/georgia-wrongful-death-statute-explained/\n\nWe\u2019d love to hear what you think!

So please feel free to comment with your thoughts (good or bad) and let us know what other questions you wish we\u2019d asked.
