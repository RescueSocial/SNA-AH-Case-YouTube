            "description": "After months of slipping out of having to actually sit down for the $50 million defamation lawsuit that he launched against\u00a0Amber Heard,\u00a0Johnny Depp\u00a0may have run out of moves.\n\n\u201cPlaintiff John C. Depp, II shall \u2026appear for three successive days in counsel for Defendant\u2019s offices in Virginia \u2026or at such other place in Northern Virginia designated by counsel for Defendant, from November 10-12, 2020, beginning at 10:00 a.m. each day,\u201d declares an order yesterday from Fairfax County VA Circuit Court Chief Judge Bruce White \n\nNo word yet from the Depp camp if the\u00a0Fantastic Beasts\u00a0star plans to fight this order, yet. However, if the Oscar nominee does show up, it looks like it will involve him having to skip out of some of the UK filming of the latest sequel in the WB franchise from J.K Rowling.\n\nIt was the coronavirus delayed start of shooting on the David Yates-directed\u00a0Fantastic Beasts 3\u00a0that was why Depp sought in August to have the commencement of the trial in the contentious\nmatter pushed back to mid-2021 and why he has been supposedly unable to sit with Heard\u2019s lawyers previously. Though the actor has been conducting a mini-grand tour of European film festivals the last month or so, WB SVP for Corporate Legal Wayne M. Smith wrote in a September 8 letter that \u201cwe require Mr. Depp to be in the United Kingdom from September 17 through the anticipated end of production in mid-February, 2021.\u201d\n\nCiting the backlogs COVID-19 has caused in the courts, Judge White\u00a0on September 11\u00a0shoved the previously much delayed trial from its anticipated January 2021 start to May 3 next year. Under that timeline, Depp\u2019s deposition desired dates would have taken place mere weeks before the trial began \u2013 a state of affairs that Heard\u2019s attorneys claim gave them little time.",
