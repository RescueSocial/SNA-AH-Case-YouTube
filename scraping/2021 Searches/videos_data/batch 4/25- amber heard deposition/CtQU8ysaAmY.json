            "description": "The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) and the Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT, and Harvard conducted a virtual meeting, Macrophage Infection by HIV: Implications for Pathogenesis and Cure, from October 13-14, 2021. While CD4+ T cells are the main targets of HIV infection, macrophages also become infected and resist the cytopathic effects of infection, contributing to HIV reservoir persistence. Furthermore, they drive inflammation and can contribute to the development of co-morbidities, including HIV-associated CNS dysfunction.\n\nThis meeting examined emerging data related to macrophage interactions with the immune system during HIV infection, macrophage reservoirs and approaches to their elimination, and the involvement of CNS myeloid reservoirs and associated co-morbidities. The meeting also highlighted recent work on macrophage inflammation in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection and work from new NIMH-funded investigators. A panel discussed research gaps and priorities related to human macrophage reservoirs and inflammation/co-morbidities, and treatment strategies for HIV remission and cure.",
