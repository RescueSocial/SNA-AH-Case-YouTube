A lengthy handwritten ransom note was found in the home. Patricia Ramsey was an American beauty pageant winner who won the Miss West Virginia Pageant at age 20 in 1977. She was best known as the mother of JonBen\u00e9t Ramsey. Burke Ramsay, who spoke about his six-year-old sister's unsolved case for the first time after 20 years of silence on the Dr Phil show was slammed by viewers for his \"alarming\" body language when interviewed about this cold case true crime. And now there is an abc20/20 episode asking \"Who Killed JonBenet Ramsey\".\n\nThe Behavior Panel is a group made up of the world's top body language and behavior experts, Mark Bowden, Scott Rouse, Greg Hartley, and Chase Hughes. Together they analyze the body language and behavior displayed in videos in the public interest. The Behavior Panel is a non-partisan group, looking to educate and entertain the public with their interest and expertise in nonverbal communication, body language, deception detection, interrogation, and resistance to interrogation.\n\nBy looking at the gestures, facial expressions, micro-expressions, and context around what people say, this group of nonverbal behavior experts reveals the possible truth and deceptions.\n\nThis behavior profiler group takes on the task of investigating the behavior behind the crime news that often forces us to think and feel the way we do.
