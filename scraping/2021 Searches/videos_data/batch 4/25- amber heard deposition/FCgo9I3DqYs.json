He rubs his face and appears to be annoyed. This type of nonverbal communication is usually a turnoff for jurors. \nHe stretches then rubs the back of his neck, which signals to opposing counsel that he's tired, disengaged, and his guard is down (i.e., time to attack). It also looks unprofessional.\nJoe looks at his own attorney while answering, which jurors often interpret as \"looking for the answer,\" or \"looking for cues.\" \nJoe's answers in this clip are bad. He's asked whether the lawsuit was already pending at the time he distributed photographs (the topic at issue in the copyright case). He agrees by saying \"yeah.\" Next, opposing counsel inserts the premise that Joe was aware Big Cat Rescue didn't authorize the use of the photographs, to which Joe agrees. Joe then tries to outwit the attorney and somehow dodge liability by saying \"yeah, except I didn't make these.\" But then the attorney gets Joe to admit that he participated in the demonstration and handed out the photos. Joe then denies handing out the photos because he was \"the one in the bunny suit.\" The whole sequence is messy, contains contradictory testimony, and would likely annoy a jury.\n\n\nClick here for a compilation of Roger Stone's Unhinged Greatest Hits https://youtu.be/J2dV93B3Pe4",
