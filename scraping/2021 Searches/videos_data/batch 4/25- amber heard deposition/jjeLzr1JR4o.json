Suits:\n\"Suits\" delves into the fast-paced, high-stakes world of a top Manhattan corporate law firm where hotshot associate Harvey Specter (Gabriel Macht, \u201cLove & Other Drugs\u201d) makes a risky move by hiring Mike Ross (Patrick J. Adams, \u201cOld School\u201d) a brilliant but unmotivated college dropout, as his associate. As he becomes enmeshed in this unfamiliar world, Mike relies heavily on the firm\u2019s best paralegal Rachel (Meghan Markle, \u201cHorrible Bosses\u201d) and Harvey's no-nonsense assistant Donna (Sarah Rafferty, \u201cBrothers & Sisters\u201d) to help him serve justice. With a photographic memory and the street smarts of a hustler, Mike proves to be a legal prodigy despite the absence of bonafide legal credentials.",
