The actress, who filed for divorce from Johnny Depp, said she is giving half the money to the American Civil Liberties Union for its violence against women campaign. The other half will go to the Children's Hospital of Los Angeles. In a statement, she said: \"Money played no role for me personally and never has, except to the extent that I could donate it to charity and, in doing so, hopefully help those less able to defend themselves.\" #InsideEdition",
