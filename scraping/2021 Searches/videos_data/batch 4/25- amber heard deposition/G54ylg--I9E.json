            "description": "In dramatic courtroom testimony, Kyle Rittenhouse, the teenager who fatally shot two people in August 2020 during unrest in Kenosha, Wis., recounted the first deadly shooting.\n\nUntil he began crying, Rittenhouse had been recounting his steps leading up to the moments he opened fire. Rittenhouse also described his prior encounters with Joseph Rosenbaum, the first man he shot, saying that Rosenbaum had been screaming threats at Rittenhouse and others on the streets that night.\n\nLegal experts have said the case effectively boils down to whether jurors believe his self-defense claims, which makes his testimony crucial. Jurors will weigh whether they agree Rittenhouse believed he feared for his safety or life, and his testimony provides them a key window into what he says went through his mind each time he pulled the trigger.
