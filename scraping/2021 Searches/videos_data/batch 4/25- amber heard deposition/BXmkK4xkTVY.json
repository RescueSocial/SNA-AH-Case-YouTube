Of course, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard\u2019s split is certainly no exception. Even though their legal battle has already lasted years, there's a little chance that new participants of the case, like Tesla CEO Elon Musk and actor James Franco, end up testifying in the court case against Amber Heard?\nAccording to court documents obtained by Us Weekly, James Franco and Elon Musk were subpoenaed on October 26, 2021. They were ordered to \u201cproduce the books, record, electronically stored information and tangible things designated and described\u201d \u2014 including \u201cverbal conversations, telephone calls, letters, emails, memoranda and reports\u201d \u2014 by January 17, 2022. As we have already spoken in details about James Franco being dragged to the case in the previous video (if you haven\u2019t seen it, you definitely should), in this episode we are going to reveal all the details about Elon Musk\u2019s who once challenged Johnny Depp to a cage fight. \nJohnny Depp\u2019s legal team is interested in speaking with Elon Mus kand James Franco because they may have a really important information that can help the case going. Here is an official Adam Waldman\u2019s (JD\u2019s lawyer) statement: \u201cWe are interested in James Franco and Elon Musk as fact witnesses because we have evidence they are men who saw Amber Heard\u2019s face in the days and nights between when she claimed Mr. Depp smashed her in the face on May 21 and when she went to court with painted on \u2018bruises\u2019 to obtain temporary restraining order on May 27\u201d.\nThe Tesla billionaire Elon Musk has been involved in Johnny Depp and Amber Heard\u2019s case once again and this time around his connection to Amber/Johnny drama is a little bit different than previously. In short, Elon Musk has been involved to the entire scandal because he dated Amber Heard after the former couple\u2019s split. Elon was first dragged into the dispute last year when Johnny Depp issued subpoena against him. This was part from a separate legal battle between the former couple in the US. \nBut what does Elon have to do with everything that happens on the first place? Well, Elon Musk and Amber Heard had a short-lived romance after her marriage to Johnny Depp collapsed in 2016. However, though JD repeatedly has alleged that Elon and Amber Heard were romantically involved while before their split. Elon Musk has always denied these claims and even joked last summer about settling things with Johnny Depp in a \u201ccage fight\u201d when his name kept coming up at the ongoing UK libel trial. \nMoreover, when Amber and JD\u2019s relationship began to fall apart, Amber was trying to get a restraining order against Johnny Depp and when she decided to this, she shared her thoughts about it with Elon Musk. After she revealed him her thoughts, he offered to pay and provide her with 24-hour security. Moreover, the High Court was told that Elon Musk became a regular late-night visitor to Amber Heard monthly. And allegedly, it all started way back in 2015. And you probably remember that \u2018triangle\u2019 scandal, involving Elon Musk, Amber Heard and British supermodel Cara Delevingne.Well, so many views and opinions. Bit I want to know your thoughts about the entire situation! Do you think Elon Musk\u2019s testimony will help Johnny Depp win the court case? Or the fact that Elon Musk will appear in court will make things only worse for the actor? Let me know your opinion in the comments section down below.
