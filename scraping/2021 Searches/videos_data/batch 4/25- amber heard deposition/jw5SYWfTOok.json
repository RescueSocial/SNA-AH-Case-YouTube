She did the same with Johnny by asking for a divorce settlement of 7 million, which she claimed to have given to two charities. But after the lies, that fact is quite hard to believe. \nThe major blow-up of events occurred when she took advantage of the Me Too movement to expose Johnny by labeling him as an abuser when they were married, which was just the beginning of this entire mess and of course, was quite clearly instigated by Amber. Whether it was for publicity or money we\u2019ll never know.\nAmber came out with allegation after allegation, leaving Depp flabbergasted at how low Amber could stoop, and for a long while kept quiet. She has faked bruises to prove her innocence, posted lies about Depp\u2019s apparent abusive nature in the Washington Post, and even claimed she had tried to assault her sister which we shall get into the deets of later on.",
