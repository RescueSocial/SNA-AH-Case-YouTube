            "description": "Amber Heard LIES About Donating $7 Million Of Divorce Money To Charity!! \n\nSubscribe to The Spotlight \ud83d\udc49  https://bit.ly/3txAgy1\n\nWATCH NEXT: \u25b6\ufe0f\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk62Q2ve1Ck&t=120s\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R74lQyLJmR8\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Weh7DWgL_XQ&t=10s\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRELATED VIDEOS:\ud83d\udc47\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTqgUl0nDjA\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iX63Sqkr8sE\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBgHjlrv-0E\n\n\nThe famous filed by Johnny Depp for a whopping 50 million against Amber along with the case, which Johnny was losing tremendously, is constantly making headlines with its new developments making their way onto the news from time to time. In complete honesty, the storyline of these events between the pair could quite easily be converted into a telenovela show provided a great director is ready to take up this venture. \n\nYes, we are talking about the alleged charity donation that Amber Heard was going to make with the 7 million she scored from the divorce settlement. Amber had stated that she wasn\u2019t comfortable keeping the money of her domestic abuser with her and chose to give it towards a better cause.\n\nThe trial of the highly destructive case was clearly not in favor of Johnny according to both him as well as his barrister Andrew Caldecott QC. But with fresh evidence on the table, things may actually look brighter for Johnny\u2019s fate in the case. \n\nJohnny\u2019s team is currently trying to get back at Amber using the information with regard to her not paying off money towards the charity which she claimed she would do. Amber had publicly announced that she would be donating the 7 million towards organizations that actually needed help with funding. She claimed to have given out the money to two different social causes and organizations. The two organizations that she stated she allegedly donated to were American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the Children's Hospital Los Angeles. She even stated that her donations to ACLU were done keeping in mind the hardships she had to bear with regard to her being a victim of domestic violence and wanted similar victims to benefit from these funds. So according to our unbiased calculation, each organization should\u2019ve received 3.5 million US dollars each. \n\nBut did that actually happen?\nKnowing the recent truth about Amber coming out, it is easy enough to guess that this was a lie too. Evidence to back this claim up came when Mr. Caldecott from the Children's Hospital Los Angeles communicated with Johnny\u2019s business advisor in 2019 claiming that no payments were made by Amber Heard towards the hospital. \n\nAt the when the evidence was brought out, it was found out that Amber had paid just a mere 100,000 dollars towards the Children's Hospital Los Angeles and 450,000 dollars to ACLU. She also stated that she made an anonymous donation of a grand total of 500,000 dollars to ACLU, but that could pretty much be another lie too. \n\nNow, what did Johnny\u2019s team have to state?\nOf course, they weren\u2019t surprised. His team stated that this was all part of the manipulation bandwagon that she has been blinding everyone with for the past few years. Even though Amber has stated that she would be giving out the donations over a course of time, many do not believe this statement of hers either. Depp\u2019s team also spoke up about how she chose to pull off a facade in front of the public to gain sympathy from whoever she could. Not only did she do this, but also was involved in putting Johnny down and bringing her standard up in the eyes of the public. I think it is safe enough to say that the words of a gold digger are quite hard to believe, especially if they claim it is for charity, Mr Caldeco, Guess it was just bad timing for Johnny Depp, especially with the famous Me Too movement blowing up during that time. \n\nThey first had helped put her story out through their newspaper claiming Johnny to be a \u201dWife Beater\u201d. Now, Mr. Adam Wolanski, a representative of the NGN, has stated that even though this bit of evidence can prove Amber to be a gold digger, it does not necessarily support the fact that she wasn\u2019t going to pay what she promised, as she probably planned to do it over a course of time and not at once for her own reasons. \n\nA certain incident was questioned by Depp\u2019s time, that spoke volumes about how the jury wasn\u2019t looking into the evidence as much as they should. On a trip to Australia, Amber claimed to have a life threat against her due to the fact that she was being held hostage for three days all due to Johnny Depp. The truth behind this incident actually happening wasn\u2019t looked into and was blindly believed by the jury, bruises. amber heard aquaman 2 jason momoa clevver news informoverload\namber heard elon musk\n#AmberHeard #JohnnyDeppCase #JusticeForDepp #AmberHeardCase #AmberHeardAudio #JusticeForJohnnyDepp #TheSpotlight",
