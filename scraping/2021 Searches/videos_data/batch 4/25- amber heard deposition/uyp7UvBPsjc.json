            "description": "The House managers wrapped up their arguments against President Trump on Jan. 24. Trump\u2019s team, including lawyers Pat Cipollone and Jay Sekulow, now has 24 hours to present their case. After Trump\u2019s lawyers conclude their presentation, senators will have an opportunity to submit questions to both sides in writing. Following that, debate will turn to whether to call witnesses and subpoena documents.\n\nTrump was impeached by the House of Representatives in December for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. Impeachment does not mean that the president has been removed from office. In the next phase, the Senate must hold a trial to make that determination. A Senate impeachment trial has happened only two other times in American history and once in the modern era. At the center of the Democrats\u2019 case is that Trump sought to withhold military assistance and an Oval Office meeting until Ukraine announced investigations into former vice president Joe Biden and his son.\n\nWatch the debate on Jan. 21 on the rules of the trial: https://youtu.be/yz_J8sfZVEE.\n\nWatch the first day of opening arguments on Jan. 22: https://youtu.be/ttkY4rQqBPw\n\nWatch the second day of opening arguments on Jan. 23: https://youtu.be/1PcqupKuKro\n\nWatch the third day of opening arguments on Jan. 24: https://youtu.be/WpmUGeWzuOg\n\nWatch the first day of Trump\u2019s legal team\u2019s defense: https://youtu.be/WpmUGeWzuOg\n\n#trumpimpeachmenttrial Read more: https://wapo.st/2GnT7UZ.
