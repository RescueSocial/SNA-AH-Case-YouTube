This has been an exhausting endeavor but one I feel to be very worth while.\n\nThis video picks up right where Part 1 left off.  So if you haven't seen that one, you might be a little lost if you go straight into this one.  I see Part 1 as more of a set up for Part 2...which I see as the grand finale.\n\nOnce again, this video may seem more speculative, but I base any of that in facts and sound reason.\n\nThanks again, and feel free to share and comment.  Take care!\n\n\nMusic: \"Creative Minds\" from bensound.com",
