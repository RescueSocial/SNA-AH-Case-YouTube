Sandra teaches us German, Jason probes her on charcuterie, Will auditions for her new marketing campaign, and Sean sings opera. Welcome to SmartLess.\n\nSeries Description: \"SmartLess\" with Jason Bateman, Sean Hayes, & Will Arnett is a podcast that connects and unites people from all walks of life to learn about shared experiences through thoughtful dialogue and organic hilarity. A nice surprise: in each episode of SmartLess, one of the hosts reveals his mystery guest to the other two. What ensues is a genuinely improvised and authentic conversation filled with laughter and newfound knowledge to feed the SmartLess mind.\n\n#Wondery #SmartLess #SandraBullock",
