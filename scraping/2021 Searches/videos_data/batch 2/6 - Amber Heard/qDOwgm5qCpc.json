Infamous audio leak, police officers\u2019 bodycam footage, and many other things were revealed during this never-ending legal battle. However, as you may have noticed, all this evidence is strongly against Amber Heard. Except this one. The recent one. A few weeks ago, Amber Heard secretly welcomed her baby girl Oonagh Paige via surrogate. And now fans (and not only fans, literally everyone) sure that Amber will try to use the child to her advantage - to win a lawsuit against Johnny Depp.\nIt\u2019s been years since the nasty and messy drama started getting really tense between Amber Heard and Johnny Depp. Whether you wanted that or not, you\u2019ve heard about so many plot twists in this ugly divorcing scenario, so it is difficult to surprise you with something unique about the entire situation. According to the recent news and updates, 6 months ago Johnny Depp lost his libel case. Johnny Depp and his legal team tried to fight but there was no chance of winning. Though Johnny Depp has strong support from his fans, things certainly haven't gone JDs way in the courtroom.\nAs for now, even despite the fact that Johnny\u2019s appeal was rejected by the Court of Appeals in March, a separate lawsuit against Amber Heard in the United States is scheduled to go to trial in April 2022. And also, the good news for the actor is that a judge has finally ruled in his favor when it comes to questions over the $ 7 million divorce settlement Johnny Depp had paid Amber Heard after the couple officially divorced in 2016. At the time, Amber Heard pledged to donate the entire settlement to the American Civil Liberties Union and Children's Hospital Los Angeles, but it wasn\u2019t officially proven. \nJohnny Depp's lawyer Andrew Caldecott says that this public pledge made by Heard was nothing more than a \"calculated and manipulative lie,\" meant only to tip the scales \"against Mr. Depp from the very beginning.\" He has introduced evidence to support his claims, alleging that the Children's Hospital Los Angeles wrote to Johnny Depp's business adviser in 2019 and informed them that Amber Heard still hadn't donated the money. And there are so many things that Amber said or did that still remain controversial or questionable. \nIt's obviously been a very messy legal battle, but a good portion of the public seem to believe Johnny Depp's version of events. That is why it seems like Amber Heard has been worried lately and she didn\u2019t know how to make another plot twist. But here we go. Recently, Amber Heard literally shocked the whole world when she revealed she is a mom!\nYes, mom! Out of nowhere, Amber Heard took to IG and shared a photo of herself with a little child, captioning: \u201cI\u2019m so excited to share this news with you. Four years ago, I decided I wanted to have a child. I wanted to do it on my own terms,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI now appreciate how radical it is for us as women to think about one of the most fundamental parts of our destinies in this way. I hope we arrive at a point in which it\u2019s normalized to not want a ring in order to have a crib.\u201d\nShe added, \u201cA part of me wants to uphold that my private life is none of anyone\u2019s business. I also get that the nature of my job compels me to take control of this. My daughter was born on April 8, 2021. Her name is Oonagh Paige Heard. She\u2019s the beginning of the rest of my life.\u201d\nA source exclusively told Page Six on Thursday that Heard is \u201cbeyond in love\u201d with her daughter, Oonagh Paige, whom she named after her late mom, Paige. Also, Amber's friends revealed that Oonagh was born with the help of a surrogate after Amber Heard was told she would never be able to carry her own baby. A source who knows the star told us: \u201cOonagh is absolutely gorgeous, and Amber is besotted. She always knew that she wanted to be a mom, and this is her greatest wish come true. She\u2019s so grateful to the wonderful woman who helped bring Oonagh into her life.\u201d \u201cThe most important thing for Amber is that she\u2019s open about Oonagh\u2019s birth,\u201d the source continued.\n\nBinge Watch - Binge Watch is the best source of the latest celebrity news.
