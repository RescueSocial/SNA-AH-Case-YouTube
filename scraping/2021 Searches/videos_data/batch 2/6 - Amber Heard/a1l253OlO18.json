On May 23, 2016, Heard was granted a short lived restraining order against her husband of 15 months, alleging in court documents that the 52-year-old actor physically abused her throughout their four-year relationship.\n\nCelebrities and friends weigh in on the couple's split, and Heard's allegations she was physically abused by Depp. \n\nIn today\u2019s video are going to tell about 5 celebrities who defended amber heard. \n\n5) iO Tillett Wright\nArtist, actor, and activist iO Wright maybe a friend of Heard who purportedly came to her defense during Heard\u2019s alleged altercation with Depp on Saturday. consistent with Heard\u2019s court filings, Depp demanded Heard call Wright to \u201cprove his paranoid and irrational accusations about some delusional idea he was having.\u201d Heard claims Johnny then \u201cripped the telephone from my hand and commenced screaming profanities and insults at iO.\u201d\n\n\u201cI heard iO yell at me to urge out of the house,\u201d Heard stated. \u201cJohnny then grabbed the telephone, aroused his arms sort of a baseball pitcher, and threw the telephone at me striking my cheek and eye with great force.\u201d\n\n\u201cI immediately covered my face and was crying due to the pain resulting from the phone hitting me. Johnny charged at me, insisting on seeing my face. He taunted me, challenged whether or not the telephone hit me. He then forcibly pulled back my hair as I attempted to face up from the sofa. I then yelled out \u2018Call 911\u2019 hoping it might be heard by iO who was still on the phone. Johnny continued screaming at me, pulling my hair, striking me, and violently grabbing my face,\u201d Heard alleged\n\n4) Samantha Spector\nHigh-profile attorney Samantha Spector, who represented Morena Baccarin in her litigation with ex Austin Chick, is Heard\u2019s lawyer.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, this is often not the primary incident of violence perpetrated by Johnny against Amber,\u201d Spector writes in court documents obtained by PEOPLE. \u201cThere are two other incidents within the past six months. Although Amber is scared of Johnny, she strongly insists that we do everything possible to stay this personal matter out of the media spotlight.\u201d\n\n3) Amanda de Cadenet\nWhile British chat show host Amanda de Cadenet hasn\u2019t released a political statement, the 44-year-old retweeted several messages of support for Heard on Friday and Saturday.\n\nOne day after Heard claimed she was abused by Depp, de Cadenet shared a photograph of herself with Heard and model-turned-actress Amber Valletta during de Cadenet\u2019s May 23 birthday celebration. within the photo, which has since been deleted, Heard is seen smiling but together with her hair placed over half her face.\n\n2) Evan Rachel Wood\nWho? Actress, known for True Blood, Mildred Pierce and therefore the Ides of March.\nIn a tweet that was later deleted, Wood seemed to criticize the way some media outlets had written about Heard's sexuality: \u201cAmber Heard\u2018s sexuality is merely relevant therein bi women are at far greater risk of experiencing intimate partner violence. Bisexuality however isn't a reason for violence. It doesn\u2019t mean Heard is somehow immoral or deserving of abuse.\u201d\n\n1)Andy Richter\nWho? Comedy star and screenwriter, known for his work on the talk show Conan. On May 28, 2016, Richter suggested that Depp and his representatives might be attempting to fire up bad publicity for Heard.\n\nOn May 28, 2016, he tweeted that, one among the items you'll pay a publicist try to form your ex look bad within the press after you have been accused of abuse.\n\nWhat do you think About the Allegations filed by Heard? Does Johnny hit her? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below and If you haven\u2019t subscribed to my channel yet, please do so.
