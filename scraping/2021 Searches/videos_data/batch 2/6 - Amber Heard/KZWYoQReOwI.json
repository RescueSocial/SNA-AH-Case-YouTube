            "description": "\"She Did It To Me\" Elon Musk Exposes Amber Heard...\nAmber Heard and Johnny Depp, are still going through quite the legal battle. This has been a battle that seems to be never ending specifically because of the fact that it got pushed back due to the recent pandemic conditions. Depp and Heard did not end their marriage the usual way and many are aware Heard make some pretty interesting accusations. Throughout this court battle, various celebrities have come forward to defend Depp and many have been called forward as witnesses in this trial. One witness that has played an important, but confusing role in this case is Elon Musk. And it seems that he may be handing more evidence over soon.
