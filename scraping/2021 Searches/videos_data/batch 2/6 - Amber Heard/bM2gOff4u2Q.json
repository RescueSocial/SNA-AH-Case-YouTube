            "description": "Amber Heard Sentenced After Exposed For Fake Photos\u2026 \n\nThe ongoing court battle between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard is unlike any other case seen before, mostly because of how long it has continued on for. The case has caught the attention of so many around the world that a new documentary from Discovery+ has set to air, telling the story of Johnny Depp and Amber Heard's relationship and subsequent breakdown, according to Deadline. Some seem to believe that the case has been followed by so many because of the fact that it still has not been entirely settled, as their court date got pushed back for various reasons. And it seems to be that the further the case gets pushed back, the more evidence is being revealed.
