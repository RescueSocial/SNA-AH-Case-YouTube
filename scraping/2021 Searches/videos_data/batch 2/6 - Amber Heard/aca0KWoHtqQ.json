            "description": "#JusticeForJohnnyDepp #amberheard #metoo #timesup\n\nHey everyone!  Welcome back.  I'll keep this description short.  This is a recorded conversation/argument between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard.  This was recorded just months before they filed for divorce in May 2016.\n\nI know this is a long one, but I encourage you to listen to/watch the entire video.  I feel this finally confirms who the real abuser was in this relationship, and the audio speaks for itself, although I do add some context and insight...but try to keep it to minimum. (Time stamps below)\n\nAmber Admitted to previously hitting Johnny (Video):\nhttps://youtu.be/PbXTr41ZFTQ\n\nAmber Speaking at Women's March (Speech begins at 3:02:12)\nhttps://youtu.be/SmO8Wh0f8tc\n\nTwitter: @ThatBrianFella\n\nI understand there are some who don't like me interrupting the audio to add context or insight.
