            "description": "Claims Johnny Depp wanted Amber Heard replaced in her Aquaman role have resurfaced, following his highly-publicised libel trial.  \u00a0Earlier this year the Pirates Of The Caribbean star lost his trial against The Sun\u2019s publisher NGN Newspapers, over an article that labelled him a \u2018wife-beater\u2019. He has since applied to have the decision overturned.  \u00a0During the trial it was put forward to the court that Depp had demanded former wife Heard \u2013 who he was married to from 2015 to 2017 \u2013 be stripped of her role as Mera in Warner Bros\u2019 Aquaman sequel, with the details re-emerging this week in a lengthy profile on the star.  \u00a0As was reported by Press Association during the trial in July, Sasha Wass QC, for NGN, told the court \u2018from the moment Ms Heard petitioned for divorce and for a restraining order, the full brute force of Mr Depp and his PR machine was engaged\u2019.  \u00a0She said: \u2018Reports appeared in the press suggesting that she was a gold digger. Mr Depp personally set out to damage her career.\u2019  \u00a0Wass said that after Depp sent a text to his sister saying: \u2018I want her replaced on that WB film\u2019 \u2013 a reference to the Warner Brothers film Aquaman \u2013 \u2018a petition garnered the support of 400,000 people [quoted at the time of trial] to have Ms Heard removed from the film\u2019.  \u00a0According to The Hollywood Reporter, which published the profile this week, the messages were sent to Depp\u2019s sister, producer Christi Dembrowski, \u2018who previously had a deal with the studio and was influential there\u2019.   \u00a0It comes amid a petition, titled \u2018Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman 2\u2032, which has reached 1.7million signatures.   \u00a0However, the star, who appeared in the 2018 superhero film opposite Jason Momoa, confirmed last month she would be returning for the sequel which is set to film next year.  \u00a0She recently said: \u2018I\u2019m super excited about the amount of fan love and the amount of fan appreciation that Aquaman has acquired and that it has garnered so much excitement for Aquaman and Mera that it means we\u2019ll be coming back. I\u2019m so excited to film that.\u2019  \u00a0The petition, started by Jeanne Larson, alleged that Amber is a \u2018known and proven abuser\u2019, and claims that she has \u2018systematically crusaded to ruin Depp in Hollywood\u2019.  \u00a0Both Depp and Heard alleged abuse by the other during the libel trial, and also both denied allegations against them.  \u00a0A judge eventually ruled in favour of The Sun, saying they were accurate in calling Depp a \u2018wife beater\u2019 in an article headline.  \u00a0In the wake of his trial loss, Depp resigned from his role as Gellert Grindelwald in the Fantastic Beasts franchise, after being asked to by Warner Bros, and has since been replaced by Mads Mikkelsen however the profile claimed he was still paid $16million (\u00a312m) for the one scene he\u2019d shot before stepping down.   \u00a0He continues to remain in advertisements for Dior\u2019s Sauvage fragrance.",
