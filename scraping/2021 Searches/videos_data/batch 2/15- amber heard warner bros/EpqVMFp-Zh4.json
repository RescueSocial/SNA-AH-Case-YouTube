            "description": "For the past year or so,\u00a0Pirates of the Caribbean\u00a0Captain Jack Sparrow actor, Johnny Depp, and his ex-wife, Amber Heard, have gotten more than their fair share of negative press.\nFollowing a report that he had allegedly abused Heard on multiple occasions, Depp filed a lawsuit against U.K. News Group Newspaper publication,\u00a0The Sun,\u00a0purporting that he was never the instigator of any domestic violence.\u00a0He lost the lawsuit in November 2020, but an appeal is expected.\nIt is worth noting that two of Depp\u2019s former parters, Winona Ryder and Vanessa Paradis,\u00a0both supported the actor\u00a0throughout the libel case.\n\nDepp\u2019s lawyer and the actor himself continue to claim there was never any spousal abuse, while Heard and her camp\u00a0allege that she was held \u201chostage\u201d in Australia\u00a0during the filming of a\u00a0Pirates of the Caribbean\u00a0movie, among other things.\n\nDepp \u2014\u00a0whose finger was cut off during an argument at one point\u00a0in the tumultuous relationship \u2014\u00a0has been blacklisted by many of the movie studios who previously worked with him.\n\nWalt Disney Studios has\u00a0reportedly replaced him with Margot Robbie\u00a0in the upcoming\u00a0Pirates of the Caribbean 6\u00a0project. Meanwhile, Warner Bros.\u2019\u00a0Harry Potter Fantastic\u00a0Beasts franchise recast Gellert Grindelwald\u00a0with Mads Mikkelsen (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story) after the libel trial ended.\n\nMany of Johnny Depp\u2019s fans believe that Heard should face the same industry backlash. A petition for her to be fired from Warner Bros.\u2019 film adaptations of DC Comics\u2019\u00a0Aquaman\u00a0franchise\u00a0has garnered wide support, with nearly two million signatures.\n\nNow, as\u00a0Yahoo! News\u00a0shared, Heard has reportedly been let go from her role as Mera \u2014 but not for the reasons you probably think:\nAt this time, Warner Bros. has not confirmed Heard\u2019s exit from the\u00a0Aquaman 2\u00a0movie. Per\u00a0IMDb, Heard also played Mera in Zack Snyder\u2019s\u00a0Justice League, which recently finished filming.\n\nFor Depp\u2019s part, the actor\u2019s best hope for a career revival is likely to be\u00a0longtime friend and professional partner, Tim Burton. The director has cast Depp in numerous projects over the years. Burton is currently working on\u00a0Beetlejuice 2\u00a0and an\u00a0Addams Family\u00a0TV adaptation\u00a0\u2014 Depp\u2019s name has been connected to both projects.",
