            "description": "Amber Heard has seemingly responded to Johnny Depp fans\u2019 campaign to have her axed from the upcoming Aquaman 2, following Depp\u2019s libel trial loss in the UK.   \u00a0Last week Depp stepped down from the role of Gellert Grindelwald in the Harry Potter spin-off Fantastic Beasts, after being asked to do so by Warner Bros following the trial.  \u00a0Not long after, his fans started a Change.org. petition to have Heard, who was married to Depp from 2015 to 2017, dropped from her role in the Aquaman sequel, which has so far reached more than 1million signatures.  \u00a0Heard has now commented on her role in the DC film in an interview with  Weekly in which she appeared to rubbish any rumour she wouldn\u2019t be making her return as Mera.  \u00a0She told the publication: \u2018I\u2019m super excited about the amount of fan love and the amount of fan appreciation that Aquaman has acquired and that it has garnered so much excitement for Aquaman and Mera that it means we\u2019ll be coming back.  \u00a0\u2018I\u2019m so excited to film that.\u2019  \u00a0The actor added production hopes to get underway sometime in 2021.  \u00a0Her comments follow the judge\u2019s findings of Depp\u2019s trial against The Sun\u2019s publishers after he sued following an article which branded the actor a \u2018wife-beater\u2019.  \u00a0In delivering his verdict, Justice Nicol found that 12 of the 14 alleged incidents of domestic violence did occur.  \u00a0Depp\u2019s lawyers said they want to appeal the \u2018perverse\u2019 verdict.   \u00a0In a handwritten statement last week, the Pirates Of The Caribbean star confirmed he was leaving the Fantastic Beasts franchise.  \u00a0Depp wrote on Instagram: \u2018Firstly, I\u2019d like to thank everybody who has gifted me with their support and loyalty.  \u00a0\u2018I have been humbled and moved by your many messages of love and concern, particularly over the last few days.  \u00a0\u2018Secondly, I wish to let you know that I have been asked to resign by Warner Bros from my role as Grindelwald in Fantastic Beasts and I have respected and agreed to that request.  \u00a0\u2018Finally, I wish to say this. The surreal judgement of the court in the UK will not change my fight to tell the truth and I confirm that I plan to appeal.\u2019  \u00a0Despite stepping down, the actor will reportedly get his full salary for the film, for which he shot just one scene.  \u00a0According to the Hollywood Reporter, Depp had a \u2018pay-or-play contract\u2019, which requires that he be fully compensated whether or not the film is made and even if it is recast.   \u00a0The star is believed to have been on an eight-figure salary, and was the highest paid out of his co-stars Eddie Redmayne, who plays Newt Scamander, and Jude Law, who plays Dumbledore.",
