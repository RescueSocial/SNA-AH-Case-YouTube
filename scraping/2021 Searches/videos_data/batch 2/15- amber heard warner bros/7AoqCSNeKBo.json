The film also stars J. K. Simmons as Commissioner Gordon, while Amy Adams, Jeremy Irons, and Jesse Eisenberg reprise their roles as Lois Lane, Alfred Pennyworth, and Lex Luthor, respectively. Earlier this month, he announced Snyder behind the scenes footage, October 7, coinciding with the last day of filming in the UK\n\nIn a recent interview with the variety, Gadot addressed sexuality Wonder Woman comics after writer Greg Rucka said that \"obviously\" had relationships with other women.\n\nGadot said his sexuality in the upcoming film \"Wonder Woman\" is \"something we have not explored.\"\n\n\"In this movie, she does not experience any bisexual relations,\" he said. \"But it's not about that. She is a woman who loves people for what they are. She can be bisexual. She loves people by their hearts.\"\n\nWarner Bros. will release \"Justice League\" on 17 November 2017 with a sequel yet-to-be-titled expected to be released on June 14, 2019. \"Wonder Woman\" opens June 2.\n\nJustice League - First look at Amber Heard as Mera:\n\nIt's all or nothing at this point to Warner Bros. and DC Comics universe with its cinematic superheroes. It's not as if his films have not been a financial success so far, but have taken a forthright criticism of the box office thanks to rampant interference study and a clear direction. Justice League, on the other hand, is trying to change all that. great movie team up Zack Snyder will offer all kinds of heroes, the brutal billionaires who are confused by the tsunami crushers owls titaNc depths.\nAnd some secondary characters added to the mix as well. IGN revealed the first look at Aquaman's greatest ally, as Amber Heard donned the uniform of a royal armor for SmackDown.\n\nAnd this is a concept art design by Ian Joyner io9 through.\n\nDamn, that looks absolutely fantastic. Say what you like about Snyder, but production usually involves some absolutely fantastic costume design. In the DC Comics material source, Mera becomes Aquaman's wife and queen of Atlantis. She is also a formidable, able to match blows with Foes heavyweight thanks to its unique biology that allows him to survive the crushing pressure of the deep ocean fighter.\n\nBut it's his skill with Hydrokinesis really makes him dangerous. Mera can increase the density of water around, essentially, tightening and remodeling in various forms of effective combat which can crush enemies. It is basically a master water below. Anyway, that's a first look fantastic on Queen Atlante, although do not expect her to have too much of a role to play in the league of justice.\n\nMera Amber Heard will, however, be much more prominent in the film by James Wan Aquaman, which begins filming next year. As for the Justice League, which is currently still on track for a launch in November 2017. And hopefully not blow your load before then reveal with too much hype this time. There is nothing wrong with keeping a few of revealing the secret, ya dig?\n\n\nI created this video with the YouTube Video Editor (http://www.youtube.com/editor)",
