Jason Momoa was seen in the role of Arthur Curry AKA Aquaman. Willem Dafoe played Vulko, Patrick Wilson played Orm / Ocean Master, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II played Black Manta, Dolph Lundgren played Nereus, Nicole Kidman played Atlanna, Temuera Morrison played Tom Curry, and Ludi Lin played Captain Murk were among the other notable cast members.\n\nBut Amber Heard\u2019s court struggle with ex-husband Johnny Depp has received a lot of public attention in recent years. Despite the fact that the pair had split in 2017, judicial processes in respect to domestic violence accusations and Johnny Depp\u2019s libel action were still ongoing in 2021.\n\nIn the middle of the libel action, Warner Bros. withdrew Johnny Depp from his part in the Fantastic Beasts film trilogy. As per We Got This Covered, Amber Heard supporters turned upon her due to the legal fight, and many joined a Change.org petition to have her withdrawn from the Aquaman 2 movie.\n\nThis all began when Amber Heard\u2019s audio confession to physical attack leaked online. Previously, Johnny Depp was viewed as the culprit, however, this flipped things around. Fans of the Fantastic Beasts star staged protests to have Heard removed from Aquaman. Soon afterward, this was reported that the DC creators were thinking about that as well.",
