Now, on to the video:\nIf you haven\u2019t been living under a rock, you\u2019ve probably heard all about the Johnny Depp and Amber Heard fiasco somewhere on the internet. It\u2019s one narrative that has its twists and turns especially regarding the accusations the couple has made against each other. \nBut to keep you refreshed, the pair have been dating for quite a while before eventually getting hitched together in a Los Angeles private ceremony in 2015. However, one year later, multiple sources have reported that Amber has officially filed for divorce from Johnny alongside a temporary restraining order on the grounds of physical abuse. She said that at the time of the divorce an incident took place wherein Johnny had lost control and threw his phone at her eventually leaving Amber bruised in her face. However, an insider had told People magazine that there were no investigations or proof that such a crime had taken place.\nAnd while they have been officially separated since 2017, Heard took it to The Washington Post in 2018 to write an op-ed for speaking out about women and domestic abuse and Johnny did not take it lightly. \n\u201cI became a public figure representing domestic abuse, and I felt the full force of our culture\u2019s wrath for women who speak out,\u201d she wrote in the article.\nJohnny eventually sued Amber for $50 million for defamation over the said article. He stated that Amber was not a victim of domestic abuse but is rather a perpetrator and went on call the allegations as an \u201celaborate hoax to generate positive publicity\u201d for Amber.\n\u201cThe op-ed depended on the central premise that Ms. Heard was a domestic abuse victim and that Mr. Depp perpetrated domestic violence against her,\u201d Johnny\u2019s lawyers said.\nIn 2020, phone recordings of Amber blatantly admitting to having hit Johnny on multiple occasions.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what the motion of my actual hand was, but you\u2019re fine, I did not hurt you, I did not punch you, I was hitting you,\u201d she said in the phone call.\nAnd as mentioned, the whole situation has been quite damaging for their careers as Johnny announced on Instagram in November 2020 that he has been asked to resign from his role as Grindelwald in the third \u201cFantastic Beasts\u201d film \u2013 a role he had successfully been playing since 2017.",
