            "description": "#WeGotYourMail #ViewerQuestions #T3Medias\n\n1. BigBurg 97 (Reaction Intermission) Do whatever you want. It's your channel.\n2. Jerf1 (Wonder Woman 84) I think they're going to release it in theaters but also put it on streaming.\n3. Miguel G  \u2022 I'm new to the channel. Love your reaction to bill burr. He's my favorite comedian by far.  Have you checked out jo koy?\n4. Christopher Carbana (Taylor Swift Fight For Her Master Copies) I mean if she was the one writing the songs composing all the music and doing all the studio work sure but all those files belong to the label\n5. James Merlaut (New member Regarding CMA Awards) No clue what this is \ud83e\udd28\ud83e\udd28\ud83e\udd28\n6. Jeanne Cihla  \u2022 2 Ezra and amber need to go. If you use the reasons Mr. Depp was fired those two should be fired also. Double standards!\n7. Wendy Bryant  \u2022 Amber needs to go!!!!!! She will eventually get what's coming to her.\n8. Chogyam headroom  \u2022 Amy camera upgrade??  Just a thought.\n9. Paul Simmons  \u2022 Where was the mainstream media  During the case? Why do you think internet social media was exposing this first. When the verdict comes out then it's all in the newspaper. Just imagine JD kids. They never liked AH in the beginning.\n10. JoeHell67 - Depp was asked to step back from his role, what I read...I don't know about Amber Heard, why can't you at least question her role?\n11. merdelune9  \u2022 I don\u2019t even watch Depp movies, and I\u2019m on team justice for Johnny.  When I first heard that he beat his wife back in 2016 (I thought he was still with Paradis, so I assumed it was her that he abused), I believed it.\n12. Christopher Smith  \u2022 A libel or defamation case is very difficult to win. Although you can be right overall, any small detail can make it as though you've lost. Not an attorney.\n13. Scott Jackson \u2022 If Heard keeps the role, then that's an admission by Warner Brothers to their stockholders that they like losing millions of dollars.\n14. Channel Member James Merlaut \u2022 It genuinely sickens me how WB could treat Johnny like this. Like seriously, did Amber do \"stuff\" for the WB executive board? Because otherwise, why are they in charge of developing movies if they're this dense.\n15. David Irvine: [t3medias.com] JDW As T'Challa. Yes! Thank you for saying this. JDW is the guy to continue the story of TChalla. Was saying this weeks ago. Same exact reasons too. Best reason Chadwick would have wanted this and bet he would have because of Denzel.
