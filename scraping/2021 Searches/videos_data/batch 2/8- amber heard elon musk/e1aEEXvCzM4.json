            "description": "Elon Musk Challenges Johnny Depp To A \u2018Cage Fight\u2019 Amid Amber Heard Rumors\n\nIn case you haven\u2019t been keeping up with the ongoing legal drama between actors Johnny Depp and Amber Heard, one of the celebrities who\u2019s been dragged into the proceedings between the ex-couple is SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk, who dated Heard following her separation from Depp. Just last month, it was alleged that Musk had not only an affair with the Aquaman actress while she was still married to the Pirates of the Caribbean actor, but that Musk also had a threesome with Heard and Suicide Squad actress Cara Delevingne inside Depp\u2019s own LA penthouse.\n\nNot only is Elon Musk denying these allegations, but he\u2019s also willing to face off against Johnny Depp in a cage fight\u2026 sort of. First off, here\u2019s what Musk recently had to say about about the affair and threesome rumors:\n\nI definitely was not having an affair with Amber while she was married to Johnny, this is totally false. We did not have the threesome, you know. So I think people think these things are generally more salacious than they are.\n\nElon Musk then added in his interview with The New York Times that he recommends that Johnny Depp and Amber Heard \u201cbury the hatchet and move on,\u201d and that he hopes Depp (who has derogatorily referred to the industrialist as \u201cMollusk\u201d) \u201crecovers from this situation.\u201d However, when it was noted how a text message was read in court where Depp threatened to Heard that he\u2019d cut off a part of Musk\u2019s, shall we say, lower-down anatomy, Musk jokingly continued\nIf Johnny wants a cage fight, just let me know.\n\nWhile the prospect of Elon Musk and Johnny Depp going mano-a-mano would surely make for quite the pay-per-view spectacle, it doesn\u2019t sound like Musk is truly willing to engage in such a brawl. Still, considering that Musk told podcaster Joe Rogan a couple years back that he\u2019s trained in various martial arts, no doubt he\u2019d be able to hold his own quite well. Nevertheless, this cage fight undoubtedly stands just as much a chance as happening as that fight between Justin Bieber and Tom Cruise: next to zero.\n\nEven ignoring the Amber Heard/Elon Musk/Cara Delevingne threesome claim, the last month alone has been full of wild developments in the legal clashes on the Heard and Johnny Depp front. As part of Depp\u2019s lawsuit against The Sun, which described the actor as a \u201cwife beater\u201d This includes a picture of an alleged poop Heard took on Depp\u2019s bed being shared online, Heard claiming that Depp dangled a dog outside of a car and the actress admitting that she punched her ex-husband, but saying that it was in self defense. Suffice it to say that this particular celebrity drama isn\u2019t dying down anytime soon.\n\nAs for Elon Musk, while he\u2019s best known for his work in the realms of science and engineering, he also has made a name for himself in some entertainment ventures lately. Last November, he voiced an alternate version of himself known as Elon Tusk in an episode of Rick and Morty, and he\u2019s also collaborating with Tom Cruise for the first movie to actually film in outer space.\n\nStay tuned to CinemaBlend for more updates on the continuing Johnny Depp and Amber Heard saga, and head over to our 2020 release schedule to learn what movies are supposed to hit theaters later this year.",
