            "description": "Amber Heard ADMITS Cheating On Johnny Depp With Elon Musk. \nAmber Heard is no stranger to being in the news; from being in a long, dirty legal case with former husband and actor, Johnny Depp, to rumors of hooking up with Elon Musk, to welcoming her first child Oonagh Paige through a surrogate, Amber Heard appears to be one of the most-discussed women in the past few months. \n\nAmber Heard and Johnny Depp were once in love, but today they are both in court trying to save their reputation. It is no longer news that Heard accused her former husband, and even though this accusation comes with incriminating evidence, fans and friends of Johnny Depp have refused to come to terms with the accusations. In fact, Johnny Depp has maintained innocence since the start of the case. \n\nRecently, Amber Heard became the antagonist in her own story when reports emerged that there are chances that she made up the story. Now, there are clear indications that she cheated while still being married to Johnny Depp. Sounds interesting?
