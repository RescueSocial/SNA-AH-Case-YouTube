Expressing his heartbreak over their parting, he spoke of his recent breakup with ex-girlfriend Amber Heard. It's an usual move for Musk. In 2010 he said that he would \"rather stick a fork in my hand than write about my personal life.\"\nThe CEO of Tesla and SpaceX went on to discuss how difficult it is for him to meet people. He says he is looking for a long-term relationship \u2014 and a soul mate. Musk even asked interviewer Neil Strauss if there was anyone Strauss thought he should date. He told Rolling Stone, \"If I'm not in love, if I'm not with a long-term companion, I cannot be happy. I will never be happy without having someone.\"\nhttp://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-relationships-2017-11\nhttp://www.wochit.com\n\nThis video was produced by YT Wochit News using http://wochit.com",
