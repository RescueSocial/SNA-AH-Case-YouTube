            "description": "Johnny Depp has been challenged to a cage fight by Elon Musk after evidence was given in court claiming Depp believed the billionaire had been having an affair with actress Amber Heard during her relationship with the Pirates of the Caribbean actor. \u00a0London's High Court heard how Musk visited Heard at the Los Angeles penthouse she shared with Depp during their marriage.  \u00a0Musk has denied sleeping with Heard behind Depp's back and has jokingly challenged the actor to a \"cage fight\" after claims were made in court that Depp had threatened to cut off Musk's manhood. \u00a0He said his relationship with Heard started after she had filed for divorce. \u00a0 Musk, 49, told the New York Times: \"I definitely was not having an affair with Amber while she was married to Johnny, this is totally false.\"  \u00a0 Asked about claims made in legal documents that he had a threesome with Heard, 34, and model Cara Delevingne, 27, in Depp\u2019s penthouse, Musk said: \"We did not have the threesome, you know.  \"So I think people think these things are generally more salacious than they are.\"  Musk added to the publication: \"Well, yeah, I hope he recovers from this situation.  \"If Johnny wants a cage fight, just let me know.\"  \u00a0 Depp and Heard's turbulent relationship has been laid bare during a three week High Court showdown against The Sun.  Depp is suing the publication and its Executive Editor for libel after they branded him a 'wife beater' in a comment piece in 2018.  The piece criticised Harry Potter author JK Rowling for \"standing by\" Depp and keeping him in her Fantastic Beasts movie franchise.   \u00a0 Depp's ex-wife Amber Heard appeared in the courts as a key witness for the defence.  Johnny categorically denies claims that he was physically violent to Heard during their relationship.  Heard claims Depp was violent towards her 14 times.",
