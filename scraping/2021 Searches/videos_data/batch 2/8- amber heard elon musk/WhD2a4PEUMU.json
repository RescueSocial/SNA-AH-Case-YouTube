            "description": "Amber Heard is Planning to Wed Billionaire Boyfriend Elon Musk and Hopes to Start a Family Together.\n\nHer bitter divorce with ex-husband Johnny Depp finally went through in January this year. But Amber Heard has seemingly not been put off marriage and is said to be 'making plans' to wed billionaire boyfriend Elon Musk. The 30-year-old actress is looking to 'settle down and have a family' with the Tesla boss, her father has revealed.\n\nAmber's father David told Grazia magazine, 'Amber and Elon are both very serious about each other. She would love to get married. \n\n'One of the things they want to do is settle down and have a family. They are making plans for that.' Amber was first linked to Musk last summer, after the pair were spotted together on several occasions both in London and Miami.\n\nThe Rum Diary actress is said to be 'smitten' with Musk following her divorce with Johnny. A source told the Mirror in January, 'Amber is over the moon about her divorce but she is even happier about being able to go public with Elon.'She was telling friends over Christmas how smitten she is with Elon. 'They are already planning a lot of adventures together and she's relieved she can move on with her life. It's an exciting new chapter for both of them.'\n\nMusk, who is reportedly worth an eye-watering \u00a39.2billion - reportedly 'became infatuated' with Amber after the two appeared in the 2013 film Machete Kills, according to The Hollywood Reporter.",
