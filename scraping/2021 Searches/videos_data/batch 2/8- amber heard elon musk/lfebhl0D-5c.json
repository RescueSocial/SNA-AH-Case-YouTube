The staff at Johnny Depp's penthouse has reportedly confirmed that Musk arrived late at night and left the next morning.\n\nThe lawsuit filed by Depp further mentions that the staff at Depp's penthouse had reportedly given access to the garage and elevator. News reports further add that Amber Heard had shown violent behaviour toward Johnny Depp in Australia when the latter wanted a post-nuptial agreement with respect to their assets.  \n\n'The Pirates of the Caribbean' actor has received the court's permission to go ahead with his defamation case against former wife Amber Heard. \n\nAs per the media reports, the actress, in an article,  had revealed details of her experience of domestic violence without particularly naming Johhny Depp. 'The Aquaman' actress stated that she faced the worst force of their culture.\n\nThe court has allowed Johnny Depp to go forward with his legal case against former wife under the assumption that she aimed her allegations of domestic violence on him.",
