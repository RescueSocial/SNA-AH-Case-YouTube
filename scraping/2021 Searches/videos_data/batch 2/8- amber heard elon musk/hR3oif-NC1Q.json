            "description": "\u201cInstead of continuing with a linear economy, let\u2019s work towards a circular economy that enables us to use our planets resources responsibly. Let\u2019s think in cycles.\u201d Anna Goldhofer works from within the industry to create the change we need to tackle climate change. Anna is a sustainability expert and activist that wants industries to act circular and more responsibly. In her talk she proposes a change of mindset and gives insights how to adapt circularity within industries and explains 4 ways how to combine action with a circular economy. \u201cLet\u2019s treat this crisis like the existential emergency it is. Time is running against us.\u201d She speaks as a sustainability expert and activist. She studied industrial engineering, what creates the basis for her broad understanding of materials, lifecycles, resource management and recycling possibilities. She understands herself as a young global citizen, aligning her daily doings with the UNs Sustainable Development Goals. Anna is highly committed to take action, to learn, to empower and to develop solutions which positively impact the future of our planet and its people. Her utmost believe is that regarding the state our planet is in, it is important to question whether what we do in our everyday life has a positive impact on the world. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at https://www.ted.com/tedx",
