Elon Musk spoke out after being accused of having a \u201cthree-way affair\u201d with his ex Amber Heard and Cara Delevingne.\nCelebrity Sex Confessions\n\n\u201cCara and I are friends, but we\u2019ve never been intimate. She would confirm this,\u201d the Tesla CEO, 48, said in a statement to Page Six on Thursday, June 18. \u201cAlso, I wish to confirm again that Amber and I only started going out about a month after her divorce filing. I don\u2019t think I was ever even in the vicinity of Amber during their marriage!\u201d\n\n\nMusk\u2019s response came one day after the Daily Mail reported that Josh Drew, a friend and former neighbor of Heard and her ex-husband Johnny Depp, participated in a deposition in the former couple\u2019s ongoing legal battle. Drew, who was previously married to the actress\u2019 MMA fighter pal Raquel \u201cRocky\u201d Pennington, reportedly claimed that Musk, Heard, 34, and Delevingne, 27, had a threesome at the Pirates of the Caribbean star\u2019s Los Angeles home in late 2016.\n\n\u201cThey were having a three-way affair, correct?\u201d attorney Benjamin Chew asked during the deposition, according to the U.K. newspaper, to which Drew responded, \u201cMy understanding, yes.\u201d\n\n\nMusk was previously accused of having an affair with Heard before she filed for divorce from Depp, 57, in May 2016 after one year of marriage. The SpaceX founder denied the allegation at the time.\n\nOn Thursday, Musk urged the Rum Diary costars to \u201cbury the hatchet and move on\u201d as their messy legal drama continues to make headlines more than three years after they finalized their divorce.\n\n\u201cLife is too short for such extended negativity,\u201d the tech entrepreneur told Page Six. \u201cNobody is going to say, after it\u2019s all over, that they wished the court battle had lasted longer!\u201d\n\n\nMusk and Heard were in an on-off relationship from 2016 to 2018. He is now dating Grimes, with whom he welcomed a son named X AE A-XII in May, the same month Delevingne split from Ashley Benson.",
