            "description": "Hidden in eastern Indiana is a building that tells stories of time. Once a Jail, it helped hold the accused and guilty away from society. This building had an addition on it that allowed the county sheriff to reside here and watch over the prisoners. While the building didnt have a large amount of cells it was still enough to get by and sometime before its closure showed issues and following new regulation had to be updated. Now it is a home for the owner who intended to actually turn it into a musuem, but quickly found out its secrets. During the tour he tells of hearing footsteps and of seeing stange sights. I hope to see what he sees.\nLocation- Blackford County Jail, Hartford City, Indiana",
