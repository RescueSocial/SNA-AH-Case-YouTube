Each episode outlines the motivation for murder, whether it be revenge against a cheating husband or lover, a large insurance payoff, or the ending to years of abuse, with each murder's circumstances as unique as the women profiled.\n\n#Snapped #truecrime2021\n\n\u2705 Join Group Telegram: https://t.me/joinchat/gbFdTQ0Xn0FkMTU1\n\nDISCLAIMER: Copyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for \"fair use\" for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.
