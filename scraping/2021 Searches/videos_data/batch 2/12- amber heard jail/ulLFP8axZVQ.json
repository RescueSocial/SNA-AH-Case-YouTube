            "description": "What does it take to keep America\u2019s young men from going to jail again and again? Roca, a Massachusetts-based nonprofit organization, helps hundreds of very high-risk young people stay out of harm\u2019s way and go to work. Those young people say that Roca is a pain in the ass and \u201clike that annoying fly that never goes away,\u201d and Molly Baldwin, Roca\u2019s founder and CEO, agrees. She suggests that if we want to see any change happening for these young men, we should start by changing ourselves first.\n\nMolly Baldwin is the Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Roca, Inc. A graduate of UMass, Amherst, Molly began her professional life as a street worker and community organizer, and soon founded Roca in 1988.\r\n\r\nFor over twenty-eight years, she has been a tireless advocate, mentor, and community convener, reaching out to the highest-risk young people from Massachusetts\u2019 most dangerous urban communities, and bringing together the major institutions, corporations, and agencies that affect these young people\u2019s lives. With the help of engaged institutions and Roca\u2019s committed staff, Molly\u2019s efforts at Roca have helped thousands of young people make positive and profound changes in their lives.\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
