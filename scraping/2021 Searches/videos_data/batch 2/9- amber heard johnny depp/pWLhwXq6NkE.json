            "description": "Amber Heard Assistant EXPOSES Her For Ruining Johnny Depp\nThe case between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard is a complicated one to say the least. Not just because of the clear hatred shared between these two, but how far each one is willing to go in order to prove either their innocence, or the other's guilt. More recently, the tales of the trial have been focusing more on Johnny Depp because of his findings about Amber Heard and whether she's been lying to the court or not. And now, someone from Amber's past is opening up about how that is more true than people realize. We'll break it down for you.

A look at how people outside of Johnny Depp are going and revealing certain things about Amber Heard that might just turn the entire case on its head.
