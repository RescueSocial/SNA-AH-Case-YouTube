            "description": "Johnny Depp has been accused of slapping  Amber Heard three times after she laughed at his 'Wino Forever' tattoo that he had changed from Winona Ryder's name on the second day of his blockbuster libel case. The Hollywood legend, 57, is suing The Sun newspaper after it labelled him a 'wife beater'. Yesterday he denied the claims and branded them 'sick' and 'completely untrue'. Today Depp, who is being cross-examined at the High Court in London, was asked by The Sun's lawyer Sasha Wass QC if he had taken cocaine at the time of the alleged incident in March 2013. Ms Wass put it to Depp that the actor first hit Heard, 34, in early 2013 - one of 14 separate allegations of domestic violence, all denied by  Depp, relied on by The Sun in their defence.\n\nOriginal Article: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8501429/Johnny-Depp-vs-Amber-Heard-round-two-Hollywood-legend-arrives-stand-second-day.html\nOriginal Video: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/video/newsalerts/video-2206772/Johnny-Depp-Amber-Heard-arrive-High-Court.html\n\nDaily Mail Facebook: http://facebook.com/dailymail\nDaily Mail IG: http://instagram.com/dailymail\nDaily Mail Snap: https://www.snapchat.com/discover/Daily-Mail/8392137033\nDaily Mail Twitter: http://twitter.com/MailOnline\nDaily Mail Pinterest: http://pinterest.co.uk/dailymail\nDaily Mail Google+: https://plus.google.com/+DailyMail\n\nGet the free Daily Mail mobile app: http://dailymail.co.uk/mobile",
