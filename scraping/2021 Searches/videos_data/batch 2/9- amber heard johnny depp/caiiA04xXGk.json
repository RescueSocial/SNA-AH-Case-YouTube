            "description": "#JusticeForJohnnyDepp \n\nPrevious video: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPI3...\n\n\nI think the video I recently uploaded about Raven Symon\u00e9, gave many of us the impression Raven is on Depp's side. Raven put out a video which discussed how she saw Amber Heard at the same Tesla charging station. Amber Heard was seen freaking out, by Raven and her wife. \n\nI did some research after this, only to find that Johnny Depp is one of the accounts Raven follows; Raven does NOT, however, follow Amber Heard! Thank you to the Twitter user who pointed this out; I apologize for not remembering who tagged me, as I get many notifs a day. \n\nMy links: \nTwitter: iamDrSoup",
