Depp portrayed Thompson in \"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\" and the two were close friends until Thompson took his life. Like any good friend, Depp helped pay for Thompson's elaborate cannon-firing funeral, then set about bringing one of the author's written works to life. \n\nIf you're a fan of \"Fear and Loathing\" then you'll love \"The Rum Diary,\" starring Depp, Aaron Eckhart, Amber Heard and Giovanni Ribisi. \n\nA friend of Celebs.com, photographer Scott McDermott sent over some gorgeous shots of Amber looking very Marilyn Monroe... or is she summoning a young Kim Basinger?
