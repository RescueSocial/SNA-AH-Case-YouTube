And the more time it goes, the crazier things happen. There are so many celebs who are already involved in the ongoing legal drama but here we have one of the largest celebrities to be dragged into this $50 million defamation suit. Now, the litigation involves plus one A-list participant - none other than James Franco.  Johnny Depp\u2019s legal team subpoenaed James Franco and now the future of the libel case doesn\u2019t appear to be very positive for Amber Heard. If everything goes as planned, James Franco\u2019s appearance could help Johnny Depp win this legal battle and come back to normal life. But why does James Franco is officially being brought into court? We will break it down for you in a second.\nIf you are not aware of this part of Amber Heard\u2019s past, James Franco is one of those people who Johnny Depp had alleged Amber slept with, while she was still married to Johnny Depp. Although, it\u2019s been a few years since Johnny first made that allegation. But now, everything is absolutely serious because this time, James Franco is officially being brought into court to answer all the needed questions. \nLet\u2019s get into details. James Franco is subpoenaed over surveillance footage of him entering an elevator with Amber Heard just hours after she had an explosive fight with Johnny Depp. This fight allegedly left Amber Heard with multiple bruises on her face and body. However, Johnny Depp has claimed that she \"painted on\" the wounds to garner \"positive publicity.\" On the footage James Franco can be seen getting close with Amber in the elevator. this recording took place just one day before Amber Heard filed for divorce from Johnny Depp. Johnny Depp\u2019s legal team want to inquire from James Franco how Amber Heard looked at the time of this incident.\nBut James Franco isn't the only one that JD's lawyers want to ask questions. Because if the bruises, that Johnny Depp\u2019s lawyers say were painted on, were present when the actress filed for a restraining order on May 27, they should have been visible to James Franco the night after the fight on May 22 or so. Johnny Depp\u2019s legal team is also interested in speaking with Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and Space X, because he too allegedly saw Amber Heard\u2019s face in this time period. Here is an official Adam Waldman\u2019s (JD\u2019s lawyer\u2019s) statement: \u201cWe are interested in James Franco and Elon Musk as fact witnesses because we have evidence they are men who saw Amber Heard\u2019s face in the days and nights between when she claimed Mr. Depp smashed her in the face on May 21 and when she went to court with painted on \u2018bruises\u2019 to obtain temporary restraining order on May 27\u201d.\n\n\n\nBinge Watch - Binge Watch is the best source of the latest celebrity news.
