The original video had a single but important problem and the youtube editor wasn't working, nor does youtube let you replace published videos. \n\nI interview the lovely Paula, a good friend and former personal assistant of Marilyn Manson. She's known him for almost two decades and tells us about him. She also gives her view of the abuse allegations against him (she's on his side) and discusses her experiences with Johnny Depp and Amber Heard. \n\nAt approximately the 1:05:30\u200b mark, she and I begin discussing Johnny Depp and Amber Heard. Paula knew them and was present at the infamous 2015 Thanksgiving dinner that was discussed in the UK trial. She has some interesting things to say about Johnny and Amber. \n\nPaula's Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/paulababy1/\u200b\u200b \n\nFOR MORE VIDEOS ON MANSON ALLEGATIONS, SEE MY CHANNEL.
