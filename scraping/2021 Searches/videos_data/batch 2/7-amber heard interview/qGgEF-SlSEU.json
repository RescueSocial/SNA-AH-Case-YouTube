            "description": "Sometimes we post interviews in full when they are conducted by other people due to misrepresentation. In this case, @Nicole Arbour posted clips, and we posted the whole interview, aiming to offer both our audiences something entertaining and, hopefully, compelling. Nicole and I discuss role models, casual contempt, sales and marketing, social media, Harry Potter books and films, gender dysphoria, dating advice for women with high IQ\u2019s, and more.\n\nNicole Arbour is a Canadian (now American) comedian, choreographer, singer, and YouTuber. She is known for her work in acting on television and film and more recently as a comedian and entertainer through the most popular social media channels.\n\nFind more of Nicole Arbour on Twitter @NicoleArbour, Instagram @ibnicolearbour, and on YouTube.\n\n This interview was recorded on 03/29/2021\n\n// SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL //\nNewsletter: https://linktr.ee/DrJordanBPeterson\nDonations: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\n\n// COURSES //\nDiscovering Personality: https://jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com/\nUnderstand Myself (personality test): https://understandmyself.com/\n\n// BOOKS //\nBeyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life: https://jordanbpeterson.com/Beyond-Order\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning/\n\n// LINKS //\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com/\nEvents: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events/\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog/// SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL //\nNewsletter: https://linktr.ee/DrJordanBPeterson\nDonations: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\n\n// COURSES //\nDiscovering Personality: https://jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com/\nUnderstand Myself (personality test): https://understandmyself.com/\n\n// BOOKS //\nBeyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life: https://jordanbpeterson.com/Beyond-Order\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning/\n\n// LINKS //\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com/\nEvents: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events/\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog/\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/\nReading List: https://jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson\n\n// SOCIAL //\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\n\n// SPONSORS //\nInterested in sponsoring my audio podcast?
