Based on the bestselling memoir by Stephen Elliott, the film stars James Franco as a has-been author whose fascination with a high-profile murder case leads him to his own troubled past. When Stephen uses his new-found obsession with the case to avoid his personal troubles, he finds it unexpectedly brings him romance with the trial reporter Lana Edmond (Amber Heard) while forcing him to confront old issues with his abusive father (Ed Harris). The film also stars Christian Slater, Cynthia Nixon, Jim Parrack and Wilmer Valderrama.\n\nAt the recent Los Angeles press day I landed an exclusive interview with Amber Heard, James Franco and Pamela Romanowsky. They talked about how the theme of memory impacts the story and characters, the way they like to work on set, what they collect, their go-to karaoke songs, and more. In addition, Franco teases The Disaster Artist and when fans might see the first footage. Check out what they had to say above.\n\nAmber Heard, James Franco and Director Pamela Romanowsky:\n\n    1:00 \u2014 What\u2019s their go-to karaoke songs?\n    1:36 \u2014 What do they collect, if anything?\n    2:32 \u2014 How they gelled together on set.\n    3:10 \u2014 Director Pamela Romanowsky on how the cast prepares for filming.\n    4:37 \u2014 How Amber Heard likes to work before filming, and how James Franco reads on set.\n    5:40 \u2014 On how the theme of memory impacts the story and characters.\n    7:43 \u2014 James Franco teases The Disaster Artist and when fans might see the first footage.\n\nFor More Collider:\nhttp://collider.com/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/colliderdotcom",
