As we have learned, FAITH begins where the will of God is known and praying God's will is essential to obtaining results.  As men and women of the Spirit, God calls us to \"level up\" when He invites us to dive into the height, depth and width of His love.  When we, like David become \"after God's heart\", it is then that we can pray as He prayed.  Lessons taken from the life of Jesus gives us clues as to how to walk in this power.  Join us as we discover secrets of intercession.\n \nFeed you faith, starve your doubts to death.   Tag your friends, like and share your comments as the WORD goes forth.",
