            "description": "During the whole scenario of Johnny Depp\u2019s divorce and post-divorce chaos with former wife Amber Heard, the 58-year-old actor had a ton of supporters all ranging from his fans up to his co-celebrities and actors who have seen him and have been with him all throughout his career. Johnny had a lot of celebrities defending him by his side, including a set of high profiled co-actors such as Helena Bonham Carter, Javier Bardem, Penelope Cruz, Sia, Kevin McNally, Sharon Osborne, J.K. Rowling, and even his exes Vanessa Paradis (whom he had two children with), and longtime partner Wynona Ryder. However, throughout this long course of Johnny\u2019s marital havoc with Amber Heard, and behind all the faces that are not afraid to defend him and represent him during his hardest times, it seems like the actor had once been through all the same mess during his childhood, as it has recently been reported that Johnny Depp was declared to be 'emancipated and self-supporting' at the time of his parents' divorce, and that he had in fact been abandoned at some point by his mother as a teenager. This new discovery and information has been uncovered after an American filmmaker did some thorough research about Johnny\u2019s background for a documentary on the Pirates of the Caribbean actor\u2019s divorce journey with Aquaman actress Amber Heard. So, what did really go down during Johnny\u2019s teenage years?  Had he really been abandoned by his mother? Was he really alone during his parents\u2019 own battle of divorce? Let\u2019s find all that out in this video, but before anything else, make sure to hit that subscribe button and smash that notification bell first for more updates on this. Now, let\u2019s begin!\n\nFirst, let\u2019s take a look back at the current turmoil that Johnny is facing. Johnny Depp has been at the height of his career in the industry for many, many years now. He started acting as early as the 1980\u2019s, which helped Johnny begin his acting career, landing more minor roles and then major ones. Later on, he became a popular star of the classic, eccentric director Tim Burton\u2019s films, where he portrayed various roles that all have these similarities: unique, bizarre, and creepy in their own ways. He also played a few roles with Helena Bonham Carter in many Tim Burton films such as Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Alice in Wonderland and Alice Through the Looking Glass, Corpse Bride, Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, and Dark Shadows. One of the most widely-known appearances of Johnny Depp that perhaps brought him the largest commercial and critical success was the Disney media franchise \u201cPirates of the Caribbean\u201d series, where he landed and reprised his lead role for all five movies that ran from 2003 to 2017. After this huge commercial success, Johnny Depp was cast as Grindelwald in the critically acclaimed film \u201cFantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them\u201d, a spin off and prequel to the Harry Potter film series. But despite this remarkable success, Johnny had a not so pleasant childhood, but we\u2019ll get to that later.\n\nThe divorce was finalized in 2017, a year after Amber filed for it. However, the former couple\u2019s lawsuits were far from over. In 2018,  Despite not being directly named as the perpetrator on Amber\u2019s claims on the Washington post article, Johnny\u2019s team knew it was meant to attack the actor, thus resulting in him choosing to file a lawsuit of $50 million against her, for defamation over the said article. \n\nIt has not been proven, and Johnny has not admitted to maltreating Amber, but it\u2019s no lie that the actor is no stranger to such predicaments.\nAmerican actor and filmmaker Paul Barresi in his research for the new Discovery plus series \u2018Johnny Depp vs Amber Heard\u2019 has uncovered new court documents that show.\n\nIn a 2018 interview with Rolling Stone, Johnny said, \"Yeah, there were irrational instances. Maybe it's an ashtray coming your way. Maybe you're gonna get clunked with the phone. It was a ghost house -- no one talked. I don't think there ever was a way I thought about people, especially women, other than 'I can fix them',\" talking.\nNeedless to say, Johnny had a very bad childhood, yet instead of turning into a monster that he could have, he developed into the humble icon he is today, and that we all look up to. This new information may affect the ongoing trial, but do you think Johnny might have had the capability to hurt others because of his past?
