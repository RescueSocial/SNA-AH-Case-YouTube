There's no one quite like Abby Lee Miller in this world, which is why we just can't get enough of her. But, when it comes to Abby, there's only one person she just can't get enough of, and that's Maddie Ziegler. Despite teaching hundreds of students how to dance, Maddie has always been the one who left a mark. She brought something new to the table that Abby had never seen, and it turned her into a star. \n\nThere's a handful of reasons why Abby chose to favor Maddie over her other students, and we\u2019re going to discuss each and every one of them. Maddie started dancing when she was just a toddler and has had a lifelong relationship with her former dance coach. Still, that doesn't explain why Maddie received special treatment from Abby.
