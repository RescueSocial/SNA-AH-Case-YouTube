(Amber's LIES EXPOSED)\nhttps://youtu.be/AKSQk1KayeA\n\nNumber 8: Molestation \n\nAs we all know Amber Heard has accused Johnny Depp of molesting her several times and the issue was taken to court and also led to his removal from the Fantastic Beasts movie.\n\nNumber 7: The Takeover\n\nDespite all this, things are not going well for Amber Heard the latest news shows that Emilia Clarke has taken over her role in Aquaman 2 which is very good news if you ask me. In addition to all this, she has also been deserted by her legal team and things are looking like a lot of people who once supported Amber are now starting to support Johnny Depp.  \n\nNumber 6: The Analysts \n\nOf recent, a lot of evidence that shows Amber has been lying has been brought to light and various professionals from different fields have all come up to support Johnny Depp, putting forward strong arguments. One of these people who came to support Johnny Depp is Logan Portenier. He is the one who runs a YouTube channel known as \u201cOBSERVE\u201d. If you get the chance to watch Amber Heard's 2016 Court deposition you would notice that this guy did a really good job in analyzing her body language and facial expressions.  Logan studied her body language and other signs she gave in one of his latest videos. And because of this a lot of people were convinced that the reason why she kept looking like she was lying was that she indeed was lying.\n\nNumber 5: The Great Deduction\n\nLet us talk about how Logan made this deduction. What he did was simple. He gathered some of Amber's old clips and studied them carefully to see how she acted under normal circumstances. He then compared these videos with the deposition video and saw how Amber's eyes kept darting all around the room when she was asked if she was maltreating Johnny Depp. Throughout the entire interview she kept on talking like she did not want to be there and at a particular point, it started to look like she did not want to prove her innocence. \n\nNumber 4: The Comparison\n\nThere was also a comparison of Amber Heard's interview with Johnny Depp's interview and it was noticed that Johnny Depp sounded calmer than Amber Heard. He described the entire incident in complete detail and according to the person who analyzed his body language, what Johnny did was a sign of total honesty. After all this, Logan also analyzed videos of Johnny and Amber Heard\u2019s red carpet event and pointed out that Amber was acting as the dominant one in the relationship. He also concluded that the behavior Amber put up indicated that she was lying and she was the one who was mistreating Johnny Depp.\n\nNumber 3: The Celebrity Support\n\nMany other people have also come up and supported Johnny Depp, one of them being Joe Rogan. He warned Johnny about Amber in 2018 and said Amber was not treating him right unlike his other partners who claimed Johnny was an angel when they were dating. That aside, Sia also supported Johnny Depp and went to Twitter to claim her support. Sia also talked about Elon Musk who reportedly was in a relationship with Amber Heard after she ended her relationship with Johnny Depp. She also said that Elon Musk was responsible for giving Amber Heard the money she donated to charity. It was 7 million dollars in total!\n\nNumber 2: The Lie\n\nJohnny Depp has mentioned that Amber Heard lied about giving the money to charity. He stated that she did not spend the money or use it for anything but just added it to her already stacked amount of cash. To back up Johnny's claims, the Children's Hospital located in Los Angeles stated that they only received a sum of 100 thousand dollars and not the 3.5 million dollars Amber Heard promised to give them. \n\nNumber 1: The Absent Lawyer \n\nRoberta Kaplan, Amber Heard's lawyer has recently decided to withdraw from the case alongside a lot of attorneys that work for Amber's team using the pandemic as an excuse. Johnny Depp's lawyer, Adam Waldman called Kaplan out and told her that he did not believe her reason for leaving Amber Heard's legal team. \n\nViral Film Talk is the #1 celebrity channel dedicated to bringing fans the latest celebrity news, best tv shows, movies, entertainment, and exclusive video commentaries & more.
