For the first time in years, the state was performing missile drills, something not practiced since the cold war era. Experts stressed the likelihood of a real-world attack was slim, and that the precautions being taken should not cause alarm. However on the morning of January 13th of 2018, Hawaiins awoke with a text message on their phone saying that a doomsday scenario was approaching their island in about 10 to 15 minutes. Panic ensued, but some time later it was revealed the message was sent by mistake, it was a false alarm. The blunder went down as not just a 2018 meme, but one of the biggest civil defense blunders in US history. What caused this mistake?
