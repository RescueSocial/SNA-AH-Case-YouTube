I have been following Johnny Depp and his ex wife Amber Heard story about their abusive relationship. I am so happy hearing and seeing more people speaking out about their abusers. I am one person who take this topic very strongly and it hurt deeply when people don't or can't speak out. Let's put a stop to ABUSE, let's ENDABUSE.\n\nFollow me on Facebook @toyin balogun\nInstagram  @amazingprintz\nSnapchat  @billionaire toyin\n\nHelplines\nwww.nationaldahelpline.org.uk \nwww.womensaid.org.uk\nhttps://www.gov.uk/guidance/domestic-abuse-how-to-get-help\nhttps://www.nhs.uk/live-well/healthy-body/getting-help-for-domestic-violence/\nhttps://www.met.police.uk/advice/advice-and-information/daa/domestic-abuse/what-is-domestic-abuse/",
