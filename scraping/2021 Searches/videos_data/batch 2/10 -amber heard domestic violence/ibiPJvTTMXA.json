            "description": "#StopDomesticViolence - Amber Heard's Side (Audio Leak 1) Domestic Violence with Johnny Depp (2015). The yelling led to 3 Physical Fights in 1-2 months (0:34), screaming led to Escalating Fights including possibility of a Crime Scene (2:37) and getting Killed (4:00). She was Kicked, Kicked, and Kicked (2:06). There was a Physical Fight on their honeymoon (1:15), and a fight in San Francisco (1:32)... \n\nSIGN TO SUPPORT AMBER HEARD: https://www.change.org/p/amber-heard-supporters-we-support-amber-heard-in-aquaman-2\n\nWe show this & SUPPORT #AmberHeard. We also want to show it so that people see that you should leave domestic abuse. It can keep escalating. Don't be a bystander!\n\nShe is blamed for 'starting' the fights and not allowed to complain, be human, to feel, or to react (4:22, 9:27, 18:43, 7:16, 18:24, 24:57, 19:12). She avoided talking to him at least once because of fear of him exploding (7:21). She NEVER wanted any physical altercations (0:19). \n\nWe want people to see how people, especially women, can be trained that they 'start' fights by saying something wrong, or arguing, or yelling or screaming, and then the physical reaction from their partners becomes 'rationalized' (0:34, 8:39, 15:02, 23:56). They are blamed.\n\n'Splitting' involves not working on their marriage (8:22, 22:14). It can mean even from her talking in a low tone (9:40). She thought multiple times of splitting/leaving, but did not (0:00, 8:22, 7:01). She refers to good times such as 3 months in Australia, where she was allowed to argue without it becoming a physical fight, and wondering what has changed (5:22, 19:39). \n\nAmber Heard says she's the one who tries to end the fights and make the peace (8:39, 10:50, 27:35), saying that JD doesn't provide an Olive Branch (6:42, 18:31). She feels there is no consistency, safety, security, trust in the relationship (6:57, 10:16, 11:14, 11:26, 11:53, 13:57, 14:19, 20:57). They cannot communicate (16:52). He does not return home when he says he will (17:30, 27:01). She has tried to work on the marriage (20:11, 21:45, 23:39) and wishes it was better (23:22). He doesn't keep promises (23:56).\n\nJohnny Depp said he knew the arguments and fights would not stop after marrying her (20:59).\n\nSee how it escalated to fear of being killed after being nearly suffocated with a pillow and waking up to her blood in Audio 2 of Amber's Side: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WX27126jVLQ\n\nThinking about leaving matches her dismissal with detailed descriptions: https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5835867-Amber-Heard-Motion-to-Dismiss.html\n\nThe physical & repeated abuse can also create anger, oppression, and Amber Heard says the situation with kicking repeatedly does make a person angry (2:06) to yell and scream in historical context.\n\nIt makes people feel ashamed & to hide their abuse out of fear of what people will think or say or not shown empathy, or retaliated against. There are very few Leaders Against Domestic Abuse. \n\nShe's also been highly harassed online and with a smear campaign that is highly funded with targeting. She's received death threats and all positive praise of her is interrupted.\n\nYouTubers such as \"True Crime\" claimed to post the' full audio,' but 3 parts seen in a tabloid about crime scene, killing, & kicked was cut out along with a loud \"TRANSLATION\" appearing. McPherson is believed to own a YouTube channel that appeared after JD lost 1 role, but BEFORE Amber's Op-Ed in the Washington Post.\n\n-- Amber Heard has a long-term leadership, humanitarian, positive background with credibility --\n\nShe was the first American actress to be named Human Rights Champion to the United Nations Human Rights Office. She's an ambassador for the ACLU, donor to Women's Rights Groups, protector of refugees, and does charity. She has spent years helping children.\n\n- Supporter of Born This Way Foundation, GLAAD, Habitat for Humanity, The Trevor Project, RiseNowUS, Sam's USA, Cyber Civil Rights Initiative, SHIELD Act, Center for Inquiry, World Identity Network, and Human Rights Campaign.\n\n- Spoken at global events like the UN Social Good Summit, Global Citizen Festival, One Young World Conference, L'Oreal Women of Worth, and Emery Awards Gala.\n\nShe's Mera in the movie Aquaman.\n\nWe Support You Amber Heard!\n\nAs a pro-helping/anti-crime online social project, it was horrible to see a supposed ex-staff partner saying they wouldn't testify or support her publicly nearly a year ago via social media. Amber collaborated about Networking making people not stand up against abuse for others in her court docs. #NotABystander\n\nTexts have supported her in The Sun case in the United Kingdom: https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Depp-v-News-Group-decision-on-disclosure-FINAL.pdf#page=9\n\nSIGN TO SUPPORT AMBER HEARD: https://www.change.org/p/amber-heard-supporters-we-support-amber-heard-in-aquaman-2/u/25962625\n\n#Aquaman #UnitedNations #EndVAW #DomesticViolence #DomesticAbuse #Mera #HumanRights #ACLU #IStandWithMelissa",
