            "description": "In 2015, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard got married. The two had met on the set of 2011\u2019s The Rum Diary. A little more than a year after their marriage, Amber filed for divorce and began claiming that Johnny had been physically and verbally abusive to her during their short time together. Before much could come of it in court, Amber formally withdrew her claims. Her and Johnny came to a divorce settlement that saw Johnny paying out $7 million. Many following the situation saw this settlement as admittance of guilt on Johnny\u2019s part. Such parties included UK publication The Sun.\n\nInitially, there weren\u2019t many consequences that came as a result of Amber\u2019s allegations against her ex-husband. Johnny went forward with filming 2018\u2019s Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald Franchise-runner JK Rowling personally defended Johnny whenever the press brought up the preceding divorce. However, a 2018 article published by The Sun reignited interest in Amber\u2019s prior allegations against Johnny just a few months before the film was set to hit theaters. Although the film was still a success, Johnny\u2019s future in Hollywood seemed tenuous. \n\nIn 2018, Johnny Depp appeared in five films. In 2019, he appeared in only one. Now Johnny is suing Amber for libel and defamation as a result of the damage that her allegations have done on his career. Join Trender as we explore why Amber Heard is now facing jail time.",
