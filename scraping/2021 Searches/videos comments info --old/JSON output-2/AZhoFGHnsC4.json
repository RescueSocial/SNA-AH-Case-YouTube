Only with evidence and not with words can you beat Amber. What&#39;s more, the judgment is physical violence, and it has nothing to do with adultery. The Court of Justice only judges one thing at a time ..... Don&#39;t take any offense from Amber Heard and her sisters and friends. They are evil characters, and they will never be above good and evil. We are going to win this war because with psychopaths it has to be that way. For me, I would have banished them all from planet Earth!",
