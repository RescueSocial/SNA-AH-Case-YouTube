In this recording Amber Heard admits to attacking Johnny Depp verbally and physically, admit to not promise to stop attacking him. She talks about how she has hit him with cooking wear (Pans), battles n other objects. Call Johnny Depp a coward because he leaves every time they fight n never solve the issues.  U can head her cream at him why he always runs away n then in others she tells him that going to other room or the other side of the house is not enough space of distance, that when they are in hotels n he takes other room for himself is not far enough n that makes her harder for her to deal with it. Depp calmly answers her back saying that he loves her n that every time he leaves is because the arguments/fights get physical but she can&#39;t promise him not to get physical on their arguments in order to deal with it. There is also an incident where she attacks him with a broken bottle n nearly cut one of his finger off n Depp had to surgically attack it back. J. Depp did admit to verbally abuse her back in fight n to substance abuse issues (alcohol) that was well documented while he was filming Pirates of the Caribbean 5, but that he never hit her back. This I don&#39;t know much about but apparently there is evidence of her showing up with bruises and evidence of the attack and the day later pictures of her perfectly fine without any trace of physical abuse but this I have only heard seen some pictures but not pruff of when were taken on the videos I saw. Her best friends that were set to testify refused to do so n are not on speaking terms with her and allegation of her previous relationship came out that she also physically abuse them too. That&#39;s why a lot of the people are on Depp side, at the start everyone thought he was responsible since he had drinking issues (he did get help n turn it around, fixing his life n carrier that when he made the \rMurder on the Orient Express), but ones this recording came out that was recorded by Anber Heard not less the public opinion flip because very clearly she admits been the abuser, n many more. PS: this will have more reactions in the media, so I believe u may do other videos about it. check some of the info and legal case J. Depp is on n it will help u a lot on ur next video.",
