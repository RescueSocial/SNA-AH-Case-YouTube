So he had a way out the whole time his friends did not want to come out cause we all love and respect Johnny but I <b>HAD ENOUGH</b> of her BS and told Johnny he had to leave cause no one else was going to. she made him marry her btw he really did not want to but she threatened everyone if he did <b>NOT</b> compile to her wishes she would have hurt everyone he held dear he told me this recently more and more he has been opening up to me about the situation but I do not push him into telling me.He started to fall for her stupid lying ass but I saw right through her BS and started interfering with her plans Johnny even told me &quot;She is starting to get suspicious, and staying over at night.&quot; Amber was getting super Jealous of me and Johnny talking to one another thats why she did all the curl things to him that she did cause he was <b>PROTECTING</b> me from her.
