Her behavior is beyond reprehensible, playing the victim when in fact, she was the abuser. She needs to be held accountable for what she did, otherwise, they&#39;re basically saying that it&#39;s ok to do this (to further your career). I think Emilia Clarke would be an excellent choice to replace her. Jason and Emilia have a very special bond and great chemistry, both on and off screen. I really hope that they get rid of that vile woman, Amber Turd. Let her be catapulted into oblivion and never be seen again.",
