Johnny&#39;s career blew up an was not slowing down his movies were taking the little family around the world several times a year. As the children got older, Vanessa wanted to get back to her career, which she has done. When they separated Johnny bought Vanessa a home close to his Hollywood Hills home and gave Vanessa $150,000,000.00, they have remained the best of friends and have successfully co-parented their two children.
