We don't know the half of the number times she threw with INTENT TO DAMAGE or punched him in the face FOR THE SINGULAR PURPOSE OF ACTUALLY TAKING A BEATING, just so she'd leave with 8 digit settlement. It was a premeditated seduction (by a lesbian, not 'bi'), romance & in her words, 'MADE A WEDDING HAPPEN'!! She had attacked him several times before there were 'rings'.
