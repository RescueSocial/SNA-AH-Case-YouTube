What happens if one of you end up getting divorced before you have a kid and your biological clock is ticking and you really want a child? Will you just accept that you will never get to become a mother? Some people think they know it all, but they really don&#39;t. A woman does not need to wait around 40 years for a man to marry her and allow her to become a mother. through no fault of that woman&#39;s, the man she was with could&#39;ve cheated on her or abused her even though they were engaged. and lo and behold, she finds herself single at 32 and still childless. <br><br>A lot of statistics are from poorer single parent households, not those that are financially well off. How is a financially stable woman who saves her money for all her life in the hopes of having a baby and chooses to have a child on her own by choice and out of love because her fiance decided to cheat on her, lie to her, and abuse her 4 days before their wedding any worse off than an 18 year old girl that gets knocked up in a bar and ends up pregnant? the men commenting are just threatened that more women are going to start having children, with or without them, and stop waiting around like puppies for a decade for empty promises and hollow words. who are any of you to tell others how to live their lives? i am sure that child will be much more loved than a child that is an &quot;accident&quot; or a mistake in a home where the father smokes and does drugs while verbally abusing his wife. This isn&#39;t about feminism or about hating men. It&#39;s about women who really love children and want to be mothers, and who are tired of waiting another decade for the &quot;one&quot; to show up after the previous the &quot;one&quot; cheated on and abused her. i guess it&#39;s a good thing that most of these women could give a rat&#39;s butt about the opinions of a bunch of people they have no connection to. as for talking about finding a man to settle with, it really doesn&#39;t mean much. plenty of lowlives end up married and provide a toxic environment for their children, who grow up with traumas and other psychological issues. and let&#39;s not even talk about those who have children and end up abandoning them.",
