At that time, he was seen as \u201cthe bad guy\u201d, and she was seen as an innocent victim. <br><br>But that had changed very dramatically by the time that Depp was actually let go.  Even though he lost his court case, a lot of people (myself included) disagreed with the decision, and saw it as rather weaselly. More a protection of conservative press than anything else. And I\u2019d say that now, at least half of people are on Depp\u2019s side now, even after his court loss. We\u2019ve heard the tapes. <br><br>So it just doesn\u2019t make sense to me that WB was happy to go against their \u201cliberal women\u201d base for HP back when it looked like Depp was the only guilty party, but are paying attention to them now that the base is far more divided on the issue. <br><br>I know that there could have been on set reasons for letting him go- he\u2019s got addiction issues that have played with his ability to remain professional. But- none of this is new, and I know plenty of people are more willing to give him a bit of slack on that. Yes, he has addiction issues, but as a victim of domestic abuse, we are generally more likely to allow him a bit of grace, and time to recover. <br><br>I\u2019m not as willing to give any grace at all to Amber. And it does indeed look bad that they\u2019ve let Depp go, but not Heard. Like I said- we\u2019ve heard the tapes. It\u2019s one of the reasons that those who support Depp still support him after that court loss. I don\u2019t understand how anyone could say that she isn\u2019t abusive after hearing those tapes. I get people saying that it was a mutually toxic relationship, but not that she was an innocent victim of violence. That\u2019s just not a reasonable position to take. Which is one of the reasons why it looks so very bad for WB. We KNOW she\u2019s abusive. We don\u2019t know that he definitely is or isn\u2019t. It does look extremely hypocritical and sexist. <br><br>I just don\u2019t get why they\u2019d go out on this limb now. Maybe the HP dept thought to play it safe after Jo\u2019s showing her whole arse, but I think it makes them look worse.",
                    "textOriginal": "The thing I don\u2019t get is that WB didn\u2019t get rid of Depp back when the accusations were purely against him. And there was big backlash for that. At that time, he was seen as \u201cthe bad guy\u201d, and she was seen as an innocent victim. \n\nBut that had changed very dramatically by the time that Depp was actually let go.  Even though he lost his court case, a lot of people (myself included) disagreed with the decision, and saw it as rather weaselly. More a protection of conservative press than anything else. And I\u2019d say that now, at least half of people are on Depp\u2019s side now, even after his court loss. We\u2019ve heard the tapes. \n\nSo it just doesn\u2019t make sense to me that WB was happy to go against their \u201cliberal women\u201d base for HP back when it looked like Depp was the only guilty party, but are paying attention to them now that the base is far more divided on the issue. \n\nI know that there could have been on set reasons for letting him go- he\u2019s got addiction issues that have played with his ability to remain professional. But- none of this is new, and I know plenty of people are more willing to give him a bit of slack on that. Yes, he has addiction issues, but as a victim of domestic abuse, we are generally more likely to allow him a bit of grace, and time to recover. \n\nI\u2019m not as willing to give any grace at all to Amber. And it does indeed look bad that they\u2019ve let Depp go, but not Heard. Like I said- we\u2019ve heard the tapes. It\u2019s one of the reasons that those who support Depp still support him after that court loss. I don\u2019t understand how anyone could say that she isn\u2019t abusive after hearing those tapes. I get people saying that it was a mutually toxic relationship, but not that she was an innocent victim of violence. That\u2019s just not a reasonable position to take. Which is one of the reasons why it looks so very bad for WB. We KNOW she\u2019s abusive. We don\u2019t know that he definitely is or isn\u2019t. It does look extremely hypocritical and sexist. \n\nI just don\u2019t get why they\u2019d go out on this limb now. Maybe the HP dept thought to play it safe after Jo\u2019s showing her whole arse, but I think it makes them look worse.",
