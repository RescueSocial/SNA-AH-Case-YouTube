At the time she kinda did the same as Amber destroying my life, reputation and even worst, because I was a young successful kid that had never tasted true failure, she actually destroyed myself worth the moment she started keeping my beautiful baby from me regularly... 25 years on and instead of having the life I was supposed to, I am still recovering!!! Had bouts of dark depression, tryed to kill myself a couple of times, felt into years of self pity and drug abuse....but of course , because I&#39;am a man, whenever I touched the subject, that I tried to open up about my suffering and misery I was always shut down, even by my parents that knew her well and knew that I was telling the truth... Our culture doesn&#39;t only victimize women...it victimizes victims!!! This morning I was watching a Ambers interview and imediately recognized the facial expressions of an hipocritycal abuser...and they weren&#39;t even microexpressions... she&#39;s not a good actress even... Fake all the way, predatory social climbing, stepping upon all the people that doesn&#39;t enter her plan of advancement!!! Full disclosure, that woman that I married was married twice afterwards, has five children from 4 men...and 25 years afterwards she&#39;s still using my family name... because locally it has some value, some social power.",
