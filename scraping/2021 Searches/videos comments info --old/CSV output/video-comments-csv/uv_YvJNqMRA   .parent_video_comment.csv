It‚Äôll make the people who always fight against abusive relationships look like hypocrites because when they realize that the man is the real victim, they‚Äôll try and paint the picture as ‚ÄúThe dude is lying.

It‚Äôs important to note that Jerry Bruckheimer (producer of every POTC film) has previously said that there is no Pirates without Johnny 
While I know Hollywood does this anyway even if they know they‚Äôre not making a sequel, the main cast of Pirates 5 - Brenton Thwaites, Kaya Scoldelerio and I think even Orlando Bloom are contracted to return for two more instalments. The most recent fifth film was meant to be the first film in a new trilogy that would act as the ‚Äúfinal adventure‚Äù of this series of POTC films.
While it didn‚Äôt perform as well as any of the previous Pirates film, POTC 5 still made a considerable amount of money and if Johnny comes out of this Amber Heard situation free then I think these Johnny Depp Pirates films will go ahead..",Ethan,4,2020-05-10T22:35:27Z
