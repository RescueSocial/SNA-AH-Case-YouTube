That is a pretty big, and clear, f off message to anyone with a different opinion and in my opinion not respectful (including laughter makes it more condescending and divisive, see his IG post for full context). At least someone like Rumer Willis is open to respectful dialog and someone like Dwayne Johnson just does his job, is a nice guy, respectful and knows not to burn half his fan base. Then you have actress Gina Carano having people call for her to be fired for her political opinion because they disagree with it. That is hypocrisy. Anyone in Hollywood who is not full on bashing anyone with a different opinion from the collective mindset jeopardizes their careers.

He is allowed as per the U.S Constitution to have the right to an opinion and state what it is. The world is already divided and his statement on Trump is a valid one whether you like it or not. Yes he has fans that identify with different political ideas but he can also state his opinion without demeaning any one. Unless I am wrong. He stated that he more or less doesn‚Äôt like trump and anyone who doesn‚Äôt agree can unfollow him. I do not think that is in anyway demeaning or offensive to simply star how you feel and RESPECT that other people can disagree. He didn‚Äôt say he was right or that the people who love trump are wrong. It‚Äôs just how he feels but if you do not like it, it is within your RIGHT to leave his side.

Make no mistake - the _only_ reason Momao brought President Trump into the conversation was to attempt to shame people into believing the horseh*t that comes out of AH‚Äôs mouth.

Just like certain media can‚Äôt believe the majority of Americans disagree with the crap they are trying to push upon us and would vote for a candidate like Trump, celebrities can‚Äôt believe they are disliked.

The only way their (both the media and celebrities) tiny brains rationalize this reality is to say ‚Äúthese people aren‚Äôt real - they must be Russian bots!‚Äù
It‚Äôs just another form of cancel culture - if we can‚Äôt cancel someone (like Depp) with outright lies, we‚Äôll tell you ‚Äúhe did the same thing Trump did!‚Äù

Facebook, google, twitter, etc. don't owe anyone a platform.  If they see some of the content being put up on their platforms as being harmful to their brand they have the right to remove it.

And in true left-wing fashion, instead of having to debate conservative opinions it's far easier to whack a label on them like ""na. zi"" or ""racist"", and then that way they can just dismiss them as bigots.

He believes that if you believe that not all women should automatically be believed when they accuse a man of abuse; or if you believe in CONTROLLED immigration as opposed to mass, unchecked migration in a world where no Borders should exist; or if you just think that Bee Ell Emm have a far-left Marxist agenda (which they do), then any of the above automatically means you're beyond the pale and are literally a na. zi.
