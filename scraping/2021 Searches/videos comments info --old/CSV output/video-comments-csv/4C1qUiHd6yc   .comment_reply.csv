She did it to try to destroy him and his  character  and career and incase he left her for Good point  blank ! It's really so sad we all look at famous people like they Don't Have Breakdowns like it's Soo Taboo and they don't have problems Everybody Loses It! (Just imagine a time you lost it now imagine  It was recorded  For the world to see )But when  Some see things like this they're like ""OMG look at him hes crazy  He's a monster "" BS Lol NO HE UPSET He was Braking  ! he is Not Beating her  or Even talking to her  She starts making it like it's about her !While hes extremely upset ! I would be worried out of my mind asking my man if he was OK NOT recording him!!!Listen to the videos  Between them talking she's the one Admitting to hitting him, And she (Amber)says and I Quote "" I can't promise you I will never get physical again""....Umm Wtf... OK CASE CLOSED ! She was just  scared Johnny wasAfraid he was gunna leave her for Good, That's why  She's been doing all this crazy shit!For Johnny Depp's sake I hope this  is over Soon and he gets his career and health back  because this is sad !Of course they were both in a toxic relationship  And for those who have been in one already know it can cause mental illness depression substance abuse exc Even though she's  so wrong I pray They both find health peace & happines! he says it many times ""the physical violence has to stop"" I give him so much credit for still being so nice to this woman after everything she has done to him Worst part as he gets dropped from his roles his LIFE career  she still has a job WTF!?

76,Ugx9W2NmL_qnQkClHv14AaABAg,Ary Cahya,"In my oppinion, both of them are wrong
First ,johnny always runaway when everytime they have a fight .
Second, that make amber feel upset and mad ,seems like one side relationship, she feel that johnny not understand what she wanted in this relationship.
Third , they not do two side communication, amber always tell him what she wanted ,but johnny repeat like he can't proof that.
Fourth,for that amber feel not statisfied and this preasure ,the anger ,come out in one time so she do abbusive
Fifth, and amber show the emotion in wrong way because she do abbusive (violence to johnny)

That's why i said that both if them are wrong, because no reaction without action first . And everything happened for a reason. Maybe if amber and johnny can do communication in the right way ,this will never happened, and if amber can controled her anger ,she will not do abbuse to johnny . 

Better they do counseling of marriage ,talk to psychologist . Or if this toxic relationship still same maybe divorce is the right way for them.",2020-02-13T06:32:43Z,0

 6) Jerry Judge, head of security can be heard saying "" the cocaine messed with her medication""...being Seroquel...a anti-psychotic.

 His new wife is cheating on him, is verbally & physically abusive & now he's just found out his managers have been betraying him/her for nearly 20 yrs & taken most of his money.
 Then realize he is a man, & anger is the most acceptable emotion for men.

 No, he said he loved her. All his X's since the 80's said it was  inconceivable to them he could harm anyone he loved. 
 This is a personality trait that doesn't change at age 50.

I mean normal ppl don't cut parts of their fingers off to write insults to their wife or husband. That's some horror movie type $h!t, which there's proof and his own admission that he did. Maybe he's sane or nice when he's sober, but alcohol and drugs can change even the nicest ppl into monsters, and he has a reputation for being heavily into drugs and alcohol. He's also admitted to being jealous and controlling before which..fits the profile of an abuser. I don't understand why ppl find it such a stretch that he'd be abusive given his history. I guess ppl are tm in their feelings and not enough in their brain so they can't see reality. Ppl often don't want to admit their fav actress/singer/ect could do such vile acts but, it's unfair to the victim to deny it, and worse yet when they paint the victim as the bad guy.

320,UgwtOK20XPn46kq8qm54AaABAg,Option Z,"December Leigh I am an attorney with a JD and a LLM and I get so bothered when I see ppl outside of this profession trying to explain what evidence can be or can not be admissible in court. Evidence admissibility is one of the hardest task for lawyers and you are trying to prove your point by saying that 1) this video is inadmissible; 2) you know better cause you are a psychologist. 

Obviously you know nothing about evidence admissibility. This video can be a piece of evidence admitted in court. That’s up to the lawyers to prove the importance of the video, the pertinence, authentication of the video and a good presentation of it’s case. An attorney most be prepared to be objected bc of undue prejudice, hearsay, the best evidence rule or a lack of foundation for the introduction of the evidence, etc. It is our work to defend certain evidence and be prepared for any objection. Sometimes all you need is a little bit of creativity to make the evidence admissible. 

Secondly, I wonder how ethic is for a psychologist like yourself to go on to social media an say this is a typical scenario for an abuser when ANYONE with GOOD JUDGMENT know this technique can be used from both sides (the victim and the abuser). 

No wonder a judge does not have to follow through with an “expert testimony”. Some professionals apparently can’t separate themselves from their bias way of thinking and they can use the power of a professional title to abuse people.

You claim you were married for 42 years and your husband was an alcoholic and he never, ever touched you. I find that very hard to believe because most alcoholics are angry and when they drink they become worse. Claiming that you kids were never touched or involved in any way is bullshit. I am sure your kids heard everything.  All kids of abused women or that come from families with an alcoholic as a father or a mother, are simply told to go in their room, and they hear everything, all the screaming, the fighting ,the arguments, even if they're very young, they get scared and when they grow up they remember those things, or they'll ask, why is Daddy acting like that? Because drunks yell and throw shit around, so I'm going to guess you're a liar, not to mention the fact that you're also regurgitating what the other woman on here is berating other people for. 
He probably got locked up at least once and probably laid his hands on you at least once. I personally think you're full of shit and that you are remembering things the way you want to, or your husband was the nicest alcoholic I've ever heard of.",2019-02-23T14:24:30Z,0

 If i see somebody fiiling a big glass with a bottle of wine that is almost empty, and that person starts slamming things, throwing things around, acting dramatic, overly emotional ,and completely unpredictable, that doesn't show her anything? or  those aren't signs of anything, especially to a person that has been through it many times. Those ""mannerisms"" are not symptomatic of anything. She was just a young confused girl.
I am truly baffled right now, because when Amber took those pictures of the bruises on her face as evidence, most people would be shocked, but on the internet, and especially with famous people who otherwise, if not for the fame, she would be called a battered wife, but because of who her husband is, she is called a gold digger, a lying one at that.

I heard of this amazing scientific analysis, I guess you can call it, I'm not sure, but it's been around for a while, it's called kinesics.

Use your common sense.  The smashing of objects and slamming of doors - the inappropriate alcohol consumption. The screaming.  I couldn't live with a person like that.  I'd be a nervous wreck, which is ultimately why she left.  ""Why didn't she leave?"" people are saying.  She _did_ leave.",2016-08-22T07:44:57Z,2

559,Uggs-yri1KnuSHgCoAEC,Jaileyshouty catstv,"@Amanda Garcia Okay... so you were there? She broke the law by having him on video and publishing it to the public without his consent. I think if someone were to do that to me I would throw stuff at them after seeing that they were recording me. My brother's gf reminds me so much of Amber. She never calls my brother by his name, she always calls him by the name ""fag"" (that angers me all of the time since I don't like for that word to be said around me or my family). She tells him things like he is her slave and will do whatever she wants him to do. She is never in a good mood. She causes arguments and then will hit my brother in the face and at times bruise him. He has never once hit her and how I know this is because when an argument starts they move it to where everyone can see that he does nothing to her. She has gotten into it with me because she has called my children a bitch. Because my brother wont hit her and takes everything she doles out he will break things and has said before that it's better he hit his TV or keyboard than her. Yet I bet if she took a video of him hitting a wall or destroying his keyboard and put it out to the public, they would side with her saying what a piece of shit he is because he's angry and breaking things. But they don't have any idea what it took to get him there. Everyone is always ready to break out the pitchforks when they think a man might be abusing a woman, yet women who abuse men is never looked at in the slightest. Did you ever wonder why his kids hated her? Did you ever wonder why his mother didn't like her? Maybe it's because they seen the whole picture and not just an outline. Maybe she was abused by Johnny Depp, but it makes no sense that the mother of his children who was with him for 14 years and his ex-wife say the picture that Amber paints to the public is nothing like what they know. And it's funny how Amber was arrested shortly after her and Johnny's break up for domestic abuse against her girlfriend at an airport. Then Amber and the girlfriend try to claim that it's because they were homophobic when the arresting officer is a lesbian herself. Funny how Amber claims that Johnny is abusive and then was arrested for abuse.",2016-08-22T18:31:02Z,6

I would like to reach you about myself, I know this is me being a bit narcissistic but also for me I know I have been through a lot of mental changes in my life ... a lot had to do with different mental illnesses as well.  I was Shizophren for 3-4 months back in 2009 ... and I haven't been the same since ... and then I changed once more after I had gotten hit by a train.  I imagine I developed psychosis through severe depression and even after I overcame it I ended up developing severe PTSD after my train incident.  I have much more to share and I would like to do it with someone I find to be intelligent when it comes to the psychological field ... and I would feel extremely comfortable sharing it with you.  I dont know how to message on here or I would send it in private message instead.  You can e-mail me at  Ahmed.asghar.baig@gmail.com if you would be interested in on taking on a guinea pig to analyze.

576,Ugi_VGavAKvUZngCoAEC,Julie Lea,"@bad'hatter She was arrested for hitting her significant other, now she accuses her significant other of doing the same, the video shows her gas lighting him while attempting to get him to look bad on video, highly manipulative behavior which only shows how manipulative she is, as he doesn't raise his voice at her or even look at her. She waits until his terminally ill mother dies, then tells him she wants a divorce & if he doesn't agree to her terms she will make it a media circus (definitely emotional abuse, both the Mother dying & the media circus both being his worst nightmares). Then they settle for 7 miil, with the understanding half will go to a charity of her choice & half to a charity of hers, he writes the check to the charities in her name, she comes back with he should have to pay double because he gets a tax write off by writing the checks directly to the charity instead of to her!
She drops the restraining order, even though this is the most important time for a battered woman, the time when they are stalked, restraining orders are broken, & when murders take place. She isn't concerned with that because she manufactured the entire thing, & the manner in which she did it proves she has zero empathy, such as waiting to attack him after his Mother dies & throwing this media circus on him, and someone with zero empathy is mentally ill and a narcissist at the very least, but I wouldn't be surprised if she had some co morbid disorder as well. Most mental health professionals will agree with me, if they don't, they didn't follow her actions, because she is ""textbook""....meaning if you can read, then you can diagnose her with zero empathy....which is hardly healthy & a definite sign of a disorder.
 A psychologist can sit down with a case file on a person they've never laid eyes on & make a diagnosis from there, in fact, they often do. Some are complicated with overlapping disorders, but a long history of lack of empathy is something that is never ignored, it's one of the largest red flags out there, & Heard's behavior shows it consistently, along with being highly manipulative. Textbook.",2016-08-28T00:37:11Z,1
577,Ugi_VGavAKvUZngCoAEC,Julie Lea,"@RitzyRoo Indeed, in real life they are often attractive, persuasive, & very likable people. They are very adept at showing the face that needs to be seen to trick someone into thinking they are genuine. The danger lies in the fact there is no empathy (which really equals hatefulness in a marriage) behind the façade, & they often leave their spouse or significant other in emotional & financial ruin. In this case, Depp had the years of experience to settle but give the money to charity, but the betrayal & hurt I'm sure will leave him scarred. I've never liked Heard, she struck me as ""off"", but it's always easier to see when you are not WITH the person, I'm sure she had quite the persona cooked up that Depp fell in love with, & since none of his other relationships were with people like her, he was taken aback when she showed her true colors, as we all would be. It also explains why those around him, his family, caught on to her faster than he did...I've seen spouses defending a narcissistic spouse when confronted by family, & been close enough to see why. They give just enough, but it's all a game to them. They're actually quite talented individuals, it's their ability to turn hateful at any moment that makes them so dangerous when trusted. I think it's my real life experience with these people that have taught me the most, since I don't know this couple I can definitely say in all confidence that Heard is ""textbook"".",2016-08-27T23:16:25Z,1
