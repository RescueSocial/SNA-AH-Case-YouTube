1,UgyFLfc61h8v1M709nZ4AaABAg,"I wrote quite large piece- a few  comments down  on who I think should replace Mera, & don't mention who for a while .Soooo here it is GEORGIA MAY JAGGER.  Please read why in my comment below.",Tanya Riviera,0,2021-01-14T05:05:05Z
2,UgxT2_78v41gVzoQSrp4AaABAg,"HELLO!  I have a  new  & very different suggestion of who I think would be perfect to  play 'MERA'....Now firstly the popular way this seems to be thought about is ( if Amber ""hopefully"" is replaced). Who looks  the most like Amber? Also of course Mera- Now the problem could be yes the actress looks like her/them- but like usual people get attached to the actor that played the character, also Amber even through her allegedly disgusting, evil behaviour is beautiful, has charisma & is familiar to the audience in the role.
So simply replacing her with someone who ""looks"" the same or similar is not enough.... So No no no no no!- to Emilia Clarke or Blake Lively. Some might think my suggestion is not suitable  for many reasons, but here it is - Georgia May Jagger- yes she is a model ,not an actress, but neither is Cara Delevigne -who got a movie role in 'Paper Towns'.Cara in my opinion is far inferior to GMJ.  Besides this point GEORGIA MAY has a huge portfolio of modelling work, with several major companies and many commercials which are pretty much ''acting"". Also in my opinion Georgia is as beautiful (if not more so) than Amber, added with Charisma....Oh & side point for those who didn't know is the youngest daughter of Mick Jagger & Jerry Hall. Give someone new & fresh a go! I have no doubt that Georgia would make everyone forget the last MERA!

I'm fine with Emilia Clarke as Heard's replacement. I would chose someone else, like an unknown. An unknown actress would allow people to see just the character.

181,Ugwar115WayyiWHD38h4AaABAg,"Amber Heard committed a few, little, FELONIES in her attempt to frame her husband for domestic abuse. In 2016, the Judge DISMISSED her allegations of domestic abuse against Mr. Depp WITH PREJUDICE. That means: Amber Heard LOST the case, the Judge found the case to be ""egregiously flawed and without merit"", and Ms. Heard can NEVER bring these allegations against Mr. Depp any time in the future. It is unusual to dismiss WITH PREJUDICE, and indicates that the Judge found problems with the evidence in the case.

Because Amber Heard has given Mr. Depp a legal avenue to pursue her allegations (and because the media simply IGNORED what had transpired in Court), Mr. Depp will now have the opportunity to use his evidence against the evidence Ms. Heard doesn't have, in a Court of Law, and finally achieve vindication and justice.  If Ms. Heard had even a single piece of evidence, she would have used it to prevent the dismissal of her domestic abuse allegations.  She did not. In her original allegations of domestic abuse, Amber Heard:   Fabricated evidence and SOLD it to the tabloids (People Magazine),   Tampered with evidence and SOLD it to the tabloids (People Magazine),   Made a heavily edited video of Mr. Depp, (that did not show any crime) without his knowledge or consent, and SOLD it to the tabloids (TMZ),   Tampered with witnesses (the staff of the Eastern Columbia Building),   Committed domestic violence causing bodily harm,   Attempted extortion (see Ms. Spector's letter of multi-million dollar demands, sent to Mr. Depp BEFORE Ms. Heard made any accusations of domestic violence),   Committed perjury in the domestic abuse deposition,   Committed perjury in the divorce deposition,   Committed perjury in the defamation deposition,   and Defamation.  This just lists the crimes committed during the divorce. There will certainly be additional crimes added when the full extent of her behavior in the defamation trials she is facing becomes public. Felonies usually require three to four years of jail time...EACH.  There are ten separate crimes to be considered.

Do I think Ms. Heard will be replaced?  Ms. Heard will be fighting this in the Courts, and appealing the outcomes for at least three years...before we even establish how much jail time she receives.  Jason Momoa stopped following her on social media in 2018, because of Ms. Heard's nasty comments about his step-daughter, Zoe Kravitz. Since the recordings that Amber Heard made of her conversation with Mr. Depp was released (it is evidence in ""The Sun"" defamation case), where Ms. Heard openly admits that she hit Mr. Depp, and threw cans of lacquer thinner, vases, pot and pans, bottles, etc. into Mr. Depp, causing him injury, the publicity been a nightmare. RDJ was unemployable because he couldn't be insured.  In the recording Ms. Heard made (also evidence in ""The Sun"" trial) after she severed Mr. Depp's finger, her doctor has the nurse give her Seroquel, an anti-psychotic used with drug addicts. Ms. Heard admits ""All I was poppin' was Xanax, Adderall, Ecstasy, and hallucinogens."" How is Warner Brothers going insure her on this production?

IF you are going to comment on Ms. Heard's viability in any production, please do a little research. Everything listed above is in the Public Domain. TMZ covered the original trials, with links to the legal documents. Incredibly Average has released the full versions of Ms. Heard's recordings, as have the Daily Mail.",NIBS,17,2020-05-16T08:35:19Z
