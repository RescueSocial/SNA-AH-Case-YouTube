11,UgxsURrC75iDwSVptMV4AaABAg,"I agree that she shouldn't be fired for reasons pertaining solely to her personal life. Whether someone shows up, on time, ready, willing, and able to do the job she's been hired for, that's all an employer should care about. I probably won't watch Aquaman 2, but that's because I'm boycotting Warner Bros. over the _firing_ of an actor, over strictly non-professional reasons. And also because it'll probably suck, which isn't entirely unrelated to Heard, but has no connection to where she goes poo.

About her getting fired over weight, though...
Not all decisions in Hollywood are made by ""Hollywood"". I imagine that everyone on set is insured by the studio, and that the insurance for leading actors is very high. The insurance company will want to be certain that anyone they're insuring against accidents, with potentially enormous pay out, are as physically capable as the risks require. While an actor can be replaced by stunt doubles in most dangerous scenes, they'll still be in scenes with a higher than normal risk, and a movie set is a pretty chaotic and dangerous place to begin with. The thing about actuaries is that they don't give a shit about political correctness. They only care about minimizing the probability of having to pay out. If they've said ""Heard needs to be in THIS physical shape, or no insurance"", then Heard needs to be in this physical shape, or no movie -- unless she's replaced. If she isn't on schedule to be in that shape, the producers will, at a minimum, have to prepare for a short notice replacement, i.e. investigate which suitable actors will or may be free and willing to step in.

Also, actuators make for excellent cover. ""There was nothing we could do; the nerd said 'the stochastic model predicted a non-standard probability of an unacceptable adverse effect on the predictive value of the actuarial table for 35 year old women on set, so fire fucking Heard, or else', and that was that. We never figured out what the former meant, so there was no arguing with the latter. We considered giving him an atomic wedgie, but he said he was insured against that"". If journalists try to get an explanation from an actuary, their eyes will start glazing over within the first minute, and they'll be dead from boredom within five. They'll have no choice but to flee for their lives, and confirm that, indeed, actuaries aren't to be messed with.",Erik Jarandson,0,2021-03-18T23:18:06Z

13,Ugx5DVSnomM1MR5YIMt4AaABAg,"I don't agree. If because of her lies Johnny Depp lost all of his jobs, it should also happen to her. Letting people get away with lies is not ok!

I don't think people wanting Heard gone but being pissed about Miss Carano are hypocritical. There's substantial evidence she broke actual laws and clearly did her best to ruin Depp's reputation. That is an order of magnitude worse than posting even the most heinous shit on social media. 

Before you attack me, I don't think Gina said or posted anything worthy of being canceled, Hell, she didn't even post anything I disagree with, but even if she DID actually post anti-Semitic statements (she didn't) and said there was wide spread voter fraud (she didn't), and was an anti-masker (she isn't), and is an anti-vaxxer (she never said she was) then comparing her firing to Heard's still isn't apples to apples.

For the record, though, I do think there was wide spread voter fraud, and more and more evidence piles up every day. Just go read the Time article about ""securing"" the election. They admit violating the constitution to change laws to make it easier for Biden to win. I am an anti-masker, because the way the public uses masks is not effective and will never be effective, that's scientifically proven. I would also rather just be given live Covid-19 and take my chances and be isolated for two weeks or whatever than take the vaccine.

It's not tit for tat, Johhny Depp was falsely accused and everyone was all over him about it. Nearly lost his career because of something he did not do. He proved himself innocent and by doing that proved (or rather is proving) that Amber Heard was actually an abuser.

you're wrong about the principle of holding her job, in principle she should NOT keep her job.

why do you think companies and business owners etc, ask for new employee's criminal records?   
essentially she is a criminal, would you hire a criminal if you have a company? regardless of whether they perform their duties or not. they're a criminal. ( and even worse, they're IN THE PROCESS of committing said crime lol )

and even in the grand scheme of things, it is also wrong.
what kind of moral message are you spreading to your platform ( and the world ) by hiring immoral criminals or keeping them in their job? 
it's not like she did that years ago and she repented and needs another chance, this shit is happening now.

what kind of moral of a story would it be,  when a horrible, manipulative, narcissistic criminal gets to have a job that pays millions of dollars while 'good' law abiding moral citizens cant even find nor maintain a decent job?
it only proves to show the fucked up immoral and unjust world we live in.

That would be one time when a woman or man can be discriminated against because their costume and roll demand her to have that certain look.

It's also an excuse to replace her before Aquaman 2 start advertising, and we know how well the people have responded to Amber Heard.

There might be sanctions due to Amber Turd wasting everyone's time and money through lying on the stand, but the biggest issue she'll face is that she'll never be believed in court when she is to take the stand, ever again.  

The same will be said for her clique that lied on behalf of Amber Turd, they continued the lie on behalf of Amber Turd, so that they could further defame Depp's reputation in court as a political stunt at best and to further ruin Depp's reputation by colluding behind the scenes to further defame the man.  Jail time?  Probably not.  But I'd argue this will be terrible news for Amber Turd's Virginia court case against Depp, there will hardly be any chance of her counter suing Depp successfully.  

There are two battles in two different court rooms, one in the UK and one in America, Amber Turd being found to have perjured herself will only bring Depp's ability to find resolution, dignity once more and receive his old reputation back from those looking to nefariously harm him through seditious lies, innuendo and rumor.  The judge dismissed the UK case because he fully believed Turd handed over the 7 mil, the judge bought the lies hook line and sinker, the judge bought the lie and now the UK appeals case is not just viable but probably hard hitting for The Sun.  Now that Amber Turd has been found to have lied to the court, the appeals case in the UK should resume the issues at hand and most likely replace the biased judge too.  The UK case was dismissed for multiple reasons, all being on the word of Amber Turd, they never took the same stance when it came to Depp's multiple witnesses, they were all dismissed outright unfairly and unjustly.",Snuggle Struggle,0,2021-03-02T18:03:50Z

Yet Hollywood absolutely would fire an actress or actor if they could not meet the requirements of their contract, no matter what that might be. If the actor playing Aqua Man showed up with half the muscles, unable to fit in his costume, and safely perform stunts, he‚Äôd most definitely be out. Could you imagine if the guy playing Captain America just lost his bulk, and they put him on screen anyway haha? It would be ridiculous. Fitness is written into the contract, whether your playing Thor, or Black Widow. Hollywood does an immense amount of preaching, but the reality is that they are the last bastion of getting a job based on looks over merit, casting couches, and  Black Americans earning far less than their white counterparts. For all their talk, they adhere to a famously unfair system of degradation. The girl who will show her boobs, will always win the part over the girl who can act, and that still stands. And if you‚Äôre cast in a block buster superhero film, and your making those  tens of millions, you show up in shape. At the end of the day, Heard is a foul piece of human garbage, but when it comes to acting, she‚Äôs a fucking wretched actor! There‚Äôs a reason she‚Äôs been in Hollywood for years, and never carried a film on her own! I never even knew who she was until the whole Depp scandal!

337,UgxPG7G9hfXPvpavSix4AaABAg,"A woman fired for being fat would be a PR disaster. When the contract says she should be in top form (not only in weight, but also fit and ready for stunts) AND the company say:

She had a scandal, she has admitted how she committed Domestic Violence. Yet her contracts made it hard to terminate her. 
The perjury problems, her legal tactics all created unwanted risks, costs. and she was told, this is a huge issue...
These aren't fireable offenses, but they mean they will terminate her for any and all fireable offenses if she breaks any fine print on the contract and they will fish for an excuse if she doesn't fix her behavior...

Ability to show this, backed up with data, her own admission of guilt, etc. AND the fact she failed a surprise test of fitness...

And the difference between Johnny and her: Both would be presumed innocent till proven guilty, but she publicly admitted guilt and supporting that behavior by still giving her a role after firing others for rest is bad PR and her responsibility included avoiding that. So firing her and pointing out her admissions, some warnings, her previous DV record from a lesbian relationship, etc. would end up as part of the narrative. And as her deceptive behavior about donations managed to affect sick children of color (girls included) and she was shown abusive, some of those kids are plain victims, there is a strong narrative that can show why she has to be fired. 

Also, they can simply make sure that the stunts she would have to do herself would be so hard with her physical fitness, that she would have to say she cannot do it, and can be replaced that way.",Gergely Varju,0,2021-03-02T12:02:29Z

""If it was wrong for johnny to get fired, then its wrong for Amber to get fired""
Here's the thing about that.
We want equal, consistant treatment.  If hollywood is canceling people for being toxic and abusive, and they fired johnny, then 100% they need to get rid of amber too.  Doesn't matter if johnny did it, hollywood didnt fucking care.  They fired him because of the publicity, not because of facts, they didnt want the woke mob on them.  Same politics apply to amber, it doesnt matter if she did anything or not, they need to fire her on principal.  

I can tell you this is a real thing that happens, i've worked at places where boyfriend girlfriend or husband wife both get fired just because they had an argument, because employers that are reputable wont tolerate that kind of drama, it breeds chaos and they wont have it, they'll fire you both, even if you're both extremely high up in the business, you'll both be gone instantly just for having a heated argument in the lobby, ive witnessed it personally, on an executive level.

Amber is absolutely not immune to being fired for bad energy because thats exactly why johnny was fired. 

Now i've also seen women suck dick to get their boyfriend fired, that was one of the most fucked up things ive ever seen.

So no, you're comparing what we want, to what they do, not an accurate comparison, we want them to act consistantly.  We didnt like that they fired johnny, but if they are gunna do it, we demand they remain consistant and remove people that the people dont fucking want to see who are toxic as fuck and thats amber heard and everyone knows it.",Kugrox,0,2021-03-02T04:59:07Z

They're far more on board with this than I even am. I've written WB off as a lost cause and I've just here to watch the tire fire. They on the other hand take this personally. Why? Because three of my sisters have had their faces beaten in in previous relationships. That's the big thing that seems to be overlooked when talking about the normie audience.

Jeremy ALL actor's and actress's have a ""health and safety clause""(the you better look the part we hired you for clause). This is far more nuanced and complex then ""a few pounds overweight"". It is completely legal and put into use regularly. The difference between all other movies and Aquaman 2 is the litigation with Johnny Depp and how much the public hates her. However IMPROBABLE it sounds, it is POSSIBLE. Amber Heard was hired to look a specific way and do specific things for her role. If Amber's personal lifestyle has made Amber unable to fulfill her contracted role to portray as Mira then WB and DC have every right to fire her. Amber Heard is no where near popular enough with the public, has the acting chops, or powerful within Hollywood to have the clout to keep her safe from the studio's.


One example of the more public spotlight of the clause being used for leverage against an actor is Batman and Robert Patterson. The director has been on the verge of firing him because Robert has chosen not to get into shape to play Batman.",Kitsune Lee,0,2021-03-01T23:22:36Z

I wholeheartedly disagree with your assessment that AH should not be fired. 
First, she is a horrible actress. One of the worst. Just my opinion of course. But if I'm hired to do a job and I stink stink at it I'm going to be fired. 

Second, in this day and age where people are cancelled for their opinions!? I have listened to the tapes. She is an admitted abuser and she is a liar. She admits Depp didn't abuse her but mocks him! ""Who's going to believe you?"" 

My family and I will not support AH by watching Aqua Man 2. And there are a lot of guys that won't go see it either. I don't blame them.
And my opinion is not based on titt-for-tatt. It is based only on the words coming out of AH's mouth. She is a hateful harpie.

Chris Hemsworth worked out and had a tailored diet to play the godly character Thor.
Chris Pratt, lost weight and put on muscle to play Starlord in Guardians Of The Galaxy.
Natalie Portman got fit for the role of Black Swan and I bet she's training for her role as Mighty Thor in Thor 4. 
Charlize Theron gained weight for the film Monster. Look how amazingly in shape she was in the recent Netflix film The Old Guard.

If it's true that AH has breached her contractual obligations to be at a certain level of fitness to play the DC super character Mera, its well within WB's rights to recast the role with someone better suited to the character they envision.
