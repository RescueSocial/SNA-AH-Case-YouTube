4,UgzyIBMiSrD3BHoeC9l4AaABAg,Colonel Kurtz,"Thanks, I do understand. I think what I'm trying to convey to the audience is that I'm not an expert, just someone who is interested in it doing commentary. I did try to be more authoritative on the Marilyn Manson videos, though.",2021-03-05T06:26:39Z,2

6,UgyXUWfzegI1WYg3fi54AaABAg,Amanda Nicholson,"@Colonel Kurtz we should really go into this more with Esme Bianco getting him investigated for Trafficking. Not only could they be ruining his career but also putting him in jeopardy of a prison sentence. I was somewhat around the scene, I am a Fan I've been going to his shows since 94 and I've met him. My friend was a big fan and went on tours she has album after album of pictures. I'm not saying I know him and am biased if these situations were true I definitely would feel he should be punished but it's all so weird and fishy. The AH connection makes it worse and I feel that the Esme chick is flat out lying and it's very obvious. This is like a script for a movie for her.",2021-02-19T07:40:42Z,2
7,UgyXUWfzegI1WYg3fi54AaABAg,Colonel Kurtz,"Yes exactly! Very fishy, Amanda.",2021-02-18T18:56:11Z,3
8,UgxLku8O3mXerCdJjSt4AaABAg,Rock Candy,i think that this is an example everyone can use to become more informed on these situations and make sure we understand the evidence before we cancel someone.  I never really thought too much about the seriousness of DV on men and also how easy it is to create false accusations and destroy someone's reputation. Justice for Johnny,2021-02-21T18:02:27Z,4
9,UgxLku8O3mXerCdJjSt4AaABAg,Lost in Time,"@Mimi B Someone who worked with her said that she has a presence as soon as she walks in the room. An overwhelming presence that can make you feel like you would do anything for her. So I definitely think you‚Äôre onto something, I could imagine that one on one she uses her charisma to manipulate that person make them believe anything she says. In a group setting it would be harder to focus that charm on everyone at once; especially people who have experience with manipulators. 

I was once witness to an argument, I saw everything and heard everything. The manipulator managed to convince me that it was the fault of someone who wasn‚Äôt even there. I witnessed everything and knew that wasn‚Äôt the case, I knew but she somehow managed to convince me she was owed an apology, by someone that did nothing and wasn‚Äôt even in the same house when the argument took place. That‚Äôs the skill these people have, to this day I still have no clue how she managed to turn herself into the victim; when she was the instigator.",2021-02-09T08:26:03Z,1
10,UgxLku8O3mXerCdJjSt4AaABAg,Mimi B,"@Lost in Time I would love to have been a fly on the wall that day. I still don't know for certain what this says about her. What was she trying to accomplish? Was it an act for sympathy? Was she genuinely afraid because she knew she was flat out lying? Her nonchalant attitude in the taped deposition makes it seem as if she wasn't scared, but their are theories that she may be on anxiety medication or it's just a tough girl act. I have so many questions, but after following this case for about a year now, I've come up with another theory. I believe that Amber has a problem with telling a bold faced lie. She can lie behind a computer or phone screen, she can lie through other people, she can lie(or better manipulate) on a one to one basis, but she can't convincingly lie in front of groups of people. Just look at her ""acting skills"". She is only moderately good at playing volatile, manipulative, and/or seductive characters, but is that really acting for her?  Every interview and speech comes off as cringy and false. Her depo tape is a nightmare, and people have said she was exactly the same way on the stand. In the  interview about the $7mill donations she seems angry she was asked about it and especially annoyed when Johnny's GQ article is mentioned. She is obviously lying and the rest of the panel seems to pick up on it. They are, at the very least, sceptical about what she's saying. I could go on and on. Maybe quarantine has me overanalyzing things, but I'm interested to know what you guys think. Am I just reading too much into it or am I on to something?",2021-02-09T06:21:15Z,2
11,UgxLku8O3mXerCdJjSt4AaABAg,Deanna Gress,@Lost in Time I didn‚Äôt hear about that but it weirdly makes me so happy!,2021-01-30T07:48:20Z,3
12,UgxLku8O3mXerCdJjSt4AaABAg,Lost in Time,"@Deanna Gress I agree! I believe she felt JD would give in and never expected him to fight back; since he never did during their relationship. I heard somewhere that she had a massive tantrum before she went in to give her deposition, as she didn‚Äôt want to have to do it.",2021-01-30T07:44:46Z,5
13,Ugxb6f9X1Sni052rnMF4AaABAg,Colonel Kurtz,Ha! Thank you so much--I like her a lot.,2021-01-24T19:14:19Z,1
14,Ugyj3oVPFNk9AU__ocd4AaABAg,Deanna Gress,I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs mutually exclusive in fact it is very easy to see that she has blinded both of them at one point or another. I don‚Äôt hate E either. He is impressive in his achievements and flawed in his personal relationships. Unfortunately Johnny got the whole Horror show that is Amber but in being subjected to it was able to be done with her Whereas E will never get to that point because Amber needs him too much.,2021-01-30T07:03:45Z,2

37,UgxPP0tb3oEr2nc0HSZ4AaABAg,Colonel Kurtz,"Well, I was on Twitter defending him as soon as he filed the Virginia case years ago and I read his lawsuit. And I stepped it up during the UK trial. I've just been busy with life and didn't have the time or desire to do videos. I also just started putting out ASMR videos on a different channel, so it's not just the Depp case.

If you ever have any questions about how to do things on the YouTube end, I do know a couple ppl w channels that we could ask! 

I‚Äôd be more than happy to participate in anything!! 

I‚Äôve already retweeted this video out and have it bookmarked on twitter to be able to send anytime I see someone who‚Äôs new to the #JusticeForJohnnyDepp movement or wants to learn more about it, so that way I can send them this as a good starting point that they can then dive deeper in to!!",2021-01-13T08:15:07Z,5

46,UgzLXF7EE8ZQZllXZeF4AaABAg,DeeARTIST Jewelry,"@Colonel Kurtz I can send you some pictures with the bruise at the same place (right cheekbone) I've had when I stumbled and fell on my head - half of my face was swollen the first couple of days and it was impossible to cover with makeup. I went to see a doctor (have a proof) because my eye was swollen which made me terrified of internal bleeding/eye damage. I've had a skin discoloration, like a giant ""freckle"" on my cheek all year long, because skin around the eyes and cheekbone is sensitive and hard to heal - that spot was prone to sunburns, skin flaking would expose new layer of skin which is even more sensitive - it took months to heal and disappear (not something that can appear or vanish over night).",2021-02-27T15:20:25Z,4
