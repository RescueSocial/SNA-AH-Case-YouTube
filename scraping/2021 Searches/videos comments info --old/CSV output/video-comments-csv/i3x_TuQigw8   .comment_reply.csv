26,Ugx_4ZYqPqyKLBbH_B94AaABAg,Colonel Kurtz,"Ma'am, with all due respect, I've got someone with BPD in my family and have had several BPD friends through the years. I love them, but they have brought great heartache to me and others with their problems. I've read up on BPD a lot, and while you might know some outliers who have ""light"" cases of BPD and are therefore less problematic, in general they are extremely painful and difficult people to be friends/relatives of. Their perception of reality is often way off, they attack others unfairly, they project bad ideas and motives onto others and are paranoid, they are self-destructive and bring chaos wherever they go, and they usually have a propensity toward explosive rage. So I am basing my opinions off of much research but also many years of experience...I also find it interesting that I get so much pushback from BPD people on here, as the inability to take criticism or see other perspectives is part of the syndrome. When BPD people complain on my board that I'm being unfair, it's actually classic BPD behavior...You seem like a nice person and I appreciate your comments, but I want to be clear about where I'm coming from.",2021-03-17T17:42:00Z,1

You're very funny though, so at least you create positive emotions outside of yourself:) BUT if you haven't heard about cognitive functions I would absolutely recommend checking it out since you seem to be into personality theories already; it's basically theory on cognitive behaviour - aka brain wiring - and overlaps a lot with personality disorders (or at least shows what types of people will grow into developing the different kinds.) It's usually called MBTI, should have started with that, but yes. It's mostly pretty vague material out there tho, so if you want to get really specific and dive deep at once, I would recommend this channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCffhmXCZEpPFAUO_IbghGmg. Hope that link doesn't get censored. Also yes I can see how you could be mistaken for an extrovert on video. Introverts basically just spend a lot of energy thinking about stuff rather than acting, and then there comes a time when our head is filled up, and that can seem pretty energetic I guess.

But personal audio tapes between two people tell a bigger truth than any tweet, news coverage, or youtube video can display. My advice is listen to ALL the audio tapes, not just some. After listening in full to all the audio I could research, the only logical conclusion I can come to is that people who still think Amber is the victim, have not taken time to listen to the recordings between the two of them. She admits and justifies her constant abuse and literally victim blames Depp for wanting her to stop assaulting him.

I thought he sounded manipulative and talking about loving her so that she wouldn‚Äôt press charges until he realized she wasn‚Äôt going to back down. Sometimes people who are abusive to someone close are really nice and calm towards others. 

It‚Äôs not so strange that he might have been abusive towards Amber but not Vanessa if that was the case. That is what older age and years of addiction can do. Then again she may protect him because of their children.

196,Ugw6DXt9f2FE89sU87l4AaABAg,Kybele Kordax,"@Julie Fisk It's best to do whatever you can to have nothing to do with the person who has displayed that behaviour. It's reminiscent in a way of the film ""Single White Female"". Whilst both men and women can mirror someone, whether it's done subconsciously or consciously it is extremely unhealthy and a sign of severe dysfunction in the person exhibiting mirroring behaviours. Any time someone starts to exhibit mirroring, the instinct or intuition will urge you to get far away from them and cut off contact as much as possible and it's wise to do just that. Whilst the fact you had a partner of a family member try to mirror you is awful, it is good that you trusted your intuition and didn't let them ""solidify"" the relationship they evidently perceived they had with you. Stay safe and ensure at least one other individual who is psychologically stable and hopefully fairly knowledgeable knows about this just to provide support if needed in the future. Best wishes, from Australia.",2021-02-18T23:01:53Z,1

198,Ugw6DXt9f2FE89sU87l4AaABAg,Kybele Kordax,"The behaviour as mentioned in an earlier reply to you is ""mirroring"" and it's typically used by individuals who have a false and a shaky sense of self and identity, whether they are aware of it or not. Often these behaviours are utilised by people who have antisocial personality disorder or APD for short which is the new umbrella term in the latest edition of the DSM, the book referred to by psychiatrists and psychologists as well as medical practitioners, and which refers to both psychopaths and sociopaths. These individuals will deliberately copy the behaviour they see in others from the emotional cues they perceive to body language because they personally don't have those emotions and don't understand them but in order to seem ""normal"", namely neurotypical, they'll do their best to mimic these and thereby try to 'pass' as ""normal"" so they 'fit in'.",2021-02-18T21:42:53Z,6

We are so glad to have you! I will catch up with your earlier videos.
Stay faithful to your own values and virtues and to what is important to you. You said you are fine with using your cracked iPhone? If that's who you are, stay that way and maybe later you deliberately choose to be otherwise. Stay faithful to your own self. People will complain, troll, trigger, etc. Just be the way you want to be and you will attract and resonate exactly the very audience you desire with you and your vibe and by that you create your own special community with family feel to it. If you try to please people and try to please your audience, your vibe changes and you lose your identity.

But to answer your questions, as far as the lawsuit goes it has to do with defamation. Because of her misleading and false statements it caused him to loose lucrative roles in the case of Captain Jack Sparrow and Grindelwald. This effectively has cost him roughly 50 million dollars in lost revenue. She has now turned around to sue him for 100 million for ""defaming her character"" because nobody wants to hire her anymore (no surprise at best she's a pr nightmare). As for the jail time question. If it can be proved (and easily will) that she perjured herself or encouraged others to purjure themselves on her behalf that should carry jail time. When you take the stand you are required to say the oath ""I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth so help me God"". There's nothing ambiguous or murky about it. Therefore, willingly lying on the stand is considered a great crime here in the States. Even presidents don't get away with it. That being said, she is rich and has a lot of powerful Hollywood backing so it's entirely possible she'll get away with a fine and a slap on the wrist.

Good to know I‚Äôm not the only one that the use of that phrase resonated with (big sigh of relief I can say I‚Äôm obsessed a normal amount now) It seemed very odd to me. Any guess as to the Syrian family she has   ‚Äúchosen‚Äù? Maybe an Ex? Maybe someone she had dinner with once and has used for the purpose of making a point?

369,UgzFBXY639DLGSZjKvJ4AaABAg,Ride or Dis,Jennifer Howell and Whitney Heard refer to one another as ‚Äúchosen sister‚Äù. So it is odd Amber used it when referring to her ‚ÄúChosen family‚Äù of Syrians.,2021-01-31T06:27:55Z,2

372,Ugz8hgUmoclFT8kyppB4AaABAg,Natalia Urba≈Ñska,"Yes, that‚Äôs what most Americans definitely do very often. (I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôre American or not...). They call someone ‚Äúfamily‚Äù then take advantage of them. They especially do that in work environments ‚ÄúWe are all family in here‚Äù - because they want you to put your job above everything and anyone else. Plus, by saying it you‚Äôre supposed to be ‚Äúgrateful‚Äù that these ‚Äúwonderful‚Äù people think of you as a family.

385,Ugz5E_lh--s43nr_aNZ4AaABAg,C√©cilia FG,"@Colonel Kurtz I think there is something very very unique about this case. We are all getting to see what it is like to be the victim of a narcissistic person. Usually those acts are covert and invisible to the outside world which adds on to the trauma for the victim. Here we have audio recordings where we can hear first hand what true, insufferable, gut-wrenching gaslighting is. We are also seeing the perpetrator of the abuse disintegrate before our very eyes because of the mirror held by the public. I can‚Äôt help but be shocked by the difference between AH in those rum diary days where she looked eerily beautiful (don‚Äôt come at me please not charming but on this very first video she looks like one of the sirens in Ulysse‚Äôs tale) and how she looks now !

No has seen them , the court hasn't either ..There would have to be medical records for the injuries she said she received  like bruised ribs , broken nose , 2 black eyes , do you want me to go on ?
