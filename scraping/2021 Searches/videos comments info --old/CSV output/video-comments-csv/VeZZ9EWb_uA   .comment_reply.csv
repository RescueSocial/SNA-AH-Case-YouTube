18,UgwxScso6S632jH0LZ14AaABAg,Niki Bechus,"@Laus Deo BM There are loads of YT channels specifically aimed at educating the general public to make them better informed regarding Personality Disorders. Many of us have discovered when it's already too late  & we're already seriously involved with a person who has a PD. 
Many children who grow up having a parent with a Narcissistic or Boarderline Personality Disorder develop the mental health issue themselves. It can also happen if when still very young if there is a. absence or lack of a mother's nurturing, love & protection. If when still very young there is neglect, abuse or no bonding this can result in the child not developing emotionally becoming a PD as the get older. It is not an illness that can be cured and there is very little that can be done to help them. As for the rest of the family who have to deal with a member who has these issues it is an endless cycle of drama, problems & disappointment.
Go do some research it can only benefit you to be a little bit knowledgeable & aware of what type of character one should avoid. Be it romantically, in the workplace or as friendships.",2020-10-05T00:58:21Z,1
19,UgwxScso6S632jH0LZ14AaABAg,Laus Deo BM,"@Niki Bechus question is, why is she like that? People aren't born like this, but they are created like this in some time of their life. I do wonder why she is like that along with the others. I don't think any person at all would be born like that since their entire life. Please explain if you can",2020-10-04T22:54:39Z,0
20,UgwxScso6S632jH0LZ14AaABAg,Niki Bechus,"@Laus Deo BM She's a Narcissistic and they are not capable of loving another person. 
Initially they certainly appear so by becoming infatuated and even fixated, believing that they are in love. 
It always eventually turns toxic becoming abusive, dysfunctional & very much co-dependent. 
Starting out you're made to believe you are the love of their life, their twin flame. 
Then slowly and insidiously (some instances even quickly) they'll say or do something that will seem out of character which tests your self-worth and the level of respect in the relationship. 
This is when they establish if they have you hooked & what you'll be willing to accept. 
It begins with small run-in's such as raising their voice in anger, or ignoring your calls and messages. 
Slowly but surely the loving one you believed was your partner, you're seeing less & less of that person. 
The good side still gets brought out when needed just to keep you hanging in there hankering after the ideal person you fell in love with, thinking it'll pass it's just a rough patch they going thru.  
Before you know it you have become their venting board or punch bag where they verbally, emotionally or physically lay into you. 
They then proceed to project all their insecurities, hang-ups and toxicity on you. 
They verbally accuse u of doing the things which in fact they themselves are guilty of. 
They lay into you, trashing your character, twisting things around, confusing, blaming you & avoiding any accountability on their part. Breaking you down little by little, more & more. 
If it reaches the point where they feel it's possible you may have the courage to end the relationship, the rejection would prove too much for their fragile ego. 
Therefore before you know it they would've set things up where you're the one who's quickly and ruthlessly discarded of. 
If they can't do that then they'll go all out to spread lies about you, blacking your name & attempting to ruin your reputation. 
Not only will they do this in the cruelest & most heartless manner possible, they'll go all out trying to make sure you crash and burn. 
It's unbelievably devastating and you're left reeling and broken. 
As for the Narcissist >>>>

40,UgxoRPd-W0xGKXjeEHl4AaABAg,Patti_C,Sorry just cannot have any sympathy for this descipable person.  She had a plan to humiliate and destroy Johnny from the very beginning of her relationship while knowing he loved her deeply.  Her acts were to simply further her own so called career.  Not so sure it's mental illness but rather a spoiled child who will do anything to get her way.  JUSTICE FOR JOHNNY ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§,2020-09-28T13:09:55Z,5
41,UgxoRPd-W0xGKXjeEHl4AaABAg,Sarah Wells,"I'm sorry, I don't agree with you either, Johnny had an unhappy childhood, his mother, while he loved her, was abusive, he said at her funeral, she was the meanest person he ever knew, he isn't abusive, quite the opposite in fact, as many abuse survivors are. She must be held accountable, she has clearly never had consequences for her behaviour and is, in my opinion, from experience of an ex husband exactly like her, who, I might add had siblings who were not abusive, not going to ever accept responsibility for her actions. Even if she is charged for her lies, it will always be someone else's fault.",2020-09-28T04:03:40Z,8
42,UgxoRPd-W0xGKXjeEHl4AaABAg,Debi Espinoza,"@Julie Goodall I completely agree with you.  I have known people like her in my lifetime and the one constant is not abuse, but rather,  an extremely spoiled brat, without ever having faced consequences or made to accept accountability, in her life.  She feels free to do whatever she likes to others, as she is most definitely a sociopath/narcosis.  In her mind, she is within her right to hold others accountable, in the most violent and foul ways, for what she deems as hurting her, without repercussions, as they deserved it.  AH also believes that she is above most humans, so no matter what lie she tells, we simple minions will believe her.  She is abusive in all relationships, including her family; however, I do not ever see her truly taking accountability for any wrongdoing...EVER.  She is the worst type of human!  She is blatantly deflecting all of her behaviors toward JD without even a tinge of remorse or thought, which in the end, will be her downfall, as all of the recordings, in her very limited mind, were supposed to support her allegations, but we all know how that turned out. I signed the petition to have her removed from Aquaman....I am not a robot :)",2020-09-28T00:59:30Z,9
43,UgxoRPd-W0xGKXjeEHl4AaABAg,Julie Goodall,"I come to this discussion ""pitchfork free"" simply because I am a survivor of domestic abuse and would never even consider harm to another human being, despite how despicably they behave.   Once you experience pain like that you never wish it on another.  AH however is a different case completely to your relative.   I am angry at the way people continually try to excuse her abusive ways because she appears to be a ""frail female"".  (Not!)  I am also bewildered that a counsellor would make such a nasty comment to you and try to transfer guilt from the perpetrator to you - a relative - in such a flippant manner.  Nothing excuses violent behaviour or murder.  Back to AH - Letting her off by allowing her to spout more issues of ""her truth"" would be nothing less than a travesty and a huge betrayal to JD and other DV survivors, especially considering the pain, the loss of respect and work she happily inflicted on him as well as the ensuing vile treatment of JD's family from other sources.   I appreciate you are trying to balance out the scales, but seriously, this woman is way beyond something so simple as offering apologies or contrition. She is blatantly confident in her ability to talk over (or down to) people, as well as spin a tale however bizarre to achieve only what is best for AH.  I think the only ""cure"" for her now is a major personality transplant along with a hefty dose of empathy.",2020-09-27T22:48:47Z,8
