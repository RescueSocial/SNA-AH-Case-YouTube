0,Ugy1mkAPhf1O402YUXt4AaABAg,"Hey there - some people seem confused, thinking the UK was THE case. There are TWO CASES. UK 202, and US 2022. 

The UK was a disappointment, BUT it was a trial involving claims made by The Sun in their newspaper. It didn't directly involve AH at all, and it was also involving the system in the UK, which is notoriously corrupt and broken. 

The charity items, they didn't make it in and the UK didn't allow them. Why? Well...


Now I'm not saying US 2022 will do better, BUT this stuff exposes the corruption of the ACLU, it exposes the collusion between parties. It WILL NOT be covered by the mainstream either; its business as usual, figuring everyone will stop paying attention.",ThatUmbrellaGuy,216,2021-03-30T17:41:20Z

I have a feeling that they aired the appeal so as to regain some lost credibility after the big bombshell about Amber's lies hit.
