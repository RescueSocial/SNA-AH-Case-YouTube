1,UgzJMjlvYMaTFGOvc4p4AaABAg,"Only reason for Amber Heard to be confused in her life ( is because she got so many good chances /choices
 like Elon Musk and others
So she cannot just let the others go
Just like that
So big opportunity -her pride and joy
Anyone would love to have Elon Musk in their life
>
Reason her relationship with Johnny Depp doesn't work
She want to have them all
Keep them all
That makes her relationship with Johnny Depp suffer
If you are in the movie industry
Everyone knows your movement
Johnny Depp feels it , knows it
And although it is hurting
He larned to just ignore by avoiding
Confrontation with his wife
Not to give her reason 
Divorce him or any other excuses
>
When you are in a relatioship
You can feel the changes
With the attitude, behabiour
She cannot just let Elon Musk go
Too much to lose
>
Aside from good looking ,smart
Is very much in love with her at the time
>
It is a mind boggling to let that fantastic opportunity chances in life
But Kohnny Depp is a very good husband
But jealousy could change everythimg
So he learned to avoid 
Communicating with her
Because he's avoiding too much confrontation
And slowly
Keeping them apart
Love for Johnny Depp is mot enough to forget Elon Musk
And God Knows who else
If you are meeting someone in the elevator
Without relation
You have to dress you properly
Not with what she's wearing
It is really confusing
Too be so beautiful-she knows
That so many are interested 
And it is too much for her to lose  all the opportunity that is coming her way
So relation is suffering
She's looking for trouble with her rationship with Johnny Depp
For her to have reason to leave him
Ot hurts for Johnny-lucky he's nusy working
No-ordimary man could just have 
Amber Heard attitude
She-s very demanding
And she knows she got the extra ordinary beauty  that they are after
But beauty and attitude are 2 different that sometimes missing in a relationship

And rich",Edna rudecki,0,2021-11-11T07:29:50Z
2,Ugw0-P8VkM91ZaFnrl54AaABAg,"I think Deep has met a real vampire and still shocked with what It may come.
I think Amber is like a pit bull; won't give up the bite.
Deep is still innocent since no courts has judge him yet but she has already damaged his carrear and maybe his hopes in humankind.
A man, that happens to be a great actor, who has had a reputation of being himself, before a character on any of his works, suddenly in not much time after they got married, she raised a campaing against him that paid him badly not only to his job but his integrity and his honor, or right to be respected.
I think that Johnny has gone from trauma bonding to try scratching the flea off but it won't be easy for himself getting balanced; the narc abuse hangover doesn't go by slapping fingers.
There is not a case against him but Amber's bullying will keep going unless the Court stop the way long game and maybe John should get a restrain orders to her not getting near him in miles away.",Cristina Meg√≠as Cana,1,2021-10-04T22:44:02Z

5,UgyKekJpuLmdqBxdPEx4AaABAg,"Obviously these are 2 people who should have NEVER married. BOTH present their own personal problems they are struggling with. When you put them together those problems bleed into their romantic relationship and marriage so much so that they compound their relationship problems. It is evident this is an extremely toxic marriage/relationship. To make matters worse it doesn't seem like either of them married for the right reasons. In order to save the marriage they would most likely need to separate and work on their own personal issues first. My bet is if they did that to try to salvage their marriage they would both come to the conclusion that they didn't want to remain married. This relationship was extremely toxic from the beginning. It lacked the fundamental reasons to get married in the first place -add in the emotional, verbal & physical abuse, alcohol & substance abuse and God knows what else and you get a disaster waiting to happen.",Ldydi5954,0,2021-09-25T01:39:27Z

35,UgzFw_eQya7u5hQaPut4AaABAg,"What I find odd was her saying she didn't use makeup to create bruises and to make sure photos were taken of her 'injuries'. Her argument is all over the place. When Depp said that she should do what she has to, he really doesn't sound like he thought the courts would support her. I don't rend to agree with the past partner's statements about his character, that only goes so far, but Heard was arrested for assault before, and she evidences a temper, where Johnny demonstrates restraining behaviour (like pushing her away, but did he do so, or did he really push her to hurt her?) Johnny sounds tired and I think that's why he waited and listened to her, probably through hope that there is some resolve. 

If I look back to my own experiences of being abused, my ex was irate, excitable, accusatory and tried to call me crazy for ""imagining"" that he was any kind of cruel to me. So, patterns speak volumes in the case of Amber Heard for me. Johnny seems like a very reasonable man, and I do believe that all it takes is one thing for someone to snap and become violent, so maybe he did push or hit her, but not without being provoked and abused perpetually for years - evidenced in her behaviour in Australia, years prior. So I don't believe he is an abusive man. I have known abusive men, he doesn't fit the mold. 

Regardless of the impact on Johnny and Amber in terms of finances, career etc... what is tragic is that all this affects his children, when he mentioned his son having kids ask if his dad was a wife beater... the impact that has on the children will last a lifetime.",Vyv II,1,2021-02-13T12:49:14Z

39,UgyT6ZGBw6jalKvt0yV4AaABAg,"Your assessment of the situation is good, and she does appear to have kept the energy at the same level all the time, and there was admission om her side, and I listened to your assessment of an earlier conservation between them which was also interesting however narcissism and insecurity in a codependent relationship presents itself in many different ways, some obvious and some subtle.
 They are both in the acting profession and he has played a variety of characters with deep flaws and he is more known for his work than her, so he could have a fair amount of confidence and the calm way he handles their situation seems more from a sense of being higher than her and knowing that. 
He also has had a few beautiful women in his life and this is not good for a woman who is insecure but it could be for a man who is older and insecure about younger women staying with an older man - this is a form of narcissism as well when one partner plays on those insecurites. 
It is a codependent relationship and he is somewhat passive aggressive and at points seems to display lack of boundaries but then he defends himself against her insults but one can't help thinking that he knows he is bigger than her. She is too young on an emotional level and her emotional intelligence is low because seems to always escalate when she could deescalate and goes into patterns of physical violence which could be due to past cognitive association she is attaching to this relationship,  he is also insecure and him going away to his friends is also a way of obtaining narcissistic supply when he gets home and sees her distressed and he gets constant assurance that she needs him.
I have often seen older partners be the calm person, the voice of reason but that is also a place of power in the relationship and insecure people use it to manipulate younger partners.  
In one of the conversations you can tell she has abandonment issues, he goes to a friends and she is upset but what I find interesting is he at one point in that dialogue seemed to baby her, and it seemed that may have validated that she needed him and for some older people with Peter Pan complex that validation provides them with security.
She has unrealistic expectations that play into narcissism at times but I hear her struggling with trying to get out of that, it is unclear whether he is just an object to her because  he could be the focus but not the reason for her all her anger!  
He says he loves her and then makes an excuse for her not loving him the same way, that is passive aggressive and around and around it goes but it gives away one thing, he is insecure about her loving him and she is insecure, so around and around it goes, there is no interdependence, they cannot lift themselves individually out of the cycle so how can they lift the relationship out of that?",J Nel71,0,2021-02-10T00:51:41Z

Attractive people with money are offered temptations the rest of us will never have to struggle with, and I can't help wondering if - when famous people wed - they sort of just agree to look the other way when infidelity and/or indifference occur.

I really recommend Incredibly Average's youtube channel as a starting point for this case (all the videos, listen at 2x speed to save time), also Live Abuse Free is a channel that really helped me understand the psychological aspects of their relationship, and one of the first videos i saw relating to this topic is on the channel: Autumn on Venus the video: ""Eight ways Amber Heard..."". The channel Lost Beyond Pluto does a good legal analysis of the defamation case in the UK and finally the channel The Behaviour Panel looks at Amber's body language during her deposition in the divorce filings. These are just a few of the channels having covered this. This case has attracted many domestic abuse survivors, specifically those who have had abusers with narcissistic traits who recognize Amber as one of them - and i think an updated take on this from you could be really helpful.

SMDH. üôÑ What I see is tons of her projecting onto JD, including her aggression and claims about her (practically non existent-Amber who?) ‚Äúreputation‚Äù getting ‚Äúruined.‚Äù And he‚Äôs def not the one ass kissing and inflaming and inciting the media. As I recall, he‚Äôs the one who got dropped by Disney and JD is the one who has far more to lose on that front. AH‚Äôs ‚Äúreputation‚Äù my ass. üôÑ

He didn‚Äôt stand up for himself early on Bcuz this is what we do. We‚Äôve foolishly bought their lying bill of goods and we are having a kind of internal struggle with their lies vs the truth. (They love me. Maybe they don‚Äôt really love me. Maybe the whole thing was a con the whole time. Traumatized brain jumps in and says no. Can‚Äôt be that bad. I must protect you from this kind of pain. Etc. So we stick around a bit longer just in case we can hang onto that last shred of hope that it can get better with them. That their ‚Äúnice‚Äù and over the top affection for us will return‚Äîwhich was never real and was just their initial love bombing con to hook us in. And they play into that so well giving us little breadcrumbs intermittently. Just enough to keep us from leaving or believing the real truth). When we get first duped and then over time get abused like that, we are trauma bonded with that person and we don‚Äôt want to admit to ourselves how bad they really are until it gets bad enough to where we can no longer deny it in our own minds. And at that point, we finally accept the truth and might very well start to stand up for ourselves. With my narc parents, what they did to me was really bad, and yes I had a lot of unsavory reactive abuse myself (verbal yelling. Angry remarks. Slamming of doors. Cursing. Giving the finger. Stomping and ranting and so on). And then there were times I‚Äôd go have some alcohol or whatever when it was just THAT bad with them. So yeah. I did all that crap until I knew it was better for me not to do those kinds of things. How I was playing right into their hands and actually feeding them emotional supply. They totally provoke this behavior constantly tho and then they say you‚Äôre the one who has all the ‚Äúissues.‚Äù Imo this chick is so BPD. Plus JD kept a solid marriage (with no hint of abuse) together for like 14 years prior. So well, apparently AH has had numerous unsuccessful relationships and some having allegations of abuse as well. So eh. Pretty clear to me that first AH is trying to label her own personal issues as ‚Äúrelationship issues‚Äù and then it spirals down somehow to being all JD‚Äôs fault and now it‚Äôs totally flipped with her being this ‚Äúsaintly victim‚Äù and him being the aggressor. It‚Äôs perverse. It‚Äôs the typical MO of these types of personality disordered individuals. She is doing REAL female DV survivors no favors at all. I have zero pity for her at all.

87,Ugx9uywZN5zd7nasvd14AaABAg,"I respect you as a professional, and I find value in your work. 

I was taken back, by the lack of depth you put in regarding domestic violence, and how the victim will mirror abuse tactics of the abuser as the relationship progresses and the victim sees less and less success with healthier forms of communication, even at the end, becoming physical as well.  

I think an additional oversight is how domestic violence can impact a persons logic thinking. 

The abuser almost becomes similar to a drug to the codependent and vice versa because of the nature of the positive reinforcement (dopamine)  released, when they are happy, and the withholding when they are sad. 

I also think that coming from a healthy mindset (why continue in this level if unhealthy) gives you a set  of skills that not everyone has been given naturally or in environmental exposure. This assumption diminishes the perspective each of them has a choice to be there through the unhealthy, as neither of them clearly recognize it as unhealthy. 

The abuser creates a scenario, where there are two people, the one who is awesome, loving and wonderful, and the one who is abusive.  The victim (codependent) likely is so desperate to be loved (from unaddressed issues in their childhood) that they hold desperately to the belief that the 1st personality is the real one, and will eventually stop hurting them and their apology seems genuine.. thus starting the cycle over. That continues until the unhealthy relationship surpasses their own level of understanding of unhealthy, before they recognize it as toxic.

Anyways.. you‚Äôre the guy with the degree, and are clearly looking at this differently from me. 

I think I was just shocked at the degree of differences we were seeing in the tapes..

While you saw it as Depp continuing with  aggressive tone, given the level of which she has taken this extensive lie, and destroyed his reputation, I think that was his very subtle form of defending himself. Similar to a squirt gun versus a nuclear weapon lol the amount of anger he must be feeling towards her, for her actions, myst be immense.  

And I found it extremely interesting that your interpretation of the medias making the relationship worse. 

What he was saying was , she had taken it to the media, selling stories that HE was domestically violent. This created a much larger scale of abuse towards Depp and cost him extensive money to then have to fight to fix HIS reputation. 

What he was saying in this was, he wanted this to be settled, to stop the fight from becoming so much more out of control, and that his peace of mind, was far more important to him then proving her wrong.  

And I think he was baiting her when he was getting her to talk about previous abuse moments. By having her talk, she would be heard in her own words the extensive gaslighting. (She was recording him, and he knew it, so he allowed her own words to be the weight) 

What you hear in his declaration of ‚Äúlove‚Äù is toxic (abuse cycle love) he very much ‚Äúloves‚Äù her 1st personality. Just as she very much ‚Äúloves‚Äù their relationship in her perception. He is trying to negotiate that in his own mind. Its part of domestic violence processing. When someone finally recognizes the relationship as unhealthy, they begin to process that the 1st personality, and the ‚Äúlove‚Äù was in reality not real love, but more so like waking up from a dream, and to process that, he has to then work through that the dv cycle (her ‚Äúlove‚Äù) was not love. This form of ‚Äúlove‚Äù is incredibly hard to understand. Its cognitive dissonance at its finest. 

What I hear, is johnny trying to work through, that Amber does ‚Äúlove‚Äù him .. in her own way.. and that even with her continued use of vexatious litigation, and media reputation destroying, he‚Äôs still cant wrap his mind around why he still ‚Äúloves‚Äù her, and that demonstrates in its best form, the strong hold an abuser has over the mind of its victim.

Also I think cocal tones are important to consider, you reported what they both said like they were using the same tone, interpreting his phrases like he wqas saying 'don't reveal our private matters to the public' while instead what he was meaning was 'why are you telling those lies?' ; more than once he was concerned for her reputation, her carreer and safety (he talked about it with her mother, reassuring her and promising to take protect her younger life).

You do seem biased in your judgements, given the few of these I‚Äôve seen (other cases besides AH&JD). 
In the case of AH & JD, you seem determined to at the very least apportion *equal blame* to both parties. If the sexes were reversed in this, I just don‚Äôt see how your analysis would stand up as credible. There is almost no evidence of JD being abusive, yet you zero in on the slightest hint of anything negative with vague and pretty baseless opinions. Yet faced with some pretty damning evidence against AH, you actively look for any possible excuses you can apply. A common theme is that if she did do something, JD must have provoked it in some way. That‚Äôs a dangerous attitude to apply to domestic violence.
So far, you‚Äôve avoided the considerable evidence of AH‚Äôs abuse against others. I do hope you‚Äôll redress the balance.
Men get abused too.

The change is not you being less ""dry"" but me being more appreciative of your style because I have been schooling myself to use my mind better.

That made me susceptible to the influence of others, because I would discount or give less credence to any thoughts that didn't chime with how others saw the situation. Then later I realised that I had participated in fooling myself. 
So it's been really helpful to listen to analysis that is ""dry"" and logical, and realise that I should trust my own mind more than I did before. It's been great actually, like my fiance, I do love him but he does try it on. The other day he was whining about getting no support, for many reasons that is ridiculous but before I would have entertained the accusation against my own judgment.

It's fundamental to his identity. That infuriated her that he would walk away or stay calm or let her have a go at him. She berated him and goaded him. I watched a woman do that to her husband, when I was a kid. I've seen that dynamic with my own eyes. A couple days ago, I shared a post that said, ""The narcissist will hurt you and hurt you, again and again, waiting for the moment that you retaliate...Just so ""they"" can play the victim."" When he refused to take her bait, she invented victimization stories and borrowed them from actual victims. I also worked with a girl who was sitting on the bed, arguing with her boyfriend. He tossed something onto the bed and it bounced up and gave her a black eye. She went around work, telling anyone who asked, that he ""gave her a black eye"" and left it like that, so people would picture him hitting her. She seemed so self satisfied and almost proud of it, that I asked for details. I wasn't buying it. The next time I saw them together, I got the whole story. She had so enjoyed passing the word around that he had given her a black eye, leaving out the accidental bounce, that he couldn't have planned. There were a lot more behaviors, like that, from narcissists-I-have-known. I know the exhaustion in Johnny's voice. His going forward with this case, even though he never wanted to have to, may bring the reality of these disorders and their manifestations more to light and to believability.

207,Ugw2BjwK_scfOuRhh9h4AaABAg,"Dr. Grande in this analysis it sounds more like you are among the still happily marred who are proud of themselves about being married for a number of years after finally finding your true love. I too was dissapointed when being reminded that you cannot judge a book by it's cover when finding more details out about Johhny Depp's latest divorce because I must admit I do find Depp to be good looking. How do you know that Amber wasn't the one who brought forth first the offer of negotiating a more than fair separaton/custody agreement in writing first without a lawyer so she could protect the reputation of Dep and their children too and how do you know that Amber isn't being honest when saying that she felt like she had to defend herself to protect her health and continue being there for her children? It seems to me that people like Amber with an injury too just before her first divorce sounds like far more of a logical proof that she is telling the truth than Dep's claim that he is innocent only because she was using her less weight as excuse for her own first strike whatever that was. Why is it that some men can understand when a Sensei asks someone to leave the dojo and never come back because behind closed doors he is trying to hurt everyone there to prove his supremacy while going out of their way to not understand it when a woman wanted to leave her husband after she complained that he doesn't seem to know his own strength when it comes to when they are together? Could it have something to do with male priveledge in general and how a lot or men who are feeling insecure at the time aout how much money they might lose too in any divorce he might go through in the future and so he wants to make sure their male priveledge too continues in general? Depp had already gone through one divorce before his marriage to Amber and so he knew the truth about family court rooms in that no one there really cares that much about any criminal behavior which took place that needs justice outside of that court room as long as they too are still getting enough money to maintain their male and or just well educated priviledge too. A person could be into road rage, hiding firearms instead of registering them, coersive control and domestic violence too, and believe it or not sonetimes in some cases even child abuse of every kind and in family court as long as the criminal involved in the divorce hires a ditsy bleeding heart social worker along with a greedy psychologist in private practise who convenient at the time doesn't understand vulnerable narcissism in a man and so who believes that the man seeking divorce in the custody dispute too is doing his best to change in therapy then no one in family court is going to be later all that concerned when the unethical psychologist recommends that the children remain with the father who still has the most money to burn for them too. In support groups for women long after 9/11 I have heard so many such kind of true stories. So the moral of the story is when someone does something criminal to you -- Go to police first right away unless of course you are married to one or he is a former police or bylaw enforcement officer with connections with the boys and girls now n blue too behind the police station desks. Well in that case it is going to be that much harder to prove that you were acting in self defence behind closed doors unless you for example showed up in emergency with an axe still stuck in your head or something like that and then peope would for sure believe you when describing how you tried to defend yourself before impact. Which is why I feel a bit more anxious today and in a serious mood and more easily startled after finding out only my axe got stolen out of my garage just yesterday but nothing else after I posted on Facebook a picture of some trees down with it that were threatening some power lines in my back yard. https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/ottawa-clinic-says-it-can-cure-pedophilia-but-critics-argue-the-claim-is-unproven-and-dangerous https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/love-and-sex-in-the-digital-age/201901/surviving-r-kelly-the-hip-hop-hebephile https://pressprogress.ca/meet-30-candidates-for-jason-kenneys-ucp-who-got-caught-promoting-hateful-and-extremist-views/",Frances Bernard,0,2020-07-02T02:33:04Z

Yes, both there behaviours fit into an unhealthy relationships, and Depp's drinking and substance abuse was also a contributing factor for Amber as well. But if you delve into more facts, you will discover that Ambers behaviours of verbal abuse, falsifying documents and statements, and controlling manipulating behavious was used on way more subjects than just Depp.
To put it in a nut shell, Johnny was the one covering for Amber inorder to protect her from her own bull$#!&.
Yes...there are always two sides to a story, but there is no proof or pitcures of Amber with scratches, brusies or cut off fingers, that Depp has. Only her threats to Depp that she had proof.
Her only bruise is one that  many people witness was not on her face before or after the day she filed for abuse.
 Infact it shows in many tapes and conversations, of Depp leaving before things could get out of control. One of the things Amber criticized him for.

I saw my younger partner (we lived together) as being nearly constantly angry -- where she herself didn't understand WHY she was angry most of the time (and indeed, it seemed she only vaguely and intermittently understood that she was ""angry"" because the relationship wasn't providing her with what she wanted (this seems true with Amber also, IMO) -- which would elicit from me ""why are you here then?"").

256,UgwOGEVs7HMCXr3ZoH54AaABAg,"To me, Amber absolutely is not convincing in the part where she talk about fightclub, ""bruise makeup"" aso. It seems to me like she is running through her actual plans, so deep into her own story that she gives herself away. I dont think it was her plan, but she is submerged in her own speech. Maybe she is testing her story to hear what Depps respons and course of legal strategy might be? But she looses control over herself (her mouth) in that moment. She Fmakes a mistake.
Photographs & video/surveilance footage from elevators, hallways, the reception desk in the buiding where they had an apartement, tv shows, public avents, plus statements from police officers, Ambers personal assistant and makeup artist, even some of those close to her etc etc show and have stated they have never witnessed any form of bruising or any other kind of evidence of Amber being a victim of abuse. Even the private detective Amber hired to gather dirt on Depp, turned on her and has called her a liar and has stated that he could not find a single person (going back to the mid 90s) that spoke even remotely badly of him. 

Depps ""calm"" sounds more like defeat and confused fatigue. His moment of reaction, is a moment of clarity through Ambers ""gaslighting. I've been there. I know. I recognize the emotions behind his different tones of voice and words.",Anna Hart,0,2020-04-10T02:11:14Z

259,UgyxpYmY04GmWTNUIgZ4AaABAg,"He is really reading weird things into what Depp says.  At the end Johnny  just got tired and gave up.  It is common in discussions when speaking with someone and trying to reason when they see they are getting nowhere.  I do not think this at all made Amber more sympathetic.  Johnny just sounds tired of it all in his tone and his clear statement at the end that this Dr says why didn't he say that earlier is a bit daft. That made no sense whatsoever to me and was biased against Johnny, reading things that are just not there.   In fact to me the daftest comment he made in the whole of this video.   Has he never had a discussion with someone when you try to get through to them and then give up when see it is going nowhere? Then make a final given up conclusive summary statement.  Quite normal. 

I know he says unbiased but all the way through this he seemed albeit subtle in some instances, biased in favour of Amber by the way he translated things showing all the way through this video.  Ignoring so many facts and also subtle twisting of what Johnny says.  I found the whole video a little irritating.  Also found irritating his explanation of names used.  If it is about syllables Heard is one and Amber is two and sorry his other excuse that Heard is a verb is a bit patronising .  I am sure his listeners would know who he was referring to when he says Heard said this or Heard is.  Should have stopped listening at that point as his reasoning made no sense.  They both have a two syllable first name and a one syllable surname.  That didn't ring true for me at all.  However to use a first name is subtly more familiar and friendly than using a surname only. He should have equalised by using either both first names or both surnames.  A subtle and somewhat  subliminal influence perhaps with regard to instilling sympathy?  Well that is how I felt anyway although he may beg to differ.  Now he may not be being overtly biased but subtleties  can have a big influence as I said subliminally on his audience.",M McKenzie,2,2020-03-26T17:12:38Z

288,UgzEFOPgng7Vy6emiqJ4AaABAg,"Your analysis appears to be quite superficial and based purely on the face value of that conversation, with no attempt to look any deeper given everything that has come to public attention so far. For example, at 4:04, you say JD's comment about whether or not AH did really love him was not a deescalation strategy and made the conversation more aggressive...but they were trying to have an honest conversation about how they saw things and he was simply voicing his doubt about whether she did, in fact, love him...which is hardly odd if she has been abusive and manipulative in her dealings with him. I don't think it was a barbed jibe made with any intention to cause a fight. If anything, it sounded like someone sadly facing the fact that the person they thought loved them probably didn't. The funniest thing about you mentioning this is that AH didn't even hear it, because her call was cut off at some earlier point and she rang him back just after he said it. With respect to your comment that JD could have just stopped the call much earlier, based on both leaked audios (which you appear to have heard, though perhaps not really listened to), I believe JD persisted with the conversation because AH complained to him that the thing that makes her really angry is him 'splitting'  before she's finished with him, so he had promised her that in order to try and resolve the problems between them, he would stop leaving as long as things didn't get violent. He even said to her, 'when things get physical, we have to separate,' to which she replied, 'no, we...' and trails off. What kind of person who claims to be being abused and is afraid for their life says no to that? She first of all says she can't promise that she 'won't get physical again', then later promises she 'won't resort to the same shit' as long as he doesn't walk away in the middle of her having a go at him. In fact, in one of the conversations, AH said something that implied she WANTED fights to escalate into more than words: she complains that she hasn't been able to have a fight with him 'beyond..any real talking, kind of speaking context', because 'any time anything goes wrong, you split'; note the words 'BEYOND talking/speaking': it sounds like she is annoyed that he walks away and won't let the fights escalate into screaming and violence the way she wants them to.

She wants him to settle FINANCIALLY; she doesn't want to get things right EMOTIONALLY. That's why she's so quiet when he tries to do this and why she then brings up her evidence. The LAST thing she wants is for this to go away quietly--not unless there's money involved! She's disgusting. Also, in the first recording, I don't think she is at all upset that he ""splits"" because she loves him (LOL). She's upset that he splits because if he's not there, she can't goad and bait him into doing something rash like hitting her, which she would KILL to get on tape. She's not borderline and feeling ""abandoned"" when she brings that up.  I have to say that two male psychologists on YouTube that I deeply respect (Dr. Grande and Dr. Honda) seem to give her the benefit of the doubt to a ridiculous degree. I wonder if they're a little taken in by her charms despite their efforts to be objective? :-) Just sayin'! :-)",Quintessence,2,2020-02-13T22:17:08Z

He is clearly a co dependant with all the classic behaviors when in a narcissistic relationship or argument.  He was calm, kind, logical and rational trying and willing to fix the situation at all costs (just like a good co dependant would do).

In the phone conversation she ADMITS to planning this for months.  ""Putting on makeup to 'fake' her injuries"". Her makeup artists testified to not seeing any bruises on her face from the time she claimed to Johnny threw a phone at her face and repeatedly assault her. She also says that she doesnt want to go to court but would make contradictory statements afterwards. I know and understand that you dont want to diagnose anyone here for liability reasons. However, she is abusive. She has a history of abuse and was charged with domestic violence in the past. She may be narcissistic as her arguments and statements are a reminder of the actions my narcissistic father would do and make.

326,UgyxRuUvtcPHxZ3mG2p4AaABAg,"Amber Heard was seen without bruises on her face by multiple account witnesses. Even the authorities confirmed that She never had signs of abuse. She spoke about having a broken nose, bruises on the sides of her face all in the same night, claiming it was a life threatening experience, she goes on the next day for a tv show premier with NO signs of abuse. So the fact she had any bruises made by a fight was clearly inconsistent. Also the incident from in which she says that he threw a phone at her. Was also a gaslight attempt by her, as he tossed the phone over his head not attempting to hit Amber with it, ( comfirmed by eye witness testimony.) Johnny's ex's defended him saying he never laid a hand on them. Confirming he has no history of domestic abuse, or aggressive behavior ( twords his spouses) .  when She got violent with him said he had to push her off one time. As stated. He also states that "" the only time I threw anything at you was when u  fucking threw the stuff at me in Australia"" now. The rest of the time things were escalated he left the room. So seems like to me Johnny is a passifist. In a documentary he has said he was abused by his mother as a child. Which could be one if the reasons why he seems very chill about this situation. It could possibly be something he's used to. This isn't healthy of course. But this is what I left out of the video. More often than not the accounts of Amber where looked at the most. On her end. She has a history of violence on her past relationship with her girlfriend and had to spend a night in jail. She has scratched Johnny's face punched him. Kicked a door in his face following a punch after that. She has thrown objects at him. Let's revisit the the severed finger story. He had to have surgery to get it fixed. However what wasn't spoken about was the fact that he also contracted a flesh eating bacteria known most commonly as MRSA. Which could have cost him his life. There are eye witness accounts of this women hitting him in public in other states. In short. Amber Heard abused Johnny Depp. Johnny Depp has not started in physical interactions that we know of from his end. And it looks like he most likely never will. Despite the damage to his reputation he still wanted to try to salvage their marriage. The 2nd phone call seems to indicate ( to me) the breaking point as she says something that probably broke his heart. This person who is used to being belittled had a breaking point. What She said in that video was in fact his breaking point. ( respectfully the conclusion that i come up with here is that, this isnt a case of both parties being the problem.

Depp, with his long history of abuse and violence, clearly antagonizes and provokes her, but she really responds with full on crazy. This is a dominance strategy used by men against women for centuries, to provoke emotional responses as a form of dominance and they still don't expect to have the table turned on them as many women are doing now. But two wrongs don't make a right. They are both exhibiting push/pull and crazy-making like a true dysfunctional nightmare celebrity couple.

Amber was born in April of 1986. I turned 17 that year. My husband turned 20. Johnny turned 23. Can you even imagine how very different our worlds were? People like me, or Johnny, were already adults when she was a newborn, and we hadn't grown up with the instant-gratification world that she did - with things that contributed to the instant gratification expectation, like cell phones and email and whatnot. It's a huge, huge difference. 

She grew up learning that whatever she wants, she should be handed that thing. Right away. And if it is denied to her, she can throw a temper tantrum and get it.

But clearly from different places.    
From what I read she put way more than she should‚Äôve put in the public eye...and it backfired. Her reputation is hurt because of her actions not his. She‚Äôs clearly gaslighting him, and she‚Äôs proven via her own parents comments to Him this isn‚Äôt the only time she‚Äôs been involved in a volatile relationship! 
    Her parents texts to him are apologetic to him in their tone. Any parent who really believed their child, male or female, was physically and mentally abused is NOT going to engage the alleged abuser with this much civility! That‚Äôs what convinced me that the trouble maker is Amber; not Depp! 
     I also got the distinct feeling by the way she questions him, yet avoids solid answers, she‚Äôs realizing this is coming to an end, she‚Äôs pushed him too far. She‚Äôs almost desperate in her verbal circling!  What‚Äôs the saying about one protesting too much?! 
    All the public texts and conversations, coupled with the fact that Depp has been in the public eye for years...NEVER a word if him being abusive what so ever make me believe she‚Äôs been the aggressor and put him in a no win situation. She knows he adored her, and she used that! Now the finish line is at hand and she‚Äôs clearly making a desperate attempt to keep it going!

In my experience arguing with female partners, if I bring up something she did and I had done similar or worse (even if it was years ago) she would bring it up with a date and time stamp thrown with it. Amber does none of this. I believe he has had to hold her off a lot.

it's pretty important imo what we DONT see. we see her being focused on the living arrangements, rather than telling the truth (in her eyes) and getting away from an abusive husband. we see her being focused a lot on the court documents getting found out by the press a day or two before they likely would've been found out, all this meaningless stuff.
Also he points out how he was abused and she just seemingly cant wrap her head around it, there's a noticeable silence after he asks if she believes she ever abused him. she rubs it in his face how he wont be believed. she knows she's in the winning position in the public's eyes.
I also dont see BOTH of them focused on the fair fight thing. he brings up how she injured him, and SHE mocks it saying ""You can please tell people that it was a fair fight, and see what the jury and judge thinks. Tell the world Johnny, tell them Johnny Depp, I, Johnny Depp, a man, I‚Äôm a victim too of domestic violence. And I, you know, it‚Äôs a fair fight.

428,UgwEZa6xm9Fnk0XbWDx4AaABAg,"Many examples of shaky reasoning here.  First of all if a person is supposedly built more for physical conflict than another this does not make him mentally and physically immune to damage and pain.  We are told that being hit by a woman is no excuse to hit a woman. Reciprocation is not an excuse it must be self defence. I assume this applies to women when dealing with men too. From your assessment johnny (which has the same amount of syllables as Amber by the way) would have to be totally unable to speak or move to be a victim. Seriously, do you believe that ""you never really loved me "" could be seen as some sort of aggression that is worth mentioning under these circumstances. It sounds like a true statement to me. 
By all other accounts Johnny is a completely non violent individual.  Of course if amber came out of this with a black I It would be off to prison with him and Amber could move on to her next victim. She has already been arrested for DV and it has done nothing to stop her. Perhaps a black eye might do the job.  Perhaps the reason that female instigated DV is rising at shocking levels is because we have removed the natural consequences for it and they can now proceed with impunity.

It's harder for a co dependent victim to let go of a destructive relationship and he keeps his hopes high even when he subconsciously knows it's impossible he will never ever hear an apology or an admittance of part of the blame from Heard because narcissists rarely apologize unless they have the control on the dynamic and they take the decision to postpone the dynamic of abuse for another moment with a feigned apology.
It amazes me that in any of the 2 recordings, Heard is incapable to articulate an accusation or a concrete situation against Depp where wether he started any physical altercation nor if he was verbally abusive towards her in any point in time, she just states things Johnny arguably said that sparked her fits of uncontrollable rage. That is not the same as verbal abuse.
Malignant narcissists like Heard don't need much to jump into a conflict and escalate it rapidly. Her dismissivenes, her mocking, condescending and patronizing tone and never ending verbal impetus is so typical of a narcissist. And every narcissist tactic is used and noticed on Heard in the first audio recording: gaslighting, stonewalling, etc.
Of course any injuries she might had happened when Depp was on the defensive, just like the shoving moment on the first recording; hitting someone with more dense bone structure, weight, and muscular tone  will cause bruises on the attacker, just like  someone hitting a concrete wall will cause bruises or break a bone.
Witnesses have stated they've seen Heard without the bruises before and after he went to the police and there may be photos supporting this theory but they're probably being held as evidence for the ongoing case of difamation.
Is Depp a narcissist?
It is really hard to conclude that with the evidences presented so far, at least for me.
Actors have a required level of narcissism and it's expected, but not to the level of toxicity or danger as witnessed in Heard.",The Supernatural Anaesthetist,10,2020-02-12T05:08:54Z

438,UgyC147ub-4fecih2jl4AaABAg,"Your analysis is materialistically, meaning you have considered the words spoken only, and over look the rest of the information: the tension the motive and the instanteneous feeling when they say what they say.

Like this: I love you.
A good actor can say that phase in more than 20-30 different ways. From evil intent, killing intent, oppressive, aggressive intent to joking, sarcasm, to descending attitude to questioning attitude, to fearful, to joyful to happy to surprising etc... to ultimately true love.

If you only consider the words spoken, you missed out the majority of the situation.

I fucking hate you: speaking in an aggressive irritating voice with killing intent is a whole world different to ""I fucking hate you"" in a tone of complete devotion, submissive voice with the attitude of inseparable part of himself/herself.

In this video, pay close attention to the attitude and the intent of both, you clearly see the evil the aggrressive anf manipulative psychopath of Amber Heard, the toxic behaviour was from her. And with just reading the transcript without hearing them actually say it, you get absolutely nothing but the hollow evidence that works in court, sad but that is the reality.

However, thing bad always because of both side. Amber Heard is like that, but for this to happened also because of Depp was incapable of dealing with her, she found a way to get into his mind, either she was too good or Depp was not good enough to handle her, both cases are correct to a certain extent.

Now about Amber Heart, let dive into her own worl, her own conception. She said Depp is the baby, she said Depp have to fight with her to help her, perhaps beat her up so she can feels he is stronger thus can provide security for her (this is in her own conception, her own world), and this is very common in reality, many people are like this. They need other person yo beat up the beast inside them.

Yes Depp failed to defeat the beast inside her.
But even in this her own conception her own imaginary world, she is still wrong.
It is her own beast, she is the 1st and the inly one to be responsible, other people might help but they has no obligation to do so, nor do they have to be able to beat that beast up FOR HER.

That beast in her has causes Johnny Depp tremendous amount of trauma, physically and mentally, and remember, extreme mental trauma most of the time last for the rest of your life.
In both cases, she all was wrong.

Now here is the truth, either her herself or the beast within her? They are both the same, they are just one Ambet Heard, nothing else, no other person, just one anf only Amber Heard.

What she did was totally wrong, ethically, socially, culturally, physically, mentally and lawfully wrong.
Johnny Depp deserves much more love so he can be healed, justice to be served.
What wrong can never be right,
And what is right will always be supported and preserved.

To Johnny Depp: we love you.",Tuan V Nguyen,1,2020-02-12T05:02:04Z

I heard Johnny resigned to divorce as the only option and trying to get Amber to see the damage she was causing. For the first time it finally dawned on him just how delusional she was that she believed she was abused and not an abuser. She is incapable of admitting any fault or answering yes or no. 
You hear him say Oh My God when the realization hits him that she will destroy him without batting an eyelash. His reputation or his children (her stepchildren) mean nothing. She‚Äôll mow them all down to serve her own selfish needs. He tried to save her from what he knew would be the public backlash. Look what is happening now. 
He was protecting her even after leaving her. He wasn‚Äôt saying he ever got physical or less physical. His point was he never did any of the things she tried which is her rationale for why she can‚Äôt possibly be abusive. Her logic - She was hitting him not punching. She was physical but only 115 lbs and couldn‚Äôt knock him off his feet so clearly that isn‚Äôt abuse.

490,UgySVN5EnFnhwjTK7_x4AaABAg,"He said he still loves her. That makes me both sad and amazed; love really does some times trump self interest and what is best for oneself. Judging only by what you have said of the recording, I do not see it as hostile of Mr. Depp to follow up with ""... whether or not your love is true"" (paraphrasing). A few billion love songs have pointed out that LOVE HAS NO REASON behind it (well, Darwinian reasons, yes).

As for calling Ms. Heard by her first name, I have spent 50+ years cringing every time I have been required to call strangers by their first names: it is too intimate, and I detest doing so (ditto eye contact, etc.). Before the 1930s that behavior would earn someone a punch in the face (UK and USA). Nor will I call people older than I am by their first names: it is disrespectful.

As for a criminal case of violence against Mr. Depp, it appears she may be doing ""damage control"" from admitting, in the pervious recording, that she was violent and abusive.

Divorce lawyers tend to have the same approach to a new case: the first thing they tell their clients is to *NOT* communicate, nor visit, nor have any contact with ""the opposite side"" (that includes family members, friends, co-workers). Nothing positive comes from clients not following the dicta.

As for a ""fair fight,"" it is historically noted that several famous gun fighters ""backed down"" when faced by a clearly inferior opponent out of a sophisticated sense of ethics. As I wrote in one of my books, there is no such thing as ""a fair fight"" unless all combatants lose. The lawyers win, and the ""tabloids.""",Desertphile,5,2020-02-12T03:44:44Z

495,UgxCkObIhbxPNEcbw1V4AaABAg,"Any violence is unacceptable on either side. Unless it‚Äôs self defense. I would never hit a man unless he was coming at me, nor would I throw something at him. I might yell and scream in anger but I would also never curse, or at least there are very few situations when you would need to use cursing. And I don‚Äôt want to be verbally abusive to another person. I would leave. There is a time when if you can‚Äôt get along one person or the other should leave to keep peace. I don‚Äôt think either one are innocent. Yeah I couldn‚Äôt listen to it either it was painful. Also there was a lot of alcohol involved and possibly drugs. If either one is narcissistic or cruel it is going to be a problem.",Seraph,2,2020-02-12T03:36:41Z

502,Ugz-9BFqBtybdCKfYTh4AaABAg,"It's called ""reactive abuse"" or ""baiting and bashing"". The victim ( johnny in this case ) always ends up having their emotional hot buttons pushed(to get the reaction the abuser craves )  and then the victims do  and say things they regret and act out of character. This then makes them feel guilty and take some responsibility, not knowing that the "" fights "" are often fake and manufactured to create space and to storm out the door and go cheat etc . Often  preplanned , not the emotional outburst it appears and is thought to be. .  In this case she would sometimes  get johnny to leave and stay somewhere and pretend she didn't want that.    You can also get narcissist fleas ( see inner integration narcissist fleas ) after the relationshit is over. Takes time and awareness for the fleas  to go away .  And again , it appears that Johnny's exes said no abuse and none of this nonsense occurred in his previous relationships. . She couldn't control him is one problem here.",Kevin Johnson,175,2020-02-12T03:28:43Z
503,UgzH97EnFU-2tBkuFO94AaABAg,"I know you‚Äôre attempting to be careful, but Amber Heard is an abuser.

Edit: I don‚Äôt think this makes Amber more sympathetic at all. You need to really look at the evidence of the case. She flies into rages and literally drugged him with Xanax.
