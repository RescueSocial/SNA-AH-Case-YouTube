So, you are making fun of somebody who is already insulted everywhere on the internet and who certainly suffer from a mental illness which could be considered bullying.
She also doesn t look at the camera because the cameraman seems to be filming only her face while she is answering to the interviewer who isn't next or behind the cameraman .

71,UgwbmqK0DNOZomfPR4x4AaABAg,"I Hate to Stick up for Amber in any way ( I actually loathe her in practically every respect  Especially her behavior and manipulation tactics) 
But I will say that it appears that this interviewer was asking questions remotely ( as in not Via Phone instead  actually present in the room with her) Which might account for SOME (not all) of her lack of focus.
This is No excuse however because She IS being filmed and is fully aware that she is on Camera. This IS part of her job and she should be professional and take it seriously.

It is as if she can't fully focus unless there is a physical person in front of her to engage and emote with,  Or manipulate with her idea of Feminine wiles ; Which becomes apparent when she is interviewed or speaking with men.
 With women, she is a bit more cold and distant; Particularly if they are Attractive, as she seems to view them as competition. 
It is a very Narcissistic approach, where she tries to get men to be attracted and enamored with her ( to assert power over them to control /manipulate) whereas, with women, 
unless she deems them to be important or valuable to her, they are unimportant or just relegated to competition.

As for what she was doing or what she was taking before the interview itself, He behavior and demeanor remind me of some of the JD apartment elevator  surveillance video, where she is surrounded by friends and assistants but very scattered and distracted as she attempts to eat something and has to be essentially herded into the elevator.
to me, it seems like she was on a bender or partying hard the night before and is dealing with the aftermath the next morning as she struggles to make it to work or appointments.
Unprofessional, yes but I guess that is why she has assistants ( whom she makes their lives living hell and steals Violent abuse and assault stories to use as her own to gain attention and sympathy.)

105,UgzHzR-dsruTz-cHie14AaABAg,"*WHAT drugs did AH imbibe in before THIS interview?*  I have never seen her bob around and look at the floor quite like this.  Either she just noticed red laser dots from a gun sight, and is trying to keep moving so they can't get a clear shot... or she's trying to keep from falling off of the earth.  Oh, look... at 4.23 she finally figures out where the camera is!  Good Job!  Now can you slow your speech down to human speed and stop slurring your words?  Yeah.  Keep really, really, selling what FABULOUS friends you and Mr. Momoa are, because I'm COMPLETELY believing it.  That's why, when you made a hateful tweet about Zoe Kravitz, Jason Momoa unfollowed you.  ""And, and, and.""  This interview is BAD!  The poor interviewer was well prepared.  Pity AH got good and well stoned before she did it.  She gets a duping delight smile talking about Mr. Momoa.  You can see her thinking ""Yeah, I'm *nailing* this, they *totally believe* everything I'm saying!""

""Fuller, more nuanced, stronger, uh, more complex, and motivated, uh, representation of women.""  Makes *no* sense.  If they WERE going for what you seem to be ATTEMPTING to try to say... they *wouldn't* have hired a woman arrested for the domestic assault on her wife, arrested for driving on a five year driving ban, and who pled guilty to falsifying official documents to illegally smuggle her dogs into Australia.  If they wanted a powerful woman, they would have hired one.  They wanted eye candy, that wasn't too bright, and that they wouldn't have to pay ""Scarlett Johansson"" prices for.  Anyone else notice that when she did this interview, her cheekbone implants hadn't melted yet?  She doesn't look like THIS anymore. 

I would have thought even a narcissist like AH would have been grateful enough, that she was ""gifted"" (who knows what she did for whom, she spent a couple of weekends with ""It"" director Andy Muschietti, to get a ""recommendation"" for her role in ""The Stand""...so...) a little role in a major film, to stay clean long enough to do interviews for said movie.

I might not be the best judge of this but in my opinion she looks and sounds pretty messed up. Anyone else I would have some sympathy for but this just makes me even more disgusted. What u said about women in movies now is so scary to me. And don't get me wrong there are some great actresses now and in older films but not women who are anything like her.

You have a chameleon personality who is so good at selling herself she pulled a married Johnny Depp out and got him to marry her without a prenup. Therefore I believe that the way she acts is pointedly well thought out and purposeful.
The trial, for instance. That was careless. But she knew she had the win no matter what with Justice Nicols. So she acted exactly how she wanted (care-less-ly) since she knew the outcome. 
Do you think she knows the outcome with the movie and is therefore quite careless about appearances or advertising properly for the movie franchise? I think she knows she's getting dumped and is doing the bare minimum that her contract will allow.
She knows the gig is up! Everyone sees her for what she is, which is definitely not an A list actress! Maybe she's given up.

300,UgxFfxpKUjaRqMSGIzB4AaABAg,I've seen this behaviour from her before. She doesn't do her self any favours on camera during interviews. The famous deposition for one. She looked and sounded nuts and couldn't string a coherent sentence together. Another one where she tells her assistant off for some distraction or other.  Another similar interview to this one where she couldn't sit still. I can't stand her personally. When JD married her I'd never heard of her and even then I thought 'really?!'  (I'd seen The Rum Diaries and had no idea that was her.) I smelled a rat then and sure enough here she is years down the line keeping herself relevant off the back of her marriage and divorce from JD.  She's a person of ill repute i.e. she's immoral and dishonest. I believe that she has calculatedly attempted to destroy someone's life for her own gain .

I don't think she wants to be there, I think if she had a few wines beforehand or was even holding a glass of wine she would feel a bit more relaxed but it would appear she's not comfortable talking without having first had a drink, I know a couple of people like that, they're very quiet can't look you in the eye, don't know how to talk or what to say but as soon as they have a drink they never shut up lol. Almost like she's out of her comfort zone and I don't think she actually knows what the film is about and she just took it cos it's part of a huge franchise.

To me it looks like she's on something as well. The two times you don't want to make eye contact with people during an important conversation is either when you're high or you're lying. And I think both are happening here. She's Just saying whatever fluff comes to her mind, desperately hoping it makes her sound like she knows what she's talking about. And she's talking about something worthwhile. Which she never does. It blows my mind... anyone who could support her at this point. And her face... ugh! And Jason Momoa hates you, Amber.

372,UgwLBkKclbN35AemF4t4AaABAg,"She spent SO LONG overcompensating trying to convince the interviewer that she and Momoa get along SOOOOO great. A person with an actual friendship would have probably cracked a smile, made one comment, and then moved on. This tactic is common in liars where they belabor a false point too long; while it doesn‚Äôt sound off to the person they‚Äôre lying to, it sounds unconvincing to THEMSELVES because they know it‚Äôs a lie, so they spend an inordinate amount of time repeating the same thing to, in their mind, make them seem more believable, but in reality it is a major giveaway that she is lying. Much like when someone prefaces or follows a lie with,  ‚ÄúI promise,‚Äù or ‚Äúbelieve me,‚Äù etc.. Honest people do not need to use these phrases except under very extreme circumstances.
