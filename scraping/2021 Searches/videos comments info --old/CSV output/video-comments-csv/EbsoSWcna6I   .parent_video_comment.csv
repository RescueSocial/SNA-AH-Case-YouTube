1,UgywOdQyixq1mct6HeN4AaABAg,"Maybe she thinks shes going to be in aquaman2 but their waiting to see what happens in court. I would think theres stipulations in these contracts that if they commit a felony that the contract can be broken and they can be fired and couldnt sue them for it. Its CYA. 
Isnt aquaman2 being filmed in australia? Wonder how shes going to get around that 🤔  She steps off the plane and they slap the handcuffs on her and shes arrested 😯😏🤞",jelaine,0,2020-09-21T16:12:35Z

And it isn't just kids she influences, it's women that want to be like her. I just don't see this turning out good in the spotlight. She most certainty doesn't deserve to play the roll of super hero. And I dont mean to read like an elitist or something. But i can watch the movie with her in it.cant even picture her as a positive person after everything she has done. After all of the double standards that she has taken full advance of to continue to be on screen, and ruin a man's reputation.

I'm not a REAL Depp fan, I like him well enough, but if it wasn't for the likes of your channel I would think that he's a wife beater. Seriously Depp Heads, open your hearts and welcome all fans and supporters for Johnny, without the not so REAL fans support is less and box office is lower, and jobs for him are less. If Johnny can welcome everyone so can the Depp Heads, this isn't a competition for who's the best fan, it's a uniting of all those promoting justice against abusers.",M P,2,2020-09-08T18:20:43Z
18,UgyZFeRCZosuLK6WYvF4AaABAg,"Actually, Johnny took 2 or 3 meetings with JK during the UK trial...the movie studio solidified shooting schedules just prior to Johnny's lawyer filing for the continuation in the VA trial. There was the possibility that she would have needed a continuance anyway since the VA case was supposed to start in Jan 21, 2021 so that date wouldn't really work for Aquaman Ii filming anyway.  Johnny requesting the new court date to be between March and June should actually be fine for her as well as Johnny.  Additionally, the Court has been made aware that failing to grant a continuance would place Johnny in Breach of Contract with the Studio.",Ahyoka Ama,0,2020-09-08T17:21:50Z

22,Ugz10R8_1WxGqr5zxbt4AaABAg,"By what she's done, she's basically announced to the world that she's not in Aquaman... One, she states, 'she should have begun filming in Feb,' not 'is'. two, she has no paperwork about her contract like Depp does, and lets face it, this is Amber, if she had that sheet of paper from WB stating her contractual obligations, it would already be all over her social media - just to gloat. Three, she wouldn't be so bitter about the petition to remove her and finally, four, WB owns both fantastic beasts and Aquaman, if she was in it, this would make them think twice. Especially if she doesn't think twice about holding up a multi-million dollar film and all that entails for something else.",Julie Holland Devenport,1,2020-09-08T10:17:08Z
23,UgxqIAM6q7mIuZcMMdJ4AaABAg,He would be towards the end of the shoot in January so it would be much more disruptive to production to go on hiatus then whereas she would have only just started in February.

Does it realise how delusional it's coming across? Obviously IT does not since it keeps providing more and more material for comic relief. Now it's really gone beyond any acceptable standards of communication and I am starting to cringe a bit too much for comfort. Please, anyone, shut the thing up. Stop it from making johnny depp's and our life miserable. It has abundantly proved that it is a gold digger and a liar and a violent, aggressive abuser, a sociopathic narcissist lunatic and an insult to ALL women, especially those women who have experienced real domestic abuse. I was entertained for a little while, watching the thing going publicly with her dementia and talking about Russian bots and such like. But now its warned off. I'll be happy when all the trials are over, Johnny Depp fixes his life and his career to the splendour he deserves and IT finally disappears into some far away sunset, in a place without internet, so I don't have to listen to that shit ever again.",Maria Palomba,2,2020-09-08T06:41:46Z

31,UgwyyyY3ELvGCb25RXl4AaABAg,"The only reason I still think perhaps Amber Heard is lying about aquaman 2 is simply she never stated actual dates. Her first statement was filming will begin in spring of 2021. Now if youre a big part of a movie that is supposed to start filming in around 6ish months wouldnt you like Johnny Depp have documented dates that prove you are indeed Employed to start filming. Lets not forget she thinks we are all bots and she is probably doing all this to arc us up as well.  

In the end I guess we will find out sooner or later. If shes in it, I wont watch it. 500k people in a covid world not wanting to watch a movie is actually a pretty big deal and WB would be wise to pay attention. Look at Mulan. Its tanking harder then a sunken battleship. China is posting fake good reviews on rottentomatoes to try and get people to watch it but ultimately dressing shit up wont change the fact that its still shit. Plus people hate the main actress for her pro police stance against the hong kong protesters. 

Lets just wait and see. Once Johnny wins his NGN case I want to see what she tries to do next. Because aint noone believe her bullshit anymore",Starskreem82,4,2020-09-08T06:15:34Z

Hopefully Aquaman 2 is the last movie Teard is in. I don't get why people love Depp so much, he  can only act good as a lunatic. Loved first 2 Pirate movies,  Fear and Loathing, Scissors Hands, Blow, and Gilbert Grape (only bc of De Caprio). All those movies he's either crazy or drugged up, I'm not impressed and think his fans are mostly women that think he's cute, all 5'8"" of him, even though I think he's shorter.

85,UgyRi0J3Lz0-1URvy2B4AaABAg,Johnny is doing to right thing.  WB kept him in the moive.  Johnny is showing the court  the that he has letter  from the legal department from WB showing the date  the moive is being filmed. I think the court will grant Johnny his delay. Amber is just  acting like a little kid.,Galit Weissman,11,2020-09-07T22:40:36Z

90,Ugx-gU2C_FKtUKyZjWR4AaABAg,"So the request by Johnny’s team states FB3 was already delayed in filming due to C19, and to delay further would cause detrimental consequences for other members of the film. And because she delayed the Virginia case because of C19 as late as possible, also handing in the request a day before the deadline,and tried to for the British date as well but was denied. At the time the request was made it in no way conflicted with AH schedule. Technically, it doesn’t effect her in any way. She’s crying foul and trying to make him look bad. Again. 😡🤬",Penney Burgess,16,2020-09-07T22:33:32Z

94,UgyendBEp6ip0WZM86F4AaABAg,In the papers she filed her lawyer actually attached a letter that was to Johnny from WB that was dated in August giving the approximate rescheduling of filming so obviously he didn’t know June/July she just keeps shooting her self in foot. How she thinks people will believe a word she says is a total mystery to me 😂,Cosmicstarchild,7,2020-09-07T22:24:35Z
95,UgxctmfkfP-hUbLHJtJ4AaABAg,"Tristen, AH lied in court documents about the abuse. She could very well lie about Aquaman 2 just to manipulate others and/or get an advantage and/or to mess with Johnny's head and/or to be annoying. I wouldn't believe anything that comes out of AH's mouth. 😣🤢🤮 Besides, in the document, she just said that the filming will start in spring 2021, not that SHE will be in it. This could very well be a very misleading, manipulative way to twist the truth to get the upper hand. 🙄",liamhain,21,2020-09-07T22:21:19Z
