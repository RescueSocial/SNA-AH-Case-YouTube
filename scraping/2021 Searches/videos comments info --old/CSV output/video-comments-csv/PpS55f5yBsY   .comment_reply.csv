0,UgyaPbqhYBZkivUzT294AaABAg,Rock Candy,yes they both have substance abuuse issues but if you listen to the audio tapes it's only Amber that puunches Johnny.  He always leaves the room or hides in the bathroom to get away from her.  Amber has a vendetta against Johnny and enjoys vi0ence and destroying his life any way she can (IMO).,2021-10-26T12:44:46Z,0

27,Ugw4WEOt0eYXEFd7g414AaABAg,mariana,"@Rock Candy what? I honestly don't understand your reply. I said MRAs use this case to fuel a fake narrative that men are, overall, more affected by domestic violence both in number of cases and intensity of violence. Which isn't true based on any research that currently exists. It's a narrative made to fuel misogynistic discourse and invalidate feminist positions on domestic violence, that is: gender-based violence is rooted in patriarchal standards, gender roles, and power dynamics, regardless of the victim's gender. MRAs believe women lie about their experiences and DV affects mostly men. This case is their biggest ""weapon"" to ""prove"" their point. 

This is a disturbing and inaccurate view of the issue and it helps no one. It doesn't prevent it and it spreads unfounded opinions as if they were the ultimate truth. Of course DV happens to men. Of course there is a issue there in terms of society identifying it. That is not what I'm pointing out here. And people taking a public case to use to fuel ideological discourse is not only disgusting, but also a disservice to all victims.",2021-08-04T17:11:31Z,0

49,UgyJ6Kfyhe8kbwyAwSN4AaABAg,Flowers 🌺,"the first sentence you said is false, actually. Many abusers only commit abuse when they feel they can get away with it, so if they are with partners they think will not allow them to get away with it they wont do anything (but they will try to subtly push them in a bad direction so they become more vulnerable in the future). Also, sometimes people become abusers in the future. So like,  for example, they have 5   normal relationships, then they go through a traumatic experience and become abusive to their future partners...etc

And the papers that do talk of efficacy are, well... Often incredibly small in sample size and any objective findings are so slight that it is barely worth mentioning. 

There are far more studied and well accepted areas of forensics, such as fingerprints which are shown to be very fallible and result in false convictions and even worse 'Bite Mark Analysis' which is so severely bad that it would not be a surprise if in the coming years that every case ever convicted on bite marks would have to go back to court. 

Body language can help people convey a point and there are certainly stereotypes about body language that make people think someone is more or less trustworthy.

There are about 150-160, depending on sources, signs of non verbal deception, that can kind of be used be ultimately are just a potential tool in a huge arsenal.

I could not find any research that would put body language analysis above the level of reliability of a lie detector, and most papers say that body language is a reflection of personality development... Not an ingrained neurological, and thus readable, function.",2021-06-08T16:54:54Z,1

98,Ugw9o4Ur_OPIEL80wCl4AaABAg,Nia Selah,"I get your point but abuse is a complex issue and our knowledge about it is still on diapers. Abuse is not only physical. In fact "" smart"" abusers use other ways to harm because they are harder or impossible to prove. Someone leaving during an argument could be healthy in order to avoid fighting or could be an invalidation technique. When someone wants to resolve a conflict and the other person continually leaves sends a harmful message and some people do it on purpose leaving no visible marks. Also saying that you leave in order to not get physically violent could be a covered way of threat and intimidation. I am not saying it happened here but it happens. I wish as a society we focus more on learning the complexities instead of who did who, that is for court. Also they are actors. Their situation cannot be fairly compared to regular people.

130,UgyEjjVb3pnmdsqcj5t4AaABAg,Jess M,"@Marianne Erni With this case, I now side with Depp. I was mostly referring to the stereotypes of a clear aggressor and the shrinking violet in abusive relationships that we often see, particularly when portrayed in media. Depp is indeed a ""mess"" as one person stated, and that has been used against him, particularly with the footage of him lashing back at Heard while likely inebriated. However, as someone who also was seen as a ""mess"" by people in my own marriage because I was significantly younger than my ex and suffered from depression and anxiety, I now personally believe Depp was abused by Heard and pushed to a point where he lashed back and she recorded the outburst (something similar actually happened to me and my ex was able to talk his way out of it to the police by explaining it as a ""lover's quarrel""). 

Due to our own common biases about men as being the main abusers, Heard was able to sway the public to her side. As a younger woman coming out of her own abusive marriage, I absolutely sided with her at the beginning. However, the more I learned about the entire case, the more holes I saw and the more biased I realized I was to favor Heard even though Depp's experience seemed more similar to my own, just because Heard and I were both the same age and both women. Regardless, the entire situation is messy (and a lot of evidence on both sides is still anecdotal testimony) and the circus that was The Sun case in the UK doesn't help how Depp is perceived by the public. Personally, I hope the US court case goes in Depp's favor, but I'm mostly happy he's away from that abusive environment and I hope he seeks professional help to process his pain without numbing it with alcohol.",2021-06-07T21:24:56Z,0

My mother, my maternal grandmother and girls during Elementary and Middle school. I don't believe women blindly, I also look at the facts because I know from life experience how manipulative women can be and use the fact that they're women to their advantage. Also, if we are truly feminists, we would accept that MEN can be victims too and even more, victims of other women.",2021-06-05T17:05:43Z,0
179,Ugz912h-XFj0rwohHvl4AaABAg,Raymond Kravitz,"Yes. Still shouldn't stop one from saying ""I'm sorry"" to the supposed victim though. Or just staying silent until the evidence comes into further light. 
When it goes too far is when people actively start to attack the accused. And I don't mean online and I don't mean being angry with them on their keyboard. 
I think it's pretty disingenuous to say ""eh, let's just wait for the facts and evidence to come to light to buy into one side of an abuse case"". That's NEVER going to happen and for those that's been through similar, but without the media and money on their side, it's GOING to bother them and they're GOING to see the other side as empathetic and they're going to comment and want to support them. 
That said, innocent until proven guilty IS important and due process IS important. But it's absolutely against human nature to just say ""eh, let's not comment and let's just let this go"" when talking about an abuse case in the media. It's unrealistic and NO ONE is going to just ""let this play out"". That's the court's job. Anyone in the many years I've watched numerous cases come to light and even less publicized issues that I've intimately known about, the person saying and commenting things such as this are largely ignored. Some of them react angrily to it. 
Basically, I'm just trying to say that posting or saying this in relation to an abuse case is a waste of time and someone's going to be angry at you for it. Whether or not anyone does something about it is another issue. But I'm telling you: everyone knows this. No one's ignoring innocence until proven guilty and due process when they come out in support of a supposed victim. They see themselves in it. Let them. No one's interfering with the court proceedings. At the end of the day, it can be seen as virtue signaling, condescension, derailment, and a lack of support.",2021-07-28T13:32:47Z,0

Though this has nothing to do with the photos I’m talking about how is taking pictures of an unconscious induced on drugs Johnny Depp at all related to abuse, it almost seems like a set up. She took photos of Johnny while he was on drugs by the way these drugs aren’t known for there abuse rather than laxation, tbh it extremely rare for people to be abusive on like weed. She hasn’t given one photo of an abusive Johnny Depp rather taking photos of him being knocked out and carefully setting up photos of the drugs, a knife, a lighter, a old magazine it looks like a movie scene purposely set up to look bad. Like it to fake not to be set up, not Jonny himself rather the things around him. Honestly the bad part taking these photos while he down like that not even bothering to help him. That my problem she took these photos of a dosed Jonny Depp everyone already knows his drug issues and he said many times it help him and addicting, he had 2 other wives and they never claimed he did anything abusive is obvious scenario.

437,Ugw1SWgaTA5JkQEj8Ux4AaABAg,elleofmusic,"except she's been recorded saying multiple times and on multiple occasions that he never fights back. At no point in any of the recordings between them, even right at the very end of their relationship, did she EVER accuse or even IMPLY he had even once laid hand on her. In fact, it was one of her biggest complaints against him. She talks about all the times she'd chase him out of the elevator, and harass him for hiding in bathrooms for hours, for just standing there and taking her violence without ever engaging her. She WANTED to physically fight WITH him, and the ""monster"" (HER term and invention) was what she called him when he fled from her. There are texts from her proving this without a doubt. The only time he EVER physically hurt her was accidentally when she launched herself at him, clawing at his EYES (they're recorded discussing the incident directly afterwards) and he grabbed her wrists to hold her back. During her rabid struggling, their heads knocked together, and you can HEAR how STUNNED she was thinking he had headbutted her. It's beyond obvious that she had never been hurt by him before.
Johnny suffered a great deal of violence at his mother's hands growing up. He was conditioned to never ever retaliate, to only ever flee or stand still and wait for it to be over. All of his exes say he never once acted violently towards them, whereas Heard hit her girlfriend in full view of a cop, there's footage of her sister returning from just a brief meeting with her with multiple visible bruises, and not long before they broke up, elon musk was sporting a nasty black eye.

458,UgycyC_aY_m1VfNO16x4AaABAg,elleofmusic,"you should maybe look into the accusations against Manson a bit more. Guess who's Even Rachel Wood's friend? Amber Heard. Illma Gore, the mastermind behind the Phoenix Act, is a serial hoaxer, scammer, and fraud. The accusers admitted they wrote their statements together, and had been actively trying to recruit every woman they knew Manson had been with. One of those women refused, and has the emails to prove it. Her name is Greta Aurora, and her story was used in one of the lawsuits even though she expressly did not give permission, and it was distorted to claim she was underage, (she was not) a virgin, (she was not) and that her weekend with him was practically a kidnapping, which it was NOT. She had a great time with him, and attests he was a complete gentleman.

Of course he's not the complete innocent like Johnny is, but he's not an abuser. His ex-wives, one of whom, may I remind you, practically STARTED the MeToo movement as a victim of Harvey Weinstein, which she had never told Manson about, but even so, she said that her relationship with him was extremely healing. You should also note that the accusors are all in fact hard on cash and fame… and what are they after? His cash. Esme Bianco and Ashley Walters (all these women have been friends for many years btw… but only learned of their ""shared abuse"" last year, somehow!)  are both huge fans of Prince… and their allegations against Manson are pretty much carbon copies of everything Prince's ex tried to pin him with. Right down to the specific details.

Seriously, even Heard at least bothered to set up her hoax years in advance- these women are trying to claim they were children at age 26, that them accidentally locking themselves in the parking lot of a liquor store instead of where he told them to park is somehow his dastardly plan to keep them overnight… even tho it only locks at 2 a.m. And the real kicker… that experienced, PROFESSIONAL BDSM performers who regularly attend events like Torture Garden, and starred in BDSM movies somehow don't understand the concept of safewords, and that they starred in a show where their bare back was very frequently seen pristine and flawless both DURING and after the abuse they're claiming left their back covered in scars… their only evidence of which is a single photo of what are obviously just the temporary indentations from stationary ropes, as one would expect from bondage play. Not scars. Not whip marks. Not even proper bruises.

Funny how just when Johnny Depp's truth starts getting out, all of a sudden a bunch of long-time friends pin his biggest ally with accusations directly out of Heard's playbook, conveniently giving ppl reason to believe ""guilt by association,"" don't you think? Manson is indeed no angel, but the absurdity of the allegations against him would have you believe women are all just helpless, naive little dolls who will never say ""no"" to anything and then decades later suddenly try to extort money from you… AFTER shooting their own hostage by assassinating your career and reputation  because they know, despite their weak attempts to claim otherwise, that when against Marilyn Manson, EVERYONE will believe them at face value alone.
