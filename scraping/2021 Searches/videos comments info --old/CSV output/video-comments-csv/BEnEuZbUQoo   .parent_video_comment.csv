I absolutely loved the fact it came out. I’m happy to hear that it throws light on the fact that the thing is a gold digger & told lies. It went on a talk show and actually stated that 7 million went to charity. It didn’t want anything!!!. So to go from it was already paid to paying out eventually?🤔🤔🤦‍♀️. Think of all the children & victims that could of helped and not let down. Anyway I’m happy that Johnny may get a retrial I really do.

It is Depp’s fault he did not find out Amber was lying; or
Even though Amber was ordered by the Virginia court to answer questions about the donations and even though she refused and petitioned the Virginia court 4 times to reconsider its order that she answer the question, Depp still had 5 other ways to find out Amber was lying.

She clearly used the past tense, as in ... it's a done deal ... the $7 million that used to be in her bank account is now no longer there, because it's in the bank accounts of the two charities.  There's no other way for one to interpret what she said on that show, and she also said that she didn't want his money, or words to the effect.

They basically raised a lot of reasonable doubt through facts, which shook up the appeal. JD's lawyer left out a few facts, like the one that the first and only check to CHLA was signed by JD; and there was the fact that there was a 350k donation to the other cause, which apparently was never mentioned on any channel covering the case. Our side were trying to prove there was never a pledge, which I find the wrong approach, instead of trying to prove that in all of this time the pledge was never kept.

I split it between the CHLA and the ACLU.” She claimed she had donated all 7 million. Yet again a blatant lie and now here is proof why she fought so hard to keep that evidence hidden. She lies about almost everything. The evidence is all there. And all evidence is here. I don’t get how much more proof they need when she constantly lies and changes her story to match new evidence. JDs story never changed and all evidence (even hers and all her illegal recordings) support his story. Justice needs to be served here.

267,Ugyod3bqS0ZvKrzh90h4AaABAg,"I watched the UK hearing and I got a sick feeling. I think the courts have already made up their minds and will deny Johnny appeal. 

The NGN lawyer was so weak in her presentation that it made me wonder why she did not do her homework. Is it because she knows NGN has won??

Is this all for show so the courts can say they were fair??

I truly hope my feelings are wrong and Johnny gets justice.",Steve Kass,31,2021-03-19T17:42:45Z

286,UgxFaSdUO6_XsbKphqR4AaABAg,"I still cannot believe NGN (Amber) lied to the two Judges faces by saying that they arranged a 10 years plan with the charities. ABSOLUTE BS!  Besides, all it would take is for the Judges to say the following:
2 Judges - ""There is a 10 years agreement?""
NGN - ""Yes, your honor.""
2 Judges - ""Show us the document proving it""
NGN - ""Here you go, your honor.""
2 Judge s- ""Why there is nothing mentioned from the charities??""
NGN - ""Errr....""
2 Judges - ""And where's the signature or any confirmation of the agreement??""
NGN - ""Urm..""
2 Judges - ""And why is the date so recent??""
NGN - ""Urmm.. We can exp...""
2 Judge - ""Thank you, but we will not accept this.""",EAprima,284,2021-03-19T17:35:26Z
