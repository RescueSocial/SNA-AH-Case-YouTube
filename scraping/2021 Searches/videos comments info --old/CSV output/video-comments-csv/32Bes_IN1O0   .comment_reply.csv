0,UgwJMHKFie_V0dsddx54AaABAg,Free Spirit Christina,"@Daughter of Gaia Actually, you‚Äôre incorrect. Have you not heard or BPD rage? They are known for reactivity and out of control/inappropriate anger. Borderlines are more likely to get violent than the general public that is free from serious personality disorders that significantly affect quality of life. And I‚Äôm not saying all with BPD are abusive. I‚Äôm just being honest. My dad‚Äôs second (now ex) wife and my former best friend both have BPD. They were emotionally abusive; one was also physically abusive! This can happen when you have an unstable sense of self, a deep-seated fear of abandonment, are impulsive, get wild mood swings and angry outbursts, are irrational. Just listen to Amber Heard‚Ä¶ she acts out in rage; she has angry outbursts and is both emotionally and physically abusive! Then listen to her change her story in court. She‚Äôs a blatant liar. Watch her smirk and roll her eyes. She‚Äôs manipulative, lacks empathy. She has a real fear of abandonment and an unstable sense of self. She‚Äôs  incredibly self-centered, out of touch. If you look into this, you‚Äôll see Live Abuse Free is spot on in her analysis of Amber Hard, who is pretty classic BPD.",2021-09-24T09:04:22Z,0

2,UgwJMHKFie_V0dsddx54AaABAg,Daughter of Gaia,"I‚Äôm confused. You bring up borderline personality disorder, how she is displaying traits of it and how they are sometimes violent. But people with BPD are not any more violent than the general public. And later you also say that she‚Äôs very manipulative, but people with borderline are not manipulative. They can be perceived as manipulative but they really aren‚Äôt. They are just very very unstable. A person with BPD does not have the stability mentally or emotionally to be capable of planing and executing a planned manipulation. People with BPD are just right now. It‚Äôs extremely unlikely that anyone with untreated BPD could ever talk about emotional situations and remain calm. The very basis of BPD is instability. Extremely unstable and uncontrollable emotions. From the video when JD is angry, he displays much stronger than anything I have seen from AH. a behavior that could align with BPD. 

BPD comes from major and severe childhood trauma and abuse. That is how people develop it. Bringing it up in this situation is very problematic because of the major, major myths and stigma already surrounding it. BPD does not make any one nor does mean someone is a bad person, or abusive or evil or manipulative or violent. BPD means that someone is suffering immensely, and unable to cope with distress and unable to contain their enormous emotions. How those emotions are expressed varies between individuals. It doesn‚Äôt make someone violent. Most BPDs aren‚Äôt violent, just as most people aren‚Äôt violent. These are just normal regular people. Who happens to be very, very sick. 

If she is an abuser and if she has BPD those are not results of each other. BPD does not make you an abuser.",2020-10-18T01:15:21Z,3
3,UgwJMHKFie_V0dsddx54AaABAg,Say it Ain‚Äôt so,"Live Abuse Free This is a serious situation. I do hope that your impressions and presentation of facts serves to find the truth. It‚Äôs very difficult for myself as a viewer of these short clips of audio to fully understand what is being said and conveyed between Johnny and Amber. It would be helpful if you would play the clips in their entirety before interjecting your opinion so that we might understand the context. I am a long time fan of Johnny Depp and it is devastating g to think of him as an abuser. On the other hand these are crazy times where powerful and beloved men have been found to be monsters in their private lives. It‚Äôs hard to be shocked. I appreciate having someone dissect this situation in a way that helps us understand. I implore you to do in the most straight forward way possible, as this to me is still very confusing to follow. As someone who has not heard or seen past footage, perhaps you can play it in it‚Äôs entirety, explain the circumstances, both sides, and break down what you feel is happening.

18,UgyjyjImDgrFsHE0-M14AaABAg,Devyani Account,@Imogen Booth fuck off for not realising what borderline disorder is and I meant what I said that he should have known he was asking someone to cross boundaries and think that was normal. It's like looking out for abusers and who has toxic behaviour and with borderline it's a big issue as those people usually are trauma victims themselves. I will blame him for the part that he thought that it was ok to have someone cross so many boundaries and said shitty things about his last relationship. That was objectively wrong and narcissistic.,2020-11-13T13:45:40Z,0
19,UgyjyjImDgrFsHE0-M14AaABAg,Imogen Booth,"I think the main problem here is that you're using people's automatic emotional reactions to justify toxic behaviour and impart blame onto someone who is wholly a victim. I understand from your perspective and presumably Amber's, those reactions or lack of reaction feels like a betrayal in of itself however that is irrational. People adopt these expressions not to hurt you but because they've been hurt and to blame them for getting upset helps no one. The age gap is really immaterial. Amber was no innocent lamb. She had been dating for years and hell even had an actual wife for a couple of years, she was an experienced and consenting adult in that relationship. Johnny's relative age again should not act as a barometer for whether hes allowed to be upset either. To be perfectly honest, his age showed in their argument not in how SHE referenced it ""I know you've been around long time, you've been in a lot of fights"" (which I want to point out was a tactic to diminish his feelings and make it out as if he were being overdramtic) but instead how he was able to stay mostly calm despite what was some egregious behaviour on Amber's account. Do I think Johnny is an angel? Nope. Hes admitted that himself. But this shifting of the narrative that he should take some accountability thereby implying that he deserved the abuse he suffered? That shit is unacceptable",2020-10-15T11:31:13Z,0

64,UgxiIc0EsLqpdNTMj9B4AaABAg,Live Abuse Free,"Yes, some people turn their anger onto themselves rather than onto others. Either way there will be some narcissistic behaviour because when people are preoccupied with what others think of them it's the natural consequence - Being upset at being rejected when that's not what's happening, makes it hard to put yourself in the other person's shoes. I agree that people tend to take the most extreme example when they don't know much about a topic, and paint everyone with that brush. But (in my opinion), I think the stigma is mostly about people thinking BPD is who some one is, that it's a permanent state of mind. BPD isn't who you are. It's just ways of thinking and seeing things that can change. BPD is no longer a disorder people have forever, this was how mental health professionals used to think. I read some research done in Amsterdam, I think it was 75% of people who had a combination of group and one to one schema therapy no longer fulfilled the criteria after 2 years of it. And also, I think on average, 50% of people with BPD no longer meet the criteria after 5 years anyway.",2020-08-07T14:25:57Z,3

And then they would tell the other partner to leave and head for the hills and to run and get away from their abuser as far away as they can, and there is also a special button that the counciller can press to allow the victim to make a quick gettaway escape where they  go down a slide and are let out the back door of the building so that the abuser does not see them leaving and they dont have to ever see eachother again",2020-08-06T15:18:49Z,3

Any attention or simple emotional support given to a student may be misinterpreted.  I‚Äôm 58 years old and I was routinely treated with disrespect as a teenager, university student, teacher, and administrator by some men.  Never, never by all men.  I was not treated well in my family as a child and teenager and adult.  My father was very kind to women.  It was my mother who was competitive and angry and jealous.  I have noticed in my lifetime that the trend of silencing victims of all ages and sexes is changing.  That‚Äôs good.  Men and women watching out for each other and all children is a good thing.  It creates a preemptive strike against the blame game.  Right now, however, a lot of people need to realize that long festering anger is creating a very frightening and public mob mentality.  Manipulating a child is not the same as manipulating an adult.  Adult victims supporting adult victims emotionally and privately is not the same as presenting the facts of a crime.  It seems that right now the social pendulum has swung too far and justice is still out of our grasp.  I hope that soon we will all be heard equally and can feel safe and unthreatened.  Please don‚Äôt become bitter.  I hope that we are all evolving toward a place where good people can show true compassion towards others without being accused of unspeakable acts.

164,UgyElB-t_8bksEjdDk14AaABAg,cranberry noodle,"@Imogen Booth Sex and gender are different categories. Sex is biological, innate, unchangeable. Gender (attributes of femininity and masculinity) is influenced by biology, but falls within the domain of sociology. It's a looser concept and it has variations across time and culture.¬†

Sex determines our chromosomes, our internal and external reproductive organs, the function of our immune system (stronger in females), our metabolic rate (higher in males), our hormone production, our fat-to-muscle ratio (males naturally have more muscle, females have more fat), as well as our skeletal structure (larger bones generally found in males) and the size of our heart and lungs (generally larger in males). It's reductive to assume biological sex refers only to our genitalia.¬†

I'm well aware of intersex people. They're estimated to account for 0.02% of the global population, which makes biological sex unambiguously binary for ~99.98% of the population. Even if you consider self-identified trans or non-binary people outside those figures, then it is still an overwhelming majority that exist within that binary. Intersex is known by scientists as a disorder of sex development. In most cases, the intersex person has a clear imbalance of sex characteristics - i.e. they have all the features of one sex but with an additional feature from the other sex, and this can be resolved fairly straightforwardly through surgery.¬†

The very fact that intersex people exist as an anatomical anomaly just further emphasises that sex is dimorphic. An equally tiny percentage of people are born with one leg or even three, but we don't start claiming that ""humans are one-legged or three-legged beings' when we are overwhelmingly bipeds. 

A description that describes 99% of people is far more efficient and accurate than a description that sets out to describe the outlier and ends up overlooking the 99%. That's just anti-scientific. You're also claiming consensus where there is none. Biologists and doctors are largely in favour of the dimorphic view, while sociologists tend toward the spectrum view. Honestly, when it comes to biological sex, I take the views of people who specialise in biology. Sociologists talk about gender - a separate thing entirely. 

You don't yourself any favours when you say stuff like ""men being strong has nothing to do with biology, it's all cultural"". I doubt you've had much contact with men if you believe that. They do have a biological advantage over us women when it comes to strength. You're setting down a dangerous path of denying the reality of sex-based oppression/violence when you pretend that men and women are equally strong.",2020-11-14T17:19:23Z,0
165,UgyElB-t_8bksEjdDk14AaABAg,Imogen Booth,"@cranberry noodleI suppose you're defining sex here by the combinations of your chromosomes? In which case, you're still wrong since there's more than 2. Otherwise is pretty loose to define sex solely by one chromosome pairs, neglecting hormones and how genitalia presents itself (do some research on those who are ""intersex"" you'll find sexual dimorphism is a more varied + complex subject than you think). Then we have to note how you conflate gender and sex, when the two are not necessarily tied together. If you need an explanation for this, what do you think of when I say the phrase ""be a man""? Most likely you think of being strong, sober, tough or brave. None of these qualities have anything to do with biology. These are cultural ideas. You, without realising it, have cultivated your own gender just as someone who identifies as non-binary has cultivated theirs. The only difference is that society has decided that your gender is appropriate to your body so you've been given the priveledge to ignore that process and escape people invalidating your lived experience. 
Trans people are valid as are those who fall under the non-binary umbrella. Sociologists, psychologists and doctors all agree on this, so just chill and maybe take note of someone's preferred pronoun in a while....trust me it ain't difficult.",2020-11-11T20:59:34Z,2

This can build and build to the point where, let‚Äôs say, the wife cannot even raise a question or defend herself from, say, name-calling‚Äîor the husband‚Äôs precursor behavior to violence. All the while...Seemingly, the husband has outwardly done nothing. 

Psychically, I contend this could perhaps be bullying, gaslighting behavior. He‚Äôs got her check-mated. 

Johnny Depp is old enough to be Amber Heard‚Äôs father, a power imbalance exists‚Äîthey are not equal partners. 
Some of what I say comes from professional experience, but a greater part is anecdotal. 

This case is multifactorial‚Äîon both sides. Dual Dx‚Äôs; decades-long addictions; celebrity privilege; second-wife syndrome.  It‚Äôs a matter for personal medical and psychiatric treatment. 

Ms. Heard, I suspect, may feel the greater victim due to her youth. I have seen such scenarios‚Äîwhen the age difference is such that the husband fits the generational range of a father. 

Take this mathematical imbalance of life experience, then couple it with not having children together‚Äîa shared family‚Äî thereby...adding some normalcy to a hyper-visual, anxiety-provoking business which demands a certain degree of narcissism to succeed and maintain...you then both find yourselves in a marriage lacking a foundation or a direction.

He thinks that because he was shitty, he deserved to be hit and have everyone turn against him for lies. He thinks that bc he was 6 ft and very muscular, and she was 5'4 and slender that it wasn't real abuse.",2020-08-12T20:00:49Z,2

Apparently Johnny Depp‚Äôs mother was abusive so he just replicated his relationship with his mother with Amber Heard. JFK jr. was raised by his mother and  without a father and with an older sister. The older children always boss the younger children around so he found himself a bossy wife. Apparently at the time of their deaths JFK jr.‚Äôs sister was so fed up with his wife that they ere no longer on speaking terms. Family dynamics play a huge role in what we chose when we go out into the world looking for partners. We all try to replicate what feels familiar.",2020-08-10T09:38:06Z,2

Ignore the woman.......apparently it piques our interest......we rise to the ""challenge"".........Or blame ourselves for doing or saying something to turn him off so work hard to win his interest back........doesn't it make you sick?

240,UgyEBPhZESaFQ47II8l4AaABAg,Juanita Richards,"@Create with Squdge Craft I can't remember. I got it from the library in a city I was living in until 7 years ago.  But the psychologist got the sociopath to help her write the book to warn women but it could include men too who have been targeted.  I've tried to google the subject but I don't have enough details or the authors names. It was especially interesting because on one page the sociopath wrote all of his lines and techniques for getting the womans attention in  a social setting, in the first place. On the next page he interpreted and explained his lines and what they really meant.  Each chapter was on ensnaring the victim with his own in depth analysis on the next page. There were chapters on how to keep the victim ensnared, how to stop her from leaving etc, no matter how outrageous or abusive his behaviour became. How to keep her while cheating on her etc.  It was shocking in that it showed how calculating and premeditated and predatory these creatures are. They don't pick us just by chance.  And he said that if he came across a woman who was ""too difficult"" to manipulate, who insisted on setting boundaries, he would just walk away.  He didn't want it to be hard work - no woman was worth hard work, he believed. But surely all that manipulation and lying and game playing is hard work!

245,UgzTC-KbKPolqMTn5LN4AaABAg,athinamjd,"@Live Abuse Free Thanks for responding to my comment! I really love your analysis. What's interesting in this case is also Amber's sister Whitney. She testified in the Uk trial that Johnny was gonna push her down the stairs and that's why Amber punched him in the face, to protect her. But now Whitney's former boss Jennifer Howell, who gave a declaration for the US case, says that she had Whitney staying in her guest room cause she was afraid of Amber and her abusive ways. She stated that Whitney told her that it was Amber trying to push Johnny down the stairs and that she put herself between them...a very different version from the one she and Amber both testified under oath in the Uk. Jennifer also says there are many people corroborating that Whitney was afraid of Amber. So Whitney is probably a victim but can't get away from her sister and appears to be very loyal to her despite the abuse she has  suffered. Johnny Depp's US lawyer Adam Waldman ( @adam_waldman) has been tweeting about that issue and he has also posted Jennifer's declaration if you want to check if out! There is also a very interesting email from Jennifer to Whitney about lying under oath in the UK. In her declaration it's also noted that their father was violent so it seems that Whitney is unable to break out of the circle of abuse in her family.",2020-08-07T15:24:17Z,17

There are tons of people out there who were prepared to place responsibility on to Shanaz for what happened to her, who claim she was bossy and that that was a factor.  Equally, many people blamed his new girlfriend.  People still go pretty easy on some abusive men, although maybe they don't take physical aggression quite as seriously because men are usually able to overpower women physically if they need to.  But I do think that it would have been excusable for Johnny Depp to use his strength to fend Amber off...had he beat the crap out of her, then no.
