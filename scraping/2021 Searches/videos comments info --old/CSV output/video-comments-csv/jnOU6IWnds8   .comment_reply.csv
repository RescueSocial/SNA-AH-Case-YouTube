BUT I dont hink they are too far gone n are in MANY ways the same old fandom menace they started off to be. Otherwise I wouldnt be proud to call maself one of them.

Atleast u try and be neautral and see things from both sides, but at the same time ur ALSO not afraid to call people out on their BS when they are in the wrong which is why many like and follow you.

YOU'RE MAKING a difference, by getting the word out. Thats aw we can really do, and let others decide for themselves. 

Its STILL a LOOONG way off, so still plenty of time for them to change their mind...perhaps they are waiting for the courts to make a decision before they take any action so it doesnt seem like they are choosing sides, but by signing and sharing the petitioon and if enuff youtubers cover it, then it MIGHT put enuff pressure on them.

94,UgwSIdU4aNWq3vvyMzd4AaABAg,BIG Daddio John Bamford,"@Ross Skywalker Politics...thats why. Youtube is NO better than the feminist shill media. They push mainstream media n remove views and comments from the actual cretors. When it should be the other way around... ITS CRAZY. I mean its NOT the mainstream stuff we cum to youtube for...its the FandomMenace stuff we support n subscribe to.

I've got sick of the politics so much av had to unsubscribe from BIG stuff like CNN, Looper, ScreenRant and WatchMojo becoz theyve becum SO politicised n corrupt. 

youtube is NO longer about entertainment n has becum just anutha puppet for the SJWs",2020-03-14T14:57:22Z,2
95,UgwSIdU4aNWq3vvyMzd4AaABAg,Ross Skywalker,"@BIG Daddio John Bamford ya, I hear you man they keep backing her up ! Its sad YouTube is even taking views away from the Justice for Johnny Depp Pirates of the Caribbean tribute I did with Jon last week ! It was at 1k views down to 750 they took 300 away for no reason! Guessing for Amber Heard i assume.. like seriously? Wtf why is YouTube defending her!?!",2020-03-14T12:41:40Z,2

Atleast with pirates tho...they DONT get a cent. Let them have the numbers...that wont pay their bills or help them stay a float. Let them see ALL the numbers they COYLDVE earned if they had only Fired Amber Heard. It shows we DIDNT hate the film but only hated Amber Heard so it shows them what tgey must do.

106,UgzoVEfMuE3Ru_wYBf54AaABAg,Stuart,"@Inzayn Klainer but wouldn't that be supporting a studio that's supports an abuser. If people weren't demanding her fired, would Warner Bros even consider firing her, do they even give a shit what people think, or do they only care about making money. Do you really want to give money to such people.",2020-06-07T16:26:34Z,0
107,UgzoVEfMuE3Ru_wYBf54AaABAg,Inzayn Klainer,"@Stuart holy shit, if she isn't in it, I'll go to the theaters and watch that movie 10 times a day so it could be a MAJOR hit without her. My wallet will suffer but it'll totally be worth the cutting back on food.",2020-06-07T16:09:37Z,0
