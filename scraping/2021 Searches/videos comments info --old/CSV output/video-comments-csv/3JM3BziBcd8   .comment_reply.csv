It's like you have been shot with a bullet between the eyes! You end up feeling stupid and disgusted with yourself for being blind to the manipulation and abuse!

17,UgyXvTZtP-iKqjeFsUN4AaABAg,ritchski1,grey H that is a fair point.  It‚Äôs just frustrating to see Depp in this situation.  Hopefully it will finally be over soon and Heard will be fully exposed in court.,2020-09-26T12:27:29Z,1
18,UgyXvTZtP-iKqjeFsUN4AaABAg,grey H,"ritchski1 No. Never make a victim feel like it‚Äôs their fault, he never left her probably because she made him believe it‚Äôs his fault BUT it‚Äôs always the abuser‚Äôs fault. She pretended to be nice, pretended that she liked to help ppl, pretended that she‚Äôs everything that he loved and that she‚Äôs sweet and kind and most importantly she made him believe like she cared about him when in fact she never did. He fell in love with that, something that isn‚Äôt real it‚Äôs not his fault or his responsibility that she‚Äôs a liar. We all saw that, now that everything is exposed, so I think it‚Äôs wrong to say it‚Äôs his fault/responsibility. 
And the reason him and Vanessa broke up wasn‚Äôt amber their relationship was already falling apart.",2020-09-26T09:20:01Z,6
19,UgyXvTZtP-iKqjeFsUN4AaABAg,ritchski1,"ShelbySoup I guess so but Depp has to take some responsibility for getting sucked in by a complete narcissist like this, especially if he left his wife for her.  I‚Äôm on Depp‚Äôs side but he has been in this nightmare a long time, years because his misjudged her character, I‚Äôm sure her mask must have slipped a few times.  I believe Depp was abused to a degree but not to that of being trapped  and terrified of her.",2020-09-26T07:28:19Z,1
20,UgyXvTZtP-iKqjeFsUN4AaABAg,Doctor Soup,I wondered that too. She must have put all of her energy into looking good to him and then just showed her true colors.,2020-09-25T23:09:53Z,9
21,UgxfkEkjMXg6yHEhumJ4AaABAg,Marnie Naylor,The Johnny Depp Project Her assistant confirmed that. Said she had her whole house re-decorated and BoHo chic because that‚Äôs Johnny‚Äôs style. She was definitely on her A game when she was trying to sink her claws into him,2020-09-30T02:31:26Z,2
22,UgxfkEkjMXg6yHEhumJ4AaABAg,The Justice Project,Yeah! She fully copied JD to entice him and then pretended she didn't know anything about him when they met.,2020-09-29T23:00:14Z,2

24,UgxfkEkjMXg6yHEhumJ4AaABAg,Katia Lastovkina,@Doctor Soup It's a common trend with narcissists. They just throw words in there that they googled specifically to sound smarter.,2020-09-27T05:29:48Z,4

29,UgyfNvpa0bJGctvmRwN4AaABAg,CamIam,"""Palpable"" means it can be touched or physically sensed. She may have meant ""touching.'",2020-09-26T02:39:35Z,1

32,UgyfNvpa0bJGctvmRwN4AaABAg,Doctor Soup,I have honestly never really heard people use it much. My criticisms are mainly based on the fact that she is trying to use these big words to sound intelligent when she doesn't even know what the hell she is saying.,2020-09-25T22:12:42Z,3
