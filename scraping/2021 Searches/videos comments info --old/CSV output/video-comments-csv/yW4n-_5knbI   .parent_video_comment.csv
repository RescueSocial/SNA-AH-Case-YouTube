5,UgzJ-xvC3c96vGihs4F4AaABAg,I personally hope she does not get fired I'm so tired of this stupid cancel culture bull crap... I personally do not like Amber Heard  but if we keep supporting this cancel movement because somebody has a different opinion about something or they had a bad relationship that led to a nasty break up soon we'll  be canceling people for chewing there food to loudly lol I believe some people deserve to be canceled Harvey Weinstein deserved to be canceled anybody who abuses people or is a unapologetic racist that discriminates towards others deserve to be canceled... Johnny Depp doesn't deserve to be canceled Gina Carina doesn't deserve to be canceled and as much as I said I didn't like Amber heard she does not deserve to be canceled either... To take to a persons whole livelihood away  is not something that should be taking lightly... It's not only happening to people in Hollywood people are using it against anyone they just don't like... My opinion it's becoming way too easy to ruin a person's life,RedPill. WORLD247,0,2021-03-04T14:39:19Z

8,UgyQgmELWS2d2mn6aWR4AaABAg,"I read that tweet and article and, sorry, that is NOT a debunk at all and very far away from the definition of a debunk. Right now, nothing is clear up but Amber being fired for not passing her physical which caused her to become UNINSURABLE due to Drug-Related Issues is far more likely to occur than the issue being her body weight. At this point, we'll need to wait for the cast announcements which should be very soon.    

5:24secs - Hell no. If that happens, everyone including myself will think she is still 100% in Aquaman 2 as that is practically an official announcement.  It also means that tons of people will NOT Pay to see Aquaman 2 either, including me.  Frankly, this entire week proved that the response has been insanely positive and exciting to watch & pay to see Aquaman 2 when people believed that she is fired from the movie. In fact, metric and financial forecast for the movie massively spiked up, and the news trended WORLDWIDE. That means, beyond a shadow of a doubt, have Amber in the movie KILLS your business, so all companies would be in their very best interest to NOT hire her at all.  Sorry, I will never shed a tear for Amber because she only had herself to blame, especially as she lied to everyone including you and I for years and caused heaps of problems for sick children.",EAprima,0,2021-03-03T16:59:49Z

13,Ugz-udfbE58BkZfVabd4AaABAg,"I won't bother paying to watch that movie. I'll utilize other means to view the movie instead. Cinemas are forever increasing their prices. $19 for an adult ticket. And then food, in some cases 2-3 times more expensive than what you'd normally pay at a supermarket. What's the justification for that? There is none.",Brad Morgan NZ,1,2021-03-03T12:45:20Z
14,Ugy8OhnBIZZhlAHD1dp4AaABAg,"What does she have on the WB brass do you think?  I mean she must have something if all the Execs are in her corner considering the sheer amount of crap that has surfaced on her from people in the know.  How does she escape punishment for the s**t she has pulled and yet men who do much, much less get shown the door?",UK Media Warrior,2,2021-03-03T11:52:57Z
15,Ugzd58Q5ekqomScBV9h4AaABAg,"one of the many issues with Amber is she has permanently damaged her 'brand' . She is not family friendly at all.  It's only becoming more obvious to people what she has done - including hitting, punching, burning Johnny's face with cigarette, severing his finger, false DV/SA allegations against him and then topped with publicly lying about donating $3.5MM to sick children hospital.  The evidence is all against her and it's damning.   So even if powerful individuals consider her a beautiful and talented actor,  an amazing metoo activist leader with an iron clad WB contract - the reality is that she is not a good choice to be a female lead (or anything else) for a family friendly movie.  It will be shown at the boxoffice if they don't, or haven't, removed her.",Rock Candy,4,2021-03-03T11:31:12Z

It would have happened unceremoniously and with no protest from Amber Heard who has many platforms for claiming it's sexism/victim blaming or whatever cause she is Rep for a bundle of organisations and companies

30,UgzA1QwzPaR-gRu3zzx4AaABAg,WB kind of did ask for it. They have been very hypocritical. Fire the flash actor for tweets years ago says no word about the actual flash choking a girl in the street.

34,UgweZ6JMx8fCTHDKhq94AaABAg,This doesn't prove anything. In fact I think this proves its more true than anything. How many times has Marvel denied someone wasn't casted until they were ready to announce it. Also WB hasn't come out and said someone working on the film who didn't want to say who they were (another reason this doesn't prove it) said its not true.

I think it's more than likely that both Depp and Heard treated each other like shit, and if we knew the whole story, it would turn out that all of the allegations against both are true. 

What people on social media forget is that, even if WB/DC was inclined to fire Amber Heard, ""some people on Twitter hate her,"" is not an adequate reason that would stand up in court, and allegations from aggrieved exes aren't much better. Depp had the poor judgment to sue somebody and wound up with a court ruling that gave the Fantastic Beasts teams leverage to fire Johnny Depp. Give Amber credit for not being stupid enough to give them the rope to hang her with.",Paul McElligott,0,2021-03-03T00:46:32Z
