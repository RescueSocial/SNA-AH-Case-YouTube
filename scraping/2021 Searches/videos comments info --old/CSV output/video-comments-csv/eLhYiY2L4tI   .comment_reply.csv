Heard is a GORGEOUS woman! Stunning!

78,UgxdkhFOiCvK0dCBR6p4AaABAg,Dread Cthulhu,"@Seas _Wallace I do keep things in perspective.  I'm not sure how it is in other countries, but in America if someone says a racial slur and there is proof of it, say on social media, the person saying it can be charged with a hate crime and likely they will have their lives destroyed all over a word.  People have lost their jobs over it.  Look at what happened when Roseanne Barr said something that was perceived as racist.  She was fired from her new series.  I've read online of teachers losing their jobs as well.  You will pretty much be ostracized socially over saying the wrong words.  Imagine what happens if you physically attack a minority.  Meanwhile I hear the same tired jokes over and over all the time.  I got beat up at school on a regular basis over my hair color among other things.  (I'm also near-sighted and wear glasses.  That's another rant I could go into)  It never ends.  Not even when you're an adult.  Racism is wrong.  I'm not debating that at all.  Discrimination of any kind is wrong.  Bullying others is cowardly.  What I'm saying is that at least if you're a minority you have legal recourse for slights done to you.  i, on the other hand, really don't.  No one does anything about it.  No one ever has.  Not even those times I got beat up.  It was ""Oh kids, do those things."" Kids with down syndrome, autism or other non-protected statuses know what I'm talking about I'm sure.  And why should I have to change my hair color because others are shitheads?  I'm sorry that's just stupid.  Should someone bleach their skin so they look white enough to not be discriminated against?  My point is essentially that bullying for any reason is wrong.  It's bullshit.  It should never be allowed.  Just because someone is different in some way is no reason at all for them to have to put up with other people's ignorance and stupidity.  The things I've been through have made me grow to LOATHE bullies of all kinds.  I WILL not tolerate it if it happens in front of me.  I don't care if it puts me in danger.  I will stand against it because I've been there and I know what it's like.  Again sorry for the long rant, but it just gets to me.",2020-04-02T21:14:59Z,0
79,UgxdkhFOiCvK0dCBR6p4AaABAg,Seas _Wallace,"@Dread Cthulhu  Wow.... I hear you.... I don't know where in the world you are from/or live but um...red heads/gingers do moan about how they're perceived and treated, in UK anyway. I've gotten into whole debates with some of you. I'm sorry, there are people who are discriminatory towards you, but at the same time, you  can't compare that to being a person of colour. You didn't say ""people of colour"" or ""black people"" But I got your drift, and I don't think that was fair. That's two totally different battles And one of those has had major consequences. And if push comes to shove, you can change your hair colour. I sure as hell wouldn't.  ( I love ginger men btw. My father is one üòç) But I can't change my complexion if I wanted to. But I wouldn't change my blessing, even if I could.  Nor complain about it, just because of someone else's hang up's.  I get made fun of for having green eyes. Jack asses got something for everyone but themselves.

And the few we have gotten seem to be being replaced for the sake of diversity.  Excuse me, but being a redhead IS a minority.  By what right do you replace our minority with yours?  Oh right it's because white people right?  Yeah, because we don't get bullied for something we have no control over or anything.  We just don't get to complain about it being a hate crime like you do.  We mostly just put up with it.  *sigh*  Sorry.  It's just annoying.  End of rant.",2020-04-02T20:00:47Z,0
