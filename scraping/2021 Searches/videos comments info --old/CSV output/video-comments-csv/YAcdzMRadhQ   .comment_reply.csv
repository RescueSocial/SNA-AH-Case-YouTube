1,UgwbCk9xOMU2P8cPlp54AaABAg,CookiesSpirit,"@Elle Kay Thanks for the book title and author! I had lunch yesterday with a woman a few years older than me, and she asked me what woke culture is, and I found myself not quite being able to explain it adequately to a woman who tends to give what she calls “public service announcements” when crossed LOL. I miss the times when we were raised with extended family, knew who our cousins and aunts and uncles were, got together often, etc. As my husband tells me, “We’re mostly dead now, so it’s not our problem, all we can do is make sure our granddaughter is educated correctly.” She’s a 14-year-old conservative with an artistic lean, so will be able to meet life in the middle, or so we hope!

3,UgwbCk9xOMU2P8cPlp54AaABAg,CookiesSpirit,"Yes! Someone finally agrees with me on the dumbing down of America. There was a book written about this decades ago. I graduated high school in 1970. In 1971, the school district dropped the dress code and I told my then-husband that it was a horrible idea and would have repercussions. And it did. They dropped the pledge of allegiance. They continued to drop several subjects such as debate and physical education, just to mention a few. Since no one knows how the fundamentals of debate anymore, they just call each other names. Now there’s something called common core that makes no sense. American kids can’t do basic math. They can’t spell and their grammar sucks, which social media has hastened along at an alarming rate. They can’t write a basic business letter and don’t bother with personal letters or notes anymore; everything is by email now which i find insulting and unimpressive. If I weren’t so tired (LOL), I could really get I to a tirade! I’m just so grateful that I’m not raising kids in this day and age.",2021-10-16T01:03:12Z,1

They did one for a British news station back in 2019, and there was bitterness in that. However they did not bring up the grievance of the Prince title to the British audience. At all. Because the British know how aristocratic titles work. They completely saved it for 2 whole years and a US audience who lack the knowledge about British titles before mentioning it. If she believed she had been genuinely persecuted over a British aristocratic title, why not mention that to the British audience? Why instead wait to raise that ""slight"" with the audience that doesn't know it's not a slight. Unless she knows that information and knowledge prove it false.",2021-05-30T19:20:48Z,0

However at the present time four of the Sovereign's grandchildren, Peter, Zara, James and Louisa don't have Prince/Princesses titles. And nobody thinks that's racist. The Royal Family have a long established record of having Grandchildren of a Sovereign not be Prince/Princess which a PR company definitely did not create just to prove Meghan wrong. Indeed Archie's relationship to the Crown is through his father. Harry is the little brother of William. Just like Margaret was the little sister of the Queen. And Margaret's firstborn son is not a Prince either. He's an Earl. Which is the same status Archie has. So Archie has the same status as the Queen's sister's son got in 1961......and no PR company for the Royal Family can retroactively go back to 1961 and doctor that sort of thing.

32,UgyPOkJtzFSKrXJHso14AaABAg,K ORA,"I think the biggest problem is narrowing down humans to mostly/only this..? We’re too complex and the more we think like a group and less like individuals, the more we continue to cause the harms we want to end imo.

I mean, someone who is rich and pretty may have had a terrible life being neglected by their parents and sexually abused by everyone else, while someone who is extremely poor and ugly have a loving family, wich will lead this person to thrive MUCH easier in life than the other person, who is seen to society as only a privileged person (and vise versa), and that makes people be stuck on yet another box.

Of course that’s not just it. We don’t magically fix injustices in society just teaching one another to be kind. But however way we’re doing lately, doesn’t seem to be working because is like instead of continue to focus on respecting and understanding one another (wich is already so damn hard to achieve) we’ve never tried to compete more who has it harder and who MUST help society the most according to their characteristics. Both groups take this poorly and abuse it, because as complex as people are we still think is a very simplistic way. 

Academics understand where this is coming from, but the average person that doesn’t think like a history book, will not get or take this the way they suppose to take it (either way). If every person must be educated, respectful and intelligent to understand a concept in order to not fight with one another, perhaps we need to fix the method. Not sure if my thoughts were clear!?

66,Ugz4fI0usnPYrqkUyqd4AaABAg,A 2,"I think the issue is she went into specifics, in that she accused the Royal Family of denying her son a Prince title due to racism, when that genuinely isn't the reason. She also said he's the ""only"" one without a Prince title. When he's not. The Queen has ten great-grandchildren and seven of them aren't Princes/Princesses. Those are Savannah, Mia, Lena, Lucas, Archie, August and Lucas. Who are all the non-direct Great-Grandchildren. The three that are our George, Charlotte and Louis. Because their father is William is direct line. It's not racism or due to Meghan, it IS due to the historic formation of England whereby not just Royals, but non-Royal families too for the past 1200 years the firstborn has a higher status than the second born. It is HARRY's parentage background not Meghan's that causes their son not to be a Prince. She married the wrong Prince. I mean the entire of the British population can't pretend that accusation is racism, because everyone knows it's not. There's literally centuries old law about it and the same formulation applies to Princess Margaret's son who'd be in the same position. The Queen 'only' gave Meghan's child the same status as her own beloved sister's child Which is the correct status because both boys in that instance are Nephew's to the sovereign. And Meghan must have noticed all the other Royal children running about the Palace without Prince/Princesses titles, so it can only be a deliberate manipulation of a US audience to not have mentioned that.",2021-05-15T07:36:20Z,1

I think if someone goes on global television and accuses other people of racism, treason and breaking laws then YES they do owe people a thorough, clear explanation yes. Particularly when so much of it is distorted, for example in no way did the ""Royal Family"" provide their security like the Oprah interview said. That's just a plain, straight up falsehood. The British and Canadian Governments provided their security, and it was these two entities that took it away. Not the Royal Family. If you're broadcasting to a mass audience to makes a number of very serious accusations, make sure it's 100% accurate. Or else people are going to point out the falsehoods. That's not 'racism', it's caused by being an adult. If you're on national television making accusations make sure factually inaccurate things aren't said just because you're trying to build up a narrative. If a person says 7 lies and 3 truths in one interview, the issue is the 3 truths are liable to not be believed either.

103,Ugy0aEZqMzZn0uGo0tl4AaABAg,You Think What,"That's a great point, but I'd go further. It is almost never their skin color. After interviewing several people who were mildly racist, I came to the realization that racism is due to generalizing a group by association with bad experience. AKA if you have 3 bad experiences with people of a certain ethnicity then you will start to apply bad assumptions to new people of that ethnicity. These experiences can include reading about someone in a newspaper or on TV. Kind of like how black people were more likely to be perceived as criminal due to how often the media showed the race of the criminal when he was black. This was a while ago though. One of the conversations was with a man who didn't like the chinese business man who had bought a hotel. He called him a chink, and said that the chinese are all over here. I don't believe that he meant he disliked them because of their skin tone, but because of the difference in culture and bad experiences. This is my explanation of racism, and helps me ""combat"" it. If I know why people are being racist, if I understand them, then I can help them see the truth or at least open them up to new ideas and point out the flaws in being racist (such as the fact that two chinese people have very little in common and no connection. Like how jewish bankers and random citizens who happen to be jewish are two completely different things even thought they are loosely associated).
I was talking to some kids the other day (11 year olds) and they were talking about the Spanish kids. Not brown people, Spanish people. In my town the Spanish Americans have a very strong cultural centre. They hold festivities and play music, they retain a unique culture and that makes them distinct from, say Koreans, who melt into the general American ethnic background at least around here.

165,UgxPJIY71SACX3cyqgx4AaABAg,Shane Keena,"Postmodernism attempts to make quirks out of sensible solutions. Its predecessor, Modernism, attempts the diametrical opposite. Say you have 16 acres of prime Lower Manhattan real estate and there's a ton of inefficient-yet-quirky buildings on that site that make up a rather charming little enclave. Your ownership, through the power dynamics it enables, allows you to effectively call the shots for that neighborhood. Ownership of that site for instance, has little real impact on the new buildings happening to pop up in Midtown, if no action is taken by the owner. You know what does have an impact city-wide? Building 7 brand-new, state of the art buildings in that neighborhood, 2 of them the largest-ever towers built to date, creating an attraction that would transform the skyline of Manhattan as a whole. We shouldn't look at power differentials as oppression in and of themselves. As long as a free exchange of goods and services is being provided, and fair compensation is given to each side, that's all that matters. As long as the tenants of the older buildings were being paid enough money to buy them out from the rest of their leases and as long as no tenants raise undue criticism, nobody should care on that front. We should look at whether or not people are abusing power differentials to effectively tangle up people's personal lives and extract what they can from said suffering for their own benefit.

It is truly absurd to think that because us men are (on average) talller and physically stronger, no female partner can ever be abusive, dangerous and violent. Does a knife or a broken beer bottle not cut both women and men? Does fire not burn the flesh of anyone, male or female? To what extent does a man have to be hurt physically and damaged psychologically before we can say there is domestic violence and spousal abuse and he's the survivor not the perpetrator? That's what happened to Johnny Depp, and to yourself (but differently, I am sure). It's really offensive how people think being male somehow makes us impervious to insults and calumnies, emotional manipulation, and even physical hurt.

This was around the late 1990s according to the member which confirms what everyone suspected that Markle is actually 43 and not 39. In addition, she was studying communications at the time of expulsion, not drama and international relations. Anyway, Thomas Markle used his savings to bail her out and get the records sealed. I don't know if she went back and graduated. You'd think there'd be photos all over of her in the purple and gold NWU gown.

Society is becoming so ""me me me"" that they are trying to replace objectivity with subjectivity and facts with feelings, and that's just not right, it's narcissistic and dare I say unfair. There are certain standards (facts) that should be met, and when feelings are involved, those standards change for everyone. Of course it's at the expense of critically thinking people and in the favour of those who get easily offended, because then the bar becomes super low and everyone gets offended by anything, and a low standard is created.

C,"Sadly, I feel that in the West, the woke ideology is more and more prevalent while being less and less bothered with hiding its true Marxist nature because too often the failure of Communism is being placed solely on the cultural background of the countries where it was implemented : in other terms, the disasters of Communism in the countries that you mention is being explained and rationalized by the mere fact that it occured in these places that are unfortunately seen by the left-wing elite/media as 'backwarded' and 'underdeveloped' - a point that is superbly illustrated by Jonathan Littell in his novel The Kindly Ones, where a SS officer explains to a captured Soviet commissioner that Socialism would have prevailed in any country but Russia and that it's a shame the Revolution occured there and not, say, in Germany. Now of course we know such theory to be the xenophobic, condescending rubbish, but unfortunately it is pretty much accepted within most left-wing medias as it helps to explain why countries like Poland or Russia have gone conservative ever since the fall of the Berlin Wall.

386,UgwSV5ZAlld-SSAeQ6l4AaABAg,Gerard Mackay,"@Melissa M. Sutton it would be a pleasure Melissa. After 11 years of very expensive private education Diana emerged without a single qualification to her name, she literally failed at every exam she ever sat. She famously described herself as ‘thick as two short planks’ and few who knew her would disagree. I’m sure she was capable of kindness and empathy but she was also capable of vindictiveness (source material countless staff who worked for her) if she suspected loyalty was to Charles not her. Her lack of judgement centred around the string of extra marital affairs she engaged in ( ruining Will Carling’s marriage and stalking a married boyfriend with 300+ texts when he tried to end the affair) Her final fatal lack of judgement was cavorting with a playboy from a rich but rather sinister family and entrusting her personal safety to a drunken, substance abusing chauffeur instead of the royal security personnel in her previous life who were vetted to within an inch of their lives. Not fastening her seat belt was the final and ultimate act of self neglect which left two young boys motherless and (certainly in Harry’s case) damaged for life.

I watched your other videos and I really respect your work. To understand the whole Meghan Victim or Villain Show I looked at other sources like For Harriet, Godfrey & Michael Jai White on VladTV, John Oliver, The Take etc... And I came to the conclusion: 
We give too much attention to the British Royal Family! Why should we give a damn about royality/monarchy that presents class system, colonialism, colorism and cult of personality? 
I agree that Meghan is shady as Oprah who knew exactly what she get herself into when she married Harry. She caused troubles and is also miserable. The royal palace/system is racist/bias/conservative/complicated and the press is no doubt volatile, racist and misogynistic. I don't believe Harry is the pure victim at all. He is a grown-ass man who is capable of making his own decisions.
It's like a typical Harlequin Romance Novel where the villainous golddigging woman is only to blame and the apparent innocent sweet man is blameless... And he needs to be saved by someone like a pure good innocent lovestruck girl/woman... But the ML is often an toxic dumb Alphahole. Doesn't it says a lot about his character when he chose to be with this kind of shitty woman and lets others suffer? Maybe the villain and idiot actually deserves each other. At least Johnny Depp was more self-reflective and made some intelligent decision to free/protect himself. By the way, he was already losing lots of money before Amber screwed him over.
Harry and Meghan do profit personally from the whole good and bad Media Hype theater. Their marriage it's like a business merger.
I think the Mainstream Media and the people have been overrating/worshipping the drama and life of the royal family for far too long. There are actually more important things to discuss that affects more our real common regular life.",2021-04-10T16:25:47Z,1
