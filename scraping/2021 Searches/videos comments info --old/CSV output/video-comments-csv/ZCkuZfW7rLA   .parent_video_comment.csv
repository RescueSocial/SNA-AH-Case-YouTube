43,UgxsRDljgBSpixaFS3h4AaABAg,"He's literally not even paying her any mind. He's trying to avoid her. She's calm and laughing at him when he's in a dark moment- substance abuse is mental illness. And instead of offering to help or comfort her loved one she's trying to sneakily record this dark moment for her own advantage. I can't imagine seeing my partner drunk and in obvious pain and deciding to record them to obviously show that footage to someone else or the public and use it for my own benefit. Especially when the behaviour isn't even directed at me and they're doing everything not to involve me in that moment. By no means are we obligated to stay with someone whose mental illness is frightening us, but when he's obviously not forcing her to stay she certainly has the option to put space between them and discuss things later, attempt to help him sober up, or stay away entirely. But seeing as he's constantly heard begging her for space, I highly doubt she's capable of allowing him it, and it seems in this video that he's at the point where he no longer sees the point in asking for it.",I J,1,2021-03-10T16:03:58Z

Think about it genius, he's a violent person who does this often.  You are now making excuses for an abuser.  I feel sorry for any victim to find their way to you!
I find it amazing how some women can be so enamored with Depp's cheekbones that they just can't accept in their narrow mind that he isn't quite the perfect guy they think he is.

But I snapped and grabbed the broom and started breaking the broom over his head , the broom broke as I did.  And after years he did to me I went to jail and not him.
But it was my first offense,  so I was ok there.  But if you aren't the one dont be trying to analyze.

As soon he realizes she has crossed a line Johnny walks away and in fact leaves the property to get away from her with no threat of physical violence. Quite the opposite. Is the man not allowed to display emotion about an unrelated incident without being seen as an abuser? 
A few years ago were coached by child counsellors and psychologists to teach my pre-teen son, with mental health challenges and occasional anger outbursts, to redirect is physical frustration to a safe inanimate object like a pillow,  a sofa or a mattress rather than breakable things and never people. It is scary to see him erupt and doors and wall get punched sometimes especially now that he is a bigger; stronger, more frustrated teenager but he has never deliberately hit us. Although he is angry and emotionally he has learned to control it enough to limit himself. Of course it is unpleasant and upsetting even for a man like me but my ex and I have learned that his anger will blow over and to trust that no matter how upset he is he doesn't want to strike us and we just need to give him enough space and time to calm down by himself.",Desmond Jordan,1,2020-12-28T02:09:53Z

When I found out, I was amazed to know, I went to research the news and saw a picture published on a gossip site of Amber's face and I was: WTF? I read that he threw his cell phone in her face, among other things, I still didn't believe that this kind of aggression, would have as proof those photos. I wanted to believe it and I felt bad for it (in not believing her), because my mother and I, we witnessed and helped many women who suffered domestic violence of many kinds and always, always, very shocking, just like it was with Rihanna. This year of 2020, ""blowing up"" so many things about Johnny's intimacy with this divorce, is more than clear and obvious to me: Amber urgently needs serious medical help.

With that said, I read somewhere how a partner slamming things like doors, punching through walls, breaking things, etc, is a form of mental/emotional abuse.  I know you said it wasn't like he was saying ""this is what I'd like to do to you, etc"", but it's still toxic relationship material. What do you make of what he's doing there? Of course, with her lack of boundaries, I would imagine she kept pushing his buttons until he reached that point so she could record it. Her little laugh at the end was pretty telling. With that being said, thoughts on his behavior there? 

I'm no expert, but it seems like he feels trapped and is taking it out on his cupboards and trying to regain some power back.  Other assessments?",Sarah Aamaya,0,2020-08-28T23:01:47Z
230,Ugx2cw8_5D644lKgLz94AaABAg,He was obviously drunk and aggravated. Although probably didn't  need to react. She totally was pushing it and trying to get a rise  out of him. And the media said he ripped it from her hands when he really took it off the counter.  She certainly does not act like a battered wife,mom4,1,2020-08-28T20:56:05Z
231,Ugzpyqrt9VWkKmcdX8h4AaABAg,"It was actually when this video (the first version that cuts after he throws the phone) came out and I saw it that I knew for sure that Johnny was innocent and Amber was the abuser. I was going through a divorce with my ex at the time and seeing this video brought back memories of the time when I caught my ex trying to record me behind my back. It has been nearly 5 years since then, and I can still remember it just like it happened 10 minutes ago. We were arguing about something and he kept pushing me to the point where I finally had a panic attack. At this point he calmly got up and left the room, I could hear his phone beep as he turned on the recorder and then he came back into the room, he was eerily calm, just like Amber in this video, and kept asking me ""What's wrong? Why are you doing this?"". It was like dealing with dr Jekyll and mr Hyde.. Because I had heard him turn on the recorder, I somehow managed to collect myself enough to not shout and as a result he didn't get the recording he had hoped for. As I watched him turn off the recorder, I asked him why he had tried to record me and that smirk he gave me was the coldest I have ever seen. ""I need proof in case you go and do something stupid."". Who knows how many times he had recorded me that I didn't know of? So when I saw that video, I just knew. It really wasn't popular to side with Johnny back then and I got so much crap for doing so. But I'm really happy to see that the truth is finally coming out and Johnny is getting his name cleared from this. The sad thing is that I think that if Amber hadn't kept pushing him like she's done since the divorce, I don't think that Johnny would have fought back. I think that he was protecting her for so long and trying to avoid a confrontation that he just accepted all the blame she was throwing at him. Hell, I know from my own experience - I didn't fight my ex in the divorce either. I could have walked away with a substantial settlement if I had, but instead I walked away with nothing because I just couldn't and wouldn't fight with him. I even wrote in the divorce application that he could have it all, I just wanted my freedom. I think Johnny to an extent did the same thing. If Amber had just left it, we wouldn't be here now. But (thankfully) I think that she finally pushed him so far that he had enough and decided to fight back and I'm really happy for his sake that he did.
When people pointed to this video as proof that he was abusive, I used to say ""remember that she is the only one who knows that the camera is rolling (until he spots it)"". It's easy to play nice and behave when you know that you are being recorded.",Niko,3,2020-08-28T16:24:32Z

I'm going to school and still dont know what to do with my education as of yet. I'm still putting myself back together  and have been sober 3 years and have a beautiful baby girl and a much better relationship. However when I was a heroin addict I was crazy and abusive and needy and had been sex abused in my childhood. And domestically battered in a previous relationship. The way you explain who I was and why I was like that  is incredible. I've since become less co dependent and dont let things affect me so dramatically anymore but to see it explained is just more progress for my recovery. I think I definatley used to be a narcissist but after being a drug addict it changed me humbled me, I hope!! Plus I'm also a mother and my life truly started when my little baby girl came into my world my family is my life. I still have so much more to learn why I am the why I am. What chain of events got me to those situations. How my mind and actions were subsequently affected because of them. I'm A  hard core fan now I'd like to email you! What does your job other than youtube consist of? I think if I went to school for  pathology, then  I'd truly love my job! I'm also excellent at analyzing people and sometimes care entirely too much about people and thier problems !! My mom says her and I are both  intuitive empaths, with emotional souls! Plus I'm a Scorpio.  Lol but maybe I was just young, crazy and  on drugs. While also on the depo shot, which is I've heard can cause erratic behavior.

. I have seen so many American movies where women punch men really gard and even knock them out and it is used as an conedy effect and everything continues as if nothing happened.  If ir was reversed this comedy woukd become horror and man in film sentenced to many years in jail. I rhink there is a scene like that in There is Something About Mary. I am trying to recall a specific movie but my memory might fail there.

Jay Leno said in his show that his mom used to hit him with a pan and everyone in the audience laughed. As if it was a Tom and Jerry thing. He repeats this in an interview which is on the net. Just Google it. He really describes how boys have been brought up; don't be a girl, man up.

If it was 'a man beats his daughter with iron object' what do you think would happen to that man? 

In WWI a big part of the British army where boys around 15-17, sacrificed in hundreds of thousands. Always boys from poor families. In all wars. Just babies really.

If you go to BBC History podcast you can listen to their heartwarming letters ro their families. Many of them adress their morhers and sisters in particular and say they are fighting for them to keep them save. 

The Brirish government went to football games and rallied boys and men in thousands and recruited them.

She needs a diagnosis and mental health support before she destroys more important relationships with people around her. I have found that individuals with BPD can also be quite narcissistic and even with the acceptance and understanding of loved ones it is not an easy fix.

We don't know what happened prior to video and neither Depp nor Heard have said publicly. It could be bad financial news or something else entirely.",TwoNoisyLorrikeets,0,2020-08-17T23:46:48Z

295,Ugz8PS7GpR3UAork5pV4AaABAg,"its sad to see this shit happen to such a good actor. Johnny depp has been in many good films including some of my favorites, such as nick of time, the ninth gate, and charlie and the chocolate factory. Amber is clearly setting him up because she wants to sue him to get awarded his chocolate factory as an asset for payment instead of cash, so she can take over the business. All jokes aside though it is horrible to see anybody go through stuff like this and get set up for things. i feel that with alot of actors, being rich and famous kind of puts a target on their back for this kind of thing where others take advantage and try to incite or provoke legal things so they have an excuse to get at the persons money. Or maybe i could be wrong and its an entirely different motive with the whole money thing just being a cherry on top. ive seen people do stuff like that even in situations where there is no financial gain. i think she could also be doing it for the thrill of it or the rush feeling of being in control. Sick thing to do. That kind of stuff can also cause mental scars.

There was no where to run. As the years past my mother was completely swamped by him.
Her behavior all so changed towards me kind of parroting him.
By the time i understood what was going on I was 55 years old.
But i always loved my mother even when it was not good between us.
So i never cut them out of my life, Because of my mother and my sister.
But it did mean i had to find a why to cope without understanding what was going on.
The biggest part of that, was there was a part of me he could never get.
Even when i was it my lowest there was a place he could never get.
i always believed in my self........... just........battered and bruised but just enough all though it was a close run thing by the time i was in my 20's.
These people will never stop, never change, they will destroy you completely on every level.
They'll do it with a smirk.
Also my  brother is a narcissist or cluster b I haven't worked out the specifics.  when he reached his late teens they joined forces against me,
They will work together. Ones bad enough Two working together when you dont understand what's happening can be soul destroying.
Channels like this are invaluable priceless, these people will hate these channels because in part their power comes from you not understanding whats happening.
As emphatic people, as people who feel for others we think that every one thinks like that, but they dont. They have little or none at the level my brother and  stepfather are.

Amber heard is fucking hot as hell and a psycho, that is fact. Great actress , Ha i don't think so. I've seen most of her work and the best thing I can say about her besides nice tits is that she's passable at best which is a shame because you would think she would be able to tap into all that crazy psycho that she possess and deliver more interesting nuanced performances but nope. Anyone could have played that role. she got it because she is hot and knows how to read . Johnny depp is an amazing actor and has been for decades.

We see MR.Deep already in an state of anger or frustration we seen him smashes the cupboard and throwing your phone. but so far nor physical abuse have been recorded or cant been heard. Also you seemed enjoying taking that tape, at the beginning and at the end we see you leave with a smile with no injuries whatsoever. My verdict on this tape is you trying to frame MR.Deep  with false allegation. Therefore due to lack of evidence and evidence in attempt to frame the person. Therefore MR.Johnny Deep is claimed not guilty. And due to false evidence and no evidence toward Johnny Deep, Amber.H shall be sentenced 2 years in prison for false claims.

Sounds like he's is out of his mind (on something possibly) and obviously there's more to it before and after Amber started recording, but almost like he's said he's in pain (emotionally,mentally) to her before the clip start and is asking for it to shows physically by her cutting him. I'm just guessing from what I heard, mainly from her responses and what I know about cutting. Not much to go on in the clip but I imagine you'll see way more in it than I can.

Her laughter shows only deflection of fear and a personal attempt to minimize anxiety- not that she finds it comical- more that it's her self defense mechanism in a situation where she feels powerless and insecure about what escalation could happen.

Abuse building up inside a person who feels powerless can make you act out in ways you wouldn't usually on top of using substances to cope that mess with your moods.

He would push my buttons until I lost it and then when I did, he made sure that people were around so he could publicly ridicule me and he had witnesses and looked like a victim. He too is in the public eye and when I told him I would expose him, he said no one would believe me because people will remember all he's done for the community. He has made it on the news for helping the NorCal fires and is very well known in the bay area. I have completely lost myself due to it and have responded aggressively out of desperation, anger and pain. Many times I have self diagnosed myself with BPD because of it but according to experts, it is not bpd, I've simply dealt with too much abuse. He has used that against me. He also has told me that he is a Narc and he hates that I found out because only his father knew that and now I've discovered it.
