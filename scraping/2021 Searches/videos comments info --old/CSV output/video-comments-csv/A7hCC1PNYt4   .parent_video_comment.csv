4,UgzgLkGa4KTOKDDtaeR4AaABAg,"She's acting twitchy, her movements are jerky and all over the place.  Her words don't frame a sentence quite right and these are 'tells' that she's on something and suffering the consequences.  A addiction to stimulants, hallucinogens and who knows what else, does take a toll on a person's nervous system and brain function.  Reality is altered pretty drastically in that state.  Personally, I'd hate that feeling. Thanks for the video.",Marta Womack,0,2021-06-22T16:48:15Z

6,UgwaageoLDQPEkTAQ9p4AaABAg,"You are right on the money. I was drawn to this story (even if I hate gossiping about stars) because I went through a very traumatic relationship with a woman VERY similar in her behavior and psychological problems. She almost destroyed my life. She did have chemical psychosis due to coke, she was on antidepressant, she drank heavily, and would become hysterical and violent the second you would confront her. She has had problems with the law, with child protection service, and she kept lying and blame everybody and everything. All the therapies, the psychiatrists, the rehab never worked until I left her, and she lost her son's custody. 

She was diagnosed with borderline personality, anxiety, and depression. Mostly because of years of drug use. 

Of course, I didn't know about that until many months after she started living with me. 

These persons are toxic, dangerous, and you can't save them. Believe me. I am stil recovering emotionally and financially. Narcissists, sociopaths (there are many levels, some are moderate, but still sociopaths) and addicted persons will always convince some people that they are victims. 

And if it's a good looking woman like Amber Heard or my ex, they can get away with it for a long time and take precious years and saved money from you. There are poison.",poprip,0,2021-05-21T16:08:04Z

She takes so much Adderall (it‚Äôs the same basic chemical as meth and meth absolutely gives drug-induced schizophrenia along with cocaine. Her cocktail also includes the acne drug. Accutane, which is known to cause mental issues. She stays on it to have ‚Äúperfect skin,‚Äù but isn‚Äôt monitored for the serious side affects it actually causes.

28,UgyiZarwHfwnYTB3k8J4AaABAg,"My understanding is that Cluster B disordered people (ASPD, NPD, Borderline, etc) often use drugs to cope with the internal effects of their disorders.  On the flip side, drug addicts and alcoholic exhibit a lot of narcissistic traits while using.  It's possible we are seeing her traits exacerbated by her drug use.

If we look at her parents, her father and mother were both really nice to Johnny after Amber reported his ""abuse"" and tried to convince him to let Amber and her buddies stay in the condo (text messages) but flipped on a dime when Johnny wouldn't give in.  Parents who side with the abuser is a really odd thing.  Narcissism runs in family, usually because a narcissistic parent creates the trauma or indulgence that creates the narcissism for the child in the first place.  The same is true of ASPD; however, this is a brain disorder that is passed on genetically.  


It is significant that Amber's story is that Johnny was abusing her when in a drug and alcohol induced state when the reverse appears to be the case.  Projection.",Been There,4,2020-08-24T00:09:07Z
29,UgzaxfcdX1vAzRR7kIJ4AaABAg,"This was literally right after she chopped the top of Johnny‚Äôs finger off.

30,UgyR1QfGaU1yv-nWt6V4AaABAg,"She admitted on the stand during the sun trial that she was taking Provigil which is for narcolepsy but is abused as a weight loss drug. Look at the side effects of that drug when taken by someone who has borderline personality disorder. It's not good, similar to abusing Adderall yes can cause weight loss if you aren't ADD/ ADHD probably the mix of all the drugs and very likely mental issues- according to her psychiatrist notes- could def cause her to in her words "" lose it"" and have psychosis!",Jen Rab,3,2020-08-21T10:16:49Z
31,Ugxip5OTfUGEIFEAUt14AaABAg,"Amber is a speed freak. She takes Provigil, Aderall & Cocaine. She‚Äôs got to though the Xanax in to come down in order to sleep.

33,Ugz40GN1pyFfFCWXcUB4AaABAg,"I understand and appreciate people trying to figure out and sort of expose her but, you have to understand: anything anybody putting out there online with her name on it, content doesn't matter. Lets say she saw hashtag ""amberheardIsCrazy"" this only gets through to her as: ""look at those jealous poor fucks, they envy me so badly, I am a winner"" because you know what? she is crazy. Nothing gets to her. These people are absence of being.. simulated reality with shitload of emulations going on. There is no human in there. So it is best to put things with Johnny's name, to support him. Anything trying to expose her actually works the opposite. Ignoring these people completely and treating them the way they should be treated (as clowns) are the best way to hurt them believe me.

She's apparently taking more than one doctor's prescription for this.  It stops acne.  I suspect if she has acne problems, she needs an anti-androgen, like Dianette, which would be harmless, and would lower what also appears to be higher than normal testosterone levels, cf violence, Alpha behaviours.  She needs to be off Provigil also, and mdma, mushrooms, cocaine, wine.  She has a chemical warhead in her head and needs detoxing.
