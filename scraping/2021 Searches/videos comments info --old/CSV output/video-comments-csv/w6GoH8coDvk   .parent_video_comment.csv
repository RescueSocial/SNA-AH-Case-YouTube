So they are like see we do support women

100,UgxoAvdzrWZpya3xG1h4AaABAg,"It's hypocritical to have J.K. Rowling writing and producing for WB while firing Johnny Depp, for sure. But the chance that their Fantastic Beasts series was going to make a comeback was small, since the people who loved Harry Potter the most are generally disgusted by Rowling and don't want to put another nickel in her pocket, let alone one with Johnny Depp in it.

And for the record, it is very rare that the UK courts would side with a publisher. UK publications are known for kind of crappy reporting, particularly their tabloid rags, so they almost always get fined. Not this time and because the judge believed the allegations against Depp. 

Stay tuned for their upcoming legal battle in the U.S., but personally, Amber Heard hasn't got anything positive out of this (just read the comment section here), so I'm more likely to believe her. Is she an innocent? Who knows? But it sounds like Depp's got a problem when he's on drugs and scared the crap out of her and she got out of her marriage ASAP.",mAg1Cb0Xsabbat,2,2020-11-06T18:56:58Z
