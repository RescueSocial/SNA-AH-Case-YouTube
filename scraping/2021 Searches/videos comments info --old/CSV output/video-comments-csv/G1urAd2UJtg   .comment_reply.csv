27,UgzIaWIjbLnZpXdEKUl4AaABAg,EowynG191,"@toobaaaapi Thank you for taking the time to write al that! I really appreciate it.

I hear all the time people talking about other people being narcissists.. the word is thrown around willy-nilly like it doesn't mean anything. You've really explained it very well. I can see how very particular she is.

Also... I'm truly sorry you had to endure the experiences you did, but I hope you can find peace in the good that you can now bring, both to those who have had similar experiences (at least in not feeling alone), but also, in opening other people's eyes to this. I wasn't sure before, but I believe you. It's very clear.

‚ô°",2021-02-17T18:07:23Z,2
28,UgzIaWIjbLnZpXdEKUl4AaABAg,toobaaaapi,"@EowynG191sure, here I start:
1. I have listened to her tapes. She has over and over again blamed johnny for the things she has done. For example After hitting johnny ( and he had genuine injuries) she has texted people claiming she was assaulted. That is one thing narcissists do a lot, someone might say that is something a conspirator might do as well to create evidence, which is true, hence I don't base my judgement on just one sign.
2. I listened to another tape where she attacked johnny and severed his finger, and after the doctor, nurse, head of security etc. all came in I hear her I the tape wailing in the back ground, O MY GOD HE IS GOING TO HATE ME, a witness in the tape even says she knows exactly what she is doing. Here is the funny thing, this was the incident about which she said that depp had attacked her and dragged her naked body over broken glass, however in the tape it's clear that she was completely uninjured, and crying and wailing as if she had been hurt. That's what a narcissists do a lot as well, hit you and start shouting as if they were hit.
3. She is very bad at keeping track of her lies and tall tales, she just makes stuff up as she goes, and has no fear of being caught on camera or in her written statements. Here is where it gets interesting, a conspirator or con man doesn't make stuff up, say it on camera and then makes something else up. A conspirator thinks things through, gets his story straight, and then tries to stick to it. Her behaviour is very different. She genuinely believes herself to be above the law, and she most genuinely believes the world will keep believing her lies, even if she keeps contradicting herself on the camera. Such over confidence is usually only exhibited by narcissists. They have complete and trust in their abilities to get everyone on their side no matter how many times they get caught.
4. The fact that she has claimed a million different types of physical assaults by depp (one even a rape story she was told by her ex assistant, that she replaced the victim's name with her own name and the perpetrator's name with johnny's ,it's all over the news, the real lady has come forward) AND SHE NEVER HAD TO GO THE HOSPITAL!!!!I mean seriously girl, if you were so brutally attacked and raped so many times, which hospital did you go to (her descriptions were pretty violent, not your usual he slapped me around) instead, she was the one constantly abused but depp was the one ending up in hospitals, seriously?? This kind of defiant lying is what I have personally observed in many narcissists around me. They will abuse and become victim's not only Infront of those who don't know, but even those who saw the incident. It's mind boggling. My mil once pointed towards me when a burglar asked who has come from abroad, and said this is my dil, she has come from abroad, resulting in me losing a very large sum of money. But later she not only lied to everyone else, but to my face a million times, maybe she thought if she repeats it enough time I will also forget what happened. But no, that's what narcissists do, they really do trust they can make people believe their story, and it works for a while.
5. They need to repeat their false version of the story again and again, it's something they do. Heard signed a non disclosure agreement but still felt the need to write and publish her version of story in a news paper, this time adding more serious allegations (including a stolen rape story), it's very common among narcissists, it's as if they are trying to convince themselves of their lies as well. It's very strange.
6. Her dead of expression face and eyes when she is talking about BEING ABUSED, it's so shocking I never get over it. My own eyes used to look exactly like depp's eyes, as if someone was crying and banging to get out behind the eyes. The eyes tell a lot. 
7. Some of her actions are plain humiliating and nothing but meant to cause embarrassment, shame and self loathing in depp. No abused woman leaves faeces on sleeping husband, they try their best not to rock the boat. And her tweet the next morning replying to depp, ""it seemed like you enjoyed it."" Yeah, I am pretty sure she is a narcissist, no conspirator, gold digger or compulsive liar does something like this. It's definitely someone who enjoys playing mind games, that is a characteristic of narcissist, hitting is not as important for a narcissist, destroying the victim mentally and emotionally for complete control is the prize. Hence things like hiding his medicine when he was trying to get off drug addiction, leaving faeces on his bed, hitting him and then telling everyone she was hit (I have been there as well), but most of all, her open challenge to depp, ""go and see who believes you"" (I have been given similar challenges as well) showed a pretty characteristic unrealistic over confidence that narcissists show, also it's a trick to scare the victim into staying quiet.
I can go on and on, but I can't write a whole book here, it takes someone who has been there to recognize them, they appear so normal and just like everybody else, to an untrained eye ofcourse. She literally is seen similing when talking about the abuse incidents for crying out loud, those smirks are a clear sign of enjoyment when recalling.",2021-02-17T16:57:51Z,5

77,Ugye3q1XoVVhRasBsNx4AaABAg,xStonedSobeR x,@Sara Snow so that incredible incredible channel has disabled comments now on their latest smear video in which they claim is proof that johnny is aggressive in australia when in the audio it literally has him saying he was calm and she acknolwdged that... not once did she even mention fearing for her life or abuse. like you cannot make this shit up i assumr they were getting ratio'd in bad way,2020-11-14T15:52:42Z,7
78,Ugye3q1XoVVhRasBsNx4AaABAg,Sara Snow,@xStonedSobeR x why am I not surprised lol. Kinda telling that even they don't really believe in her if they had to do that.

I am shocked why she is in the marriage (at this point in their relationship) if she doesn't have one healthy, loving thing to say about her husband and all the love their relationship holds.  To say Amber is immature is an understatement. She needs professional help. She likes the sound of her own voice....way too much.  Just saying.",2020-11-15T02:39:29Z,18

It is just awful to hear and the fact he gets so upbeat at the idea that something/anything could work is the worst, hindsight is a wonderful thing. 
I'm so glad he got away from that vile creature (lord knows I have my own ideas on how this would've ended otherwise)
He seems so much healthier these days but the emotional cost plus his extremely private nature have all been violated too. She couldn't even respect that, especially that I suppose. It's almost a trophy or badge of honor to her, a big game hunter with their ""prize""
In their last call I know of he gave her the option to keep things private but her raging ego would not allow it. I think that recording was even worse as the op-ed had been published by then (I think, timeline is a bit fuzzy to my brain)and he was still being kind to her. Heartbreaking.",2020-10-26T17:14:12Z,13

Clearly the people still siding with her have never been abused.
