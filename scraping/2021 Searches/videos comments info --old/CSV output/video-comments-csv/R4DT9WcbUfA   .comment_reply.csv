116,Ugx2aHB7nk-Vm43HnOp4AaABAg,Kirsty Fairly,"@Xendava -Yes I've no doubt that TUG will keep us informed, he's the best when it comes to getting the info on this case. Thing is even if the studios did put AH up to all of this she'd still have to have herself a game plan of some kind to try & achieve what she was supposed to do, the problem for them all is that they all underestimated Johnny, & did not expect him to disrupt their plans. They all thought that he'd be far too easily manipulated by AH to ever divorce her. I think they all expected that she'd get rid of him, & they would then cover it all up while she inherited everything, only she then found out she was not in his will & the plan had to change to framing him as a perpetrator of dv, which is why their ""evidence"" looks so staged, they had to come up with it all as quickly as possible before JD could finally come to his senses, file for divorce & expose her.",2021-07-31T22:11:20Z,1

But you see friend I don't think she planned this at all. I am thinking that she was put up to all of this by the studios. She was sent to set him up.  That's why WB wont fire her from Aquaman even though clearly would be a wise decision. That is part of the payoff to her for setting him up. When he sued her they had to pay for the lawyers. I just saw another story that TUG will probably cover but the judge just told the ACLU that they have to prove that AH donated the 7 million to them. In essence,  show me the records. If that was a lie trust me friend this whole house of cards is coming down. Because I'm willing to bet you that the Judge already knows the answer to that question. But I'm sure TUG will be on that.",2021-07-31T21:47:40Z,0
118,Ugx2aHB7nk-Vm43HnOp4AaABAg,Kirsty Fairly,"@Xendava -She was apparently abusing Johnny from practically the beginning of their relationship, but it did seriously escalate during the Australia trip, as that was the moment that she found out he wanted a pre nup & that she wasn't even in his will, so in her rage she threw the vodka bottle that severed Johnny's finger. As for when she started planning to claim that he abused her, I think that she started planning the hoax after the Australia incident once she realised she wasn't in his will so she had to change her original plan of causing his death, & switched to staging evidence so that she could blackmail him with dv accusations, then when the blackmail didn't work she went public with her allegations in order to ruin him.",2021-07-31T21:35:02Z,0
