I can't imagine what going through all of that in general is like let alone the whole world tuned in with an opinion. More than hurting your career your children have had to hear about all that too and by being honest and not trying to drag you through the mud it all could have been avoided.  I truly hope this comes to a conclusion soon and people see the truth. How great would it be to have captain Jack back and no frankly no one can replace you as Grindelwald either.  
I am no one to be giving you advice Only you can decide when enough is enough.  I know your trying to clear your name but I think the massive support you have along with the people who really matter knows who you are and people know your a good guy. All that jargen from AH was crap.  Be happy live your life enjoy your babies and hell travel and have fun. Don't let her drag you down anymore and keep perpetuating the cycle.

56,Ugxo7Dbcy-12g4TAf7t4AaABAg,Porosus8,"Agreed. Spacey lost everything without even so much as being found guilty. He might be guilty (in fact he probably is) but although he is one of my favourite actors I'm all for studios dropping him IF found guilty; he should not have been punished by mere accusation and no finding of guilt. But if that's the bullshit way the world is these days where guilt by accusation is enough to destroy a career then it should go both ways with abusive women receiving the same trial by public opinion that men do. Personally, I prefer ""innocent until proven guilty"" (I'm old-fashioned that way) but it's much easier, faster, lazier and self-righteous to just point the finger and destroy decades of work these days it seems, thereby making the accusers virtuous by comparison. Equality means women should be unfairly judged too, it's time actresses like Heard realised that. It's a bullshit concept and lazy justice that corrodes social values and makes a joke of real victim's trama, but hey, if that's how it is, let's have equality in bullshit lynch-mobbing please.",2021-02-08T22:45:59Z,4

I am not sure of this is fully true because I’ve only seen these statements on gossip sites and channels like this. However if we do believe it there might even be a chance that they rehire him to be jack sparrow. Now we need Warner bro’s to apologize and rehire him as grindelwald. The man deserves so much more but that’s the least they can do.,2021-02-05T19:09:31Z,5

They will re look at the evidence and they will really look at it and they will see that the first verdict was pure BS and everyone knows it and to top that off they have the court hearings in the US that is coming up this year. Amber is sweating bullets she is panicking and she knows it.
