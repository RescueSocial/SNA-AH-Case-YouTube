0,UgxlYnnhaOYMJtIPLNp4AaABAg,I think it's hilarious that he's pretending anything is based on artistic integrity. It's a cheesy movie based on a comic book. They bent over backwards to please corporate sponsors and the Chinese government.,CamIam,1,2021-07-31T23:14:11Z

4,UgyxJEm-eE4D9hPurD94AaABAg,"It shows the amount of abuse enablers that read the sun, the same red top that encourages women to cheat on their husbands, no moral compass, the same as warner brothers, and hollywood, i dont care about some crappy character in a movie, irelevent in reality, when in reality a innocent mans life is being ruined for greedy fantasy that enables abusers like ah to profit from fraud and conspiring a false narrative, that misleads what justice is, a mockery and insult by a self confessed abuser, manipulator, deceiver, sexualy deviant monster herself, that cheats and supports the imoral pratices the sun news has been involved in over years, shows the state of corruption jd is fighting against, we need better journalists that are not politicaly corrupt or influenced by trends, straight talking no bullshit reporting, brutaly honest people who serve the public, not insult their core values with woke crap.",john thompson,1,2021-07-31T00:59:01Z

6,Ugy121TG2XPDyFCdPw14AaABAg,I never saw Aquaman 1 and I will not be seeing Aquaman 2 anyway because of what the WB did to Johnny Depp,Megan O'Shea,4,2021-07-30T18:50:14Z

8,Ugzyx_MiM9yrDjCqMfh4AaABAg,"Good morning Tammy it's a smokey day here in BC CANADA, i hope you had a good rest. #justiceforjohnnydepp  i will BOYCOTT AQUAMAN2, i never seen this first one either",nicole napoleon,5,2021-07-30T15:40:11Z
9,UgyHeIo2YRH3AJUxiIl4AaABAg,"The fact is that in the free world Aquaman 2 will flop. The only way this movie makes money if it‚Äôs allowed in movie houses in China. Aquaman made about 60% of their money in china. 

The producer shows he does not fear the movie revenue from the free country box office as he is expecting the box office revenue in China to make the movie profitable. 

WB may have miss calculated as China so far has not allowed any American film in. Should China not allow Aquaman 2 in I hope this film flop. We have to talk to our friends and make them aware of why they should boycott Aquaman 2

I also expect Suicide squad 2 to flop as the original one did not do well.",Steve Kass,5,2021-07-30T15:06:47Z
