16,UgwLBOgIupgp2imDoaV4AaABAg,"I mean i can sympathize with you guys here on wanting to kick her off, but this is exactly what the media is doing with everyone else that we don't agree with aka their ""cancel culture"", personally, I feel a reduced role would be fair plus it will be harder for her to get future jobs (justified or not that's the job you sign up for when you go into mainstream entertainment). We need to remember, these are peoples' careers on the line. I don't think all the work they have put in should be completely ""canceled"" due to mistakes they made in a private relationship. I don't think her public career should be influenced by her private relationship. Just my 2 cents.

33,UgyAtv6fOUSXrMH4gJJ4AaABAg,"As much as I hope she serves years behind bars and has her career damaged as he has, I hate some of the mindset people have towards a movie franchise. If she has already filmed her scenes, then it should be left alone. I don't care about her or want to see her make money from the film but I do care about the film. When you say things like ""I hope they remove her all together"" or ""just recast her, its not a big deal. They recast people all the time"" That infuriates me. It IS a big deal. Everytime they recast a role in an already established franchise it ruins the continuity, detaches you from the film, and removes your immersion. Take the mcu for example. One of the best movie franchises of all time; yet eveytime Don Cheedle aka: War Machine is on screen, I immediately get reminded: Oh hey, yea that used to be Terrance Howard in Iron Man 1. Not to say Don isn't doing a fantastic job but it still ruins the immersion. It is much worse in situations where there is more than one film, such as the Mummy 3. Moving on from recasting to removing her entirely/reducing her screen time. Making a change such as this is also bad as it will modify the director and writer's original vision which can/will ultimately make the movie suffer and be worse because of it. Now don't get me wrong I am not defending her. She should go to jail and have her image ruined, just as she ruined his. I am however defending the movie. I just want people to think about how doing those things will hurt the film/franchise before saying ""remove/recast her, its no big deal"" Because it is for those who really enjoyed the first film and look forward to the sequel.",DiabloBlade Gaming,0,2020-04-12T19:22:55Z

574,UgwrSt40W_vLEAA9Tmp4AaABAg,"Having documentation only helps a little with cases like this. In reality, tons of guys have had a lot of proof that women were lying and falsely accusing them -- even with video, recorded evidence, and even text messages of consent -- of sexual violence and the like. The real reason that Depp is being listened to is because he has an army of fangirls. People actually like Depp; that's why people are at all skeptical. If she made the same accusations against someone like Harvey Weinstein -- someone that no one likes --, then no one would have believed him, regardless of any evidence he had to the contrary. Unfortunately, it's getting to the point where a man's due process rights hinge on whether or not women like him and are willing to be at all skeptical. Granted, it's unsurprising given that women interpret what would normally be seen as abusive behaviors as ""sexy"" when the guy is actually attractive and wealthy, but ""creepy"" when it's someone who is not. It's not surprising that this same thought process governs how we view whether or not a man deserves due process or not and either assume or don't assume guilt.",latt.qcd92,0,2020-03-30T19:50:23Z
