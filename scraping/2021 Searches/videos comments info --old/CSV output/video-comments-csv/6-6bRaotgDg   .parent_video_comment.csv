Years from now after she's been through the gutter for a couple of decades, been poor, on drugs and alcohol, and bashed on by every agency and journalist from America to Europe, and been humbled A-LOT . . . I would be able to accept seeing her in a big title film again. If that all seems like alot, even though RDJr. wasn't a spouse abuser, he only really abused himself terribly and the media was pretty harsh, remember . .  he was out of a healthy life for almost two decades, and alot of people bashed him up when he was announced as Iron Man and Tony Stark, and I remember this well because I was one of the doubters, burning him in effigy for it. But that first Iron Man made me believe in heroes again, and seeing him make good on his life with the public made me personally happy, because he's kept it real clean and related to his role with responsibility, especially towards children. The Chris Reeve approach to a role like that is very important, because for every hero on screen, there's thousands of kids the world over, standing on the sidelines holding a related product in their small grip, and the starlight of hope in their eyes. I really like Amber Heard as Mera, accent or no accent, and I hope she somehow hears something along the lines of what I just said, from somebody, SOMEWHERE. I hope she changes and becomes a better, truthful person.

185,UgxrlgKPoWrchvlwx_R4AaABAg,"Imagine, humor me, if Amber was a guy. Imagine if Depp was a girl. 
So the guy cuts his wifes finger off, stages abuse claims and is caught lying, puts make up on his face to claim he was beat and is caught lying.  Outcome: jail.
but when its a woman doing those things. Its still the guys fault. 

Im an old school feminist. As in I believe in equality. I believe if I do something, a woman should be able to do it. And vise-versa. I believe the punishment should be equal too. For example if a woman back hand slaps me, she should be done for assault. Its equality. Thats what feminism is. Equality. But we dont have that. We have, in some respects, female supremacy. Where, for example, police will attend a complaint about domestic abuse and instantly take the womans side. And when they find out the male is the victim, will laugh at them and tell the guy to sort himself out and grow a pair. I myself have had such an encounter when police were called out to an argument where a lady in the house actually was breaking stuff and the cop said ""Son, who do you think we're gonna believe? You or the woman? you need to grow a pair."" So seeing how Amber is instantly believed because she is a woman, and Depp in a man so is guilty, really urkes me 

And because i said im a feminist, i gotta explain one thing. Im not one of these purple haired modern day ones yelling for equality in the street or smashing down statues. The modern ones are a bunch of attention seeking trend-hoppers. I practice what I believe in every day. I'll hold a door open for a woman, who doesnt? But I also expect the same from a woman infront of me to hold it if she sees me (and some actually do), i also hold doors for guys as well, of course. I was raised by old school grandparents who were more into the old way of life.

We as fans of DC do not care about her temporary appearance cause we respect that comic book characters first & foremost. We are not like the MCU fans(not the marvel comics fans), who never read & comics in their lives & only know these characters through these movies & the actors that play them. Trust me, every self respecting, hard core Marvel comics fan out there, do not like atleast 80% of the changes Disney/Marvel Studios made to these iconic characters. But that is s topic for another day.
So yeah, no DC fan who fought for this movie cared about Amber Heard enough to stop watching the movie because of her. We take the good with the bad.

353,Ugw6ny88Smf2hxYhJ_x4AaABAg,Comparing RDJ to Amber Heard is a false equivalence. RDJ had a drug problem. Amber admitted to hitting Depp on video and is very suspicious in this case. Should we give Harvey Weinstein another chance too? Yeah he did some stuff wrong in his private life but RDJ got a second chance. See my point? Where does it end? There is a huge difference between abuse and drugs.,Cinematastic,37,2021-04-01T16:41:59Z

I dont think she deserves a second chance, she hasn't told the truth, shes let the uk courts stick to its judgement on JD being a 'wife beater' she has destroyed his life and marred his career, so now shes done that she thinks the word sorry will suffice, when she stands up and says I lied I am an abuser then maybe just maybe!!!!!",mrs rimskie,53,2021-04-01T16:40:22Z
