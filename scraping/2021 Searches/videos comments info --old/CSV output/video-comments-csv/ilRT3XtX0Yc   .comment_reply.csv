I think they forgot what happened after Game of Thrones and what fan outrage does to people. When people stop supporting them, stop watching their shows and movies, because of her - they‚Äôll suddenly remember Dumb and Dumber‚Äôs decline and do what HBO did. Cut ties and go into double time, trying to make up for their mistake. Too bad for them they don‚Äôt have things lined up for that. Like HBO was intelligent enough to have. House of the Dragon is pretty HUGE on hype so far. They also have the ability to snag Clarke for more roles. The mere mention of Emilia sends tsunamis, WB doesn‚Äôt have that card, or George R. R. Martin. Watching them sink over this should be hilarious. üòÇ",2021-03-11T17:33:14Z,0

7,UgzspokGJfGphKsVl-F4AaABAg,Viral Flash,I guess no one will watch aquaman 2 if she is in it. Hope Warner Bros won't fuck this up. They did hear to the fans about Justice League and made the Zack Snyder Cut. So they should hear to the fans once again and fire Amber Heard from that movie!,2021-03-05T16:39:36Z,0
