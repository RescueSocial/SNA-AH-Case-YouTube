100,Ugw9ZaPiaeYDb4yILaB4AaABAg,michelle annor,"I do agree with LGBT+ being ueber trendy and a way to market yourself. Straight = boring and basic (straight TikTok is constantly derided as dull, uncool, unimaginative and cringey)

However, I do think one of the main reasons why more and more women are LGBT especially bi as opposed to straight is hypergamy.

Women themselves have become wealthier and can pursue similar careers to men. This in turn will attract women, as other women can now be CEOs, earn gender parity in tennis and some sports, serve in army,  be entrepreneurs, film producers, in UK head of fire service and Met police force - both women. 

Women can be equally brave eg firefighters, formerly a trad male role. Women find bravery attractive 😍 and they can now find these ""macho"" qualities in females.

Also women's sexuality is a lot more fluid. One minute your loyal wife is by your side, the next she is sleeping with your gay sister who recently won the $700m Mega Millions jackpot 😆 😄",2020-10-11T06:56:21Z,1

111,UgxAuZ6S_i0BVCemm7d4AaABAg,michelle annor,"@The Unveileress Reginae Caeli  Oh sorry ! 😞 😞 

I remember all those Amber Heard books as I'd read them. Initially was impressed this Hollywood starlet seemed not to be vapid. But I kept reading similar interviews pre- Depp 2005- 2009 referring to books and how she was different. It came off as if she was trying to not seem like a bimbo. A schtick. Like how Cameron Diaz used to go on about eating greasy burgers or Jennifer Lawrence falls over and farts to be relatable. 

The book talk started when Heard did the Mandy Lane movie and she didn't want to be compared to the sex symbol of late 2000s Megan Fox.",2020-10-11T08:39:33Z,0
112,UgxAuZ6S_i0BVCemm7d4AaABAg,The Unveileress Reginae Caeli,"@michelle annor ugh that hag. I have a ring that was designed and named after this book by an amazing metaphysical jeweler called ka gold jewelry. Its called the bulgakov ring. So, this means quite a lot to me. Just knowing this about her now makes it feels tainted LOL",2020-10-11T08:32:34Z,0
113,UgxAuZ6S_i0BVCemm7d4AaABAg,michelle annor,@The Unveileress Reginae Caeli actually Heard might have read it. At that time there was talk of Depp adapting the book into a movie (good luck with that). She probably read it to impress Depp before filming The Rum Diaries 😉😜  😜 😘,2020-10-11T07:37:50Z,1

115,UgxAuZ6S_i0BVCemm7d4AaABAg,michelle annor,"TBF she's fully aware that her only asset is her looks. She has always had a love hate relationship with this fact. She always did raunchy photo shoots but then in the accompanying interview she would make sure the magazine acknowledged the ""intellectual "" book she just happened to be reading 📚 📚 😄 😀 📖 📕 📘 📗 📓 . 

She did several pre-Depp interviews in UK when she just happened to be caught reading ""The Master and the Margarita"" by Mikhail Bulgakov, Anais Nin's ""Under a Glass Bell"",  Gore Vidal's ""Burr"" and Ayn Rand' ""Anthem"". It was as if she was trying to say ""I'm not like all the other Hollywood blonds...I read""  😆 😂 🤣 😅 She sure as hell wanted to give off the vibe she was cerebrally above all the glam photo shoots , but she still happily posed in her bra.",2020-10-11T06:39:36Z,0
