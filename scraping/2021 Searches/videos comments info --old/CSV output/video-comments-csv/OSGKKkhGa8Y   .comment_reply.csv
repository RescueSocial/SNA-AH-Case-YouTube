""There are audio recordings of her admitting to beating him""

Which were dismissed as Depp was manipulating her.

""Johnny is not the abuser here.""

He is according to 2 trials as he beat Amber on 12 different occasions.

""You clearly haven‚Äôt been following this case because there is mountains of evidence incriminating AH""

Except there wasn't, which is why Depp lost this case twice because he beat Amber on 12 different occasions.

""including the evidence that she didn‚Äôt donate her settlement to charity""

Because Depp sued her. 

""the fact that she didn‚Äôt means her claim of not being a gold digger is invalid""

Unless she donates it after all the lawsuits with Depp.

""now this body can footage proves she(and her friends) lied about the penthouse being trashed during their ‚Äòfight‚Äô.""

There were photos showing the damage to the penthouse. Unless these cameras covered those areas they prove nothing.

""Funny, we could say the same about the testimonies of Amber‚Äôs exes saying she was abusive towards them""

Except they didn't testify that during these trials. 

""I‚Äôm pretty sure the one with a prior record of abuse is less credible than the one with his exes saying he wasn‚Äôt abusive.""

During the trial they also mentioned 4 times Deep was publically violent before marrying Amber.
 
""I‚Äôve already listed at least two times where she perjured herself.""

Your inability to understand the facts isn't perjury.

""You mean the testimonies of her friends?""

And Depp's doctor. And the photographic evidence. And the police.

""Depp had Amber‚Äôs own PARENTS side with him.""

Before they knew he beat her on 12 different occasions.

""Her exes said she was abusive""

Actually they didn't.

""his exes said he wasn‚Äôt""

So what.

""he has audio recordings of her admitting to beating him""

Which were dismissed as Depp was manipulating her.

""there‚Äôs evidence proving she lied in court""

Your delusions are not facts.

""the list goes on.""

No it doesn't, which is why Depp lost 2 court cases and will lose the 3rd one in the USA.

""We‚Äôre talking about serious stuff here.""

No you're just having a circlejerk over the same few things while ignoring the mountains of evidence that show Depp is guilty. That's why you're incapable of talking about any of the 12 different occasions when Depp beat Amber.",2021-04-21T14:53:10Z,0

55,UgwDOQnJzQRpUp_swQl4AaABAg,Snuggle Struggle,"@Theia_Loki It's also how Democrats retain power, because people who see the system is already faulty due to the many loopholes available, if they take measures into their own hands (which negates their argument entirely because they are acting directly against their ideology) Democrats use it to further their race baiting and collective outrage and force even more oppressive policy and regulations.  The people must introduce measures that they want our leaders presenting for the people here on out, because the only people currently whispering in the ears of our leaders are these mega corporations who time and time again offer them to go on vacation on their expense if they vote a certain way, gain massive stock options if they are to push something that directly harms the constituents or allows our courts to read something nefariously to allow negligence to take place.  

People need to fight by calling their state level leaders and even push their own policy into the courts, acting like BLM and Antifa means the whole system is unfixable and we only encourage Dems to push ""The Great Reset"" where we'll all ""own nothing and like it...""  So we must remain the adults in the room and push policy ourselves, while also demanding our leaders do something about the terrorists in the streets while they clean up the blatant double standards in the court rooms.  We must do something to remind those officials in these courts that they are not above the laws too, nor are they allowed to interpret as they see fit to give a faulty verdict out of spite or malice towards one party, so that they treat man and woman the same as given by law, not giving women special privileges and protections even after shown to perjure themselves and has shown malice towards the opposing male.  Amber Turd is a great example of how to clean up the courts.  Any judge who believes the same as the UK judge should be removed from power and stripped of their titles indefinitely, as it's clear that Turd wronged Depp out of malice and that UK judge didn't care one iota.",2021-04-19T15:30:18Z,2

I will though admit I can't hate Henry Cavill. He's so happy and wholesome, and you kind of know that even if he was fired from everything, he would still be living a happy wholesome life just painting his warhammer figures and be happy and wholesome and be like.

Oh only ""pathetic incels are talking about the footage""... Yeah I don't think it's me that's ""butt hurt""
It contradicted her WHOLE statement. It shows she, josh and rocky are liars.
If you read the witness statements depositions and court documents... I mean hell you can just watch a five minute video on what they actually said.... It does not match that footage meaning she lied...
