0,UgzTzOyyUGujcjydIu54AaABAg,best djaf,"AH was not only abusing Johnny Depp, she was abusing everyone.
Read what AH assistant is saying.
She said that AH didn't pay her & abused her too.
And Johnny was always sweet and nice.
He taught her son to play guitar & always would bring the presents for her son.
And she wasn't even working for him.

Everyone around them is saying how sweet Johnny is, and how obnoxious & abusive Amber is.",2020-05-29T11:00:06Z,2

2,UgypkKurPHfuNUSLOwV4AaABAg,Rose Harvey,"Amber has said on tape she started physical fights and could not promise not to do so in the future. She called Johnny names for leaving when things were going to get physical. She told him no one would believe him. When he said he was done, she filed for divorce first and accused him of DV. 
Until he decided to defend himself, she was writing op-eds and making speeches about surviving DV, he was losing work and his reputation was in tatters. She could do and say what she wanted and was held up as a woman fighting for all women and all DV victims. 
But the evidence does not support her narrative, not only is she not a victim she is the abuser. Maybe you have updated your view, now the evidence is out there and readily available.",2020-12-29T04:03:28Z,1
3,UgypkKurPHfuNUSLOwV4AaABAg,Trauma Talk,"Hey there Yasmine! You raise really good questions and points. The reason that I'm speaking on this issue from the perspective I am is that I've heard multiple recordings of her being very verbally abusive, saying she intentionally started things to hit him, admitted to hitting him while belittling him, etc. However, I was not in their relationship so I obviously cannot conclusively say anything. But from what I did hear myself - she has absolutely been extraordinarily abusive towards him. That's not to say abuse didn't exist from him - but rather, that Loreal is putting her up as a role model as someone who has very clearly committed really awful things.",2020-05-29T20:09:45Z,2

This institution knowingly supports Heard and puts her in a pedestal as an inspirational Wahmen. NO. she's discrediting women and men.
5Why makes a point
yeah the metoo movement is hypocritical for its blue wall of silence (blue wall of silence is a real concept, it's gaining traction in the Floyd murder context)
it only attacks when male are allgedly or proven to be abusers, but never when women weaponize that stigma that society has against men
Depp didn't deserve the scrutiny he got, and justice is unwilling and silent to reestablish his character",2020-05-27T17:18:40Z,1
