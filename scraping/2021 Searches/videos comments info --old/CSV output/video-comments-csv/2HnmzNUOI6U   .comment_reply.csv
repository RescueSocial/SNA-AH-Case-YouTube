0,UgxSEYgo6M2iwAKrBN94AaABAg,TracyTriesStuff,"The Hollywood Reporter has wrote several hit pieces on Johnny Depp while practically sainting Amber Heard. They are part of her PR machine. Andy Signore, who has reliable inside sources, has said that he has been hearing that she is already gone. She is uninsurable because all the controversy and the risk something else that is damaging could drop in the future. He said the part that was untrue is that Emilia replaced her. That is a rumor at this point. AH being fired is technically a rumor, but it is one that he said has been confirmed by a source but he is trying to get confirmation from other sources to officially announce it. My own opinion is that if Amber had any current projects or any projects on the horizon she would not be in her current shape. The fact she's ""let herself go"" adds credence to the likelihood she was already fired. All her lies are catching up to her and her PR machine can't spin their way out of it.",2021-03-02T04:12:09Z,0

All her exes say she's violent and all of johnny's say he was kind & generous! She couldn't pay a private investigator to find a single person with ever had a negative experience with Johnny depp. She thinks because she's beautiful that she can bat get eyelashes and destroy his entire life...

20,UgwbdWUwKOJSMYdGgm54AaABAg,Angela Baird,"YES!!!! This is what these pathetic clout chasers who are not victims in any sense of the definition are not realizing!!! Is how very much they are hurting real victims.   It‚Äôs very sad because historically it has always been hard for victims to come out.  Then we get a movement designed to make it safer and more credible. Almost immediately clout chasers and attention seekers over saturate with fake victim hood and now its going straight back to where it was. Maybe even worse. Because no one can hardly even say ‚Äúthe me too‚Äù movement anymore without getting eye rolls and sighs.    
It‚Äôs really tragic what these attention seekers have done.   
This is getting so out of hand. Now a GROWN ADULT MAN who willingly sent pics and flirted with JC, actually expects us to accept a narrative that he has been victimized in ANY WAY!?!? No you have NOT, sir Dumb Ass!!!! Jeeeeeeeesh.  I actually hate society at this moment.  
People are even saying it‚Äôs wrong because he was a fan.  Soooooo, celebrity‚Äôs dating pool has now got to be minimized to them ONLY dating other celebrities of their same EXACT status. Because according to that rule, a bigger celebrity than James can‚Äôt date James because that‚Äôs an uneven power dynamic now and that‚Äôd turn James to the victim. It‚Äôs just so damn illogical.   
I get that maybe Jame‚Äôs behavior is showing a pattern and is weird and maybe pathetic for him to be always going for his fans. BUT it‚Äôs NOT A CRIME!!!!! And this GROWN MAN is not a victim!!! And being weird or even creepy or pathetic is not a crime.  Even if James has a fetish about doing stuff with a fan, he isn‚Äôt doing it non consensually in this scenario so why kink-shame someone if that‚Äôs what it is.  The man clearly conscented and despite what this ridiculous PC culture wants people to believe, you CANNOT consent in the moment and then decide LATER that you DIDNT CONSENT!  Can you imagine how full the courts would be if someone could later revoke consent. I mean CMON!!! That‚Äôs not how any of this works!!! So STOP IT people.  Are society is going NUTS!!

24,UgyVbpXkiBBn6oNN8j14AaABAg,BreakofDawn,"@Gracelyn Chatt no, Amber was the only abusive one. JD has a laundry list of documented evidence against her abuse, while she only has fabricated evidence. 
- she admitted on tape to hitting him, and that when their fights got physical he always walked away. When JD begged her to stop getting physical, she said she couldn‚Äôt promise that. 
- there were witnesses to when she severed his finger with a bottle she threw at him and burned his face with a cigarette bud
- she caused him to sleep in the bathroom on a flight because of how abusive she was and flight staff witnessed this. 
- she claimed one of her beatings happened when he wasn‚Äôt even in the same country as her. One of the times she claimed she was beaten, her own stylist who saw her the next day testified she had absolutely no markings on her face. 
- she stole her own assistant‚Äôs rpe story and tried to pass it off as her own
- she paid off her sister to lie under oath, to say that‚ÄúJD beat them both‚Äù in one incident, but her own sister‚Äôs employer came out and said that was a lie because her sister was always scared of Amber and thought she was going to kill JD and said her sister got kicked out of the house by Amber cuz she tried to protect JD. 
- she‚Äôs committed perjury multiple times. One time in Australia when they found evidence of her trying to ‚Äúgrease a vet‚Äù to say her dogs were okay to enter the country. And when she got caught she blamed her assistant. The other time is when she said she donated all of the $7mill JD gave her to donate to CHLA and ACLU. Turns out she donated nothing from that, as confirmed by CHLA
- JD has multiple witnessed from LAPD, staff, medical staff, friends, neighbors who testified that either she was lying about her abuse or has witnessed him getting abused. The only witnesses who have seen anything happen to Amber are herself and her friends, who I might add have been shown to be liars themselves and are currently trying to dodge subpoenas from JD‚Äôs lawyers. 
- Amber was arrested for dv in her past relationship, while all of JD‚Äôs exes have come out to support him. 
I could go on and on about the horrendous things she did to JD. It‚Äôs just so unfortunate his abuse isn‚Äôt taken seriously or he somehow also must of been in the wrong just because he‚Äôs a man",2021-03-02T01:55:18Z,0

Not only does she need tp fit into a skin tight costume, but she also needs to perform several physical stunts that a stunt person is not needed for. If she can't meet those conditions than they would have no choice but to fire her. I agree she should be fired for being an abuser who lied about donating millions to sick and dieing children, but WB doesn't want the negative publicity of her pretending to be a DV victim that was fired for speaking out against her alleged abuser. I think they are underestimating how calculated she is.

74,UgwLBDXjSJZwEwgG7tB4AaABAg,Kr H,"@Sv Vr because if she gained, and I quote ""a little weight"", then she could have just lost it. If Henry Caville got a little chunky, he'd be told to slim down. Recasting an entirely different actor just because someone put on some pounds is actually a hassle and it's just easier to stick with the actor you have. Saying that she got fired because she got fat is an insult to Depp, domestic assault victims of all genders, and women who have an unfair level of scrutany placed on their bodies.",2021-03-01T22:39:54Z,0

76,UgwLBDXjSJZwEwgG7tB4AaABAg,elusive,"@Sv Vr I am not sure if you are aware, but body standards for men in film are ridiculous and set a dangerous precedent just like ""thin"" actress weight limits. 

Like ""Fat Henry Cavill"" is preferred to the actual reality where he was expected to not drink water for days beforehand so he could film a scene in a bathtub with an actress in the set of the Witcher. Like no water for three days is what kills people. All to make his muscles ""more defined"". Also Henry Cavill was fat as a kid so it's kinda crass and hurtful to use that as a punch line. 

And this stuff is common practice along with taking steroids to either achieve or maintain a certain look for actors. People will go on for days about actresses starving themselves but not blink an eye at another dorito shaped man. 

A three month turn around from muscle man Batman to the eighty pound Machinist a la Christian Bale is not sustainable and we need to stop accepting that kind of behaviour. We need to embrace the reality of the situation and stop body shaming and embrace body diversity  no matter what gender a person may be. 

If this were any other actor, I'd be upset since weight gain can be explained away in a narrative quite easily. Amber Heard deserved to be fired but this is just a convenient cop out. Like good on the team for finally firing her but it's still a shit way to do so.",2021-03-01T20:49:04Z,0

This guy used that awful situation to reach out to James and slipped in that he was single as well. If he was vulnerable because he was in a toxic relationship (which had nothing to do with James) than wasn't James vulnerable because he was losing everything he worked for and contemplating suicide? Perhaps James was the vulnerable one that got too invested with this guy because at the time his life was falling apart so anyone showing support would probably be welcomed.
