All of her films are B list movies except for The Rum Diary which Johnny himself hired her! her biggest role is in Aquaman which is very medicore at its best.

Depp has audio recordings, pictures of real bruises not those fake bruises amber heard had which were there one day and gone the next and multiple witnesses who back up his claims.

She was supposed to hang out with me that night and ditched me after I did her a bunch of favors. I still had the baby seat in the car so I kept it for a couple days out of spite. She called me trying to get it back and I told her I threw it in the garbage. I didn't steal it, she left it. She didn't want anyone to know we were messing around because she was embarrassed that I am old enough to be her father. Her aunt was an old girlfriend of mine. We are in our thirties. To cause trouble, I revealed the truth to her aunt that I had been sleeping with her niece. Well, her niece denied it and said I raped her. She sent people after me to kill me. Criminals, not police or anything legal, but street thugs who think I am a rapist. On top of that, they call me a pedo because I was with a young girl. She is 18, BTW. Totally legal. I proved my innocence with the texts she sent me asking for sex. That is one circumstance out of MANY more. Eff the metoo movement. Where's my justice?

Something I have been in search for quite sometime is a connection with somebody that goes beyond vanity. It's very hard to do in this day and age. People can be, somewhat very superficial.

On my quest to achieve this I have learnt a lot about human nature. It seems to me that those who are not given traits such as beauty or being wealthy are some of the nicest, kindest and generous people.


While the ""gorgeous"" and well off seem to be the most arrogant and greedy people out there. Of course that's not to say there aren't beautiful kind people out there.

I've been in the process of change for a while now and I have made some decent changes but don't you just hate it when people can't let go of your past mistakes.

I saw your profile and it intrigued me. I wanted to learn more about who you are and what type of path you would like on in life.
