1,UgxD7pigw1UYdlUllxR4AaABAg,"IF he is going to be asked to resign from Warner Bros projects then SHE SHOULD BE REMOVED AS WELL.

If she is allowed to continue to participate in Warner Brothers films then HE should be allowed to fulfill the contract that he had before this got stupid.

They have taken sides to devastate someone with no proof of the accusation and at the same time retained the person who made the accusation but has evidence against her for doing exactly what SHE accused him of doing.

At this point its justice to see her getting fired, especially since its quite likely that she is actually guilty of many crimes including domestic abuse numerous times. The issue in Johnny's case is that he was tarred and feathered before any real evidence was provided of his guilt. Its not as simple as always painting every situation where someone is fire with the same brush, i.e. we didn't want Johnny fired therefore we shouldn't want Amber fired. Because Amber has more or less made it her mission in life to ruin Johnny's lie about donating to charity to make her look good, and again is more than likely responsible for committing domestic abuse against several of her partners with actual evidence to back those accusations up. Johnny's worst action that we have any evidence of? Recording Amber without her knowledge and using drugs. The parallels simply aren't there.

About AH being fired... Yes, she should be fire. You see, it is not because se has some personal issues going on... It is because she has some criminal behavior that can't be ingnored. Let her face the consequences. Besides, there is the fact that she claims herself as an activist. She speaks on behalf the victims of domestic abuse, but hey, it turns out that she is a fraud. This needs to be stopped. This is serious shit. So yes, let the he world see that she is unwanted. So bad, that she was fired, and luckily, never hired again. Honestly, I can't care less.

His reputation took a massive hit and there is an adage that says "" my name is Mudd!"" And it is in response to a man named Mudd who was accused of murder, slandered etc.  When it was proven beyond doubt that he was innocent, the damage had already been done and even with proof of his innocence he was still threatened, accosted, slandered, called a murderer etc for years after.  When someone's reputation is destroyed with false accusations it can be a life long effect.  If its proven he is innocent, she should be jailed for the false accusations and reputation destruction, emotional trauma  and not to mention the money spent proving innocence and court costs, lawyer fees etc.",DaemonTalons,0,2021-02-24T23:33:55Z

I hate cancel culture, nobody should lose work but in the interest of fairness and equality, JD lost his roles, it can't be one rule for him and not for her, it would show bias especially when there is far more negative information and evidence out there against AH, more so than Depp. The UK trial at the end of the day was damaging to both sides.

192,UgwZsK9JPA06N1hiAbV4AaABAg,"I get your point about saying that JD shouldn't have lost his role(s) for being an abuser, therefore AH shouldn't lose her role(s) for being an abuser. However, I can't agree with you as the context of the situations are completely different. JD was accused by his ex-wife 2years(!!!) after their divorce of abusing her throughout their entire relationship. While he did label her a liar by denying that he ever physically abused her, he lost major roles, his reputation in the business, and basically ruined his life - but he did not accuse her of abusing him, although she did. I can understand why, almost any man would find that too embarrassing to admit, they would see it as emasculating. They shouldn't, but most men would. But again, he did not go on the offensive by accusing her of a very real thing. On the other hand, in the case of AH, she waited 2 years to accuse him falsely and try to destroy him. It would be bad enough were she only a vicious liar and it had come out that she had, in fact lied, and JD never abused her. But she didn't just lie, she was nasty and vindictive when SHE was actually the abuser and in so MANY ways, too. It's beyond sickening. So, no, the situations are not the same. If a man  loses his career because he is found and proven to be an abuser, likewise, a woman who is found and proven to be an abuser should also lose her career. Or the reverse if a man is found and proven to be an abuser and does not lose his career, then a woman found and proven to be an abuser should also not lose her career - as you stated. But JD was accused of being an abuser and found to be so, without any proof and lost his career, etc. AH has been proven to be a liar, falsely accusing JD and proven to be the abuser - he didn't accuse her of it and I think we can be assured of the fact that he never would have, either. So yes, she absolutely should lose her career over it. Maybe that might be enough for her to seek the psychiatric help she needs for her mental illness. But as she is also very obviously at the very least a narcissistic personality, who can never accept responsibility for her actions, in fact always sees and portrays herself as the victim, that 'I need psychiatric help' moment will never occur, no matter what consequences she faces for her actions. I was never a huge fan of JD, while I can do nothing but admit that he is extremely talented, many of his roles and in many of his interviews, I found him a little too offbeat, weird, or just not artistically to my tastes. But I have seen enough and very varied work of his to honestly say that he is a really talented actor. I haven't seen any of AH's work, that I am aware of, so couldn't comment on her abilities one way or the other. Based on the video of her testimony when she was being deposed, though, I would have to think not. I myself suffered emotional and verbal abuse in my marriage and I have known people who have been physically abused in theirs and also studied psychology in college. She did not behave like an abused woman in any way. She was rude and condescending to the attorney taking her deposition. She was aggressive and rude with police in a video shown. She hit JD on video, even in what could be perceived as a joking way in the video. Showed an aggressive and possessive attitude towards JD in red carpet videos and also physically aggressive behavior towards other men (co-workers), her father, and other partners in interviews and other videos that are totally inconsistent, the complete opposite type of behavior you would see from a woman who was or is being physically abused by her spouse. So I never believed her claims, but I hadn't thought that she was abusing JD until I heard the audio tapes of her  screaming at him and berating him, admitting to hitting him and calling him a coward and a baby for walking out and ""running away"" after she physically assaulted him or started arguments with him. Not surprised, in hindsight, based on said interviews and her behavior seen in videos, but I hadn't suspected it prior to the audio tapes that proved it and all that has come out since. So I just can't agree with your stance, even though you are certainly entitled to your opinion.",Heather Kempf,0,2021-02-24T06:49:17Z

Otherwise the one side will never stop. Politics has become pop culture. Groups that never would have gotten involved 20 years ago, now take to social media to get involved. At this point I am kind of black pilled on cancel culture. They use it, we use it. Its a tool. We are in the middle of a propaganda war between polar opposite ideologies... being better means nothing if they end up winning.

If a man can be canceled and written off over unsupported and unsubstantiated accusations (or a woman if the roles were reversed) than someone who makes up lies and accusations that are then shown to be utterly false should also need to face that same potential. Heard has had the same accusations made against her by a former partner in the past, but faced no backlash at all. Then the audio recordings come out that make it clear that she was the aggressor and that she mockingly told Depp that no one would believe him because he is a man shows her to have not just been the aggressor, but that she also planned on using public and media manipulation to ruin him.

I have no problem getting rid of someone from a movie when they're a) a criminal and b) are the only thing anyone is talking about and it IS damaging to the brand. Big difference here. If WB had treated her and Depp fairly and said let's see how this shakes out that's one thing. But they destroyed him while propping her up when she's the one at fault and we all know it. It's a disgusting double standard but in this case she's also a criminal so....why are they rewarding her behavior while damning him? If ever there were a time to cancel someone it's for criminal offenses and if they keep her it will damage their brand to more than just a twitter mob.

It's fine to forgive someone who goes out and says something or even a few instances of doing so but then comes out and apologizes for her previous statements, however, this isn't even close to the case, with AH. She not only went public with lies that were meant to destroy his reputation and career, but she has been actively doing it for years, and has never once let on that she had any remorse what so ever, and not only that, but she actively trying to use the legal system to burn him to the ground with these insidious lies. And when certain parties refuse to comply with her outrageous demands, that are also illegal by the way, then she proceeds to sue other parties that have nothing to do with the situation, and she's mindlessly burning her own career to the ground in an effort to destroy JD. These are crimes Dude, and while this whole thig is blowing up in her face she is not once shown any other interest but to continue to try and fool the public and the legal system into convicting an innocent man of crimes that he did not commit. this woman embodies the entire problem with alleged rape cases that are motivated by anything other than the truth!!!! And you want to sit there and say that she shouldn't lose her career and be allowed to still be in movies etc.!?!? Dude, I can say without any doubt, that you would not be saying this if you were in Johnny Depp's shoes right now, you are totally wrong my friend. Mercy is not in order in this case, Justice is appropriate right down to the ground!!!! This has been going on for YEARS!!! The stress and heartache that Johnny went through is to be all for naught? No sir, she is placing herself on the chopping block, and even though she might be facing remorse now, I can guarantee that they are crocodile tears, she's only feeling remorse because she has been found out and is now facing the hardship that she immorally and criminally forced upon him, out of spite and anger and jealousy! This woman is the worst kind of criminal she does attack your business or your property, she isn't trying to steal his fortunes or anything of the like, no she's after how people see you, to make it so you can't even show your face in public! and you want to let her off the hook??? I think not, and it is this kind of attitude from a grown man that makes me sad. because you are al too ready to let her off the hook because she has made a public appearance saying how she is facing backlash from her absolutely evil behavior. Too bad bitch. She made this bed she is now sleeping in, and she would have definitely been were warned by all of her lawyers that doing this would cause her problems in the not so distant future! even if she were to drop the case now, she is in too much hot water for this to not come back and bite her hard. And let me make this abundantly clear, I was married to a psycho woman like this, and if she were to be let off the hook from this she would just do it again. it wouldn't matter if nobody believed her, she would try again, it is the nature of the personality disorder she has. So No way in hell should he be let off for her criminal attempt to publicly destroy an innocent man!  The woman deserves every harsh punishment she gets because it is the only way people like her will learn not to do something like that again. they are as thick and dense to lessons like this as the M1 Abrams tank armor is to small arms fire. I can only say one thing. Let the Punishment fit the crime! And quite honestly, this is forcing me to consider unsubscribing to your channel, because of these Statements, that is how passionate I am about this, because I have lived through this kind of treatment and to a certain degree, I still am. Trust me when I say that this kind of thing is every man's worst nightmare, and you want to let her off! This makes me very angry, and I think that you should start considering the horrible damage she and a lot of other women have done to innocent men, destroyed their lives! This woman is the very first to actually face a negative feedback for her evil actions, where so many have not. This is a very hot topic for many men, women who do this kind of thing need to be punished and punished HARD for this, there needs to be laws that punish false accusations of this kind of nature, and it needs to be enforced just as harshly as a man who is guilty of rape is punished because this is even worse than that act, and women think that this gives them power over men, all they have to do is threaten men with a false accusation, and then they can blackmail them into doing what they want them to do. how is this NOT a crime? How is it that it has never been addressed in the court system up until the twenty first century?!?!?!? Time that the Equality goes both ways and for women to face the music for their actions, your opinion, would propagate the problem rather than addressing it. SHe would do it again if left alone and not punished. All I can say is that I'm glad that you aren't in charge of making those decisions!! You should have thought this completely through to the conclusion before telling us that we need to stop cancelling her. Hell no! She's going to be a harsh warning to any woman who thinks they can perjure themselves in a court and try to use the legal system to punish those who dare to speak out against her, this woman hasn't learned a damnable thing yet!!!!",Oculus Angelicus,0,2021-02-23T23:04:03Z

456,UgzXXO3RwLjeG-t6ZIR4AaABAg,What might be interesting is still bring Emilia Clarke in and have either her or Heard as Siren. Heard has said (from what I recall) to have interest in playing a villain. As Mera's twin sister who also pretends to be Mera (Going off of DC Legends üòÖ) it could work for sidelining Heard or just having Clarke in which may have lead to the mistake of the writer thinking she was signed on to replace Heard because of what's going on when she might be Siren. Probably wouldn't make sense if Heard is Siren since she helped him in Justice League and Aquaman but could possibly get it to work. I don't know just speculation. Just will have to see what happens. Could also be used as why Heard has less of a role as Clarke could be spending the movie pretending to be Mira so she can trick Aquaman.,The_ Shortski,0,2021-02-23T20:39:06Z

However, if this does end up true, I wouldn't be very shocked either. It seems that one of the narratives that the media wants to push is that JD and AH were both equally abusive to each other (which we know isn't the case). To me, it seems like because of all the bad PR Warner Bros received from firing JD, Warner Bros wants to go from the narrative that JD is the sole abuser to that both were equally abusive. So if this report is true, and Emilia Clarke does replace AH, then WB will see it as an accomplishment, as they'll see it as the controversy not being their problem anymore. Only problem for them with this plan, is that the public knows the truth. JD may have been on a lot of drugs, but he never actually absued AH. She actually abused him, verbally,physically, and mentally. So this ""equally abusive"" narrative isn't gonna work with us. So the general public is still gonna be happy that AH is gone, but also still gonna be pissed that JD is still gone aswell.

This does mean that sex offender like Weinstein should indeed get fired if it's just sexual harrasment, if either Johnny or Amber actually was an abusive spouse that person should also get fired. However in the case of those two you've got at the very least two people that both did bad things but from the evidence I've seen it looked alot worse for Amber who physiclly attacked him.
