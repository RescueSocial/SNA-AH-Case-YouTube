As for the Elon Musk sperm thing, that is just the most ridiculous thing I’ve heard in a long time and it is pretty clear she broke Elon’s heart. You guys keep trying to create this separate version of reality but in the real world of facts and logic, as complicated as this case may be, Amber has already been legally validated and has witnesses on her side. You can clearly see the texts going back years between her and her friends and her and her mother regarding the abuse. There is only one route his legal team can take. They need to make the court doubt the witnesses. They need to pretend the bruises are makeup, etc. But so far none of that has worked and it probably won’t. Johnny should’ve stopped while he was ahead and Amber had dropped the request for a restraining order and he didn’t have to face criminal charges. Now he’s created a situation where he will just discredit himself even more and look vengeful and spiteful. He is demonstrating exactly what a jealous, angry partner in a position of power would do in a situation like this. Johnny needs to step back and re evaluate his life and take responsibility. His most delusional fans are going to defend him no matter what but they are easy to manipulate. The legal system isn’t.",2021-03-22T20:12:26Z,0

1) ah DID ask for spousal support, $50k per month and got denied. In response her PR team came up with this DV story and sent JD and extortion letter, threatening to go public with the story, and again he refused and the rest is history. 
2) I agree that AH is not very good at gold digging, the idea is to get along with your spouse to continue the flow of cash... but she's not good at a lot of things, such as telling the truth, acting, and being a decent person.
3) Elon musk dumped HER, and now they are in a legal battle against each other because she has his sperm and has been threatening to impregnate herself and he has been trying to legally stop her. I.e. she is blackmailing him. 

Please feel free to do your research before you respond in future. 

I am all for empowered women who have careers and fulfilling sex lives. What I do NOT condone is abuse, extortion, manipulation of others. She is a bad person who is actively trying to ruin/discredit MULTIPLE people. LAPD, the people behind real twitter accounts against her, her previous employees, just to name a few ASIDE from JD who this is mostly about.

Whether you approve of the narrative or not, AH is so desperate to get laid that she even hit on their mechanic, who then reported her for sexual harassment.

Jesus did not come to be served, but to serve. Mathew 20: 28. We are no different. This entire life is a representation of the spiritual warfare going on. Good vs evil. God isn't a flying man in the sky, but the actual representation of Love, Hope, Joy, Peace, Light, etc. Not metaphor, but literally, like an extra demintional wavelength of thought, emotions, and intent. The devil is the opposite wavelength, pain, fear, hate, anger, darkness, etc. Human life is serving one of these two. Not a man in the sky, actual sentient collective universal Love. However, humans are primatives, we make mistakes. It's in our nature, since the fall, to go down the wrong path. This means at some time each one of us has served darkness to some degree. God understands our limited understanding of our own actions, so he gave us forgiveness, though sacrificing himself in human form as Jesus Christ. It is our duty to accept that sacrifice, get the forgiveness, and be better, helping others be better, and spreading this wavelength of Love, Hope, Joy, Peace, Light, etc, thoughout the universe. But God had to make a way for us to get to this place spiritually, this is why evidence is not allowed. Evidence will make you believe, using the fear of absolute punishment to change your behavior, but that won't make you better, just scared. Faith makes you better. It is what redeemes us, not our works. Faith is the hope that things get better, that justice always prevails, that we're at least loved by our creator. But it has to be Faith in Jesus, because of his sacrifice. And there can't be evidence to point us to him, because Love had to be fair. If there were a code in our DNA, what about everyone born before genetic sequencing? If there were a book with the solar system thosands of years ago, what would stop an evil person from hiding/destroying it? If it were something you had to go to, what about the geographically isolated, imprisoned, or enslaved. If it were a train of logic, what about the uneducated, or mentally slow? Not to mention all the people born before schools. Love cannot give to one without giving to the other. So the key to salvation had to be something everyone has access to. The only thing is Faith. This is why God puts it upon your heart to learn about these things, even if it's only to criticize, or hate. God is everywhere, because Love is everywhere, and so is the devil, because hate is everywhere. They're in your head all the time, regardless of weather or not you accept that. They whisper inside your heart, giving you ideas. But more than that, they're inside everyone's heart. This is how they get things done. They corrordanate us like pieces on a chess board. The only difference is, we get to chose who's side we're playing for. At the end of our life, we go to that team's home base, Heaven, or Hell. A place where all that exists is those wavelengths. Hate, pain, anger, fear, darkness; or Love, Hope, Joy, Peace, Pleasure, Light. The choice is yours to make. But you cannot go to Heaven with hate in your heart. You must forgive, repent, and spread joy for those around you. These are sentient eternal controlling forces in our universe. Heaven and Hell are very real places, I've seen them. Those steps prime your soul for a meeting with God. Very literally. Once you've done all four, in that order, you get divine revelation, with all the evidence you'll ever need. They are, forgive your parents, brake down before Jesus, ask for forgiveness, and read the Bible. Step four takes three books to get the revelation. I recommend Genesis, Mathew, and then either Luke, Psalms, or proverbs. The order of the steps is important, step 1 has to come before step 3.

They reached a settlement because she was so aggressively pursuing assault charges that he just said let her have what she wants in the divorce so it can all be over and his lawyer suggested an NDA in agreement to settle because they knew she wanted to defame his reputation without any evidence. There’s audio of this exact conversation where this is said by him. She broke the NDA a multitude of times over and over again in so many interviews in an attempt to paint herself a domestic abuse victim when that was not the case at all. She literally got paid not to keep spreading lies and she kept doing it, so he sued her for breach of NDA. You also do realize she was gaslighting him to make him think he was abusive to her when he really wasn’t, right? That’s admitted by her on audio too. These tapes are all available for the public.

Fighting and being destructive due to intoxication is not excusable nor okay, but it’s not the same as manipulating and abusing someone mentally, physically and sexually. Brian has admitted without apology on numerous occasions to threatening people, stalking women, being sexually forceful, fondling underage girls and treating women like sexual toys existing solely for the pleasure of men and some of these things he actually finds funny. He was doing this before fame. He’s been telling his stories for decades, but everyone just thought he was lying for attention and they’re finally taking all of it seriously now that his victims are making official allegations. This is not just rock star behavior. He’s almost killed people before and he’s destroyed people lives. The FBI is investigating him now and he could be in serious trouble.

They whisper inside your heart, giving you ideas. But more than that, they're inside everyone's heart. This is how they get things done. They corrordanate us like pieces on a chess board. The only difference is, we get to chose who's side we're playing for. At the end of our life, we go to that team's home base, Heaven, or Hell. A place where all that exists is those wavelengths. Hate, pain, anger, fear, darkness; or Love, Hope, Joy, Peace, Pleasure, Light. The choice is yours to make. But you cannot go to Heaven with hate in your heart. You must forgive, repent, and spread joy for those around you. These are sentient eternal controlling forces in our universe. Heaven and Hell are very real places, I've seen them. Those steps prime your soul for a meeting with God. Very literally. Once you've done all four, in that order, you get divine revelation, with all the evidence you'll ever need. They are, forgive your parents, brake down before Jesus, ask for forgiveness, and read the Bible. Step four takes three books to get the revelation. I recommend Genesis, Mathew, and then either Luke, Psalms, or proverbs. The order of the steps is important, step 1 has to come before step 3. I can state that for an absolute certainty that these steps always work. Please, take your salvation seriously. See for yourself. Do those steps. Jesus Christ is Lord.

Jesus did not come to be served, but to serve. Mathew 20: 28. We are no different. This entire life is a representation of the spiritual warfare going on. Good vs evil. God isn't a flying man in the sky, but the actual representation of Love, Hope, Joy, Peace, Light, etc. Not metaphor, but literally, like an extra demintional wavelength of thought, emotions, and intent. The devil is the opposite wavelength, pain, fear, hate, anger, darkness, etc. Human life is serving one of these two. Not a man in the sky, actual sentient collective universal Love. However, humans are primatives, we make mistakes. It's in our nature, since the fall, to go down the wrong path. This means at some time each one of us has served darkness to some degree. God understands our limited understanding of our own actions, so he gave us forgiveness, though sacrificing himself in human form as Jesus Christ. It is our duty to accept that sacrifice, get the forgiveness, and be better, helping others be better, and spreading this wavelength of Love, Hope, Joy, Peace, Light, etc, thoughout the universe. But God had to make a way for us to get to this place spiritually, this is why evidence is not allowed. Evidence will make you believe, using the fear of absolute punishment to change your behavior, but that won't make you better, just scared. Faith makes you better. It is what redeemes us, not our works. Faith is the hope that things get better, that justice always prevails, that we're at least loved by our creator. But it has to be Faith in Jesus, because of his sacrifice. And there can't be evidence to point us to him, because Love had to be fair. If there were a code in our DNA, what about everyone born before genetic sequencing? If there were a book with the solar system thosands of years ago, what would stop an evil person from hiding/destroying it? If it were something you had to go to, what about the geographically isolated, imprisoned, or enslaved. If it were a train of logic, what about the uneducated, or mentally slow? Not to mention all the people born before schools. Love cannot give to one without giving to the other. So the key to salvation had to be something everyone has access to. The only thing is Faith. This is why God puts it upon your heart to learn about these things, even if it's only to criticize, or hate.
