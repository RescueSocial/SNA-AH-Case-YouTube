3,UgzBZbWgGMBaNikYvd94AaABAg,I think the UK case was more about protecting the tabloids. They don't want to set a president  that a person might win a defamation lawsuit against the papers. It would open up a pandoras box  and create a shit show. The judge is protecting the tabloids.  Politics. Simple.,maja fučak,0,2021-04-12T22:54:17Z

5,Ugw80pYjnBYRf-b0bP54AaABAg,"The inconsistencies are endless. It's a Trumpian blitz of lies, you'd never be able to correct all of her lies without going insane. Nonetheless, one of the most damning inconsistencies were claiming to have a broken nose, broken ribs, and split lip during a live TV interview and in photographs... and not having any medical records. ""Believe women""... that's not what we meant! 
Further, she straight up stole and co-opted her former assitant's r*pe survival story. Pretty egregious. We need to stop enabling abusers.

And YouTube needs to stop censoring ordinary dissent.",s h a d ø w b a n n e d,0,2021-03-26T10:29:42Z

8,UgwQpr4Pufq2NgaWky94AaABAg,"Here is an explanation of the photos and tex submitted in the UK.  Her legal team did a major dump of requested documents, evidence,  and photos and metadata .  JD team received this trrove of requested stuff. I guess they did a quick look over to see what they got. Rite before the trial putting their case together.  They noticed the documents for the person or persons legally responsible for verifying the metadata basically were not legal. They held no one responsible . JD team upon noticing this brought it to the judge.  The judge said it was to late and to close to trial to question them. They should of done it when they received them. Her lawyers jump rite on this saying they excepted them and there is no time for another verification.  This evidence i bet will be brought up in the US trial.  They will say a judge already excepted them as evidence and this judge should also except them. I don't think it will work but i bet they will try",Skip D,2,2021-03-05T02:44:57Z

14,Ugzo9tt8suIsPb0sIHh4AaABAg,"Hello Colonel Kurtz,

While watching some videos here, I stumbled over a featured video about 'Analysis of Amber Heard'. 'Cos I'm work-related involved in the 'section' of Psychology, I was interested, who that person is. Then I remembered. So it's not about stars or Mr. Depp, but about so called personality-disturbed individuals. After 2 vids I came to your videos (I thought you were a therapist ;) ).
Now that I watched your first video, then the second, I'm really impressed by your objective view on these topic.
The whole time I had Mrs. Spears on my mind. The media chased her, scummed her ..... but ... is there any better example of a personality disorder than Amber Heard ?
Britney Spears, like many other celebs, got under pressure in some way. But they're far away from this caliber.
I watched that Amber Heard and mute the voices. Her plain gesture and facial expression doesn't add up. Making these accusations and sitting in the court-interveiw/hearing, bored and eating that cake or whatsoever.
I admit, I hate injustice and so I'm interested in the end of the story, when finally Amber Heard unmasks herself unwillingly. She made some mistakes already.
I don't like violent people anyway and I know that a lot of men suffer under domestic violence as well, only that they won't talk about it / admit it.
I hope that the truth will come out and justice is being served.
AND: I hope we're seeing more videos of yours, maybe with a complete different topic. >I like your style to view things objective.
Kindly regards Blathnaid.",Blathnaid Ni Bradain,0,2021-02-20T07:30:11Z

16,UgzFt728XlHuniCipzt4AaABAg,"Another bit of a twist on the lack of follow through on the charitable donation pledges she had made.  It is my understanding that, under Cali law, a pledge of a charitable donation creates a contract between the pledgee and the pledgor so, under Cali law, she is in breach of contract with ACLU and CHLA on the charitable donation issue, but it would be up to the charities to bring any action for breach of contract.",L C,2,2021-02-16T14:20:19Z
17,Ugwyze6ZrVyK_VSeHZB4AaABAg,"AH said she did the James Cordon show with two black eyes, a broken nose and a busted lip. Lies lies lies.

18,UgxVe_GSiX5-s3My7TF4AaABAg,"As a British person who's experienced living in the US, I can say that the UK does NOT have a bigger tabloid culture than the US. I think Meghan Markle has tried, successfully, to spread that notion, when it is in fact not the case. Also, a lot of international people seem to follow our Daily Mail online, and this is where they get the idea that we have a 'bigger tabloid culture' when this is simply not true.",Lyna Galliara,2,2021-02-14T10:12:49Z
19,UgyS6wwVVdrazMWxiN54AaABAg,"From the first time she paraded around with that bruise I didnt really believe her.

21,UgzZcSN18EwZfSMBvpJ4AaABAg,"Historically it has been irrational to attribute behaviors to pure attention seeking. Historically victims of abuse have felt like they would be compromised by speaking out, which is a valid reaction to trauma. Yet we are now living in a zeitgeist in which there is an attention economy, and victimization has been deemed a valuable asset, thus granting undeniably positive attention. This is how the reward systems of social media have conditioned us, and we can no longer discount attention seeking as reasonable motive for any claims. 

We are living a postmodern experience while clinging to realist expectations.",Joshua Scott Hotchkin,8,2021-02-11T04:55:51Z
22,UgxLq8VElWnYN7BkC7p4AaABAg,"I m not sure if i get it right, but i look at the UK trial in a bit different way, as far as i know the law suit was against The Sun for printing a nonsense artickle about JD that did demage him. I would think that this isnt like a criminal trial about if the stuff really happend or not as more about if the Sun had the right to print such artickle about JD and if The Sun did demage JD. So basically the tabloids are allowed to temeper with the reality in the way how they use the headlines for example, but they have to back it of by something. I think the Sun argued that they had the testimony of AH and that from her ,,telling,, so not from the evidence, the story sounded possible, because in the past JD was seen as problematical with drugs and destorying a hotel room, so basicaly the Sun didnt just made up a story, they just believed AH and manipulated the headlines , but they can do it. Its not the job or duty of an tabloit paper to investigate what AH said in order to put out an artickle on what she did say. And many people at the beginning believed AH so why would The Sun not print it? I think the judge couldnt decide against the Sun cos they didnt do anything against the law...than again the tabloid and everybody sees it as the victory of AH or that this verdict proves that JD did abuse AH is another story, cos this judge never investigated really if what AH sayed is true, only if the Sun could have taken her word and print what they did print about JD, and they could. Its maybe dirty but thats the dirty part of a celebrity job and every job has a dirty part...ask a nurse...and they are not so well compansated for it as hollywood actors...so i dont feel for them so much pity for that, its a life choice and part of the job for which they are paid nicely...so i dont see here the victory of AH at all....",Alena Malecka,3,2021-02-10T16:35:02Z
23,UgxUbr1NnsAwhFVg_kR4AaABAg,Yikes on AH. She sounds like a bully and a psycho. I don’t know why people are putting up with her. How did her parents even raise her? I just hope Johnny gets the Justice he deserves.,86thislove,4,2021-02-08T14:20:47Z
24,UgxK53Sfc5a55ONaGjJ4AaABAg,"I’ve never understood the whole “it’s LA I always wear makeup because the paparazzi is around.” Isn’t the courthouse where she filed the restraining order in LA? Why didn’t she wear makeup there? There’s definitely bound to be paparazzi there. To show the judge the bruise as evidence? Quick wipe, show the judge and touch up to wear makeup for the paparazzi because it’s so important to do that as she says. But the judge didn’t need all that, pics would’ve sufficed.
