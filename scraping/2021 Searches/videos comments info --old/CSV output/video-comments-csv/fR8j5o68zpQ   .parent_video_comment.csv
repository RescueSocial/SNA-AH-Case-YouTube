I never met her i just heard her & johnny Depp argument n i hope hes ok she shouldn't be hitting on him periodt or disrespecting him but people aren't nice eventhough the petition didnt help i hope she apologizes to mr depp soon

16,Ugx0UQZS6ntpHvTsKmt4AaABAg,People care way too much about John Deep being let go by WB. He got paid handsomely when he agree with WB to leave Fantastic Beast. Stop worrying about him because he is good financially,Rayhaan,3,2021-07-30T18:32:07Z

You want to watch a film good, you don‚Äôt? That‚Äôs fine with them. These petitions and tweets only make the films even more popular and make more money. Happened with Aquaman 1 as well. Guess what? Made a billion.",Giannis MPO,2,2021-07-30T17:18:19Z
