However, that's only so the MCU x-men can still have the prejudiced humans x-men franchises(comics and others) have been known for. Even Hydra was tame, compared to the Nazis. I digress.

Also even if he did defend child murderers (still have no clue what you are on about) doesn't make him a child murderer, defending someone isn't illegal, causing grievous bodily harm however is very illegal and falls under the most strict forms of assault where death isn't the outcome, JD having part of his finger surgically reattached because AH attacked him with a wine bottle is 1. grievous bodily harm 2. assault with a deadly weapon. So for all intents and purposes she should be facing criminal charges for her actions, and that's completely immaterial of what JD supposedly has done.

So many times over the years since he hit it big he's gone to places to have fun with kids with cancer put a smile on their face in their time of need and hung out with poor people Amber's never done that! So please explain how Johnny's a bad guy so what he's dealt with drug problems what Hollywood actor or actress hasn't!? Sometimes when you're really stressed out you do shit like that and if you didn't notice and actually pay attention to the whole story so far he didn't do drugs or drink alcohol too much until he got with her because he was constantly stressed out so she made his drug and alcohol problem worse! She's manipulated plenty of people lied constantly to everyone about everything stole from charity stole from Johnny made up stories got him kicked off a lot of shows and movies that would have been great with him in it he is 10 times greater at being an actor than she is and being a better human than she is! And if this is about the stupid joke about killing Trump me and my boyfriend and plenty of people we've known said the same thing! And he didn't tell anyone to assassinate him he was upset and angry about certain things with the president plenty of people have wished death on people that they regret saying it everyone in the world has said at least once in their life it doesn't mean that they're evil or a bad person! Johnny was tortured for years by Amber and then lost a bunch of jobs and had a bunch of people threaten him when it first broke out because people were on her side but when the truth came out that she was the one abusing him all of a sudden everyone acts like he's still a bad guy you guys are all retarded AF! Shut up already enough is enough!,2021-02-24T04:50:38Z,9

113,UgwgmD2BYcu9VeNcEuF4AaABAg,Gamemediafan 17,@TheSilentBobby to be honest I wouldn't go that far. Thor The Dark World and Captain Marvel are totally forgettable. Aquaman seemed fun.
