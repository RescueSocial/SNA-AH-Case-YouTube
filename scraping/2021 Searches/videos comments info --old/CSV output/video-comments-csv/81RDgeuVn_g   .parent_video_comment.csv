It makes them as guilty as her!!!!",Kendra Manuel,30,2021-05-27T15:17:02Z
15,UgwGbV0CMj8I1HOHrpl4AaABAg,I really hope she doesnâ€™t appear in aqua man 2 she deserves to go to jail for what she did to Johnny and he deserves justice and justice isnâ€™t letting the person that abused Johnny and other people that have been abused to let their abuser roam free in the world that isnâ€™t justice justice is locking the abusers away for a very long time and if she does appear in the new aquaman film Iâ€™m not going to watch it I just hope she goes to jail soon #JusticeforJohnnyDepp,Driggsquad 01,22,2021-05-27T14:56:49Z
