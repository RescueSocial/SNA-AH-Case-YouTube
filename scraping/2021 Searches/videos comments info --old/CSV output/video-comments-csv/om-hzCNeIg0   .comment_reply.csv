It makes you feel good to believe you bought a car that's helping the planet, I guess. How about the technology tesla uses for self driving? It's not even the best technology available! That's what I find very sad. People using the autopilot thinking it's a self driving car and they lose their life or worse kill someone else.",2020-07-03T02:59:27Z,0

105,UgwSWXfiVJnc6iuAZzZ4AaABAg,Nicely Done,"@Sacred Serpents¬Æ‚Ñ¢ exactly! I'm not reading news articles. I looked at court cases and lawsuits that had people present evidence. 

People want to say, ""you dont know that person"" it's not about knowing them. It's about facts. They either did or said something and theres evidence they did it or said it. I judge people on things they say or do. Then that same person in the comments wants to make an assumption that I consume some kind of politically biased media! Well, I guess I'll just use their own words. You dont know me lolüòÜüòú",2020-07-01T00:04:20Z,0
106,UgwSWXfiVJnc6iuAZzZ4AaABAg,Nicely Done,"@herrikudo lol there was a chance for elon to provide a judge video proof of his claims that a man trespassed and tried to run over the employee. Elon musk bluffed until the judge told him to put up or shut up. Dude dont be blind bc you think this guy is going to save the planet. 

Elon musk obviously cant take criticism. He acts like a nasty Karen when people dont praise him or have actual constructive criticism.",2020-06-30T23:57:42Z,0
