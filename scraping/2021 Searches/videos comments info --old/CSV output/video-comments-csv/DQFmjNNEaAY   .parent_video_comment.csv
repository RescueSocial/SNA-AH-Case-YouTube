I like Mera as a character, and I was honestly really disappointed with Heard's portrayal.  I thought she looked cheap, and came across as insincere and shallow.
Add to that the recordings of her interactions with Depp, she's just...awful as a person.  If you're going to keep the role of Mera significant, give it to someone who isn't a goddamn garbage fire.  Call Sophie Turner, or Eleanor Tomlinson, or, hell, Deborah Ann Woll!  Or maybe we can break away from skinny redheads and go for something else?  Olga Kurylenko is familiar with action roles and has amazing presence.  I don't know, just do SOMETHING with the character that doesn't make her feel like Action Figure Ariel ffs.  I know that's asking a lot of Marvel, but come on.",Brecia Bloom,0,2021-03-03T21:40:39Z
