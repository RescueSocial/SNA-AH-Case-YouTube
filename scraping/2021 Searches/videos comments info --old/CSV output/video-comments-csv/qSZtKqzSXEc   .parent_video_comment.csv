1,UgzEVTPj8CtcfepAHJx4AaABAg,"I was taught from a young age that ""Failing to plan was planing to fail"" I've always held this true in my career and its worked everytime. It must have been a priveladge to have served under such a Commander. Down to earth, his men always came first and got the respect of all. Thanks John for yet another great interview. You certainly are joining the dots in so many ways. God Bless you all.",Peter Rossiter,2,2021-08-14T10:41:18Z

6,UgwEiCXolyHXQfXGJZ94AaABAg,"As a Gunner we did do some work with RLI and found them always to be very professional. All Rhodesians can be very proud of their commitment , bravery and national fervour. We salute you.",Alan Townsend,1,2021-08-06T15:51:11Z
7,Ugyt8quDmF1ZuDlk3E54AaABAg,"This is brilliant stuff gents. I just looked into the history of the Alouette III, they stopped production in 1985 but it continued under license in India, Switzerland and Romania under different names. The French Navy only stopped using them in 2017 replacing them with Pumas for the time being. I find that amazing. Do we know why Aerospartial stopped making them in the first place?. It sounds like the toughest heli ever made guys lol. Keep them coming.",MOOSEDOWNUNDER,1,2021-08-03T07:25:07Z

16,Ugztzdfc9VrWdKtw0cF4AaABAg,"Thank you Major Henson for your third talk, the content of which is right up there with your two previous. Again, the clarity that you offer is wonderful, in that the pictures you paint with well chosen words leaves no room for further enhancement. I have learned so much from this channel already. I can only hope that you may provide us with further excellent re-counts of 'the day', Major. Thank you John, Hannes. Take care; God bless.",Tim Rogers,1,2021-08-01T20:21:15Z
17,UgwRwZ9oFCvx_bjHyYV4AaABAg,"I have not heard much about artillery guns. Were any calibers available? Seems like it would have been useful, maybe used similarly as the fire support bases in Vietnam.",Mike Donner,3,2021-08-01T17:55:46Z

20,UgxPF7a4w409Wx2Y_Ql4AaABAg,"Strange that he should say the 303 brownings were unreliable. I used to know an SA tank commander from WW2 who said the lap gun on his sherman on some days going thru Italy would fire until the barrel started to melt and they'd pull out the gun, throw it away, and do the same with a new gun. Also most British aircraft used 303 Brownings because the were so reliable.",umvhu,2,2021-08-01T12:00:28Z
21,UgzPdvU8W78FSnVlOYh4AaABAg,Some info that may be interesting to some. I met and elderly gentleman at my shooting range during the week. We started talking and it became a very interesting chat. He became a widower the previous year and had been in the SAP. Very gentleman type short neat haired officer. He told me that he was one of a few that was chosen to go to to the USA to learn all about COIN OPS. He also spent some time in Vietnam with the Americans. He explained in such detail what they were tought in a very soft but commanding voice and how they applied and improved COIN for South African and its conditions. He spoke with great admiration about the Americans and the logistical scale they could plane and execute operations. Oh yes one thing that stuck to him on his return is the use of a 45ACP pistol in operational use. He said nobody would change his mind in the use and effectiveness in a war.,H S,1,2021-08-01T11:13:42Z

23,UgwWA1pFTwer92ep4dB4AaABAg,With respect Christiaan you are over egging your pudding and your endorsement of Eugene de Kock also speaks volumes   Nevertheless the point you raise perhaps deserves comment from Hannes or from another guest to clarify the record,Fraser Edk,8,2021-08-01T09:49:57Z
24,UgwiQ8YZExBTMSX1es94AaABAg,"Nigel, Have just finished reading the book ""The long Gray Line"" which you mentioned in one of your other interviews ... fascinating reading! Although the resources were vastly different was there anything to be learnt from the American use of choppers in Vietnam especially the work done by the little Loaches?",Hans Hannweg,5,2021-08-01T09:42:09Z
25,UgzH4eqqn4RRFn5Gz3l4AaABAg,"Caves, inside the cave is the enemy, hidden in the dark, outside is the light , inside the cave in the darkness anybody approaching from the outside light can be seen. Instantly. Surely an RPG shot into the cave would have been more effective than a suicide entrance from the light. I cannot understand the Rhodesian soldier thinking he can enter a cave and winning. Just my thoughts.",john smith,2,2021-08-01T09:11:34Z

33,UgxL1QqUuhxDbAZq9z54AaABAg,"Nigel Henson was outstanding once again and he has provided enormous insight into fire force operations. 

Some contect to what Nigel shared: 781005 Lt Jeremy Lionel Fisher, A Coy, 1 RAR: Killed in Action 28 September 1977 (RIP. Salute). Jerry was 22 years old and hailed from Mangula and was a former Plumtree pupil.  LCpl Russell Phillips SCR (RIP. Salute) was my troop Corporal; a wonderful guy who was loved and respected by those who knew and served with him. A man of enormous humility but as brave as they came; I remain proud and privileged to have served with this incredible soldier. 

As to Major Henson, he was the finest commander that I served under and I served under a number during my service. He was a man's man who loved his troopies and was loved in return. A fire force commander of exceptional skill. Salute Sir.",Russell Fulton,0,2021-08-01T07:07:22Z
34,Ugxoq51j59YI5WELDCx4AaABAg,"Thanks for another great interview as allways! üòä
It is always very interesting to listen to your guests' experiences and stories on a topic we have learned little about here in Europe.
Major Henson's experiences as a officer and RLI fireforce comander makes him clearly to a encyclopedia and an authority on the Rhodesian bush war and tactics used.

Thank's again.
Keep up the good work üëçüòä",Lars Andreas Ris√∏y,14,2021-08-01T06:38:47Z
