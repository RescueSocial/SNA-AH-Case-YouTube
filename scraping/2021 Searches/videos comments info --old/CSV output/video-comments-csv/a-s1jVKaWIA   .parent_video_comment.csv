1,UgwM8GpIT_WfMJAo_hB4AaABAg,"Why do they keep backing, this terrible liar?
They could get so many terrific actresses
to replace her, she's not even a great actress.
Warner Brothers is making a bad move with
their movie choices. Kevin Spacey lost a role
because he a bad role model is a movie. Why not her?",Angel baby squeaky,2,2021-09-10T19:29:25Z

I was angry about it before, but imagine the look on the Executives faces when they realize ""maybe we should have listened to the masses."" Think about it this way; WB keeps AH, AH loses in VA next year. Not 100% more like 70% JD could go after them later for backing an abuser. From my perspective  JD has a discrimination case against WB when he wins next year. They kept and backed his abuser even while court proceedings were going on, while kicking him to the curb on her word. Wanna talk about a reverse discrimination, JD v AH is the case. So let them make the movie and let them keep her; then you all can join me with lawn chairs so we can all watch the dumpster fire together ‚ù§ü§£",Spamachu Chan,0,2021-06-20T13:20:14Z

I know that they probably won't actually fire her ( and I unfortunately I get why), but at least it's fun to fantasize about her replacement.
