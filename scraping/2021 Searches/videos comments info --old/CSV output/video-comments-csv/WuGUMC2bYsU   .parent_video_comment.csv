I think we want to hear more about that!

3,UgxcWB6eOM9zsWLSlHR4AaABAg,Goro was a complete waste. The only reason he was in the movie was for Cole to find his special power and protect his family. Nothing else. They killed him and then they moved onto the next thing.,Shane Everett,0,2021-05-05T00:34:31Z

10,UgyQ4LTtqd-540EVERh4AaABAg,"I think they added in Cole because the studio was afraid that there would be no one for the audience to empathize with, who stands in for the audience. I'm trying to think tho. Did the first MK have a character like that? A family man, a normal guy? If not, that movie got along fine without said character.",ShogunOrta,0,2021-05-02T17:44:01Z

I think I know the problem.
MK take ""inspiration"" from Avenger...For all of history that i know of MK why the ""heroes"" part. I never hear that from any of the MK cast (the character) For the the inspiration that should take is any of Bruce lee movie OR Duke nukem. Why Duke nukem you ask.

20,Ugx1ldfS9F_GvAf9bbV4AaABAg,"Mortal Kombat 01:02:42.  I think you guys have to think how the writers can bring the ""special moves"" into the realm of believability (hence the whole arcana thing), the 1995 had very good things (some locations, at least they tried the living forest!), but got parts of the lore WRONG!! (Sub-Zero was supposed to have been hired to kill Shang Tsung in the first MK, and in the 95 movie it was one of his goons!!) the production values where low since the budget was like 10% of the 2021 movie. Movies need POV characters when dealing with high fantasy concepts, and the 2021 was a lot better in certain aspects than the 95 one, of course it lacked in others; but come one, when movies don't take themselves too seriously people complain that it was a joke, and when they do, it's ""this is not a fun movie""....come on guys....",BruceKenobi,2,2021-05-01T03:18:36Z
