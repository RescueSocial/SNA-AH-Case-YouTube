1,UgxmTQROWNWC2oN97kB4AaABAg,Jacob Aarum,@Ashraf Anam I've sadly gotten into it with Snyder haters and Snyder fans. I'm a fan of Snyder and Geoff Johns and Snyder fans give Johns a lot of shit.,2018-12-08T08:45:52Z,0
2,UgxmTQROWNWC2oN97kB4AaABAg,Ashraf Anam,@Jacob Aarum Osvaldo's just a Snyder hater.,2018-12-08T07:27:31Z,0
3,UgxmTQROWNWC2oN97kB4AaABAg,Jacob Aarum,"Justice League (2004) Aquaman reminds me a lot of 90's Aquaman. Momoa reminded me a lot of JL. I could argue I grew up with 90's of I grew up with the JL cartoon.
Momoa is the perfect Aquaman. Shit, he'd be perfect as Lobo. Who says he can't do both? I do say Geoff Johns made him cool again though. His New 52 run was damn good.",2018-12-08T07:10:33Z,1
4,UgxmTQROWNWC2oN97kB4AaABAg,Osvaldo SastrÃ©,"@Ashraf Anam You think Peter's Aquaman is better than Johns? Get out of here! Nostalgia talking, just the design cause his stories were just fine. Yeah, I know the JL-JLU version is based off David's take on the character, that doesn't make it incredible, just the other side of the spectrum from the Super Friend's style. You think that was a cool easter egg? Out of nowhere from a flashdrive? Looking at a camera like a caveman deciding wheter attack or not... Awful. Everything Zack gets the credit is for work he didn't actually do: WW directed by Patty Jenkins and Aquaman by Jame Wan, he just give the basic, these directors worked with the characters, cause they actually GET the character. Let's stop right here, you seriously think Snyder is a good director and I don't, so it's going nowhere.",2018-12-08T02:28:33Z,0
5,UgxmTQROWNWC2oN97kB4AaABAg,Ashraf Anam,"@Osvaldo SastrÃ© 15 years? Doesn't look it. You missed Peter David's Aquaman then it seems. And never watched the Justice League TV series. David reincarnated Aquaman after his classic version became a laughing stock into a darker and grittier character to be taken seriously. His cameo in BvS was awful? WTF! Your taste in superhero movies is seriously bad and unconventional. Geoff Johns only merged the classic and darker versions. Wan thus builds up on Zack's Aquaman adding stuff from the New 52. His storyline also immediately follows Zack's cut of Justice League, as confirmed by Momoa, and people who have watched the movie have said that Wan has kept Zack's Aquaman intact. Everyone knows without Zack's contributions, we wouldn't be having any of the DC movies following BvS.",2018-12-08T02:17:33Z,0

8,UgxJB9lROBq9oWuriK54AaABAg,MisterCovek,"Exactly. I find these modern women kinda hypocritical honestly. A couple of decades ago, when these superhero movies were just getting started, most women would scoff at these characters and stories. They were for nerds and shit. Now that they make billions of dollars and get world wide fame and praise, all of a sudden ""it's time"".",2018-12-06T13:57:13Z,7
9,UgyGAX_Xv33hmzziLht4AaABAg,Brandon Ax,"@Osvaldo SastrÃ© But I don't agree MoS was amazing. And the extended BvS was a great film. Idk, maybe we just have different opinions.",2018-12-08T19:18:24Z,2
10,UgyGAX_Xv33hmzziLht4AaABAg,Osvaldo SastrÃ©,"You got Man of Steel, a 100% Zack Snyder film and wasn't as good as you claim it could be. We got BvS Extended Version and besides most of Snyder fans claiming to be a better movie it doesn't translate to a good/solid movie. So no, stop trying to claim all the blame on executives, they fucked up but also Snyder's shitty direction. And also, Ayer's style of making everything ganster and cholo fucked up Suicide Squad, besides the horrible writting.",2018-12-06T05:34:48Z,2
11,UgyGAX_Xv33hmzziLht4AaABAg,Niamh Morrissey,"@Za Za 
They obviously should've gotten someone who wasn't gonna make the rest of the movie in the exact opposite tone of what Zack already made.

Joss's style blends with Zack's style as well as a rectangle block fitting in a triangle hole.",2018-12-05T18:38:35Z,2
12,UgyGAX_Xv33hmzziLht4AaABAg,Za Za,"Jordan Weaver what the fuck is captain avengers ? 
You mean Joss whedon ?
He was brought in to finish the film coz Zaks daughter was freaking dead dude. 
So should Zack have ignored his dead childâ€™s death to make a better movie for you fan boy ???",2018-12-05T08:55:55Z,0
13,Ugz3hyEa0cPKpGPAnUd4AaABAg,Za Za,"Judge Executioner pretty sure he had nothing to do with casting orm. 
Arthur and Mera were about it. 
What about the other 100 people in the movie. 
Maybe give James Wan some credit for the awesome movie heâ€™s made that is better than any movie Zaks released.",2018-12-05T08:52:28Z,3

The interviewer asked her what characters she dressed up as when she was a kid, and she gives a whole thesis on needing to see more strong influential women given major roles in movies. Yeah, the interviewer mentioned that as a lead-in to his question, Amber. You still didn't give him a straight answer. *face palm*",2018-12-30T06:21:54Z,5
