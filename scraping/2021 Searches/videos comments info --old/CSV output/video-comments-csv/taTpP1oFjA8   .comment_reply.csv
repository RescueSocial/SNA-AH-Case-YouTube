They are subconsciously drawn to repeat their childhood as that is what's familiar. They're ultimately trying to finally receive the love and validation they deserved but didn't receive. But no matter how much effort they put in, or how much they put themselves last, the Narcissist will never truly see their worth beyond the supply they recieve, as they genuinely don't care. If you had a Narcissist in your childhood, you are primed and conditioned to be manipulated to question yourself, accept responsibility, and accept anothers reality over your own perception.",2020-09-18T03:28:09Z,4

 Accurate, Depp concedes description of their fights, or lack thereof.

 Of course the best thing to do is walk away when someone is out of control, unless you know that aggravates that person, in which case,  that can be super passive aggressive.  In any case, sometimes just staying with the angry person  and being calm and compassionate and sympathetic ( without being condescending) is probably the best option
