1,Ugz52oTH0IBqD0h8vR14AaABAg,"(Heads up: I have posted this on several videos, hoping that Lost Beyond Pluto might see it. Sorry for the spamming) 

Dear Lost Beyond Pluto, I miss watching your legal analysis and professional translations of all the ""legaleze"" into layman terms for us. 
I get that you are clearly having much more fun with your current format of talk show with someone you care about and feel comfortable with. It clearly shows, and you look like you are having such a good time. And I want that for you. 

I just miss having your unique and sharp and simple breakdowns of a case that has been so complicated and felt so confusing (the AH/JD case). 
As someone who is still living with long-term consequences of prolonged emotional abuse (it's nearly 20 years later and I am still having a hard time trusting anyone or even functioning as an adult), this case really got to me. Hearing those tapes really punched me in the gut, emotionally. 
One of the things that have been so devastating for me, is that no-one believed me, and that's what I see repeated with Depp. 
...and the let-down and despondency so many victims of abuse felt collectively after the UK ruling...! Well I know I'm not the only one who took that really hard. 

I continue to follow this case because I am so personally invested, but I really miss your expert, clear-cut and qualified analysis and take on the developments. 
I would so much like to hear your opinion on the paper that just came out, using the UK ruling as a case study and minutely and systematically assessing the credibility of AH. The paper is called ""Assessment of Credibility of Testimony in Alleged Intimate Partner Violence: A Case Study"" and can be found here https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/24732850.2021.1945836",damnitalexis,0,2021-08-03T14:37:03Z

78,UgwpmMTk57a7ETISfj14AaABAg,"I feel that Jennifer's statement could carry a lot of weight for a couple of reasons. One: she was supeonaed (sp?) So, no axe to grind. 
Two: Forget the stairs incident or any of that. The fact that Whitney (and amber?) said that whitney had to go sleep on her employer's floor and Jennifer says that SHE is that employer. But whitney slept in a guest room, discredits whitney's (and amber's ~ AGAIN) testemony completely. 
That is all I need from Jennifer's statement. 
But, I guess there is a little bit of icing. I would tend to believe Jennifer's statements where she says whitney said she wanted to stay with her because she was afraid if amber.  And that she was surprised Johnny puts up with amber and the explanation of the stairs incident are true. It seems that they were good friends. I think that while venting, especially venting fear, people don't lie to friends as close as whitney and Jennifer were. whitney said this to Jennifer BEFORE there was any thought of a court case (I think). So, she would have no reason to lie. Plus, she, whitney would have been lying in favor of Johnny which would get her in more trouble with her sister, amber. Who, I truly believe whitney was afraid of. Also, whitney said she was afraid amber would push Johnny down the stairs. This aligns with a statement I think whitney made in court that.....I'm so confused as to sequence....but, at some point whitney placed herself between Johnny and amber. But, she was facing AWAY from Johnny and AT amber. People face the person they are afraid of. For whitney to put her back to Johnny and face amber shows me that she was not afraid of Johnny pushing her. But of amber pushing or hitting her or Johnny. So, she faced the person she was afraid of.....amber.
The above explanation by whitney aligns with the statement to Jennifer that she, whitney was afraid of amber. She was afraid for herself and for Johnny. 

But, the strongest support from this statement is that neither whitney or amber are credible because its MORE credible evidence that whitney and amber lied on the stand. (Sleeping on the floor vs sleeping in a guest room.)

I actually feel sorry for whitney. If amber is THAT violent. Which it sound like she is, I could easily see whitney being terrified if she didn't say what amber told her to say. Under other circumstances, I might tend to think that whitney is not all that bad and that she would not have lied had she not been terrified of amber.

86,Ugye6NcEFVrE5DI2lY94AaABAg,"Sorry, I am late to the dance. I did not know why I was being copied your opinion of this matter.

Quickly, with my existing knowledge of the subject matter and this current post.

It Is your contention that this 3rd party HEARSAY evidence will be accepted into court and considered in this civil suit against the so-called, NEWS?paper recognized as, The Sun.

You are further stating that said 3rd party, HEARSAY evidence will be accepted in a similar civil suit against Amber Heard in the United States.

As the president of Fathers4Justice, I am familiar with both courts, however, I primarily deal in matters of family law. 

Much of what is being stated is of course HEARD in matters of family law and even though as many as 80% of the family law judges queried on the subject matter believe that allegations of abuse in family law are false, they still accept said allegations as a result of the BILLIONS of dollars generated in family law and specifically in this matter, the BILLIONS of dollars generated for the states via both VAWA and the Social Security Act's title iv-d program.

The bottom line is always the same, will the courts. the attorney's and all of their minions generate income as a result of said, ""hearsay evidence'?

Legally admissible and believable or not, there is money to br made here.With that said, it is my contention that said evidence will be admitted. NOT BASED ON MATTERS. OF LAW but on matters of income generated by every facet of the case, including the drama.

The statements made here within your video do not discuss the validity of any comments made by the Sun and I am not familiar with, nor have I followed your previous videos. However, Anyone familiar with said, NEWS?paper is fully well aware of the anti-male gender-biased and drama based posts of said, NEWS?paper. 

In our campaign for family law reform we subscribe and communicate with both broadcast and print media worldwide. When communicating any matters with UK media, we must be 'matter of fact'. Therefore, we make it a point not to communicate with the SUN.

We are all looking forward to the complete vindication of Mr. Depp of these false allegations and more importantly, full accountability for the criminal falsehoods as perpetrated by Ms. Amber Heard.

I wish you continued success in your efforts and will try and follow along as time allows.

88,Ugw3hDBbapIhJV5e5vd4AaABAg,"I think it shouldn't be considered simply hearsay because of the text messages where Whitney texted Jennifer asking her if she had been subpoenaed & when she said she had, Whitney basically threatened her for not talking to her 1st & that's when Jennifer said she WOULD tell the truth. 
 Text messages were used against JD in the UK trial, why wouldn't they hold weight in Appeals UK ( IF APPEALS) or the VA trial?
 Don't these text messages substantiate that Whitney is lying? 
 If Whitney is lying for Amber (we know she is) then what Amber said is a lie & 1) she is not credible/or even less credible 2) the ""staircase incident"" is a total lie 3) wouldn't that give more weight to the rest of J. Howell's statement? 
 AH's Dad was incarcerated for slaughtering domesticated animal's, ( like a dog) & that's clear psychopathy, so I already knew Whitney, Amber, & Paige were abused by him. Plus, AH has the genetics for psychopathy, & has shown psychopathic tendencies ( Josh Drew's testimony, text messages, photos of a knife collection & AH saying she would kill JD, now J.Howell says Whitney thought AH would kill JD). 
 AH has 3 diagnosed Cluster B Personality Disorders   NPD ( Narcissistic Personality Disorder, probably malignant narcissism), BPD ( Borderline Personality Disorder, with sociopathic tendencies. 
 It's safe to add psychopathic tendendencies, though she's predominantly Borderline with full blown Narcissism. 
 It's very frustrating to me more weight isn't given to her psychological issues in Court, they are EXTREMELY predictable in many ways, such as lying, gaslighting, psychological & emotional abuse, & VERY often physical abuse. 
 * Paige was in denial/uneducated about her daughter. Cluster B's are incapable of empathy/love & exploitative of others by definition. 
 * to realize this she would have to face her husband & daughter did not love her. AH is on video being verbally abusive to Paige ( her Mom).

Whitney is the only OTHER person other than Amber that says she saw Johnny hit Amber. So w/ Jennifer coming forth, Whitney's claims will lose merit, I feel....

165,Ugwjvsdug7OZnsXjm5t4AaABAg,"Thank you for this video. :D
I think that when Whitney was in an office (with Howell and next 20 people) she was on the phone (and im not sure if with AH) but after the call she said out loud in the ofiice that ¬¥¬¥AH really cut his finger off¬¥¬¥ which was during trip in Austalia. So those 20 people might confirm that Whitney say that. It is not a big proof but at least they could proof that Ms. Howell does not lie about that. 
And Ms. Howell is the boss Whitney mentioned in court when she said that she had to sleep on the floor at her boss¬¥ home (which was even then weird bc it is ridiculous that her boss didnt have a couch at least) but Ms. Howell claims that Whitney was in a guest room so why would Whitney say that she was sleeping on the floor? It can show that Whitney is not really a reliable witness bc she lies about unimportant things like the fact that she was sleeping in a guest room. 
So if they discredit Whitney as a witness (and she is the only one who allegedly saw any violence from Johnny which many witnesses along with Ms. Howell says was not how it happened and that AH was the one that was trying to hurt Johnny and Whitney) then this incident might be discredited as well. 
Plus it would be a tiny proof that Whitney lied in UK trial that she went to Ms.Howell¬¥s house bc AH or Johnny were angry that Whitney sold photos from their wedding , whereas Ms. Howell claims that Whitney was living in her house bc she was scared of AH. Which is, in my opinion, more believable after we saw the video from that TV reality show ( in which Whitey was talking to other women about her bruises). 
So if they discredit the only ¬¥witness¬¥ (Whitney) then AH¬¥s side has only hearsay witnesses which is not very credible. 
Anyway, once again thank you for your videos and srry for my English but it is my second language so i hope you will understand what i mean :D:D",bee 21,1,2020-08-11T13:21:39Z

Concerning this evidence, I think it only use is to cast a shadow on Whitney's credibility, which is important because she is the only person who says she saw Johnny's violence towards Amber first hand. 
As to the inconsistency in their testimony, I would say that everything happen on top of the stairs and if Johnny was occupied defending himself, maybe he was not even thinking about anyone falling down the stairs... It is only in Witney and Amber's testimonies that we have that. I don't think anyone was verbalising ""Careful! I'm going to fall down the stairs!"".
