Actually, she was the one that ran after him cuz she targeted him since the beginning according to her texts and her changes.

When he finally left her, she sent him an extortion letter and he refused and she lied to the press saying she was the one being abused. Now she's being investigated by the Australia gov, the FBI and the LAPD, and he still ain't got no justice. She abused several people.",2021-05-10T03:25:59Z,0

18,UghpR6b09pQ1e3gCoAEC,Stella Apple,"@Burda Ellis Oh wow, had no idea Angelina dated Justin, ha! How ironic on that one lol. Well it worked out for the both of them because Brad and Jenn still own Plan B the production company they started, she refused to let him buy her out, good girl ;) 

As far as Johnny goes, I too have no respect for him and haven't seen a movie with him in it yet, including The Rum Diaries. It will be hard, but I think I'm going to see Alice Through the Looking Glass because I'm a Tim Burton fanantic and he's really not the star per-say and there are a ton of other stars in it. Amber is a horrid actress and now she is working with Alisters on Oscar Nominated pictures? Give me a break! I could hardly get through her performance in Magic Mike it was so pathetic. She is one of the worst actresses out there. Johnny sought her out and cast her in TRD's and knew exactly what he was doing. He pursued her knowing he had a common law wife and 2 children. I have just lost all respect for him and so have a lot of his fans. 

He may come to his senses yet, but who knows. Doing Reality TV, Playing in a band, breaking International Laws, he thinks he's 20 again. I'm waiting for him to check into rehab next.",2016-05-08T06:52:17Z,2
19,UghpR6b09pQ1e3gCoAEC,Real Cosmic Builds,"@Stella Apple Yeah,there are some actors I loved. like for Brad&Jen they were in early 00s,she loved him. then Mr&mrsSmith came along and then heard they were divored. I ws so sad about it too. Also, Angie dated Justin OUAT too,so it's like hey,while I hook w/my co-star who was Angie, many years go by,they have more kids than ever,ofc!@d time she was married to JonnyLeeMiller,before that she was married to BillyBobThornton. OMG! Her son,Max(i think) is kinda like their son,bc they both adopted him. I remember when Angie was married w/Billy. I thought she did great,but then they got divorced,then she married Jonny,then they got divorced. then she got w/Brad and all of a sudden,nvm Brad&Jen bc smhw Bradangelina happened! nvm Jenns feelings. so years later, Jenn meets Justin in what was it, I think it was Wanderlust. &they've been together ever since,just as long as Brad had been married to Angie. I get it! &yet it's funny I was watchn one of the Hollywood Report videos d/one w/ Justin&Voight(Angie's Dad) I was shocked 2c those2 n/d same room,bc Justin used2 date Angie, &yet those2 are still friends even tho Angie married Brad &who was Jenn's ex-husband and is now Justin's newly wife xD Man,I almost made myself confused for a second there. But, could never watch this movie bc of how I found out Johnny left Vanessa. It was so mean of what he did,I seen her n interviews. She seemed nice,but since he married Amber,she was only 25 and she's still only a couple years older than Jack. It's kinda disgusting. I feel sorry for those kids of his,I've watched her new film w/Walken and I'm not convinced. In all honesty, relationships in Hollywood is real bad. It's even worse when it's real life,when an actor is married to a non-actor, like ones as MerylStreep & JeffBridges at least those2 who are 2of my faves,they can keep a marriage going. and they have more kids. I mean Jeff has like 30+yrs w/his wife, and Meryl has about d/same w/Dom. Anyway. I'm gonna stop ranting,before I start a rumor mill or something. I've stopped watchn films w/Johnny now,he's getting too serious, d only ones he's good@ for me,is d/kids&family ones are only ones I'll ever watch. I could never watch this1! Seeing those2 together really pisses me off. xD Apologies.",2016-05-08T03:44:14Z,0
20,UghpR6b09pQ1e3gCoAEC,Stella Apple,"@Burda Ellis His quote was that he couldn't get Amber off his mind the whole time after making the movie, which meant in my view that he went home and made for some very tense moments with Vanessa and then broke it off with her. He fell in love with Amber during the movie, this is exactly what Brad did with Jennifer when he fell in love with Angelina during Mr & Mrs Smith. He just made it tense when he went home, and she filed for divorce. They're fucking losers, the only difference with Brad is, he didn't involve children, so I'll give him that and Jennifer is happy now. Johnny stated that he quickly called Amber to find out she too hadn't stopped thinking about him and he was thrilled to find that out. She went home and broke it off with her girlfriend when she found out Johnny wanted her. Now how does one go from being in a long term relationship with a woman, who was beautiful by the way, to stealing a man, a very very rich and powerful man in Hollywood by the way, who had a family he was very happy with and it not be for power and money? She comes off so phony when it comes to speaking about Johnny Depp and their ""love"". ""I fall even more in love with him each day"" and it sounds so pathetically ridiculous. She may as well say ""I can't wait to get through my prenup agreement to get my settlement, my offers with A Listers have already come through for my subpar shitty acting and then I'm out of here."" and it would make more sense. 

Johnny is a middle aged man who has put more rings on more fingers in Hollywood than one could count and he's taken them back just as many times. He was married once to a woman named Laurie and said he would be very cautious about getting married again. He should have married Vanessa, although she stated she didn't need to be married because their love was forever and it was already written, but it would have made it harder for him to walk away without her being able to at least rape his bank account for embarrassing her like this. 

For the record, he was single in at the bottom of his career when he met Vanessa at the premiere of The Ninth Gate in France I believe. I would have to look it up, it was a very long time ago, but I do remember this. They met in the lobby of the theater, it was in the dark when they shook hands and he knew immediately that whoever she was sent something through his body, same with Vanessa. She was pregnant a few months later with Lily Rose. There were rumors Kate Moss wanted him back before he found out about Vanessa's pregnancy, but those were just rumors. However, it doesn't matter, they were a perfect fit and she was with him when he was no longer a movie ""star"" and he was doing bit parts in Chocolat and other dumb movies. It's a shame he threw away his good name to be with some nobody who is acting like a Hollywood brat and thinks she is the shit.",2016-05-07T17:24:57Z,3
21,UghpR6b09pQ1e3gCoAEC,Real Cosmic Builds,"@Stella Apple Yeah u cud tell when Amber's w/his kids. I've seen d/photos. His daughter still seemed unhappy,nor did his son. I still think,cheating on ur wife w/ur co-star is like saying. ""It was acting. i was acting w/her,but then we spent a lot of time together,and then i saw her naked. &i was smitten w/her beauty. nvm our family. our life w/our kids is now shattered bc of what I did. It wasn't you,it was me. I'm sorry, I gotta go."" type-thing. IDKY! but, I had the same feeling w/him&Winona. Like he left her for Vanessa, then he left her for Amber. She's like several years older than Jack is &I feel sorry more for Lily. But,also Vanessa didn't deserve it@all! I'm sure n way,his kids thinx she broke up their parents bc she continued the affair w/their Dad,when they were supposed 2b professional. OMG!",2016-05-07T12:33:33Z,3
