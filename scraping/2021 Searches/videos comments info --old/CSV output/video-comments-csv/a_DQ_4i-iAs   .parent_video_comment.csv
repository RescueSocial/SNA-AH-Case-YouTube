9,UgwdU0zmwtEs93XsWoF4AaABAg,"I just came across this video and I just have to add my 2 cents worth. I have had the utmost respect for Johnny Depp since I first watched him on 21 Jump Street. Always heard good things about him and love his acting. My respect slipped a bit when he left his longtime partner and kids, then married Amber Heard. I thought he had made a terrible mistake at the time and it seems like I was right. At some point, when he decided to get political, he made a remark about an actor shooting a president that didn't go over well with me, but looking back, I suspect that was Amber's influence at the time. Now, after all this stuff with Amber, it seems to me she was the root cause of all his problems.",Kaye Johnson,0,2021-10-07T07:49:45Z

She cannot just do this to a beloved, innocent, kind man! Johnny‚Äôs only fault was marrying this POS! She is a truly horrifying psychopath who now knows she can get away with something this disturbing so this makes her even more dangerous! FUTURE VICTIMS BEWARE because there are absolutely going to be more victims! Please for the love of god someone take her down and give her a taste of her own psychotic medicine!!! Take her down before she can do this to anyone else! She has been proven to be a big fat liar many times! She says herself how she got the bruises painted on her face to screw him over!

About, I guess, ten years ago, I cut my TV.  I ocrnly get what news and current events for the most part from the internet and news clips like what pops up here on YT.  SOOOO, I am embarrassingly behind the times and didn't know about Johnny having left his first wife and then the horrendous problems he's had with Amber.  At first when celebrities break up, at least from my POV I wait until I catch enough sound bites to learn if its going to be a mild or calm divorce or a crazy knockdown.

49,UgxzecP63_w9HcAO5C94AaABAg,"Total agreement on physics not allowing a punch to a wall unless he tried some cheesy third rate martial arts finger punch, then the size of the hole in the wall would be his fingers width and height, but more than one finger would have been broken, if he hit a wall hard enough to break the skin, his DNA would be on the wall even under the paint, and all of his fingers would have likely sustained similar damage, they could verify this with her providing a location and they could excise part of the wall to get the DNA. I have hung drywall, first, a scientist would make a mold of a first and make it out of the bone ballistic gel and a skin equivalent and then set up a punching machine test it against all of the various dry walls, and come up with a conclusive statistical-based analysis determining that the physics would let that happen puncture force is 1.2N force to break drywall is 3.22, the blunt force required shear flesh off and break a bone. To break a bone the force is CONSIDERABLY higher than the puncture force. So a scientist would look at the statement, they would look up the force requirements to try and hypothesize about the physics at play, determine that it would take considerably higher force values. The bone can break as part of a boxer's fracture, but if you don't tuck your fingers in while you punch it minimizes that risk, the key additional detail is that the bone was crushed, which would be inconsistent with that, and the skin would likely not split at the fingertip but rather the knuckles. After theorizing the force they may do detailed math if the information is already available, if it is not, they would set up an experiment to do testing on dozens of brands and thicknesses of drywall and come up with a fairly conclusive dataset. They would likely reskin or liquid skin the hand between each hit so the test could be as similar as possible. I believe that part.",Louis S,0,2021-04-27T13:00:01Z

It should never have taken this long. Women like her who play the victim just because of their gender are the most vile excuses of humanity. This video was absolutely heart breaking. Seeing Johnny relive the worst time of his life and hearing the horrific way he was treated.....I hope she rots in jail. Johnny is such a sweet, kind, caring man who deserves the very best in life.

121,UgxOCY2yqnIq4t18j7h4AaABAg,"You're wrong about the smile. (He didn't exhale. You tried to access his emotional space, and in your mind, it made sense that he'd exhale. He didn't.) He's still partly in love with her. He finds her fit amusing, as destructive as she is, a part of him still finds her exciting and... admirable. He felt pleasure saying she smashed a vodka bottle, ""because she's insane/sexy hot""... He knows it's serious, but in truth, he finds it rather hot. Femme fatale, you know? He's lying about his outrage he feels against her. He's not as upset as he says he is, but he knows she's still lying about him, and that he can't allow her to keep doing, but he is more turned on by her fits of anger than threatened by them. Still, what kills him is something different. The hunched shoulders do speak of a feeling of betrayal, yes... Which ties together with his self-loathing of actually loving this POS of a woman.

When he actually gets to the part where the finger gets sliced, no smiling. Now, it's relived concern. Her being angry and volatile, funny, charming, but he speaks of the finger the same way as when kids get hurt while playing a bit rough, it's just that OK, someone got physically injured and that's not funny anymore but concerning - even if it's his own finger. But he does lighten things up with his sense of humor, which is again linked to his ability to see Amber's rages as something rather humorous. He KNOWS this is a contradiction in his mind, but he just can't help thinking this girl is... Exciting and lovable. The sadness comes from the loss of her, when he knows he has to do the sensible thing and divorce her, but he figures he'll always be in love with her - to his own detriment. 

The flashing smiles... He went somewhere else in his mind, something that amused him at the time it happened, before he returns back to the topic. Just a flash of a memory that he played back to himself but didn't comment on, as it was probably irrelevant. Maybe something she said during the argument or right after the accident, some Amber-like attitude she'd take into the events or something. He's thinking of her with pleasure, and that's where the smiles are coming from. (Again, he didn't exhale there, either.)

""It looked like Vesuvius"" he flashes a smile again, at his own amusement to the visual of his finger shooting blood. ""Having to deal with the insanity..."" ""... by this woman *smiles, scoffs* I was married to."" So there's the first exhale. He doesn't think somehow, that she is fit to be called ""a woman"". He'd probably refer to her as ""a thing"", a thing of intrigue and curiosity, but not really a woman. He was also laughing at himself, in the ""I sure know how to pick 'em"" -effect.

On a side note, the reason why he stammers and stutters, and loses focus is not, as some might assume, drugs, but him running a film in the back of his mind of the events he's supposed to be describing. But like many intelligent people, he can have several films running in there over each other, and he follows tangents here and there just to check them or amuse himself with them. Intelligent people do this, as they know they can get away with a few extracurricular activities and get back into the room after the entertainment is over. His attention shifts between one and the other ""memory film"", and he has to remind himself of the topic he was actually supposed to be talking about. A little ADHD, that is.

He flashes a smile again in ""I didn't want to lose the finger""... He loved the drama of it. He knows it's stupid to, so the conflict of loving the drama and feeling stupid about it result into a smile directed at himself: ""you're an ass"".

He's less enamored by the fact she says he did it to himself... That's a typical male response to annoying stuff their wives do. Almost like: ""She can fight the fight but she can't be honest about it, that's disappointingly feminine of her."" So that's what he's not impressed by. ""Chop my finger off and I'll laugh but lie about it like a coward and I'll divorce your ass."" 

The brushing the hair back, I interpret as disappointment in her, again: ""At least do me the COURTESY of LYING BETTER."" As in, IF you have to put me through this, at least have some DIGNITY in it by lying so I don't have to be EMBARRASSED by being nailed by your shoddy, bad lies.

Granted I know a lot about JD and his obscure sense of humor, or at least, think I do. :D",Tonia Thraw,1,2021-02-15T12:15:48Z

This was my first time to ever see one of Your videos. I did like it and Subscribed to Your channel. 
I will be honest that at first I thought that I was going to totally disagree with You and be upset I entered watching this video with Great trepidation. I apologize for that as I was totally wrong about You. I knew in my heart of hearts that Johnny was not lying on the stand. Although I am not trained as You are; I still believe that I can see deceit in Someone when they are not telling the truth. I was also happy that I was right. I can be a ‚ÄúSoar Loser and an even Worst Gloating Winner. Hahahaha! Like there is a competition but I obviously, enjoy being right. LOL!!! 
Anyway, thank You For pointing out the expressions that show Johnny to be telling the truth. You are very perceptive and well-trained. I learned a lot from You. 
That is AWESOME because I am older and as I am sure You can hear; I can be a stubborn old woman too. Well, thank You for showing Us and what Johnny‚Äôs body and facial expressions show about his testimony and integrity. üòäüëçüèº

He is definitely telling the truth, and told him she'd ruin him for leaving her. I dabble in body language, had a DA situation and volunteered with survivors of DA.

Amber is without question guilty in my books, and we do NOT have to believe ""all women"" when this woman is clearly lying,  and has proven to be a ""gold digger"" after all as her charitable donations stopped way after JD paid her money, and long before the court cases.
Being an actress myself, I can testify how hard it is to get steady work, (especially since she's not a good actress in roles or selling this story)--but
 if you seduce and Mary a legendary Actor with genuine talent then your odds are much better.


AH has a history of DA as well. Justice Nicholas made a  completely biased (at best) and compromised (most likely) decision against Depp.

The way the recordings play out  - it is my opinion - her control of him wasn‚Äôt happening fast enough or completely enough therefore she turned to violence, this kind of treatment to push even the most saintly of human over the end. Her own words that she was afraid for her life - certainly is contradicted her mannerisms, behaviors and her own words from the recorded conversations. Also, they way she is acting in her recorded depositions - again is total opposite of her behavior in the recording she has admitted under oath was her and Mr. Depp. And if you actually watch close she smirks and lightly laughs when listening to those recorded conversation while eating during her deposition.... oh and her eating during ....

I like the guy, he's a good actor, but he's also has a history of drug abuse, alcohol included, admitted by himself. he should had responded in kind, through an american paper told his side of the story and leave it at that, but he raised it to another level  going to court, and you don't do that if you have skeletons in your closet. i blame his current lawyer buddy; since he fired his manager and his former lawyer, both friends of his who covered and watched for him, he's been struggling, and now this...also he said  after the trial in a story that when in Ireland at one time he took some pills and woke up three days later in France with no recollection of what happened in between... that was not wise of him.",Miguel Angel Ortiz Oliveras,0,2021-01-11T05:36:51Z

The notion that men are not victimized by women is offensive. Equality is one thing. Demanding unfair concessions that ignore the pardigms of justice based on gender is a tremendous step backwards. Perhaps the ERA struggles because the women involved are generally entitled elitist who tend to be educated yet incredibly. Ignorant. 
Thus us an interesting show that's probably over the feminists heads because it analyzing psychological tells. The body betrays a great deal and  by considering each individual objectively by way of their text ( what they say, write, or express via the body, painting, the visage, etc) one can decode a lot more then deferring to mind numbing reflexive bias. Men bad. Women good.  That's even more ludicrous than misogyny.  Johnny Depp is an empath. Obviously.  His ex wife is a disordered personality. I am not qualified to armchair analyze her but something ain't right. Empaths are creative honest human beings. The disordered are drawn to empaths because they are open and experience life in wats a narcissist or sociopath never will  They're vampires. I'm glad he got out if that relationship alive. I know he will gain a great deal of wisdom from this  now he's in battle, he's weary and humiliated as his career suffers. He will never be the same.

316,UgwPZZU-DdLhJaXKmJl4AaABAg,"First, less importantly, as far as Johnny calling his finger Little Richard, I don't think that has to do with King Richard, unless the king was called Little Richard. Richard¬†Wayne Penniman (December 5, 1932 ‚Äì May 9, 2020), known as¬†Little Richard, was an American musician, singer, and songwriter. He was an influential figure in popular music and culture for seven decades. Little Richard was very well known and liked in the USA.¬†

Secondly, I think you are right on the money. Johnny was so truthful about everything while Amber was not. One thing I did notice about Amber is that she accused Johnny, not only accuse him Johnny of physical abuse she also accused him of sexual abuse. How can anyone who has experienced every kind of abuse imaginable, because if she suffered physical and sexual abuse then the emotional abuse goes along with that, how can she sit there so calmly, matter of factly, no emotion just blank face and talk about the the pain and suffering she has endured. No human being could if you were telling the truth.¬†

Not only I feel bad for Johnny having to go through this, I feel bad for every domestically abused woman out there. Having someone claim to be a victim when they are not and most likely the abuser apart of your small circle of victims is shit.

Personally I find the biggest piece of evidence proving Johnny's innocence is how his ex partner has stuck up for him and has only said good things about him.

I think his idolization of Hunter Thompson caused a lot of harm. He was already introspective enough. He still feels bad about River Phoenix. I hope he has enough money to live on and can find a place of quiet, peace, write a script to put his pain and truth in or paint pictures, write a book or create something. Creative pursuits are great healers.

He was unfortunately, left out of the Beasts movies. Or fortunately.
I wonder if his story with medical reports, xrays, etc., was presented in court. The fact that previous women voluntarily said he had never done anything to them and he simply is not that kind of person.",millieo,2,2020-12-01T14:34:17Z

375,UgwUOxfATff2pkousFB4AaABAg,I agree entirely with the comments here and your interpretation. When I first heard about it I thought he was an abuser. It was her depositions and recordings and the words coming out of her mouth that changed my mind. She convinced me that she was the abuser. She did not win in the UK as she was not on trial (although she seemed to need her lawyer) the Sun won the right to print what they wanted. It's a pity because judge Nicole has made a laughing stock of the UK justice system. Unfortunately he views Depp as a Hollywood monster and how dare he criticise the UK press. The damage to the reputation of the American people by their President is very far reaching. Thankfully not for much longer.,M P,9,2020-11-28T23:45:32Z

386,Ugxag1aotgJh3DLQzpB4AaABAg,"Now, now, now, it's not true, Johnny Depp cut his own finger off. Amber Heard said it herself: First he punched a wall, but that didn't work, so he smashed it with the phone, but nothing was working, so he resolved to take his wall and phone beaten right hand and smash a bottle, so he could use a shard to finally use his left hand (even though he's right hand dominant) to cut the damn finger off his right hand because all the other ways he tried it just wouldn't work! At last! He was able to finally write a bloody message on the mirror instead of using red paint. He knew this would be much better. He's also pretended all those years to be right handed; he's actually ambidextrous! How can you dispute this? Amber's story is the only one that makes sense! Someone throwing a bottle at you and cutting off your finger doesn't make sense, I mean, who would do that? Now cutting off your own finger using your non-dominant hand after failing to break it off by throwing a punch at the wall and banging it with a phone (I'm sure that's what she meant happened, after all, Amber is a woman and all women are truthful, so she couldn't have possibly been changing her story; she must've meant that there were several failed attempts before the actual occurrence), now THAT is understandable and realistic. Clearly, AH is the one telling the truth about the finger incident (Duh!)

 JD as you mentioned has that humour which is extremely understandable to a lot of us in the UK (as a nation we are known to humourise traumatic subjects or nasty things & without really knowing it could be misconstrued in many peoples minds) I'm a big humour to cover person, to my detriment on occassion.

The body languages couldn't be any more different if they tried. She eats throughout as a stalling tactic, to think over questions or ignore them all together. She's inclined to go on an irrelevant tangent too, smirking when asked if she hit Johnny.

Right, somewhere in the comments I see 'dupers delight' reference (and I've seen that vid too, and can say with certainty, that guy ain't no expert); in JD case that's actually not _it_ ! We have to look at one's baseline first, and in his many interviews etc, we can see he often does this right corner-lip-half-smile, so that would be part of his baseline. He also has a light stammer/stutter, which comes through sometimes although, for the most part, he has it under control.

Love your work! Maybe do a next vid on wannabe language readers who 'do celebrities' for the views and own personal gain? That would be marvellous! [Hint, hint: ahem...Scottish Body Language 'Expert'.]

Biology and our Limbic system just doesn‚Äôt lie.
The only thing I picked up in his body language that was going ‚Äúagainst himself‚Äù was that he protected her multiple times from her abuse of him and has to unravel it now and he has a ‚Äúnervous stammer‚Äù I‚Äôve seen in past interviews this nothing new however some have falsely accused him of lying but you need ‚Äúclusters‚Äù to make any decisions.the smirk is because it‚Äôs almost a disbelief motion with the exhale which is ‚Äúcan‚Äôt believe I got away alive from all of this and covered for her‚Äù his eye blocking is very typical of trying to remember correctly how things happened and the emotive state also.
He does feel shame over his daughter in particular because I think he feels responsible for the bullying that she‚Äôs faced along with his son.

451,UgzWYVIfgdQZeLiBAjh4AaABAg,Thank you! Have been looking forward to this video after seeing your analysis on the AH deposition. This case is really getting under my skin.. I hope truth will eventually prevail and that JD gets justice! Thanks again!,Yas M,20,2020-11-09T18:43:44Z
452,UgyDl_61-42RMjkEA1R4AaABAg,"Heard's deposition was cringeworthy and came across as an (over)act, Depp's was straightforward and, in my opinion, was truthful.  Nicol got it wrong, again.  He messed up before resulting in a consultant surgeon being handed a 30 month sentence for gross negligence manslaughter.  After his release his appeal was successful on the grounds Nicol failed to give further guidance to the jury after they asked for it.",British Scorpion,117,2020-11-09T18:16:46Z

458,UgzXdJHwUG_bmhSO4It4AaABAg,"Thanks for your analysis. It seems that you have understood very well what JD was experiencing during his deposition and that there are no signs of deception, just a genuine man recounting what actually happened. Shame (massive understatement) the judge in the UK libel case has not got your depth and breadth of understanding of human beings.",Light House Psychology,20,2020-11-09T15:02:31Z
