She's the one who was making false claims against him. It looks like the British courts are more screwed up than ours.

  This is all a tricky situation for us guys, cause yes a real man would never hit a woman and it must be very hard for alot of men out there whose partners do hit them in arguments and really lash out and are abusive to them, but they're just real men that would never hit their woman back no matter how she goes on extra. But they love their woman too much and put up with it, same thing goes for women in DV and abusive relationships like yourself. 

  It can be hard to walk away especially when that partner is also being emotionally manipulative. 
       I've never been in a abusive relationship (guess i've just never been in a relationship long enough for it to turn abusive in anyway) and i'd like to think if i was i'd easily just walk out if my partner hit me i would not stand for it. But then i think well what if i  had been with that person for years? 

  For men i dont know whether there is a thing like the Women's aid a kind of advice line you know? And ofcourse men just wont talk about it to anyone really, i mean how would you even talk about that rnd your mates?
