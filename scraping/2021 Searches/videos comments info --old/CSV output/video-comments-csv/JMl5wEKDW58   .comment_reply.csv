She’s an actress and now a high level member of the me too movement, and has been hired to be a front face to help abused women. We gave that title to a liar. 

I don’t think it’s wrong to first point out, and second even bash when a women who’s abusing the system, help destroyed Johnny Depp career and labeled him wife beater. And is playing a superhero, someone who little girls will look up too. I don’t see how I’m suppose to just act out of kindness to a women who has also said she has donated her court wins to children’s hospital, only to be caught that she kept the whole 7 million to herself.

102,Ugx3jXVCyrHvo-lh5v54AaABAg,John Wick,"@Why It Matters Podcast right the media would lose interest if a famous liar is exposed, the next me too story would instantly be either disinterest or skepticism and eventually total tuned out audience.. her exposure has already happened.

103,Ugx3jXVCyrHvo-lh5v54AaABAg,Why It Matters Podcast,"Because the mainstream media only caters to whatever movement can get them enough traction and money. For them that’s me too movement. 

They can either boost the me too movement with the headline actress in abusive relationship speaks up. Or go with me too movement board member accused of beating her husband. Which would essentially kill any support for that group.",2021-01-15T17:46:27Z,9
104,UgwEskAvHyq_I4zxKV54AaABAg,Luke Maher,"@Why It Matters Podcast there are so many things and stories they could do with Superman. Take inspiration from all the classic storylines and give their own take on it, yet they're more focused on these other movies and spin offs that hardly any of us are asking for. If they had a studio head that loves DC comics or just comics in general, like Marvel has with Kevin Feige. The possibilities of great storytelling for not only Superman, but all the other DC heroes would be endless, even if Marvel and Disney doesn't always stick the landing with each character or movie.",2021-01-15T19:01:04Z,0
105,UgwEskAvHyq_I4zxKV54AaABAg,Why It Matters Podcast,"Totally agree, I think they chose amber just for looks. Which shouldn’t be the all factor. I mean Jason mamoa doesn’t look like the blonde aquaman we’re used to. Yet he carries it really well.

But hey you know Warner bros and DC don’t know what they’re doing when you can’t even figure out what to do with Superman. One of the greatest comic characters to ever exist.",2021-01-15T18:36:07Z,2
106,UgwEskAvHyq_I4zxKV54AaABAg,Luke Maher,"@Why It Matters Podcast Exactly! Couldn't have said it better myself. Jason and Emilia already have better chemistry on and off screen than him and Amber ever will. And aside from already being a FAR better actress with actual talent, Emilia is able to express kindness within a character, while also being able to convince us she can hold her own in a fight. Amber, even when she's playing a character who is supposed to be heroic, all we can see is how evil of a person she truly is. Emilia just oozes that role model type, like Gal does. 

I'd be surprised if there's still parents out there that allow their children to look up to Amber as Mera. She doesn't deserve to be Mera or even be allowed to act in general. Besides she doesn't even have anything of value for us to latch onto. There are far better actresses out there in terms of looks and talent. WB should give Emilia the role, but we all know that'd be smart and wise decision, which WB sadly isn't good at making, at least at this moment.",2021-01-15T18:15:02Z,3
107,UgwEskAvHyq_I4zxKV54AaABAg,Why It Matters Podcast,"If it was up to me, I would cast Emilia Clarke instead. Let the character be in the hands of someone who has a good personality and can be a roll model for kids. 

And then when the character becomes very popular, amber heard will have to just watch all the success that she won’t be apart of.",2021-01-15T17:42:00Z,9
108,Ugyb4GfR1nH-RAONFqJ4AaABAg,Why It Matters Podcast,I’m just still stunned at the fact she’s still not in prison. Really shows the equality between men and women these days. Even though if this situation was reversed Johnny Depp would most certainly be in huge trouble.,2021-01-14T11:27:12Z,0
