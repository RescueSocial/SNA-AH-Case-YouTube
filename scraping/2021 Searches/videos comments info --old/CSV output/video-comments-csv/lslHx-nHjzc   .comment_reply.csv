And didn‚Äôt and a judge recently granted Johnny‚Äôs a victory to check and confirm she lied. Also Johnny is far from broke he could loose all his money and make it all back because he‚Äôs Johnny depp and people love him and his work. Also Amber has said multiple times she married him for financial security so yes she did need his money especially because she couldn‚Äôt even afford to get herself a hotel and was barely getting roles when she met Johnny.

As far as i understand this recording here was made by amber, and submitted as her evidence in the divorce(???), i may be mistaken tho. The audio from australia was definitely hers and definitely part of her evidence. And the audio from their call during the divorce was depp's. 
I have no idea if he made 50 other recordings or if she made them and actually sent them to him at some point. But now they only demand these recordings from depp to provide in this case. Does it mean she doesnt have them?? Why not?",2020-12-17T06:00:34Z,5

Instead of getting help for her trauma and identifying the toxicity within herself, she used it as a weapon. I think she likes being the aggressor, she likes being violent, it makes her feel powerful. When she can't be in the power position, she plays to people's emotions and plays the victim, so no matter the situation she was in control. She saw a man that was deeply caring, accepting, and successful in the film industry where she was floundering. That made him the perfect target for her.",2021-03-06T17:22:42Z,7

She was only entitled of half of the money they both earned, DURING THE PERIOD THEY WERE MARRIED.  THAT is what ""No-Fault"" Divorce law stipulates in California.  If she HAD known this...I have little doubt that she would have arranged an ""accident"" that would have taken his life, so that as his widow, she could inherit the lot.

That's what she's been doing; controlling the narrative even psychologically, reflecting and accusing, never letting him speak, and when he does belittling what he says and then switching back to playing victim again, rewriting memories and reflecting, lying.
