5,UgzJDBD0aVf2mwnKWUN4AaABAg,sixty one fifty & a lullaby Addict,"Hey so what would u guys do if everything they been doing was part of some social experiment & yâ€™all were hating for NO REASON. I donâ€™t even try to pick sides especially when I never personally met them. Even when itâ€™s people i personally know, I hesitate to get involved at all cuz if they kiss and makeup the only aH0L3 is me. A great way to lose friends. I guess the one exception is if u start dating one of em & then itâ€™s personal. That being said I canâ€™t even believe sheâ€™s single, pretty sure she has her pick of whoever she wants.",2021-11-20T02:26:49Z,2

16,UgwTnw02TZ_HxISzyMp4AaABAg,Olga Kruglova,"@Ben U Define successful actress. Is it the one who produces the film with 2.5 million dollars budget and acts in it and the film makes 663 dollars? Syrup was a flop. The Stand was a flop. Gully was a flop, it has 1.1 rating on IMDB. London Fields was a flop and she was sued by the production company. Aquaman was relatively successful, BUT it had Jason Momoa in it, Nicole Kidman and other stellar cast. If it made whatever it made, it wasn't because of her, but despite her. So, my point is not flawed, you didn't do research on the subject. We'll see how Aquaman 2 will do, but my guess is not good. What I do in life doesn't require good looks, but intellect. I dare say that I am quite successful at what I do. My intellect will last way longer than her looks.",2021-06-22T11:43:58Z,1
17,UgwTnw02TZ_HxISzyMp4AaABAg,Ben U,@Olga Kruglova she has looks. Like stunning looks. And sheâ€™s a relatively successful actress. Like right now. So your point is flawed. How do you do in comparison to her ? My guess is not that well or else you wouldnâ€™t be hating. Looks like sheâ€™s had a successful career and probably always will as long as she goes with it. And her looks will probably last a lot longer than yours. You straight up just sound like a hater,2021-06-22T10:15:30Z,1
