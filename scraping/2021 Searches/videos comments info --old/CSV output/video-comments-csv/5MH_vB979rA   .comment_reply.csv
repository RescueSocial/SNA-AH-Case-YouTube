119,UgwnzgsE-rxyV4fO8XN4AaABAg,MrRavellon,"As far as I know, about half of abuse cases are reciprocal and among the non-reciprocal cases around 70% are female abusers (that's just violent abuse, mind you)
Men just suffer less damage from it (because women are less capable of doing damage) and report it less (because there is no recourse unless they have iron-clad evidence)

This shit is really complicated and Duluth model makes things ten times worse. Default assumption that the man is the aggressor is really fucking nasty when around half of abuse is reciprocal. And when all you have to do is make a call to the police to have your partner kidnapped and deprived of liberty for at least a day, the women don't even have to be physically abusive to make the man's life hell. 
Not to mention, if there are kids involved. What can the man do? Run away with them? He'll be declared a kidnapper, stripped of parental rights and jailed. Seek domestic abuse shelter? Sorry, only for females. Leave alone? Stripped of parental rights, burdened with child support and have his kids alone with the abusive woman that hates him and likely the kids. Go to court? Good luck with that, unless she's clinically insane it'll take years for you to even have a chance to get your kids free in your custody and all the while you will have to live together with her unless you want to leave your kids alone with her.",2020-02-05T14:38:33Z,10
