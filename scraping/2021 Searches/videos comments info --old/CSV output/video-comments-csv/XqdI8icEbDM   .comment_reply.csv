Regardless, it has been shown she lied on occasion relating to the relationship. Some of those documents actually contradict statements of hers. As is, it was shit relationship and it is most likely the abuse was coming from both sides. It is not clear who started it but if the claims of former spouses can be believed, JD was a saint and AH could be troublesome. It might be she started it or she didn't. What you have to understand is JD is loved by many, this woman came out calling him a horrible human. JD then retaliates and does provide evidence she lied.

 Testifying is testifying. You are not allowed to lie, you will be in trouble if you are caught lying. 

That is the whole reason they are testifying, (especially in this specific case) To try to find out if youre lying.

Sure maybe you cant be held in contempt of court, but I'm sure it would still end very badly if you blatantly lied and the other side could prove it.

really it's no different than what you see going on with the American elections. you see clear evidence of vote rigging. And even the Supreme Court won't touch the issue.

do you think there's a judge anywhere that wants a feminist hate mob destroying their career?

there are ramifications for a large situation like JD versus the almost meaningless case that Sargon had.

sargon's case was essentially a civil dispute were some crazy chick sued him over copyright.

nobody really pays attention to any of sargon's crap outside of his community. so the judge doesn't have to worry about a hate mob destroying the judges career.

sargon's case was basically one company versus another.

versus JD's case which is to public and popular to be able to escape ramifications if you don't go the way you're expected to.

in popular culture or Hollywood once the black Mark has been put upon somebody. then their career is effectively over. 

in Hollywood and the media spent far too much time destroying JD's reputation for them to turn that ship around. 

in the case of JD It Isn't So Much a man versus a woman thing. it's the fact that the court of public opinion has already made its verdict.
