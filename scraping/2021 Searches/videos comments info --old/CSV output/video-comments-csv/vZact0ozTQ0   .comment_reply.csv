I bent over backwards in reconciling her behaviour and the story she told so it made sense but it was a stretch. Then I did think it strange that Depp would be a ""monster"" to her but so many of his exes said that he was a gentle and kind man, I reasoned that he changed with Amber, but I found that a stretch too.
Then I heard the audio clips of AH and JD during the marriage, unmistakable abuse and mocking and attempts at gaslighting, from Amber. An exasperated but still willing to try to make it work and a very sad tone, from Depp. This was when I knew that Amber had lied, and lied. And keeps on lying.",2020-12-14T12:51:41Z,0

148,UgxB5X2lhu5GrqIoiCJ4AaABAg,John,"@Judith Hodgson there must be. If I had to completely guess, I'd say Elon Musk paid to keep it extremely quiet while they were together, either a 1x payment or he's still helping so he doesn't get too involved in it.
