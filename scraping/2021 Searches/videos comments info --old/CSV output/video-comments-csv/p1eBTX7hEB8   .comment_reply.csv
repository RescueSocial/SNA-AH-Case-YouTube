2,Ugy98iaTsWFjp-T5bu14AaABAg,B. T.,@Jay Lee  it depend how he turn on you...this is what he was talking about with the interviewee. The abuses in childhood.  He talked about being a survivor of abuses ( that relationship and others épisodes of abuse concerning also sexuality). Sexual abuse and  s violence is not the same. It was a long interwiew.,2021-03-17T16:04:10Z,0
3,Ugy98iaTsWFjp-T5bu14AaABAg,Jay Lee,"@B. T. Well having your sex partner turn on you is hurtful but it is not sexual abuse.  Ezra was the one who wanted the relationship to continue, the partner turned on him and beat him up, just like in the movie, Perks of Being a Wallflower.  Romantic rejection is something we all experience.  This is different of course, but it is not sexual abuse.",2021-03-17T15:15:26Z,0
4,Ugy98iaTsWFjp-T5bu14AaABAg,B. T.,"True. In somes interviews Ezra talks about having suffered abuses in childhood, (a relationship that turned in a violent way and others episodes) and struggling with suicidals thoughts, anxiety and dépression in their life and adhd.
And in my job I have seen a lot of cases like this illnes that TCM has, with clinical behaviours similar to the way Ezra portrayed it.The one Who doesn t know what ""severe mental illness"" is is the author of the video. And also mental illness is a big and generic concept. There is a big misconception about it.",2021-03-16T19:57:56Z,0

He calls the shots.  Hum....just couldn't get past Molly Ringwald's performance in the original.  Laura San Giacomo, trying to play Nadine but just not able to sell the allure. Neither can Heard. They should have let Heather Graham play Nadine instead. Though I thought she was a darker character, like a Selma Blair/ Lara Flynn Boyle type.  I feel Marsden, is closer to Stu's character but missing a good ol' boy accent. Odessa is the Frannie I felt King was describing. Though not given the dialog that made her a strong player in the book.  There were two real highlights that make the original a should see anyways, that is Rob Lowe and Bill Faggerbakke, Kellie Oberby, playing Dayna, Ruby Dee and of course, Jamey Sheridan, as Randall Flagg, honorable mention for Corin Nemec for playing Harold and Ossie Davis.

Script wise the 1994 version did a much better job at telling the story. Sad, they fix a few problems and mess up so much more. I guess that is what happens when you are looking for progress to be good? And they still cannot get it right. Few King movies are.  It is a serious problem when you have a writer like King, who fleshes out his characters so well. It leaves Hollywood with a difficult job, or they make it difficult to find suitable actors. Doesn't make a lot of sense when a writer does the hard work for them.",2021-01-25T22:35:40Z,7

The twilight movies did it too and it was devastating. The books were great they had depth of character and relationships. They left important dialogue out that showed character relationship development and what they replaced it with left beloved characters feeling empty and fake. I think Harry Potter and Lord of the rings were the only movies that respected their stories enough to try and be true to the books even though you have to leave SOME dialogue out they left nothing out that needed to be replaced with rubbish.,2021-01-31T22:06:38Z,0
