She is basically trying to destroy him, and sadly thanx to this #metoo era we are in right now, she seems to be winning, cause she has all the media and sjws behind her. 

    None of us really know the full story or bigger picture only they do, but from everything i've read up and looked at, imo it just looks to me like Johnny Depp did seem to truly love Amber, but she was never ""in love"" with him, she was in love with his stardom, his fame, that ""Johnny Depp"" the movie star, all that part of him and she was probably hoping that fame was going to make her as big a star as he is, and like they would turn into this power couple or something. 

    Amber Turd is really quite pathetic and just like a monster inside because none of the fame or stardom really mattered in the end, she had him, they had eachother, but this is the crazy thing about celebrity and how we the public build up these famous celebs and movie stars. They have all this wealth and fame, and it's almost many of them just become a slave to it, cause they seem to loose track of whats truly ""REAL"", what they have right there in front of them. 

 Brad Pitt is another e.g. not saying he is anykind of bad person, but he was seriously stupid, he had it all, beautiful wife, kids everything and it's like he still wasnt happy and had to go fuck it all up boozing and smoking pot. 

   Now i would say regarding Depp it does honestly feel like a classic case of the older man trades up, gets a new, younger model over time. That kind of feels like what he basically did with Amber and it seemed to have burned him bad, but he really didnt deserve this.",2021-02-26T19:51:07Z,5

       The truth will come out one day believe, sadly it may be ages though till it does, because i think unfortunately we are just stuck in this particular time of #metoo, where women have never been believed in the past, so now they are believed no matter what! 

   Back in the 50s and 60s was a time where there was terrible racism in places like America, black people were not allowed in clubs mixing with white people, or not allowed to sit on bus with white people. 

  I only mention this as a example of look how times have changed, but unfortunately that was just the way society was back then. It's came along way, still got some way to go but things have improved.

Personally I thought he treats her so delicately because he doesn't respect himself enough to stand up to her. He might be full of self-loathing due to his drug and alcohol addiction, and he was probably manipulated by her into feeling guilty for ""being a handful"" during his relapses. A self-loathing person is the perfect prey for a narcissist. 
I think that he excuses her behaviour because he genuinely believes that he's way worse of a person and a partner, something like ""I have no right to get mad at her after she put up with me for years"".

107,UgyxOYnEmlEcV_BfYat4AaABAg,NatalieJune,"@lola amis Do you know if more are going to be release? Just thought I wouod ask. Thsnk you for doing this I really appreciate it. Women and men that have been in these types of marriages/relationships most of the time no one bekueved them because well it's so hard to believe how manipulative and cruel someone can be especially when they have been wonderful  aka on their best behavior in front if you. These recordings help victims explain it differently. This may be harsh but I would rather be hit every day than deal with the manipulation, lies, control tactics and being talked to like a father would talk to his young daughter.",2020-02-20T19:49:35Z,0

109,UgyxOYnEmlEcV_BfYat4AaABAg,Angela Baird,"@lola amis yes, plus its the media that hyped up and ran a me too smear campaign on him and they dont wanna admit they were part of the lie and basically helped perpetuate her abuse on him. All for a story and to push an agenda that all females are telling the truth about abuse.   No media outlet has been humble and brave enough to apollgize and tell the TRUTH!",2020-02-07T22:03:21Z,0

111,UgwQhxNd_ayDzWKN6_F4AaABAg,Ester Lev,"to be fair, what he actually says at the end is ""you're defending yourself against me about something I didn't f***inkg do"" which from the context is in reference to spreading the rumor about her being a stripper. This is also the only time in the entire recording that he gets angry and vocally denies what she's accusing him of, which I find curious. Like, she's been calling him an abuser, said he threw the phone at her face and even mentioned previous altercations none of which he denied, yet his breaking point only comes when she accuses him of feeding the media salacious rumors about her past.",2020-03-29T12:49:51Z,0
112,UgwQhxNd_ayDzWKN6_F4AaABAg,van doe,"but it's better now because his name is atleast cleaned a bit, i don't think he's really happy about what the public sees Amber now, because that's not what he want but he know he had to do something to stop all the fire that goes through hik",2020-03-10T19:37:18Z,1
113,UgwQhxNd_ayDzWKN6_F4AaABAg,NatalieJune,She projects constantly and is a professional gaslighter.  It can take people years sometimes decades to realize it's happening to them. Especially when it is by someone¬† you love and might be married too also. I'm happy Johnny saw thru this before decades went by and that he didn't go through this any longer than he did. It's takes a huge toll on people. The sooner you realize that it is happening the easier it is to leave. The longer it takes the harder it is to walk away for most not all but a lot. It's psychological and emotional abuse and it is hell.,2020-02-07T04:30:55Z,5
114,UgwFjfEpV0hXX9SUbKV4AaABAg,NatalieJune,"I think she didn't want him to leave. She wanted him to sit there and take it, hoping he would lose control and hit her. However he decided to remove himself. This pissed her off. If he stayed then her plan might have worked.¬†(It wouldn't have been a fair fight so I for sure would be looked  like the abused victim acting in self defense. Then everyone feels sorry for me, I get pity, fame, and money.) I never wanted that I want you I love you but now I am not letting you get away with your behavior for free Johnny. Its so frustrating All you had to do is NOT SPLIT while I'm arguing with you. Just Sit there, shut up, and when I'm done, ADMIT I THAT I AM RIGHT. It's not that hard, you know I am always right ok I'll be honest 95% of the time I'm right. Pleas Johnny for me for us please just remember I'M RIGHT YOUR WRONG ALWAYS. Then I wouldn't completely lose it which means besides possibly tgrowing the occasional POT, PAN and maybe VASES I would never hit you.  I don't even punch you now, i just hit you. That's what you want isnt it? For the physical stuff to stop. Its what i want. Marriage is sacred and I worked SO HARD FOR THAT WEDDING. Now why is that so Hard for you to do? Johnny WHY WONT YOU FIGHT FOR ME? I just told you exactly what to do and all our problems would be solved. Why Johnny Why? That's all you had to do, but no you couldn't. So all of this is your fault you caused all of this DON'T blame it on me. I reacted and acted because you made me and other times it was by DEFAULT.",2020-02-07T05:18:22Z,4
