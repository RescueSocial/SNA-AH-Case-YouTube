Black Manta learns of this existing biotechnology, and becomes hell bent on achieving it for himself so that he may even destroy the kingdoms and rule the seas as an unstoppable pirate. Believing in the importance of his bloodline, as his father did, he brings his teenage/young adult son on this journey to train him and teach him of Atlantis and why they do what they do. Of course, Kal is morally conflicted by what his father is teaching him, but he goes along with it, as they hunt down Dolphin. Aquaman spends this time helping Dolphin fight against Manta, but also trying to learn the secrets to how a surface dweller could've changed their biology. In the climax, just when Manta is about to achieve his goal, his son takes the power instead and turns against him, realizing the atrocities his father has committed and who the real heroes are.

1149,Ugy8cM0bLAJSdanw3fB4AaABAg,Recast her! The character is bigger than the actor. Mera is akin to what Lois is to the Superman mythology. She is not only Arthur‚Äôs predominant love interest but she is an incredibly powerful visually dynamic and  and queen of Atlantis. WB have already recast Rachel Dawes in the Dark Knight  and recently  of course their Batman. This shouldn‚Äôt be a problem. If you cast a big name to replace her. Maybe Jessica Chastain or  Emelia Clarke? Again this is  presuming Amber Heard is found guilty. I think this whole thing will end in a settlement. I don‚Äôt think Depp comes out of this totally absolved either. It was a toxic relationship they brought out the worst in each other.

And there's this... For the most part Grace is always telling us that we (comic and movie fans- the ones that are in the known of the business) are very small in comparison to the rest of the regular movie goers and that's true.

So there's no need to recast her as most people won't know or are interested in personal things just in the movies themselves.

...look what happened with James Gunn. And say what you will, and even though he didn't actually did anything, still it was a very disgusting and sad situation yet he got to stay.

Let Amber Heard stay and just don't let her promote the movie and/or choose the media that would interview her.

Or, at the worst case, skip her for the second one and have her come back in the third.

Again, Mera is an amazing character and Amber Heard did a great job.
