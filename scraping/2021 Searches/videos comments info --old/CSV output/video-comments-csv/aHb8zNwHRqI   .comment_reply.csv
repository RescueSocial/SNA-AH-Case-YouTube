0,Ugw8A1E1W2NEae8GSw94AaABAg,KayKay2513,"@jerry linger ¬† can you link any proof?  I just went looking and I have not seen any proof.  Just the court files which are just accusations. 

Also, who cares if Scamber Turd is a woman.  The evidence is there, we've all seen it.  There is NO evidence that I have seen of his.  Just accusations 4 years after the divorce.  

I would also say it's the other way around with the men vs women thing.  Men have been being cancelled ever since the me too movement started.  Sooooo many men were cancelled and hated on BUT when a WOMAN is a proven liar, committed perjury on three continents, and shown to be abusive  to her ex husband then why hasn't she been cancelled yet?  Why does Johnny lose his roles, his work, his passion, because she falsely accused him of abuse?  I don't understand why people cannot see why this is sooooo outrageous!  Abuser have no gender and what she did, all her actions are gross and she should be held accountable but she has not been yet.  It's not ""hate"", it's frustration at our society that allows women to abuse men freely.  It should not be allowed.  I'm saying this as a victim of domestic abuse by a man.  It doesn't matter man or woman and I don't know how many time I have to say it to get it through to people.  

Also, channels are allowed to cover what ever they want on THEIR CHANNEL.  If you are so passionate about it, start making videos of it.  This channel does not have to cater to every celebrity that gets accusations.  I believe he covers JD and her because there has been evidence to show her appalling behaviour and nothing has been done!  She faces no consequences and it is wrong.  You have to speak on things you feel are wrong!

I hope you can get some insight by my words and don't completely deflect and try to make this a fight instead of a discussion. 


Also also, why do you ask people who comment, why the channel does not do something you want it to do?  That's very weird, you should be asking the channel not some random person.  ü§®",2021-07-13T04:49:25Z,0
1,Ugw8A1E1W2NEae8GSw94AaABAg,Ronaldo F,@jerry linger You are using whataboutism to try and direct attention away from AH. This isn't just about AH being an abuser. this case has got this much attention because she tried to destroy his life and it worked. The only reason he has any support is because AH has continuously got caught in lies exposing her as the abuser. JD got fired from his work for false accusations while AH kept hers. This case is more about double standards and men being presumed guilty without evidence while women are assumed innocent in the face of undisputable evidence. You are comparing apples and oranges. when Jeremy Renner accuses his wife of a bunch of abuse in public causes her to lose all her work then you might gain more traction. Cases that are littered with injustices are going to receive more attention than those that don't.,2021-07-02T19:29:02Z,0

3,Ugw8A1E1W2NEae8GSw94AaABAg,Julie Lea,"@jerry linger Amber Heard is a female who committed perjury on 3 Continents, broke the NDA on a WORLDWIDE basis-Judge Bruce White and committed abuse to further her career...permanently cutting off JD's finger who is a musician. 
 This has been going on for 4 yrs, guaranteed this fellow renner is not THE SAME as Amber Heard.
 Methinks you know nothing about the facts of the case.
 Check back in 4 yrs & see if there are 87 CCTV, police cam footage, & audio of renner repeatedly & blatantly admitting to his crimes. 
 I don't know who he is! I lnow who Johnny Depp is, & the rest of the World...another reason JD speaking out for Domestic Violence Victims is so important.
  This guy wouldn't be getting attention now if not for the JD case! No way! All DV victims are important, BUT JD set the precedent, giving up a great deal to do so.
 There isn't nearly enough evidence in the Renner case ....apples & oranges.",2021-07-01T04:34:34Z,1

29,UgyrAUBngC8pSzvKil54AaABAg,Branda Stark,"I get where you're coming from, but the actor knew the role was a hot potato when he accepted it, so he's gonna be under fire until the end (personally, I don't have anything against him)
Also, I find the situation very fishy, there were reports that the morale is low on the Crimes of Grindewald's set, and that the movie is going to bomb, and suddenly he gives a statement that he was gonna talk to JD and what not, even though more than a year has passed since he replaced him, I mean, why say this now? And like you said, WB must be very strict about what the actors can say about JD. I don't know, I believe the studio is using him for damage control. 
I won't attack the actor as I won't attack momoa, but I won't watch their movies. It won't affect them, because by the time the movie is in theaters, they would already have been paid.",2021-06-29T14:44:22Z,2
