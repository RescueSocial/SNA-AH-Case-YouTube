One post clarifies everything and he also doesn't have any creative criticism becuz his content is so damn lazy. It's the same topic over and over. I'm not here to tell u what to enjoy but what I'm saying is his content has become VERY lazy compared to his older content where he actually put some effort into it.

He makes the same content with the same thumbnail format, the same title format and the same video format every single time without creativity at all. He has no personality no humor and once again no creativity. He makes videos by just reading twitter headlines and callsit content with some stupid hypixel gameplay in the background. He used to make actual entertaining content at one point but soon realized they werent pulling in the views. So he made a vid on quackity getting cancelled and after seeing the amount of views he decided to ditch his work ethic and run after the money. And dont even get me stared on the amount of clickbait on his channel like for eg
Title: Tommyinnit got cancelled
2 mins into the vid: well he didnt actually get cancelled. 
And dont bring up the point that so many ppl watch him that means he is entertaining. No. minecwaf kids will watch anything with any member of the dream smp member in the title and thumbnail and he knows it thats why he decided to ditch makin good content and went to the money route.
