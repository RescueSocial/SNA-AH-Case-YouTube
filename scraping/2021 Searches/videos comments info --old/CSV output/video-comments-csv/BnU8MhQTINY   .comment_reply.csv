17,UgyEXItgXoKU4RAlcc54AaABAg,NIBS,"@Last Emperor , how delightful to hear from you.  I had a suspicion that you would leave comments on every ""pro-Depp"" comment in this thread.  I find the psychopathy of obsessive fandom very interesting.  I had no idea that you were so personally involved in this case.  You would be of much more assistance to Ms. Heard if you were willing to take the stand to testify on her behalf, because although you *know* that Ms. Heard was attacked ""no less than twelve times"", as of this moment, she has no viable evidence that she was ever attacked.  I state with confidence that the incident involving broken glass alcohol bottles would have resulted in a hospitalization of no less than three weeks.  I have unfortunate experience with such injuries.  The paramedics arriving with the ambulance would have medicated the subject with narcotic painkiller.  The injuries would have chemical burns from introduction of alcohol and contaminants into them.  A team could have removed the glass and contaminants over a period of about eight hours, using x-rays to locate the glass shards, which covered the patients entire back and the bottoms of both feet.  Then the injuries would have to be closed, using staples, stitches, tape or adhesive, depending on the size and depth of each cut.  Glass bottles produce very jagged cuts, so infection is always a concern.  The patient would require a Tetanus shot, and a full course of antibiotics.  The high risk of infection would result in the length of the hospitalization.  A professional would be required to change the dressings and monitor the wounds.  The patient could not do this themselves, as the injuries on the back and soles of feet would not be accessible, and the pain would require sustained amounts of painkiller.  The injuries could not be exposed to the sun for a period of a year, as the scar tissue has a tendency to pigment.  After a year, the reconstructive surgery could begin, minimizing ripples and reducing the scars to fine lines.  Unfortunately, there is no record of any of this.  A single report of an x-ray would go a long way to prove abuse in the United States.  The upcoming trial will be very different from the British Trial, as Ms. Heard will be the defendant in this case.  Opinions will not matter.  Only verifiable evidence will be admitted.",2020-12-20T03:52:13Z,0

20,UgwP91V06lteXZZUuY54AaABAg,NIBS,"@Christina Taft , I'm sorry, but you have confused me with someone else.  I have never been charged with any crime, and never been arrested.  My work requires that I have Police checks regularly.  I am a survivor of narcissistic abuse, and now counsel young people facing narcissistic abuse and it's resulting trauma.

At the time Ms. Heard left Highschool in Texas, she was arrested for a crime that resulted in a five year driving ban.  There is no crime in my country that can result in such a prolonged ban, therefore the crime must be singular.  The arrest record is sealed, but is archived, and may be one of the arrest records that Ms. Heard has been ordered to produce for the Virginia defamation trial.  We are aware of the existence of this sealed arrest because Ms. Heard was arrested in California for driving while her license was revoked.  In 2009, in the Seattle/Tacoma International airport, Ms. Heard was arrested for the domestic assault of her wife, Tasya van Ree (at the time, Ms. Heard had changed her name to Amber van Ree).  The assault was witnessed by the two arresting officers, and an airport full of people.  Ms. van Ree had a valuable piece of jewelry ripped from her neck during the assault.  The officers queried Ms. van Ree if she wanted Ms. Heard arrested, and she responded in the affirmative.  Ms. Heard was taken to the Police Station for booking, and spent the night in jail.  She was arraigned the following day (an audio recording of the arraignment survives, and is accessible if you desire to listen to it).  The Judge and the prosecutor noted that both women lived out of state, and for that reason opted to hold the case open for a period of two years, on the chance that Ms. Heard would reoffend, or that Tasya van Ree would decide to prosecute Ms. Heard.  When Ms. Heard met Mr. Depp, she attempted to have this arrest expunged from her record.  When the press discovered the arrest, Ms. Heard suborned *the victim of the assault* , Tasya van Ree, to release a statement that would clear her name.  If a *man* had assaulted a *woman,* and then contacted the *victim* of the assault to write a statement *to clear his name,* the #MeToo movement would have erupted in *outrage.*

This is the statement of Tasya van Ree:  ""In 2009, Amber was wrongfully accused for an incident that was misinterpreted and over-sensationalized by two individuals in a power position.  I recount hints of misogynistic attitudes towards us which later appeared to be homophobic when they found out we were domestic partners and not just 'friends'.  Charges were quickly dropped and she was released moments later.""  She added ""It is disheartening that Amber's integrity and story are being questioned yet again.""

This statement contained so many lies, that the arresting officer, Officer Beverly Leonard, agreed to give an interview correcting the mistakes Ms. van Ree made.  The official declaration submitted to the Court indicated Ms. van Ree called the Police to have Amber Heard arrested.  Officer Beverly Leonard is an openly gay woman, and Gay Rights Advocate, who donates her time to domestic abuse shelters.  She found the description of her as ""misogynistic"" and ""homophobic"" to be amusing and inaccurate.  The charges were *not* quickly dropped, and Ms. Heard was *not* released ""moments later"" as Tasya van Ree did not provide bail for Ms. Heard, and she was forced to spend the night in jail.  Even Ms. van Ree's final statement, ""Amber's integrity and story are being questioned *YET AGAIN""* is worded to make Ms. Heard appear a ""victim"".  Ms. Heard went to great lengths to make sure this arrest story did not become public knowledge.  I can not find any record of it being reported before the Depp/Heard divorce...which is when Ms. van Ree wrote this story...therefore Ms. Heard's credibility was *never* questioned.

Ms. Heard's other arrests were not for physical altercations, but I do find the Australia case particularly distasteful.  Ms. Heard pleaded guilty to falsifying official documentation to Australian Immigration to smuggle her two tea-cup yorkies into the country, *knowing* the dogs would be euthanized if they were caught.  All animals must be quarantined before being admitted into Australia, because ""Rabies"" does not exist on that continent.  The only test that is conclusive for ""Rabies"" requires the dissection of the animals brain.  It was revealed during the British Trial, that Ms. Heard had suborned perjury from Estate Manager Kevin Murphy, threatening to have him fired.  Mr. Murphy began proceedings to change his testimony when Mr. Depp and Ms. Heard divorced.  He has documentation that proves he repeatedly told Ms. Heard what the consequences would be, if she smuggled the dogs into the country.  It was cruel to endanger those two small, innocent pets.

Ms. Heard has some other arrests that will be exposed during the Virginia Trial, as the Judge has ruled her previous arrests are necessary to the case.  We may learn of other incidents, but the abuse arrest is definitely pertinent in this case, as a narcissistic abuser will have a history of abuse, and will continue to abuse.  This is part of the disorder.

22,UgwP91V06lteXZZUuY54AaABAg,NIBS,"@Last Emperor , how eloquent you are.  Your extensive education and experience are put beautifully on display.  You are truly the finest example of an ""Amber Heard Fan"" that I have had the pleasure to encounter.  I am, conversely, not interested in any of the ""personalities"" involved in this case.  I am a narcissistic abuse survivor and counsellor, heavily concerned with the litigations of such crimes.  It is, sadly, not unusual to see crimes of this sort mishandled by the Court systems all over the world.  Fortunately, where the law may fail us, Behavioral Science always delivers justice in the end.  You have nothing to fear from this outcome, as you have so succinctly illustrated your belief that Amber Heard is not a narcissist (although she does have that diagnosed disorder.)  Narcissists are absolutely incapable of changing their pattern of behavior.  A narcissistic abuser will have abused in their past, and, most importantly, they will abuse again in their future.  It is only a matter of time before the truth will be irrevocably established.  Incidentally, the Virginia Court ruled today to allow Amber Heard's prior arrest for the Domestic Assault of her wife, Tasya van Ree, in 2009, witnessed by two arresting Police Officers (and an International Airport full of people), and held open for a period of two years from the arraignment.",2020-12-20T03:20:45Z,0

 I'm quite overqualified to ""speculate"" & NOTHING IS CLEAR.
 I SPECULATE that her ACTIONS from Australia (thinks laws don't apply to her), to going PUBLIC 2 days after the death of his Mother, to demanding $50,000 a mo spousal support (withdrawing due to her attorney, it looks bad), marrying a man when she's GAY for fame & money (she's only been with men who could DO SOMETHING FOR HER!), & there's ONLY ONE REASON SHE REFUSED TO GIVE HER DEPOSITION (even after the Judge ORDERED it) & she  DID refuse to take him to Court, DUH, dropping the case, even though she was forced to give the money to charity....although she threw a FIT & I don't know how much she gave/kept.
 That's her ACTIONS. SPOUSAL ABUSE ON HER PART!!!! Abusers do NOT marry ABUSERS! They marry passive people they can manipulate....THIS IS FACT.
 The CLEAR evidence is nowhere! She made a tape of Depp when he was upset (due to finding out his managers had stole MILLIONS).
 She SOLD the tape. Which shows her abusing Depp. She's been out all night, she lies, gaslights & baits him (ABUSIVE BEHAVIOR) ON THE TAPE!!!!
 If you were a abused person or a psychologist or even had the common sense of a ant, you would see he's not abusive.
 In spite of being upset about having millions stolen AND being married to a whore who stays out all night not bothering to call in, he never faces her, calls her a name, or does anything remotely abusive. He kicks a cabinet. GUESS WHAT? If he was abusive he would be hitting HER!! Abusers don't hurt THEMSELVES, moron.
 Even with the baiting, etc going on, HE NEVER FACES HER.
 The Court ruled this inadmissible bc no abuse takes place, despite her efforts 
 This is a TAPE. It's FACT, not my opinion.
 I'm not a Depp fan, I'm a psychologist & advocate for DV victims!
 That's why I followed the case, & am upset a abuser is ruining the #metoo movement.
 It's so blatant if you understand ABUSIVE NARCISSISTIC PEOPLE.
  Watch a video on REAL abuse & see a abuser hurting himself instead of the victim....it doesn't happen.
 #MEN ARE ABUSED TOO.
 She's TEXTBOOK, he's not her 1st victim.
 
 When he sues the Sun & all the evidence is in court, it will be HORRIBLE FOR FEMALE VICTIMS! Some nobody in Hollywood already accused a man of abuse, the press called his X wife thinking she made the allegations, then the 2nd former wife, both said he never hit them.....abusers start young, LIKE HEARD, not in their 50's. And women since his 1st wife Lori Allison from the 80's publicly defended Depp of their own accord. Sherilyn Fenn, Kate Moss, Vanessa Paradis (who called Heard a liar & was with him 14 yrs prior to Heard). 
 This is well documented in all psychiatric journals dealing with abuse.

 AND NO ONE ADDRESSES THE FACT SHE WAS ARRESTED FOR DV & NOW IS REPRESENTING THE PEOPLE SHE TERRORIZED!!!!
 MEN GET ABUSED TOO. WELL DOCUMENTED BY FRIENDS, EMPLOYEE'S, AND CO-WORKERS ON PIRATES. 
 And NOW JK ROWLING, WHO YOU CLAIM TO HAVE MORE INFO & BE SMARTER THAN, SHE'S SEEN THE DOCUMENTATION.
 WHEN YOU FIND A ANGRY, DRUNK, ABUSER WHO NEVER TOUCHES HIS ""VICTIM"" I'LL RECONSIDER. Doesn't happen. I've seen both male & female abusers personally as well as hundreds of cases as a psychologist & advocate. Probably since before you were born.

60,UgxOpu6HOv9woT9z-iF4AaABAg,Zombies anyone,"Pfsif a last time just for you .... it is agreed between the two that Depp pays the 7 mio in installments to her
with the last one supposed to be payed in January 2018. Heard then has time until the end of 2018 to
pay the promised amounts to charity. Don‘t ask me why, but it‘s how it reads in the agreement. So please
stop this defaming shit and useyour time to direct your hate to the people who really are responsible for it.
Thanks !",2018-01-07T10:42:25Z,1

63,UgxIpxKEhkeIdu6hz4p4AaABAg,NIBS,"@Yom Kippur , if there was no doubt of it...WHY did Ms. Heard DROP ALL HER ALLEGATIONS OF DOMESTIC ABUSE rather than submit a single piece of her ""evidence"" to the court for testing and verification?",2020-02-18T23:04:13Z,1
64,UgxIpxKEhkeIdu6hz4p4AaABAg,NIBS,"Wow! This comment hasn't aged well. Even two years ago, people paying attention knew this story began with an extortion letter from Ms. Heard's lawyer to Mr. Depp. BEFORE she made ANY allegations against him. Ms. Heard demanded 50,000$ monthly support, the Range Rover (Mr. Depp to pay costs and maintenance.), three Penthouse Apartments valued at 13,000,000$ (Mr. Depp to pay utilities and fees.), 100,000$ lawyer's fees, 25,000 forensic accounting, AND a sizeable divorce settlement. If Mr. Depp had PAID Ms. Heard ALL of the MONEY and GOODS that she wanted...she would have quietly divorced him. If he did not, she assured him that she would destroy his reputation. When Ms. Heard discovered Mr.         Depp was not willing to accede to her demands,  Ms. Heard fabricated ""evidence"" and sold it to the tabloids (People) for cold, hard cash. She also tampered with ""evidence"" and sold it to the tabloids (People) for cold, hard cash. Multiple signed affidavits confirm that she tampered with witnesses. Ms. Heard made an illegal video of Mr. Depp without his knowledge or consent and sold it to TMZ for cold, hard cash (the video actually CONFIRMS that an angry Mr. Depp NEVER TOUCHED HER!). Ms. Heard then committed perjury on her abuse allegations deposition. BUT WHEN IT CAME TIME to turn her ""evidence"" over to the court for testing and verification...SHE. DROPPED. ALL. HER. ALLEGATIONS. OF. DOMESTIC. ABUSE. Now Ms. Heard cannot escape the testing and verification of her ""evidence"". The world will see that SHE was not only the ONLY Domestic Abuser, but that she broke multiple laws, with intent to harm, to defraud, and to defame. Add to that that she is a REPEAT Domestic Abuse OFFENDER...and she is going back to jail for a very long time. The only question is, will iO Tillit Wright, and Raquel Pennington be willing to go to jail with her as her accomplices?",2020-02-18T23:01:15Z,5

to be meaningful while it is just the usual illogical behavior you find in any case. We‘re humans, not chess
