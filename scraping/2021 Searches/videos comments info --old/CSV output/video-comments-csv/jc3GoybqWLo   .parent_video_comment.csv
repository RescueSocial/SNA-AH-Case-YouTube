They're about family feuds, cosmic chess games, projectiles and pyrotechnics that can level entire city blocks or reduce planets to asteroids. You want Asian representation, there's a Shang Chi movie coming out in July despite it never being a priority title even as a comic. We could have had a Sleepwalker movie, a great mythology wrapped in a hard to find or underrated comic book. But because of a fictitious need for 'representation', we get Shang Chi ahead of Morbius, Infinity Watch, Darkhawk, Sleepwalker, The Eternals, etc. I don't watch movies for representation and neither does anyone else. We watch movies because we need our Campbellian Hero's Journey fix.",Hatchet Mouth,0,2021-03-19T22:00:42Z

4,UgyXfVP5pkQgQsHcF0R4AaABAg,It can be Dolphin or Siren or a completely new character. Either way it's good that Wan wants an Asian actress. The first movie was quite popular on the Asian market and it would show that he cares. Heard's case tho is very bad but sidelining Mera just because the actress did some shady stuff is awful. Still it's just a rumor and who knows if it's just an attention grabbing move from a scooper.,alexpiperhalliwell,3,2020-12-23T00:34:06Z
