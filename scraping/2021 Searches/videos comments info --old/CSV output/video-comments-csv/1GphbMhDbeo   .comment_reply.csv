1,Ugw1Opk98ygOpemtqlt4AaABAg,Crazy Duck Thing,"@Linda Ciolkosz Ok, I get what you're saying, but I have three main issues. One; while men are more likely to be abusive and mess up a woman's life, they do not have a tendency too. It's still fairly uncommon for this to happen.Two; I'm not saying that women don't lose a lot in a separation, yet men lose a lot as well. Johnny Depp lost two of his biggest acting roles. Three; what happens in the majority of cases doesn't really matter here. Most of the evidence says that Amber Heard was at least physically abusive towards Johnny, so why should other cases affect it?",2021-02-28T00:52:22Z,0
2,Ugw1Opk98ygOpemtqlt4AaABAg,Linda Ciolkosz,"@Crazy Duck Thing OK, Duck. They(men) have tendency to mess up a women’s life... 2nd definition -(2.
a situation or state of affairs that is confused or full of difficulties.) Women being more emotional & cleave, wholeheartedly; men dominate, bully, & control. But divorced women have to pick up pieces w/lower income bracket, 
making their own way again, older(physical attributes go downhill), being spring loaded to date & find another may be more difficult. Comprendez vous, s’il vous plait?",2021-02-28T00:18:27Z,0
3,Ugw1Opk98ygOpemtqlt4AaABAg,Crazy Duck Thing,"@Linda Ciolkosz I know full well that most domestic abuse is carried out by men. But from your reply, I may not have fully understood your point when you said, ""MEN HAVE “A TENDENCY” TO MAKE WOMEN MESSY!"" Can you clarify what you mean with this?",2021-02-27T19:34:12Z,0
4,Ugw1Opk98ygOpemtqlt4AaABAg,Linda Ciolkosz,"@Crazy Duck Thing YOUR A LUCKY DUCK, BUT THE “TENDENCY” IS THERE IN A MAN/WOMAN RELATIONSHIP; WHILE EACH HAS HIS OWN EXPERIENCES IT IS A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF “MEN” THAT ARE ABUSIVE(PHYSICALLY, MENTALLY & EMOTIONALLY NOTWITHSTANDING— FINANCIALLY!)LOOK UP THE NUMBERS!",2021-02-27T18:02:38Z,0
5,Ugw1Opk98ygOpemtqlt4AaABAg,Crazy Duck Thing,"How do men tend to make women messy? In the none of the heterosexual relationships that I personally know of has there been abuse from women, and only one of them with an abusive man. Perhaps you are attempting (failing) to generalise the the entire female gender as violent from your own experiences.",2021-02-27T10:15:21Z,1
6,UgzZ31YG8G3QLXVSf554AaABAg,Crazy Duck Thing,"Firstly, lay off the caps lock. Secondly, I doubt that the ""LITTLE GIRLS"" you are talking about care very much about who exactly the actress is; she isn't Elsa. Thirdly, the aforementioned little girls don't make up a very large percentile of Aquaman's audience, at least not enough who are going to up and ignore the film. Fourthly, while the idea that what happens outside of movies should not affect what happens inside of movies is a half decent point, Johnny Depp lost his role as Captain Jack Sparrow in all upcoming ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" movies as well as his role as Grindelwald in ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them 3."" If he lost his roles due to domestic allegations, why shouldn't she? Lastly, if you choose to dignify my comment with a response, please attempt to use proper grammar, and don't say ""POO POO ON U.""",2021-02-27T10:09:46Z,0
