3,UgxN8zhqSPmcoht93594AaABAg,Donald Dolan,"@gigittyNefertiti ""Times Up"".. I completely forgot about the ""other"" movement name! Thank you for the reminder! üòä  And yes, I think you're absolutely correct.. that she and her friends were planning on either killing him or driving him to suicide.. or at the very least an ""accidental"" fatal overdose. But I think they thought they had more time to plan that out, but that JD through a monkey wrench into the works for that plan by finally standing up for himself and telling her he wanted a divorce! That, she hadn't accounted for in her long range plan. But I could absolutely see her playing the role of grieving widow to the nth-degree and relishing every minute of it.",2021-03-06T01:26:00Z,2
4,UgxN8zhqSPmcoht93594AaABAg,gigittyNefertiti,"@Donald Dolan I agree completely she used those movements to her advantage to further the hoax, it was almost like ""perfect timing"" and everyone from times up and the aclu who are on her side still are showing they don‚Äôt really care about true victims, it‚Äôs a popularity contest because like you said she has made it even more difficult for actual victims of both sexes to have their stories taken into consideration, but yeah with the case going public it‚Äôs gonna be interesting everything else that comes out, cuz we‚Äôve only gotten like 2 tapes and elevator clips... I also think she may have been planning to even kill Johnny at some point which is terrifying",2021-03-06T01:06:09Z,2
5,UgxN8zhqSPmcoht93594AaABAg,Donald Dolan,"@gigittyNefertiti All great points! As you mentioned, she's probably gotten away with so much over the years, was never held accountable for anything that we're aware of.. and chose JD because he was soft spoken - which she equated to being a pushover/patsy for her schemes and hoax, but in the end he pushed back, drew a line in the sand and said no more.. let's end this civilly, but even then she chose not to accept his offer. Why? In my opinion it was because the ""Me Too"" ""Believe ALL Women"" movement had just gotten underway with Harvey Weinstein, and she locked on to that as her DV story. She single-handedly brought that movement crashing down and damaged ALL REAL DV survivors.. Female and Male alike.. with JD being one of them as we've learned. It's going to get interesting what new stories she concocts as the trial nears.",2021-03-05T23:04:20Z,2
6,UgxN8zhqSPmcoht93594AaABAg,gigittyNefertiti,"I personally think she came up with the hoax years ago like you said but hadn‚Äôt found her prey yet. The drugs and alcohol I‚Äôm sure took a toll on her but also I think people around her feed her ego and she thought she could get away with it, I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôs gotten away with so many things over the years and never had to pay any consequences. Also I‚Äôm sure she thought Johnny was weak and wouldn‚Äôt stand up for himself or retaliate because he loved her so much.",2021-03-05T22:35:28Z,0

17,UgwqK3W9qi8JFHl19hl4AaABAg,Sarah Wells,"@Doctor Soup she so planned this, I read that article a few years ago, its been circulating for a while. Its becoming common knowledge that she's up to her eyes in drugs and alcohol and she's the one who smokes pre made cigarettes, just before she said that Johnny burnt his own face with his own hand rolled cigarette, which irritatingly go out frequently because the tobacco isn't as tightly rolled as manufactured ones. Although I do think her manufactured lies are going out very frequently ü§£",2021-03-04T17:57:32Z,8

19,UgwqK3W9qi8JFHl19hl4AaABAg,Mimi B,Kate James even spoke of it in one of her statements. She said she often talked about her drug use as if she was bragging about it. So she can't say she was just bs-ing her way through this interview. Her own assistant backs it up.üòè,2021-03-04T17:30:59Z,6
