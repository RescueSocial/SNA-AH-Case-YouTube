While talking about married life she insisted on having 'fiercely independent spirit' and that quote about falling in love again and again which is weird. She was facing constant abuse, not always physical, during the relationship but Depp used his friends, employees and money to consantly manipulate her back into the relationship. That is why she had to fall in love 'again and again' and also why she had to get a restraining order. She is an opportunist like everyone else in Hollywood but no doubt went through shit with Depp and thankfully got better of it.",2018-04-27T06:49:54Z,4

It¬¥s not true. Elvis was heavily pill addicted since the Fifties. Especially after the death of his mother. He was pill addicted and absolutely wasted when he died. Doctors said his veins were the veins of an old man. He died because of pill (and possibly drug) abuse. And he fell in love with Priscilla, when she was 14 and he was 24 (!). He kept her in a golden cage for several years until she was old enough to get married. And a few years after their child¬¥s birth she left him for what she thought would be a better life for her. Elvis wasn¬¥t just ""decent"". He used to¬† shoot TV¬¥s and asked Nixon to make him an ""official sheriff"" against drug dealers (being addicted himself) and kept a 14 year old in his mansion. If you call Johnny drug addicted and sexual pervert, you might as well name Elvis the same. And I write this even though I used to be a huge Elvis fan and still am fond of his early recordings. He was human - good and bad at the same time. Like the rest of us.",2016-03-23T16:08:43Z,0
82,UgitoSxgyyGEYHgCoAEC,LoveAndLaughter,"@social networking spy
When did I say I was 13? Maybe you¬¥re the liar? And being 13 is being in your teens. Elvis may have been younger than Johnny, but still he could easily have been my father (and, thank heaven, Johnny is still alive, Elvis didn¬¥t manage...). And Johnny is not ""not far from 60"", he¬¥s 52, that¬¥s a way away from 60. But, well, I think I can survive if you don¬¥t want to talk to me (actually, you did talk a lot for not wanting to talk to me). And all you say is that a 52 year old can¬¥t be loved by¬† a young girl (obviously it can happen). But it¬¥s okay to love old Elvis as a young girl? So where do you draw the line between 42 and 52, when it will be still okay for a young girl to have a crush on somebody? It can only be a notional line, I guess. An individual border you make up in your mind. I¬¥m wasting my time, you don¬¥t want to talk to me... :-)",2016-03-22T16:36:02Z,0
