Prior to Aquaman movie Aquaman was fairly unknown character. Fact that one movie was a success, does not establish him as a major character.

It's not fair because while the actress who is currently attached is someone that should be disliked, Mera is not deserving of such hate and the name of the character shouldn't be ruined permanently because of the reputation of the celebrity who is unfortunately connected to Mera. 

She is a good character who has always been a decent partner-in-crime fighting for Aquaman. People should not condemn Aquaman's wife as if the character is only relevant because of Amber Heard.

WB are playing a big game I when it comes to international box takings with only streaming on HBO cause most of the money comes from worldwide success and if it has a bad review when it‚Äôs released worldwide it‚Äôll tank üò® I‚Äôm going to see it but I don‚Äôt have my hopes set too high.I‚Äôm Sooooo hoping there‚Äôs no solo Mera Film Imagine how boring that film would be  he! he!",The Killing Joke,1,2020-11-20T06:30:05Z

85,UgywJkOasQwMEnlUSFB4AaABAg,"Oh yeah, she should totally get her own movie. I mean come on everyone she's a victim after all, she totally deserves it. üòí

Is it at all obvious that I'm being sarcastic. Well, I'm only going to put as much effort into my sarcasm as Amber puts into her rumors. Which I assume isn't that much given the source of said rumors.",Raymond Candela,2,2020-11-20T06:26:47Z
86,UgyfdPsplbNyNVrbkQB4AaABAg,"It takes a long time to develop a movie. From coming up with a story, writing a script, finding a cast, getting the money together and planning strategies for distribution it isn‚Äôt necessarily a done deal. When AM2 tanks because of her, maybe they will finally understand, we don‚Äôt want her because her continuous behavior. It‚Äôs really a pity that Mamoa has to pay for such a stupid decision.",Penney Burgess,5,2020-11-20T06:25:51Z

AH needs to be permanently relegated to the bottom of the trash heap and, forgotten.

91,UgyFNRpPBFoVPMjAadB4AaABAg,"On a side note, someone mentioned Amber Heard is in the 2020 remake of The Stand TV miniseries. I don't think that the 90s version of The Stand needed to be remade, but whatever. In this remake Amber Heard plays Nadine Cross, a woman who betrays the good guys for power and to stand at the side of the antagonist of the story. Way to broaden those acting horizons, Amber!",Miles H,9,2020-11-20T05:57:55Z
92,UgyjpBQaJjjkdIMKEZl4AaABAg,"Lol why a mera solo film of all characters? Mera isn't that big of a character to warrant a solo film to be honest. I'd rather see  a solo  film about ocean master or black manta.

Also just realized you're playing the Nintendo Wii mii music‚ò∫üòõ

Also did you say ""illuminerdi""? Instead of illuminati? Haha im just teasing you trishy! Don't hurt me lol‚ò∫üòâ you'd make a great voice announcer you have a powerful voice.

96,Ugxiu4yNlrHqh-_q3Ot4AaABAg,this is a rumor.  there is no way in hell they're gonna give her a movie.  they're already prepared to cut her out of the film.  i've been saying this: she'd better be happy with this and The Stand because those are probably the last two jobs she's ever gonna get.,chicostephenson,35,2020-11-20T05:41:16Z

105,UgzYMrCTQ1T4_1fPSTB4AaABAg,"I mean given how most people don't even know Mera and how she doesn't have many enemies who go after her, I don't think a solo Mera film is a good idea.
