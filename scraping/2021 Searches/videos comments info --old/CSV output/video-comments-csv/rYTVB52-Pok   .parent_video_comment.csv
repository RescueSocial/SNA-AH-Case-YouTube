Both of them are flawed - like all of us - but only AH is a criminal that obviously planned this to blackmail or extort money- the worst of it abusing johny mentally and physically. I remember i saw the cover of people magazine with her fake injury - yet there is actual recording of her admitting her abuse and i hear about it by chance through a youtube recommended video?!",Alexandra Kabaeva,0,2020-06-28T16:32:03Z

56,UgyXIbS8gNzJUqw7akV4AaABAg,"If the petition gets to 500K or better yet, 1M thats a LOT of money in ticket sales globally. Not to mention how many people may decide not to see the movie because of her being EXPOSED. I know the franchise is huge but that is a large number. Ticket sales where I live are about $16 each so If it's somewhere between the $12-$16 mark that's anywhere between $6-$16 million bucks! Yes these movies take hundreds of millions to make but that's no drop in the bucket for profit as far as I'm concerned. It's a hefty chunk and I'm sure the producers have taken this into consideration. Bottom line here more importantly than money is not supporting ABUSERS. JD was dropped from projects based on LIES so AH Should be dropped based on FACTS. If we want equal rights for men and women then she should get the same treatment.
