10,Ugz2gl2A1FguqaG6Icd4AaABAg,b lue,"No one is saying men can't do this, however this is completely Amber's doing, so why imply or redirect this to JD?
  Amber on the other hand doesn't deserve any defence because she is a legitimate psychopath who solely started an ingenuine relationship with JD to take advantage of him as well as his status, which consisted of mental and physical abuse, manipulation of both JD and the media.  All for the sake of Amber trying to boost her own celebrity stature, through the strenuous means of falsely accusing JD of being a physical abuser, in tandem of destroying his reputation and career.  Crying wolf and creating false allegations is INCREDIBLY illegal.   The audacity of how long Amber can stomach & manage to prolong her lies, deceptions, alligator tears, and the fact that she lacks all empathy is disgusting. She is the ultimate disgrace to all men and women who have suffered from domestic abuse and violence.  
I don't 100% agree with cancel culture, however Amber's ass can get cancelled.  She should use all of the money she gets to put herself into extensive therapy, as I'm sure she has many past/prior skeletons and issues that impacted this entire debacle.",2020-07-10T06:54:59Z,3
