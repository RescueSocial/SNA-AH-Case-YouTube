17,Ugw2szWMGHIvJ4NaKld4AaABAg,Adam Mitchell,"@Heather Nikki Well I’m sad that you feel this way. I realise he bought to life some popular characters in his career. 
However, I will point out that as Exulted as Mr. Depp is, he was very close, borderline besties with Harvey Weinstein, (furthermore not that it’s important but Depp is renown for abusing is wealth)

One of the most genuine saintly actors in Hollywood RDJ a couple years back wrote two lists. 

List - 1

Lloyd Kauffma
Dan Schneider
Oprah Winfrey
Harvey Weinstein
Jimmy Kimmel
Johnny Depp
Seth Green 
Clare Grant
Ellen Degeneres
Stephen Colbert
Mark Thompson
Will Smith
Aubrey Drake Graham
David Schwimmer
Joseph Gordon-Levitt

List - 2

Denzel Washington 
Liam Neeson
Viola Davis 
Amber Heard
Reese Witherspoon
Scarlett Johansson
Hugh Jackman
Julia Roberts 
Snoop Dog
Natalie Portman 
Emma Stone 
Jonah Hill
Elijah Wood
Jay Leno 

Now as much as I was a fan of Johnny Depp and even sided with him in the beginning but that exactly is the problem our likability trumps facts it’s like when we find out a friend or loved one does something wrong we will always defend no matter what.

RDJ’s first list is his list of evil, child abusing and corrupt Hollywood figures.

His second list is a bunch of people who he regards as the most respectable, kindest, honest and loveable people in Entertainment. 

P.s I hope all are keeping well and safe.",2021-10-18T15:23:07Z,0

Have seen it up close more than once and there is still little to no help for people with narcisistic abuse one of the reasons being that its hard to detect and therefore people are not getting the right treatment, so lets FIRST help them and then we can play the smallest violin for the abusers (IF they even want help) 🙄 rather put THEM in asylums then people with severe mental problems caused by them.",2021-07-12T08:26:24Z,3

118,Ugx7Ud5n-pVVxiIGpvl4AaABAg,Trilly Kayembe,"@Veronica I can appreciate your point about the label of ""not as bad"" being a stigmatising way to label a narcissist. I agree that nobody is born bad, as I said it is often a result of maltreatment during childhood which would cause narcissism and other personality disorders but this is in combination with genetics. Maybe ""bad"" is the wrong language and I agree that i wouldn't use this terminology in my professional practice working with patients with NPD and this is rather personal. But a lack of empathy isn't exactly a positive trait to have and leads to treating others extremely poorly. Also I disagree that narcissism is a mental illness. I see it as more of a mental health condition which needs to be managed as it is not curable or treatable with medication. From what I am experiencing and what I am hearing about narcissists they often appear to not want to get help or change because they do not see an issue in their actions and genuinely think that they are the victim in many situations despite being aware that they have caused other people harm. I feel that saying ""The choice is up to you"" is stigmatising in a way though because actually it's not our responsibility? It's theirs. As I say, they have their own vulnerabilities but they are still very much aware of what they are doing and how they are behaving. I agree we should encourage narcissists to get the help that they need and to go to therapy but everybody, especially those of us who have been victims to narcissists must not place this responsibility on ourselves.",2021-05-11T02:29:24Z,11

187,Ugx9FzMGGE6DLJqSs0R4AaABAg,Gay Satan,"@Theresa L. Dowling yes and I’ve also watched and read descriptions of Amber Heard from actors and directors she’s worked with in the past, both good and bad reviews. But even if everyone says she’s a great actor, person doesn’t mean the evidence is fake. There’s a lot of proof disproving the audio leaks. The unfortunate thing with this case is that it’s between 2 people, without secondary witnesses. With my own research I feel like Johnny Depp is telling the truth. This could change if Amber supports more evidence for her side of the story.

I do recognize I might be biased, since I’ve had 2 male friends sexually assaulted by women, who had proof against them but weren’t taken seriously.

Im on the same page. telling someones behaviors or personal characteristics by eyes? no way. 
you are saying I state the obvious but OP, the comment I originally replied to, claimed that you can tell she gets violent and aggressive if things dont go her way, by the eyes. after we know the whole story saying this in hindsight. so obviously it wasnt obvious to OP that you cant tell this by the eyes. if you still dont get what I mean nevermind or disagree so be it. no harm done my man.",2021-10-26T18:02:45Z,0
338,UgyOGy_1sx7v7cp7Cg94AaABAg,Noartist,"@Daniel Seon  I mean youre stating the obvious.  Obviously they wont tell you a whole story.   If I come across a man who has just killed someone you would probably see the fear, anxiety, adrenaline in his eyes and know what kind of emotional state he was in.  It wont tell you he killed his wife...   And no,   i dont take youtube comments personally lol.  There were a few things i agreed with , but my point being is generally when i come across a psychopath its in the eyes.  I agree,  we cant conclude she beats up her husband but we can probably conclude she gets triggered very easily and has a hard time controlling her anger which is a supportive trait to whats shes accused of.    Like I said,  she remimds me of someone i know very well and they also cannot control their anger so even in situations where you would expect most people to demonstrate control, it leaks through.  They just boil inside.",2021-10-26T15:46:52Z,0

I didnt take it personal. my comment robbed you the wrong way. but it was most definitely personal. but its fine. Im sorry if I upset you. 

but I most definitely said that you cant read intentions from the very beginning.
the original comment of OP was a blatant claim with no logic to back it up. becoming violent and insane when not getting your way is a behavioral pattern. a personality tendency. 
you cant read someone’s personality or behavior from someone’s eyes. their whole story. Eyes change all the time. can you read their momentary emotional state? Absolutely I agree with you. But you cant read if someone has a short temper, is violent or is a sore loser through someone’s eyes. Because these behaviors can have countless expressions at any point someone’s eyes depending on the moment and context. Thats all I was saying.",2021-10-26T15:29:19Z,0
340,UgyOGy_1sx7v7cp7Cg94AaABAg,Noartist,"@Daniel Seon lol  i guess i did.  Dont take it to personal it was more of a generalization and partly satire.    I think you did sort of suggest you cant read emotions through eyes and we were foolish for thinking you could.  its  seeing how triggered she gets,  which you can pick up from the eyes.  I noticed   and thought  wow,  i know someone just like that who is actually a bi polar abusive, entitled psychopath bf beater so I agree with her. It was the look in the eyes and to be fair body language as well. I can almost guarantee this is a troubled girl. Obviously there are limits, that doesnt need to be pointed out but the eyes do say alot amd rarely lie. Some people have warm eyes, some cold.   She just has that cutting look and i do think she has a very cold, aggressive hateful side but at the end of the day i highly doubt Johnny Depp is an angel either.",2021-10-26T13:21:34Z,0

Something I have been in search for quite sometime is a connection with somebody that goes beyond vanity. It's very hard to do in this day and age. People can be, somewhat very superficial.

On my quest to achieve this I have learnt a lot about human nature. It seems to me that those who are not given traits such as beauty or being wealthy are some of the nicest, kindest and generous people.


While the ""gorgeous"" and well off seem to be the most arrogant and greedy people out there. Of course that's not to say there aren't beautiful kind people out there.

I've been in the process of change for a while now and I have made some decent changes but don't you just hate it when people can't let go of your past mistakes.

I saw your profile and it intrigued me. I wanted to learn more about who you are and what type of path you would like on in life.

462,Ugy1Qhuh9r-9Kh4_rLd4AaABAg,Time Space,"Actually I think she's a lot hotter now that we know she is evil. 

I use to find her annoying when I thought she was just another neutral actress.

Now she has a real story.

You have to understand that Celebrities are just human like you and me.

But some of them are such good actors that they appear to be saints.

When in real life they are illuminati devil worshipping satanist.

Remember the movie Tomb Raider where Angelina Jolies Dad in the movie was the leader of the illuminati and that makes Angelina the rightful queen of the illuminati in the movie Tomb Raider.

So you can't say that Angelina has never even heard of the illuminati

and yet she speaks at the Council of Foreign Relations Bolderberg Group in real life.

And these group of people are the real illuminati members in real life Satanist that rule the world through business multinational corporations, energy monopolies, banking families like the Rockefeller and Carnegie and Rothschild Families who own and control Central Banks like the United States Federal Reserve which controls the US Government.

Amber Heard isn't evil
she just wants to succeed financially because she wasn't born with 50 Trillion dollars like the evil ass Queen of England who killed her Dad to take the throne. 

Do you hate the Queen of England for all the evil things that she has done, or the Rothschild Family for all the wars they have caused? 

They profit from building weapons of war and selling them to both sides of every country that they put to fight against each other while civilian soldiers lose their lives the Bankers wage war for land and oil. 

Then they profit off the interest of the dept that the collateral damage that their weapons caused. 

If a missile blows up a building, the Government rebuilds it and then taxes the population to pay for the building that the Governments war caused. And who caused the war in the first place? 
The Bankers who profit off the sales of weapons of tanks jets helicopters missile and the debt of Nations.

Did you know that the Queen of England owns most of the Nuclear Power plants and that they supply plutonium to build nuclear bombs to the leaders of the world.

If you don't hate the Queen of England or the Rothschild Family who stole 500 Trillion dollars worth of land from the poor.

Then you have no right to hate Amber Heard for screwing over Johnny Depp.

Fight the real enemy.
Who do you think unleashed Covid-19 on us? 

Amber Heard or the Royal Families and the Banking Families?

Who is your real enemy?",2020-12-28T23:20:16Z,0

If you wanna be happy for the rest of your life
Never make a pretty woman your wife
So for my personal point of view
Get an ugly girl to marry you


A pretty woman makes her husband look small
And very often causes his downfall
As soon as he married her and then she starts 
To do the things that will break his heart",2020-08-01T16:50:23Z,3

I don't know you either, but since you seem to be a kind person I'll clear up the story a little. The ""demons"" were my ex and her 17 year old daughter from her previous marriage. Their behaviour wasn't simply PMS(I wish). PMS was just an amplifier to their selfish, hateful, manipulative, and destructive nature. You may wonder why I would ever get involved with a person like that, and I too used to say to my self ""what the hell was that guy thinking"" when I would see friends in a similiar situations. Well you've got two major factors 1. She was incredibly attractive/sexual,  and 2. Manipulative people will go to great lengths to hide their true nature until they get you where they want you. They were both perfect angels until I let them move into my house. Maybe you have been lucky enough in your life to avoid mentally disturbed people, and I hope you continue to do so, because trips to the ER and destruction of personal property are nothing compared to the emotional damage that sticks with you years afterward.

I was still in the stage they call love-bombing, but it was so half-assed, cause he doesn't really respect people to be consistent enough, so his real self shone through all the time. I knew him for years prior to that and would never have thought I'd be stupid enough to get together with him, but for some reason I did. Looking back, I disgust myself. I found out about things he was intending to do, which are so horrible and evil I can't even put them into words. The scariest thing was that I genuinely believe he is a dangerous person and having bruised his ego and spoiled his plans by breaking up, still makes me fearful about what consequences might be ahead. So I can only imagine how it must have been for you.
Sorry about the long post, but it feels so good talking to someone who knows that abuse first hand. I hope you heal from the trauma. We need to take that experience and turn it into an advantage. Nothing makes us stronger, more resilient and teaches us how to use our empathy more than the shit we had to go through with those hellish creatures.

I'm going to stand by my guns and stick with my opinion that AH is BP with NPD. Maybe one day we will find out her diagnosis through court docs and we can revisit this conversation and see who was closest haha 😂",2020-07-28T21:35:02Z,0
627,Ugx12zOk__xK9fCXK-B4AaABAg,Michał Drożdzewski,@Anonamoose manipulations have nothing to do with being bipolar. Bipolar disorder is a mood disorder with manic episodes lasting up to a week (!) and much longer episodes of depression. It's not a personality pattern / trait. You must have confused bipolar disorder with borderline personality disorder.,2020-07-28T20:31:19Z,1
628,Ugx12zOk__xK9fCXK-B4AaABAg,Anonamoose,"@Michał Drożdzewski Her  manipulations, drastic mood changes and behavior as documented in recordings by the security and dr's charged with caring for her really do point towards bipolar. I'm by no means a medical professional though.",2020-07-28T20:03:42Z,1
629,Ugx12zOk__xK9fCXK-B4AaABAg,Michał Drożdzewski,@Anonamoose she's neither schizophrenic nor bipolar. Mood stabilizers and antipsychotics are prescribed off-label for many different reasons including personality disorders. I don't want to diagnose but she seems like she's a malignant narcissist imho,2020-07-28T10:30:21Z,3
