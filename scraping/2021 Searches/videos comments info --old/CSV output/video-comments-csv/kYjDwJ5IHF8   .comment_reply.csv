12,UgyDnIjqFGPSndMAHLh4AaABAg,Lilyanna,"The other side of the evidence (that Depp might be at least partially guilty)

A recording in July 2016, can hear Depp saying to Amber: ""I headbutted you in the forehead. That doesn't break a nose"".

Johnny’s security guard Jerry Judge could be heard on the five-hour recording taken in the house in Australia saying that “he saw cuts on Ms Heard’s arms” and Amber had permanent scars on her arms 

Johnny said in a text that his severed finger came from him throwing a bottle, but now says it was Amber

A couple of years ago he was sued sued by his bodyguards for being violent toward them and forcing them to transport narcotics for him (he eventually settled out of court), and as of 2019 he is being sued for attacking a locations manager on a film set.

There is a tape of Johnny’s witness saying that they were pressured to give evidence for him 

A Nurse who saw Amber just after she said that Johnny had attacked her noted that she had bleeding to her lip

Johnny texted Amber saying “I couldn’t be more sorry for yet again ruining your day. I always regret when I jump or worse, when you jump. I’m a f****** savage.”

Make up artist Melanie Inglessis said she helped Amber cover up bruises and marks before the James Cordon show

Ambers neighbor says she saw her with injuries the night the police were called 

Raquel Pennington told him Mr Depp had 'shoved her' and he 'got angry' and went and 'banged on the door' of another apartment before going back to his own.

Joshua Drew said to Johnny’s bodyguard something like, 'He beat the shit out of her again and you guys stood by and watched it'.
and he responded “it's not his business, they are husband and wife” 

Depp texted he was going to “smack the ugly cunt around”

Ellen Barkin claims Depp threw a wine bottle across a hotel room during a fight with friends.

Assaulted a man in Canada in the 80’s who asked a group of people to leave a party at a hotel  

Johnny was arrested for threatening people in London in 1999 

Johnny’s manager texted Amber Manager - ""When I told him he kicked you, he cried. It was disgusting. And he knows it.""

Screen shots of Staff supported Amber and said she was kicked, hit, and crying, but they were too afraid to witness. https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Gy4Pw8yoPVsY3T2VZs_ZQp_9_-FMYwIE and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2qFCFd-5C8",2020-08-19T16:40:41Z,0

Pus i'm sure she's stressed out. Once she gets better rest, no stress, stops alcohol she'll be back to her self again. I never recommend fillers bc overtime they do migrate and never fully dissolve. It's been proven on ct scans. Even if you use dissolving agent it can destroy your own natural tissues. SO better never start fillers.",2020-07-31T19:00:04Z,1

You were totally accurate in your assessment too!   What was it about her that seemed fake?  I also had this gut feeling whenever I would watch in interviews that something about her seemed disingenuous.  She didn't seem like she was a nice person.  I couldn't put my finger on why, but it was just a gut feeling. And I also never believed her claims of abuse about Johnny either.  And now the truth has come out.",2020-03-19T14:41:05Z,27
