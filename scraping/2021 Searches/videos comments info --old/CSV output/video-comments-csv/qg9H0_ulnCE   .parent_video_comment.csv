1,Ugx8Vz75mpu1ZR6Q0lt4AaABAg,"They weren’t abusive to each other. I am not a fan, but he was the only one trying to be logical and saying there can be no physical abuse…

On one hand you say that media should be discussing DV but then you won’t touch it.

My husband was physically abused by his ex girlfriend, for things like spending too much time with his brother.
Over 20 years of marriage and my husband and I have had lots of disagreements but neither has laid a finger or thrown objects. Female only perpetrators exist!

I also had to support my brother in law against my sister (who is a LOT like Amber Heard)
She tried to claim that he had been physically, mentally and financially abusive throughout their relationship (her goal was to get sole custody of the children so she could move with them to a different country to be with her new boyfriend).

I supported him bc I was disgusted at her lies. He had financially supported her going to university. When she needed to move abroad for her third year with the kids, he supported her, learnt the language etc. whatever she wanted to do he would make changes to his career to allow for it.

They would argue a lot and were both very fierce. The only time I saw him ‘physically’ doing anything was to drag her out of danger because she threatened two men who had spat outside their house, with the garden shears she was using, and the two men turned round and started walking back towards her, egging her on to fight them and they were swinging some kind of chain. So my B-I-L grabbed her from behind and dragged her into the house.",Mrs M,0,2021-10-11T11:43:52Z

7,Ugx2Z5bD_TdIhudoiFN4AaABAg,"These guys are so out of touch with the case. Before they opened their mouth they should have researched the case. They are ""blindly"" reporting on a case they haven't researched one iota.  This is not blind devotion to a celebrity, it's about truth. If these guys had done their research they would have heard Amber on tape yelling at Johnny because he was being a ""baby"", that he would leave the room when she got physical with him instead of finishing the fight and because of this he wasn't taking the marriage seriously. The men in this video don't know about all the witnesses, including cops and medical professionals, whom have spoke on JD's behalf. We are not fans sticking up for our favorite celebrity, we are people who are warriors of truth and want justice because if we cannot go to a court with solid evidence of our innocence (as JD did) and still be found guilty how can we ever expect to get justice in domestic violence cases for the general population.

BUT as I saw more evidence and literally heard her admit to abusing him on tape multiple times my opinion changed quick and I avidly support Johnny, who has been blacklisted while Amber is being protected by Elon Musk and her other powerful friends.

We raise money to support other charities that Mr. Depp favors.  We work to disseminate facts about Domestic Abuse (ET Canada should speak to an expert in the field of Domestic Abuse, so that they will STOP spreading fallacies such as the LIE of ""mutual abuse"").  In return, Amber Heard trolls have organized (yes, we have proof) to mass flag our channels, illegally harass us, dox us, and actually threaten us and our children.

Many of the people speaking up for him are survivors, and I came into this as an objective observer who wanted to hear both sides of the story. Finding her video deposition online is what sold me because of the projection. But added to that, text messages from her parents trying to get him to violate the TRO and telling him that she only filed allegations to stay in the penthouse longer proved that this was nothing more than a gold digging ploy.

The moment she was caught out, she switched tack and jumped into an implausible explanation of another scenario. Started out saying that she only hit him once, but ended by saying “every time” she hit him he was “always” melodramatic. She told on herself.

And as far as having realistic goals and sticking to them; AIN'T WORKING OUT SO WELL FOR HERD IS IT? Since hoaxing the media and pumping it full of lies to get JD out, is her idea of a realistic goal. Her simplistic concept that only a woman will be believed is not as realistic as she thought; since she's the very fishy woman with questionable motives and history of DV arrest, convicted for falsifying documents, soon to be convicted of perjury in the UK, Australia, and the States, who's an attactivist, posing as an activist with a page-long minor age arrest record, and Depp is the man;  one who has proven himself over and over to be kind, generous, and humane to many he has worked and lived with, not to mention strangers and fans. Karma is rearing her beautiful head! The first perjury she will be caught in ... down for the count! The VA 2022 Court Judge has ordered herd to get proof of her ACLU donation. We got the spoilers on that one, so this will be her FIRST perjury that goes into discovery. She is LIABLE. Her lawyer is also a liar, and the three-year statute of limitations for perjury, including California, does not even start ticking until the perjury is discovered in court. NOT three years after she committed perjury NOR are California laws different than any other state, as her lawyer glibly lied in a news article.

I do not doubt that some nasty things have been said on both sides, however, it is clear who the real victim is by facts that have been presented. The audio recordings alone with Amber admitting herself that she starts physical fights is a huge piece of evidence. Johnny was the one who was physically abused by Amber, not the other way around. You can hear all the narcissistic symptoms from Amber in the recordings. Narcissists are abusive! She is also a sociopath. Johnny may have some issues but I do not believe for one minute he was physically abusing her. I do not believe he hit her, pulled her hair, or threw a phone at her face. So many people have come to his defense. Johnny has never been accused by other women of abuse. It is NOT a pattern with him! It is clear to me that he is not what she is claiming him to be. I don't understand why people who makes these kinds of videos, basically on Amber's side, cannot read between the lines by looking at all the evidence, witnesses, testimonies, video and audio recordings, pictures, interviews, character references, arrest records relating to DV, psychology, body language, personality, authenticity and honesty of past interviews, etc., and not see what was really going on. She's a narcissistic, sociopathic, liar who pretended to be someone she wasn't to get Johnny to fall in love with her so she could use him for everything she could get out of him and to further her career. She abused him in every way. She has and/or has had severe mental illness, anger, and drug problems. She blackmails and extorts. Whatever Johnny's issues may be do not compare to hers and still does not prove conclusively he has ever been physically abusive to her or anyone. The evidence for her being abusive to him is far greater and clearer.

Every thing Heard submitted as evidence was tainted.  Photos without original exif & metadata, photos with 0 injuries & a flawless makeup free face-as she lies to the judges face “I had 2 black eyes & a broken nose” telling the world “Do not believe the evidence of your eyes & ears”, just believe my Uncorroborated blather.  I’m a good actress. 

It’s chilling what the UK judge did.  He was clearly bought & paid for if not horrendously biased from the beginning. 

His ruling was an insult to all DV survivors everywhere- men & women.

A Heard has done more damage to the fight against violence of women than any person in modern history -or at least as much as powerful Right Wing white men who do everything they can to protect their own.

And it’s not about blind devotion if you actually take time to read evidence.
The dismissal of survivors who’ve actually READ the evidence that you actually ADMIT you don’t want to read- is just like Trump BS & the lies peddled by Right Wing media (shocker heards biggest media defender is also Trump’s- Rupert Murdoch) 

The Kremlin uses same argument- make the facts so confusing where you just throw up your hands & decide “I can’t believe anything”.

No that’s just lazy media👆 who refused to actually read court documents that proved Heard is a toxic narcissist & liar. 

Oh & if you argue the UK judge decided against Depp, and that must mean Depp was guilty, maybe take a look at the Judges absurd ruling that no judge or jury in US would ever side with.
Amber Heard literally did speaking engagements for the Judges wife’s nonprofit & judge did not recuse himself. 

Then the judges ruling itself is littered with HIM making himself a witness BOLSTERING Heard’s accusations.  

We would NEVER see a judge getting away with all of what he did in the US.  It was literally extra-judicious & he has zero business being a judge in Traffic Court, let alone something as contextual nuanced & manipulative as Heards lies.

90,UgwHko0kcbrJmumLGMl4AaABAg,"Unless ET Canada has taken time to read the court documents and seen the video and audio proofs exposing Heard for her lies, then ET Canada should keep its unnecessary comments to themselves and focus on irrelevant news trite as they have done for years. Regarding what has happened in the UK, Amber has lost more than anything. Her reputation is exposed worldwide, facts are spread everywhere about her lies, including her confessions that she assaulted Johnny, and the recent body cam videos have confirmed how she and her goons are liars and bandits and grifters. Everything is now in the public space thanks to these trials and now the public can share them perpetually. Even though the UK appeal court did not give Johnny permission to appeal, they affirmed in their statements that the proofs he gave were reliable and irrefutable, and the UK Appeal Court confirmed that AH lied in court and on TV, that she abused numerously Johnny and Kate James, and that she never donated the money as she claimed for years. And the judges said that if rags have to attack Johnny they should also mention all the proofs exposed and revealed about AH. That is why the UK medias have steered clear from this case since March and have barely reported what happened. Because they know that the UK court has confirmed AH's a liar and an abusive person toward Johnny and others, and also because these rags know that if they attack Johnny, JD activists and fans will be there to confront them and present proper facts. 
Furthermore, it is not just fans of Johnny Depp who defend him, but also DV survivors and feminists; which has really flabbergasted many JD detractors (politicians, reporters, etc.) who realize that their misandrist agenda does not represent society.
And considering that Dan Wootton mysteriously left The Sun and Talk Radio a few months after the trial to work at another rag, I wouldn't be surprised that this happened because of the UK trial and all the facts revealed about AH; with the love from the world for Johnny and the hatred for AH being so strong that it brought a stain on Murdoch's properties and he lost money; and so he asked Wootton to quit and to go work elsewhere. So that also can be considered another victory.
Even more hilarious is how AH's latest movie in the cinema was a massive flop critically and financially. Because the public despises her, they boycott her totally. Whereas for Johnny, City of Lies is making a massive amount of cash in USA cinemas, Itunes and streaming services, even above other box office successes from WB. As for social media, posts attacking Johnny are minuscule compared to those defending him and loving him. Posts that love him go by the 100 000 while those that attack him are barely 100 or 200. Movie scholars always express support for him on social media while for AH, they never mention her because she is the epitome of mediocrity.

91,UgyJlB3PvJMaDhmOvf54AaABAg,"Phhh... Typical journalistic content.  You do realise that there are MANY supporters of Mr. Depp who are themselves domestic abuse and/or sexual abuse survivors.  These survivors ARE reading the court filings (from the UK, Virginia, and foreign subpoena filings in California).  We are seeking the information ourselves because there has been a clear mainstream media bias reporting in favour of Miss. Heard.  Please do not insult DV survivors as being uneducated or unwilling to look at the evidence. Many initially believed Miss. heard, however, the evidence keeps leading us towards Miss. Heard having repeatedly lied about multiple incidences (both small and grandiose lies). Please note that discovery is ongoing in the US, which is producing further evidence in support of Mr. Depp's assertions that Miss. Heard is not truthful in her claims. So, YES many of Mr. Depp's supporters have looked at the evidence; which includes photographic evidence, medical records, third-party testimony, eye witnesses, voice recordings of Miss. Heard admitting to assaulting Mr. Depp and berating him for leaving when things get physical, LAPD STATEMENTS AND BODY CAM footage, not to mention the 7 million donation lie - and her previous DV arrest record which Miss. Heard casually dismisses. If Miss. Heard's assertions are to believed then 5 X police officers lied on 3 x different occasions! So, please if you cannot be bothered yourself to objectively consider this evidence as well as the hundred (if not thousands of pages of court filings) then Shut T F Up and stop commenting on the large proportion of Mr. Depp's supporters who are themselves abuse victims.

I have read through reams of evidence and I believe Johnny Depp over Amber Heard. Her evidence? Doesn't exist! Any bruises on her are painted on, and the onus is on you to prove otherwise. I just watched the police's bodycam footage from the night she ridiculously states that a phone was thrown at her and the place was trashed. But did any of that really happen? The pictures don't lie, they agree with Johnny. Everything is pristine! He is GOOD!!! Why do you have to demonize him because he had a drug problem for a while? Okay, he did. He seems a lot better. Leave him alone! Leave his fans alone! I couldn't even watch your whole video, because you were just so abusive, going on and on about people being too devoted to celebrities. You know what? Johnny's not just some silly celebrity. You should care about people, whether they are celebrities or not. If it suddenly is popular to NOT care about someone, because he's a guy, and he's a celebrity, and some woman has accused him of awful things...well, I don't want to be what is popular! I want to dig in to the facts! I want to see all the camera footage that I can, I want to hear all the audio recordings that I can, I want to look at any text messages and read anything relevant. What you will see if you drop this sadistic apathy of yours and really look at this case, with new eyes, is that Amber's story is constantly changing! That her friends' stories are constantly changing! Johnny's are 99.99% more consistent. And she had motive. Not less than one month into her marriage, she is on security footage, having affairs in the penthouse she shared with Johnny, while he was away filming a Pirates of the Caribbean movie. I really don't care for your opinions on how Johnny is got to be guilty in this! I'm NOT stupid! I looked at evidence, that Amber and her friends were planning on killing Johnny with knives!

119,UgzVjQ0tgI4lAjBTkXR4AaABAg,"The problem with this case is there wasn't enough evidence to convict yet Johnny lost the case. The system isn't perfect and it's often quite terrible in fact of favoring women over males. We studied this in school but even when it's been proven that that male hadn't committed the act or the woman admits they hadn't much of the time the woman still wins the court case and the male is convicted. This is a problem with a lot of systems. It isn't necessarily a fair system. Where as a lot of issues really are against woman like the workforce this is a different case when it comes to the court system and why a case like Johnny's without enough real evidence over the matter that he'd could lose a case. The courts and the news are generally eager to say rape or assault to look like they in favor of women and equal rights and issues but they tend to neglect that in court there not necessarily fair.  I've lived in shitty neighborhoods and watched several male friends get similar issues of false accusations. One particular girl went to court against every man she slept with and called rape. Seen one friend living nursing home who was in and out of jail for years over the case until they just told him to say guilty to end the the disaster of him being back in a jail cell over the crime they weren't sure he committed. Behavior wise the guy dealt with a lot of anxiety and was too much of a push over and was weak. He was a really harmless person. Another male I knew and kind of hated was the first person to win against her. However he was notably staggering with a leg issue. Though many of the other guys she'd call rape on I didn't believe he was a another case where is personality he might be likely to. 

In regards stating this I'm not saying that women aren't necessarily victims of rape and even worse like murder. Some countries are pretty ignorant about some of those issues even like Canada and the US in cases like Indigenous people.  In regards allegations over movie stars happen as well. Micheal Jackson was another and the majority would love to have seen him as a bad guy since he looked messed up sounded strange among other reasons but he the evidence wasn't really there asides parents pushing a child to stand in court even when that child later admitted in this. With MJ he was notable for being strange after his musical career ended but his family and children thought highly of him even if he might have been overprotective and kept their faces hidden as much as possible over his own music career and publicity being of harm. In Johnny's case his career is over even though there wasn't enough evidence to really convict him. Even his exes came to make statements that Johnny never was an aggressive person. Johnny's only real known issues are with alcohol and drugs but in regards there can be the same evidence on Amber Heard as well through their relationship over alcohol through a lot more pictures then she had of her standing in a public place with puffy eyes and red on her cheek possibly a mark which you can't be sure how she actually got whether it was actually Johnny or another reason including her own habits.",Vincent Wolf,0,2021-04-16T09:34:55Z

130,UgyKMGBED_h1Ut0xB9J4AaABAg,"I understand that there are some hardcore fans on both sides however in terms of JD supporters not accepting any accusations saying JD is an abuser it is not that they won't accept it there was no proof of it yet, it has been proven that AH ( which has been agreed on by the UK judges in the 2nd appeal) lied in the courts, lied under oath, manipulated the courts & lied about donating the charity money even though she went to  multiple interviews on T.V accepting all the praise for donating the money
 all her proof has been dismissed, the media will  keep smacking JD down but when it comes to AH they do not follow through the reason I suspect is because they thought AH was an angle & when all the  proof came out she lied they were to  much of cowards to say they were wrong JD has been block from getting jobs yet AH is allowed hers & she  gets to keep a platforms where she gets paid for doing speeches for 33,000 per speech for speaking out against DA when it was proven she was causing DA with JD
there is no proof JD did anything it is all accusations by AH & her sister as well as best friends if you want the JD supporters to have a more open mind to the accusations( of which many of us are open minded to evidence) there are prove to us we are  wrong instead of putting across the impression we can not move on from ppl who make baseless accusations but when you  have AH  halting all proof against her coming to the public eye, whining about ppl making death threats to her & her family( which JD supporters do not support) yet AH Supporters assuming they are not bots this has been suspected for some time due to inconsistence with AH social media accounts do the  same making death threats & AH give a pathetic apology not specifying who the apology is going too & acting like a child in the tweets comments 
sorry this message is long but JD supporters are not close minded thick people we understand how both sides feel but there is no proof JD did anything, AH on the other hand mountains of it if AH has lied this much in court what makes her supporters think she is telling the truth it not like AH lied  at one or two things there is literally a list 
if you want JD supports to consider otherwise make a sensible argument to prove otherwise which is extremely hard since AH accusation or evidence is severely questionable & consistently changing or been dismissed sorry it's long but still like I said we are not  close minded ppl(JD supporters also, the majority of us never condone death threats)my opinion",PICK&MIX GAMER,1,2021-04-12T20:48:43Z

214,UgzXALltce5ar2JfQqB4AaABAg,"Your commentary is accurate most occasions. But you are off here. My experience of this situation is that a great many of supporters are not necessarily ""fans"" or ""stans"", or they only became more fans through first learning about the case. Many are survivors, previous victims. Many are feminists, advocates. Many just want justice and equality. These people are passionate because they feel the evidence does not support the fore-gone conclusions made by main stream media for the past 4+ years. They feel their voices and experiences silenced and devalued by main stream media. Many are outraged that main stream seems to be silencing the facts of the situation: this seems to be having a massive effect of this grass-roots movement. The truth point to a very singular case of abuse of social-rights movements through lying and manipulation of msm  - this alone is so shocking and appalling that it cannot but leave a strong impression in anyone who take the time to go over the facts of the case. Couple that with the msm then not only not reporting on this even as a possibility but reporting the polar opposite as if a foregone conclusion enough to ruin a life and career. This is the recipe for the people-driven movement you see now.  Looking only from the perspective of metoo/timesup: This is the exception case in DV. AH is that false-allegations individual that we hope and wish do not exist, but which exists and nobody wants to talk about.  MSM does not know how to handle this.  However,  quite serious abuse also occurred, not just lying. From the broader view of an abuser and victim: this scenario is all too common.  Is ruining of a person, their life and career a price MSM is willing to pay?  You speak as if ""mutual abuse"" is the only possibility,  this is an extremely irresponsible thing to do. Please do your research on abuse statistics before making statements like this. Mutual abuse almost never occurs. The evidence of this case are  mostly publicly available:  you should do your research. Look at the concrete evidence. Look at what is happening now with Jennifer Howell and AH's sister. it is unfortunate that anyone who cares about this serious issue & are true allies and feminists and survivors are denegrated, their intentions mis-cast that they could only care if they were 'fans' & 'stans'.  It is also unfortunate that just the suggestion that a man did something would be enough to ruin his life & a fore-gone conclusion - in this case this is injustice and it is injustice for a news outlet to speak as if he is already presumed to be.",Nan Nan,2,2021-04-03T14:26:13Z

I don’t know who the man in the gray and green hat is, but saying it’s an “uncomfortable reality” Depp supporters live in, to not be able to accept that Depp abused AH? It’s not a reality at all. Learn to do your research and get educated on the subject, the same way we did. 
If you’re wondering why we think the way we do, it’s because we’ve actually taken the time to do the research and uncover the truth. I’m not even a Johnny Depp “fan” and yet here we are. 

Evidence:
-Testimony
-Witnesses
-Inconsistencies in Heard’s statements
-AUDIO recordings of Heard LITERALLY claiming she abused him.

The reason we KNOW Depp didn’t abuse Heard, is because there is NO evidence that he ever did. 
Amber Heard abusing Depp is the reality, and I hope you along with many others eventually find it in your hard to do the research and stop feeding into this disgusting narrative.",Doctor Soup,4,2021-04-02T15:54:35Z

Regarding Johnny, I have yet to see any proof of him having actually laid a mean hand on her.
The ""evidence"" that I have seen against him has been vague and twisted a lot of the time. The evidence against Johnny is from Amber, just as the evidence against Amber was said by her own mouth as she shamed Johnny for being weak.
Why must it be both at fault now, but when it was Johnny as the ""abuser"" the blame was not shared.
Why is it Johnny is not seen as a victim of domestic abuse when Amber was seen as one before the role was reversed?
Why is it that Johnny is to suffer because of this woman, but he is still shamed. Both for being a victim, abuser and for being part of an abusive relationship.
Amber was not shamed for being a victim, nor was she ashamed for being in an abusive relationship. Why is she not faring the same consequences for being an abuser as Johnny was and still is?

It was only a few weeks ago, not many, that I really let myself get to know this case, and therefore Johnny and Amber. I was not a fan of nether before, but now I am one of Johnny Depp.
He has my support because he is a victim of abuse, just as many others. He is not perfect because he is just as human as every one of us, but just as a woman should not be shamed for being hurt by a man. A man should not be shamed for being hurt by a woman.",Ku Nilsen,1,2021-04-02T00:30:29Z

If you do your research you'd see noone ever saw him being violent they just saw some violent aftermath(ie writing on countertops, stuff messed up, I'm not talking physical injuries) and Amber told them it was JD.  Interestingly enough 1 of ambers costars from never back down  stated that he saw violent aftermath and amber blamed her ex wife's temper even though she was witnessed and arrested for assaulting Van Rhee in an airport by a police officer.  Medical professionals and DV trained officers contradict her evidence,  she just says they are lying.  Too much adds up to her lying and projecting her behavior on him. 3 stop telling us we haven't looked at the evidence and follow him blindly bc a lot of us have read and looked at the court documents that have been filed for the VA trial against heard.

279,Ugzd4NqOGN3I0jmBPZx4AaABAg,"Johnny Depp fans harass her nonstop though so she would be tempted to respond. Most of the time, she doesn’t. As for Amber hitting Johnny, you don’t think abused women don’t react and flip out at their abuser? That’s just unrealistic. It is a very complicated situation but when you whittle it down to the bare bones, you have someone who was out of control and intoxicated beyond reason getting jealous and losing his mind and attacking his wife. She dealt with that for a long time leading up to her hitting him. Can you really put her in the same category as Johnny? And while, it is important to acknowledge male victims, when a man decides he’s a victim only after being accused of abuse, it has to be understood that this is a widely used attempt at a defensive strategy. Especially if the woman fought back. 

I think what also makes this complicated is that Johnny isn’t just this terrible person. The public and those close to him have difficulty grasping it because that is not the Johnny they know. But that is why Johnny refers to himself as ‘the monster’ when he is in this state. We have to have a discussion about the effects of extreme intoxication and mental health issues combined and what that is capable of doing to a persons mind. It’s strange to me, that no one is talking about addiction and intoxication and how that has contributed to these events. We want to be compassionate towards those who suffer from mental health problems and addiction problems but sometimes that forces us to confront some of the the ugliness that can arise from these issues. Violence isn’t always sadistic or meant to punish. Often in cases like this, there is this overwhelming emotional stimulation and an inability to stay grounded in reality, that results in a loss of control and enacting violence towards others. Does that mean, it shouldn’t be condemned? No, of course not. But it does mean that good people can do bad things. It is important that Johnny and people like Johnny focus on getting help. The courts can only resolve so much. Johnny needs to face his own demons. And maybe if he took responsibility and took the steps to recover, he could have his career back. He could demonstrate to others in similar situations that there is a way to find your way back. We spend a lot of time canceling people but spend so little time on addressing what healing really looks like in these situations. 

I don’t understand why we can’t step back enough to see the whole picture and judge the actions but have at least some understanding beyond, ‘he’s totally innocent’ or ‘he is a monster’. If it was that simple, it would be much more easy to identify abuse. People we love are just as capable of being victims as they can be abusers. If we can’t confront that uncomfortable truth, then how can we really expect to confront this issue. Understanding the combination of addiction and mental illness and how it can manifest is important too. Substances induced psychosis is a real thing. As are substance induced mood disorders. Johnny has a history of depression and anxiety and a history of cutting. Repressing all these emotions can lead to an explosive temper when you become uninhibited under the influence. It is just as important to understand why abuse happens as it is to know when abuse is happening. Some people truly are sadistic assholes. Some people really want to hurt others. But this isn’t always the case and it should be acknowledged to help us understand more about this situation and know how to help not just the victim but, in cases like this, the abuser as well.",Shifting Mercury,0,2021-04-01T11:42:54Z

327,UgzpIY707jC906EhAP54AaABAg,"A lot of people only think of abuse in the context of battered women that can't fight back because of the overwhelming violence, but the reality is that abusive relationships can look like a lot of different things.

When you find yourself in a *toxic relationship* that may eventually escalate to physical abuse, its not uncommon for both parties to end up being awful to each other even when one is clearly worse, because even when you start out as the victim, the more someone verbally abuses you sometimes the more likely you are to lash out in kind and verbally abuse your abuser right back when you just can't take it anymore but also are not ready to just leave. Things get really confusing and emotional when you are stuck in that situation long term. I can't even begin to imagine how much worse that is when you are legally married and feel like you just can't walk away.

I have no problem believing that Depp got physical with Amber, but I also have no trouble believing the same of her. It's easy to see it potentially going either way considering they were both clearly stuck in a toxic relationship that probably brought out the worst in both of them, which is why neither is likely to be innocent of some form of abuse even if one of them very likely took it further than the other. I don't feel like I know enough to say I 'know' what actually happened either way.

However, a man his size is always going to be able to deal more _physical_ damage than the petite woman he's with, so *_if_*_ he really did_ leave bruises on her that would make him even more in the wrong, even if she is wrong too. Men should be careful when they find themselves getting heated in a toxic relationship because unfortunately just by being so much bigger (usually) people are going to judge your actions as potentially more of a danger by default, so it's important to avoid even the appearance of getting physical with women. 

That is just my take from what I know so far. 🤷‍♀️

Was brought to light she used another's abuse story as her own.  4th In her divorce she stated she would donate a large sum of money to charity and she has not.  5th if you watch her movements and eye she is very jittery, high strung and wanted to be accepted.  I had no idea who she was before aqauman.  JD has no history of abuse.  Which doesn't mean it can't happen.  However, she is the instigator which is still abusive.  I wasn't there. If he had done it he would state he did.  He would say ""Things got out of control and I did it.  It was wrong but I can't change it."" That's the man he is.  I actually wasn't a big fan of his but have become one.  She needs to be held accountable.  She stated it first before he could.  So he's the one taking the heat.  Seen this many times with woman.  Just because someone appears to be old, different and whatever else they are saying means he is a good actor.  In this case the greatest act of his life.  He was beaten, abused physically, emotionally and financially.  He was scared and he just wanted to go back to the way things where before he my her.  She used his for fame and that's why she became so abusive.  She couldn't take the relationship because it wasn't her true self.  She's a lesbian and nothing wrong with that.  What's wrong is what's she doing now.  I don't wish Ill on her but I do feel she needs some mental health help.  It would be interesting what a psychological evaluation would say.

Women can be abusers, they can be as violent as men, sometimes even more violent. All the leaked and published evidences serve against Amber Heard - they clearly show that she is an abuser. That mainstream mass media stubbornly keeps broadcasting this case as a ""we're here for women victims"" act despite all the logic and common sense is a complete disgrace for modern journalism.

If it turned out he was guilty because of sufficient evidence I would walk away from him.  I like the guy because he appears to be nice and treats his fans with respect.  Yes, he is very talented and his work makes me happy, but I never would be happy supporting an abuser.

She is unlikable too. READ THE COURT DOCUMENTS! Listen to the tapes,calls, and watch the court tapes. She is convinced that because she is a woman, she will win. But many men get bullied, and abused by spiteful women. Yes, we women are usually the weaker in abuse, but, love and kindness make some men give up everything just like some women, and we need to quit assuming she isn't crazy just cause she is a woman.

There are so many threads on Twitter containing statements, court transcripts, photos, CCTV, the audio tapes, legal depositions etc etc. What more does Johnny Depp have to do for the media to report on this fairly and showcase his evidence? He has police officers who saw no injuries or damage. He has numerous witnesses who did not see the magical bruise that appeared on her face on the day of court. So many people saw her afterwards with no injury. He has many photographs and TV appearances, photoshoots where you can clearly see she has no injuries in the days after these alleged horrific assaults. Type ‘James Corden show Amber Heard’ into Twitter and you’ll see the threads about it. She has lied. People need to accept this and support Johnny. This could happen to any man in your family. This isn’t petty celeb drama- This is serious. She abused him and lied about being the victim. It is simply unbelievable that it’s still being debated that he was the abuser. The U.K. case was corrupt AF. He will win in the US with a jury and where she has to make full disclosures of absolutely everything. Also please look up Jennifer Howell. She is a friend of the Heard family and is nothing to do with Johnny. She is Amber’s sister’s best friend. She is now a witness and says that Whitney told her Amber cut Johnny’s finger off and she didn’t know why he was putting up with the abuse. She also says she was worried Amber would kill him one day.

For myself, i'm not a particular Depp fan. I got interested in this due to the crime and law aspect. and had an open mind from the get go. A year in and there are indeed facts and evidence, as im sure you're all well aware of. A.H has been lying, and has inflicted violence upon Depp on the record by her own recorded admission (see a missing finger, reattached for forensic details). Conversely, there is no evidence that Depp did any of what A.H claims. Her lies tend to undermine her a great deal. This is why it will be great to have the Virginia case.

394,UgxlvOGqsUCw4T_iq4B4AaABAg,"THE EVIDENCE IS CLEAR. She is abusive, he is not.  How do you explain that Amber had a large bruise one day but none the 4 days before the bruise and the 4 days after?  That is why we are so upset.   Amber is committing fraud and extortion.  Which one of them have a prior  arrest record for spousal abuse?  Right it is Amber.  When the police were called to their home one night Ambers friends said she had a black eye, a busted lip and a broken nose and that JD had trashed the apartment.  In LA it is standard procedure tp arrest the male if there is even a hint of a problem.  A police officer with experience in domestic abuse arrived at the home.  There was no sign of any violence and the apartment was immaculate.  At this point Johnny had left for another location  -  Johnny was not even questioned, let alone arrested.  In the trial in the UK the judge REFUSED to hear the testimony from the police officers and determined that the pictures Amber had taken of the apartment being trashed was sufficient evidence an assault had occurred -  even though the police officers swore there was no damage to her or the apartment in their statements.   This PROVES the  photo's were staged AFTER Johnny and the police had left.  Again the UK Judge did NOT ALLOW either  of the police officer's written or verbal statements into the trial.  Johnny's team also attempted to show video of Amber at the James Corbin show the next day that showed no injury to her face but it was not allowed.   The UK justice system did not and will not go against Rupert Murdoch.  The Murdochs have destroyed much bigger people than Judge Nichols!

I started off believing amber because that's your natural instinct. When the tapes came out i listened to all of them.
Once you listen to the tapes you realize that amber heard is the abuser and aggressor. 
I think as a man you guys are disregarding victims. This isnt just about depp. Its about believing victims. If amber was abused by depp i would be on her side. In fact i was until the evidence was revealed. There is no way you can listen to them both on the tapes and not walk away  thinking she lied. A person who is being abused doesn't complain about  the abuser running away from the fights. She has also admitted to being physical. He's told her they have to be apart if it gets physical. Not to mention she has yet to present photos of the horrendous injuries she claimed to have had.
Also the $7mil divorce settlement she has said over  and over that she donated to children's hospital snd ucla has not been donated. So this means she has been lying about this since 2016. If you can lie about donating to children you'll lie about

He has obsessive problems, where he can get easily addicted to something, be it drinks, drugs or even the person he care for but he has a huge moral compass where he don't mind destructing himself but never others. That's how people of his personalities operate, they stick through any abusive relationships like a lost child. Things to note is that Amber has a history of physical abuse with her ex, Tasya while 3 of Johnny ex'es, Allison, Paradis and Ryder have gone public on how Johnny is incapable of such thing.

Maybe you guys on ET Canada would dive into the court docs reading and listening to the evidence you will understand why millions are outraged and making it known. In the beginning I was like maybe it’s both of them maybe they were both abusive to one another but after reading the evidence I see that Amber Heard A woman physically and emotionally abused a man and because she is a woman she got away with it and you media outlets continue to enable her by not calling out the facts that have been presented you report on absolute bullshit and what is being said on Twitter instead of going to the court records and reading the evidence. This is not just fans defending someone they admire and they look up to this is a serious issue about a stigma that has continue to go on for years and years that men cannot be emotional they cannot go through physical and emotional abuse because they are men and they are supposed to be stronger. considering that you three are men I would think you would have an understanding on some level about how it would feel to be physically and emotionally abused for years and not feel comfortable sharing it or reporting it because of the stigma that surrounds men when they report that they were abused. because you know what happens most people laugh and don’t believe the guy and they say that’s not possible and you media outlets continue to allow it you Condone this behavior and it’s disgusting if it was a woman going through this it would be no question on who side you would be on.,Autumn Perez,127,2021-03-30T19:48:22Z

471,UgyqhoHuevs7m5Ctpet4AaABAg,"No, we aren’t protecting Depp blindly. I wasn’t even a real Depp fan (though I definitely recognized him as one of our era’s greatest actors). She’s abusive and sociopathic and it’s insane that she has gotten away with it legally considering all of the evidence. Hoping the one in Virginia will be more fair considering it’s against her directly rather than against a media company that is in bed with the British judicial system. There are actual recordings of her accusing him of running every time she would hit him and called him a baby yet she was so afraid of him? She’s disgusting. Another piece of evidence: A woman named Jennifer Howell came forward after Amber’s sister claimed that she had to escape Johnny by staying with Jennifer because Johnny tried to push her down the stairs. Jennifer came forward and said that maybe her sister is afraid of her because when the stairs incident happened she went to her and said that she was afraid Amber would kill Johnny because she tried pushing him down the stairs. Completely changed her story. And this was said in front of 20 of her coworkers as well so there are tons of witnesses. Johnny’s exes came forward saying he was never physically violent with them and that he was gentle. It’s not even a matter of equal abuse between them. She was solely abusive from the look of it and then destroyed his life in a narcissistic rage. She’s gross.

Further, she accused Johnny of violent rape with specific detail and her former PA (whom she also abused) came forward saying that the exact rape story down to specific details were her own rape story which she had shared with Amber. Who steals a person’s rape story?! Her lies and insanity are beyond comprehension.",Tiffany Malnar,0,2021-03-30T19:16:12Z

476,UgwysRgR8MjZd4PLFPx4AaABAg,"This is weird. Yes, there are a ton of “stans,” but I’m not a fan of anyone in this case. What bothers me is that there’s so much evidence of someone being abusive and vindictive AND getting their way, because some powerful media companies are invested in favouring one person in the story. The problem for me is bigger than these people. It speaks to a major cultural issue that needs to be dealt with.",drawitoutlady,166,2021-03-30T19:07:55Z
