That’s why he was arrested, charged, pled that he had no memory of the incident and got 3months suspended for 2years and had to pay compensation for the injuries he inflicted. The he and his interbred family turn it on it’s head and all blame us. Because of the behaviour my son witnessed he has suffered from anxiety and depression for years, this was because he felt he should have defended me and his sister but he was only a young boy, he’s had nightmares for years about us being in a car accident caused by his father and couldn’t rescue us.

(I'm sure I'm getting into trouble with these stories) But I heard of this rancher who came home early and caught his wife in bed with another man. He didn't rush in, he left and got his brothers. They then busted in.
I don't exactly when this happened, like I said I've had some trauma to the head, so dates, when and wheres  I just lose. But he had his brothers hold down the guy and he beat his wife.
Then he got, clipping shears?, and he gilded the guy. Didn't touch anything else but that. They then wrapped him in a rug and dumped him off naked somewhere. When the guy got to a hospital the doctor said, ""I don't know who done this but they know what their doing. There's no signs of trauma or infection besides the obvious cuts"".

Then the audios came out what 2 yrs later? (I didn't hear about it until like 5 months ago) but I listened & I started to believe her less. I binged ALL the audio plus her deposition & by the end I was disgusted with her! The things she said, she admitted to abusing him & in all the recorded conversations w/him she NEVER pushed or argued or brought up him abusing her. All after complained about was every time they started to argue he left. To me that was all I needed to know but I still listened to it all just in case. But she proved to me that everything she said was a lie. Her whole thing is abandonment. If someone consistently leaves to avoid arguments they really aren't the abusive types. But she thought all that would make him come back if he ever got wise & left! I believe ppl just have not heard any of that. Or they are just willfully ignorant.
