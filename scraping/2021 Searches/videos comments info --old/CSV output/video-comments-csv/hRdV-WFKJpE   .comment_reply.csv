3,UgxTSTpyGU1u9CIg_Ed4AaABAg,Ewa Sadowski,"She needs to be made an example of how one cannot blatantly lie on a huge scale about another person, portray herself as a victim of domestic abuse and make it public, have Johnny lose business opportunities because of her claims, and think that it is okay. Hollywood has always been full of hypocrites and  pedophiles who rarely do the right thing most of the time. However, Heard should be made an example of by becoming a pariah. She, herself, brought this upon her head and IF Hollywood wants to continue making money and not losing then firing her and replacing this actress would be sensible. This would send a powerful message to others that narcissism and sociopathy have no place in Hollywood.",2020-06-22T16:46:43Z,0

They hate the mere possibility of the ""Snyder Cut,"" because it represents, to them, the impending doom of their ""holy cause.""  Believe me, toxic feminists are highly aware of this as well.

They can see the end coming, and they are screaming as loudly as possible to sabotage the DC fans as ""undeserving"", and get the ""Snyder Cut"" cancelled, so that they can have a precious victory in their twisted cause.

134,UgzKSfgIdQbicY6VCbh4AaABAg,Trex bra,"@addison burns not true in the past women when they first started voting was dominantly right wing, voting stats show women tend to put all the eggs in one basket when it comes to voting. Whereas men tend to be more swing voters, u could even argue women are more naturally loyal then men are. Or u could argue men are more treacherous or u could argue women are more like sheep and cave to public opinion more easily because they're more naturally agreeable then men and that men are more critical and discerning, willing to take chances one informed decisions or in this case voting for politicians and legislation. Ultimately it is not women voting thats the issue, it's that people need to be more informed and in today's world there are alot of misinformed people who cling to suprisingly narrow minded ideologies without look at their movements as a whole. Finally everyone gorvernment, organisation, group, country and movement eventually gets corrupted by extremists, anarchists and loud narrow minded individuals who take over the whole movement/organisation and as seen throughout history it only takes a few people to ruin it for the many. In this case women who have dominantly been supressed throughout history of their own chosing in many cases yes but in many more cases forcefully. Now that they have a voice and large influence over the world history is literally being made, new variables that human civilisation has never encountered trully and to such length is being observed every day. So we have no roadmap or real way to navigate this unheard of and unseen civilisation. Dont blame all women as destroyers of civilisation, plenty of men have done that before just look at rome.",2020-06-17T16:39:01Z,0
