One single source issues a statement from Warner Brothers, then issues a statement from L'Oreal Paris, then issues a statement from Amber Heard's lawyers? The statement is also full of mistakes. It says Ms. Heard has chosen not to settle...but Mr. Depp is the PLAINTIFF--He's the only one who could settle. Ms. Heard is planting stories and trying to play us for fools.

The only person who could have made this many mistakes in an article is Amber Heard herself. She decided not to settle in a case where Mr. Depp is the plaintiff. She has damaging evidence, but didn't give it to the court in the domestic abuse case. The Judge closed the abuse case with prejudice. Does she think that she can easily fool everyone?",2020-03-01T10:07:15Z,0

She couldn't if she wanted to, Mr. Depp is the plaintiff in this case, and ONLY he can settle. Ms. Heard has incredibly damaging evidence...then why did Ms. Heard drop the case, allowing the Judge to dismiss the case with prejudice? It means that the Judge found the case so flawed that his ruling prohibits Ms. Heard from ever bringing her abuse charges against Mr. Depp. You can look forward to someone else's ""tiddies"" because Ms. Heard's are going to be in jail.",2020-03-01T10:00:49Z,0

That Judge dismissed Ms. Heard's case WITH PREJUDICE. She can never bring a Domestic Abuse case against Mr. Depp in the future. And it ends with they are not going to fight the case in the media.
