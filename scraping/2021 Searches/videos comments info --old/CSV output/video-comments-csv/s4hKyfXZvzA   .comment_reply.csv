In 5 years,  she already had one major movie (that alone would have gave her the full benfit) plus several other small films and potentially even Aquaman 2. 

I get the reason she donated to not be seen as a golddigger but she easily made enough if she donated the whole amount to take the whole benfit. Her not donating it leads to more issues but OP asked about the legal/tax benfits of donating the money.",2021-07-29T22:52:00Z,3

60,Ugz2uy9airAMPj0-JdR4AaABAg,Christine Perner,"Now look at what happened to Meghan Markle. She had multiple narcs working against her as well. He sister, Samantha, a vile woman according to her own mother and daughter, her father Thomas, Piers  and let‚Äôs not forget two of the biggest covert narcs in the world, William and Charles- who intentionally leaked fake nasty stories to the press to damage and vilify the character of Meghan. People can‚Äôt understand why Harry is so set on ‚Äúdestroying‚Äù his family? Well, now ya know. How family intentionally and maliciously went after and destroyed his wife. They did it behind the scenes by having their press secretaries- who both have curiously left their roles- leak the fake stories. And given that Jason Knauf knew where her father was, I‚Äôm 100% sure that he led the paparazzi to him and set him up to stir the shit before the wedding. They tried to use him to make her look heartless when he himself is the heartless one. How dare he refute her claims of racism. He wasn‚Äôt there and he doesn‚Äôt know what she endured. Harry was the one who heard the questions of skin color about his unborn son and if he took offense to the questions then I am SURE he read into the meaning behind the questions. But william never thought Harry would dare expose him, but he did. Even tho he didn‚Äôt name him, we know it was him because he was so enraged by Harry repeating the conversation that he knew was between himself and Harry, that william broke royal protocol and felt the need to claim they are ‚Äúvery much not a racist family. ‚Äú   If it wasn‚Äôt him who said it, he wouldn‚Äôt have felt so enraged and so obligated to refute the claims.  William claiming she had an ‚Äúagenda‚Äù was typical narc projection and to anyone who truly understands how narc abuse works, you know that HE was the one with the agenda, and that was to stop the marriage- however he could. By stressing her out. By attacking her via the press. By claiming SHE was the bully when all along it was HIM. If anyone meets the criteria of a narc, it would be the entitled, grandiose views of himself, jealousy, feelings of being threatened, overshadowed, etc, by someone he felt was truly beneath him. He is behind the Thomas debacle via Knauf. He is behind the Kate cried fake story. He got Jason to plant the fake complaint email of bullying. If the bullying complaint was true, then why was it never really acted on at the time? Because it wasn‚Äôt true and it was just planted ‚Äúevidence‚Äù to be later drawn upon to support his fake claims. He was dismissive towards Harry‚Äôs concerns for his wife because William himself was behind the abuse. And Harry now knows the truth and that‚Äôs why Harry will NOT shut up!",2021-07-30T20:14:17Z,0

64,Ugxig_3RrawZ3yo1ENx4AaABAg,La Bella,"@STB 1971 Incorrect, LGBT relationships do NOT have a much higher DV rate. The highest rate is still on hetero women, by hetero men, the second highest is gay men on gay men, even when accounting for population. 
That being said, I am a strong supporter of more resources for men in DV situations, and it doesn't matter if it's a man being abused by a woman or another man. The fact remains is there is so little resources to help men in these situations and because of a toxic mentality by society, too often men feel like they should just suck it up and take it. 
This is wrong, and it breaks my heart. NO ONE should be abused, and if they are, there needs to be resources to help them get out of that situation, and gender doesn't matter. I am also against the way men have historically been mistreated in the family court system. This is ALSO wrong.",2021-07-31T15:08:17Z,0
65,Ugxig_3RrawZ3yo1ENx4AaABAg,octoberapple,"@Chili Pepper wrong. they do not always arrest the msn, or even file a report, even when he is abusive. police act out of their own personal biases (sexism, racism, classism, etc. whatever they may be), and seem to be highly susceptible to believing narcissists' lies. 

they don't even always respond to calls. supposedly cos they're dangerous situations and they're too scared for themselves. that's somehow become a justification to just not show up at all. 

& however much money anyone is getting, there aren't enough shelters for women either, and they're often advised not to go, as shelters can be as or more dangerous than the home. 

no one should have to be fleeing their home cos of abuse. the violent, abusive person should be taken from the home to jail. just the fact that isn't the premise, but instead that the victim should have to flee and hide and be financially/materially devastated and go into counselling and whatever else, is proof of how little society cares still. the focus should be on the criminal.",2021-07-30T20:37:36Z,0

The feminists went further and pushed the laws based on The Duluth Model- which as no scientific base. Basically what most people don‚Äôt know, if the cops show up for a DV call, they will always arrest the man even if she assaulted, because as per the Duluth Model- she was abused in some past that she finally took action. So why cops always arrest the man- so they can always increase the stats that men are always the abusers and women are the victims no matter what the situation- so VAWA can get 2 billion a year in funding.
