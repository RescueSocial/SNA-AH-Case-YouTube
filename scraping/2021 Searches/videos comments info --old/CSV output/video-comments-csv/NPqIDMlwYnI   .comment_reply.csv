So why not trust the statement that was made by the venue afterwards that said it wasn't staged and the attack was real.

Apparently she invited him to ""jokingly fight"",but they were ""pushy fans ""and they were around him(he was alone without s√©curity agents) for a long time ,maybe she approche and intrude him asking for ""jokingly fight "" and he felt invited to do a ""d√©monstration"" on her (he ""choked"" her collar) that results in a ""violent"" behaviour because they were not "" playing the same game"" .Or maybe he felt irritated by things that we don't see and he responded in an impulsive way. Maybe they were just playing. They were ""pushy"" and I don'think they were fans. We are not judges  and we have no contest. And the contest is everything . The vid√©o is edited and little editing can totally altere a narrative. And the lie (tell that the police arrived but it wasn' t true) is the second ""editing"". The   ""victim"" and her friends had a calculated and manipulative behaviour wich was: telling lies about police,editing a video,put it online to distroy someone...not a ""normal victim behaviour"".  ...so...The police was not even involved. No police involved, no trial, no judges,no sentence of a court, no medical documentation of injuries. In serious cases all this qualified people (not us from our home) are involved.

However, there were also times during the depositions and testimonies where Heard and her friends committed perjury if the audio tapes are to be trusted, and she is no stranger to openly lying on the stand, as Australia is charging for perjury when she went to a
Australia with the dogs. Not only that but there has been statements by one of the charities that Heard reportedly made the donation to saying that they never received a donation, this was brought to a judge by Depp's lawyers who has granted them the opportunity to investigate the claims. I'm pretty sure only a fraction of the money she pledged has been donated. 

Looking at the UK libel case against The Sun, it was a ridiculous decision. There were several testimonies from police officers, as well as evidence given as video and audio recordings. Keep in mind this isn't a criminal case, so the it doesn't need to be beyond a reasonable doubt but only majority sure that they didn't have the evidence to say the thing that caused damages. The judge made it about a criminal case rather than libel, and disregarded key testimonies, there have been some lawyers on YouTube that have spoken about the case. 

They both have a lot to lose, but I think what is angering many is the mishandling of the situation and the fact that even now that there is substantial evidence to prove that Heard was abusing Depp, she hasn't lost roles, but Depp has.",2021-09-27T17:19:54Z,1

217,UgycXEOl7nTpKRbnOmF4AaABAg,AKSBSU,"@Lexii Loo   He's also male. This is the norm in the court systems. Usually no one cares because it's happening to normal, everyday people. Men on average get over 60% longer sentences than women, and in cases like these or custody or divorce cases, men almost always lose no matter what the circumstances. I've been assaulted without warning or provocation by an ex-girlfriend. I got punched in the face about 3 times and defensively grabbed her wrists until she stopped. I was told I was lucky she didn't have me put in jail for ""putting my hands on a woman,"" i.e., holding her wrists until she stopped trying to punch me in the face. They said I could have left bruises on her arms. I wouldn't have been all that surprised if they looked for bruises on her fists my face might have caused. Depp has no chance in the legal system against a female accuser.",2020-11-14T12:49:31Z,9

However, while I still support Fantastic Beasts for reasons I have already given, I will not see any future Pirates of the Caribbean films, because Johnny Depp made those movies as great as they were.  Kids today still love Captain Jack, as well as several other of his great characters, and Captain Jack makes appearances at children's hospitals to entertain sick kids.  I hear that Eddie Redmayne was also going to children's hospitals, letting Newt meet the sick kids.  I'm sure other popular actors have done the same for little fans.",2020-11-12T07:20:38Z,10
