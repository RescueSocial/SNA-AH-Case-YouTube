5,Ugwt2rDKb74CQtDYebh4AaABAg,"This is so very obviously Raquel.  Which means Raquel lied under Oath in her declaration to the Courts.  Does anyone know if Raquel was specifically asked if SHE was the Anonymous 911 Caller that Raquel & Io & Amber tried to pretend was ‚ÄúLauren‚Äù? Did that come up? I think no doubt it‚Äôs gonna come up at the Trial in Virginia.  We shall then get to see all Heard‚Äôs shady Hoax CoConspirators really turn on each other.   There‚Äôs no way the police DON‚ÄôT have access to the identity of that 911 Caller.  If she used a cell phone they have the cell number.  If she used the Eastern Columbia Bldg lobby phone -then Depp has access to the surveillance footage from lobby.  
Either way, there‚Äôs evidence who the caller was.

Wondering now if this is part of Heards demands from LA police for all records related to the incident that night.  Heard lawyers need to desperately know how much damage control of witness evidence is necessary.

Take thisüëÜinto consideration, along with Whitney Henriquez‚Äô lies on stand in relation to testimony it was Depp, & not Amber who almost pushed Whitney down stairs, and Jennifer Howell and all the Art of Elysiam witnesses -who know Whitney lied for Amber on stand and shits about to get  real for Amber & her Coconspirators.  Tic Toc!

What are the odds that after Amber sees all the evidence Depp has against her she breaks down crying and tries to accuse her publicist Gottlieb & lawyers fault for advising Heard to setup Depp? 

I think odds are not as bad as you think.

First of all she sounds like the kind of woman who knows Johnny but wouldn't know he is violent if true she is supposed to be surprised and shocked but there is no surprise or shock and a woman in a situation like this would sound a little angry but she is not.
she sound like she is doing a normal phone call but there is also a little bit of hesitation in her voice this is fear which is for lying to the police she is worried about the consequences of what is she just did
and another extremely powerful emotion in her hesitation is absolutely guilt this subconscious guilt this the kind you can't hide unless you're a sociopath ,she also says things like ""I don't know - that is all I know- I have to go"" first two phrases are like she is trying to escape telling any other lies, the third is like she is not  interested in this monster who is beating her friend HA her friend plus she said that the assault is happening right now so a genuine call she would say hurry up or she would be angry that the emergency lady is investigating and asking questions while her victim friend is being abused by this vicious monster but no she didn't sound like that at all and she wanted to remain anonymous so she wouldn't testify and get exposed for her lying and her manipulation her and that narcissistic bitch amber heard

It is feasible I guess that a person could hear an incident on a call with a person they don't know well. So 911 had to react. But honestly, once the police got to the address they saw no injuries and no damage to property.

154,UgyfMxxnd4Ctk1CnCkx4AaABAg,"Amber Heard's team seems to be out to bury her.  This is the FIRST 911 call to be placed that night.  Unfortunately for Ms. Heard, one of the original co-conspirators, Raquel Pennington's ex-husband Josh Drew, who gave his deposition in November 2019, now contradicts the original story. The entire fabrication is coming apart at the seams.  The co-conspirators had NO IDEA that Mr. Depp would bring two security guards with him--but, as he was going to inform Ms. Heard that he was filing for divorce, he expected her to become violent.  They waited at the ONLY door to the penthouse apartment, listening carefully, expecting to have to break up a fight.  When Mr. Depp told Ms. Heard it was over, she became agitated and called iO Tillett Wright, to explain that the ""defecating in the bed"" was a ""harmless prank"".  Mr. Depp didn't care, tossed the phone on the sofa beside Amber, and went into the kitchen--at least 20 feet away.  Ms. Heard began to scream into the phone ""Stop hitting me!""  Raquel Pennington came out of the hall closet, where she was hiding, waiting for her cue. As she began to scream ""Leave her alone"", she realized that two security guards were standing behind her, observing her.  They moved to the living space immediately, and observed Ms. Heard yelling into the phone, and Mr. Depp across the room, in the kitchen.
     Everything was unraveling quickly.  Two unexpected witnesses were in the room, and had observed everything. Amber and Raquel changed their screams to ""Don't do that again!"", but the damage was done.  Their story was that Amber had texted Raquel to come from her (FREE) apartment, and she had run down the hall to save her friend.  But she didn't pass the two security guards waiting at the ONLY door.  Mr. Drew has testified that Raquel Pennington was NOT in their apartment, as she swore to in her deposition, but was waiting in Mr. Depp's hall closet.
     The first 911 call was actually made as Mr. Depp and his guards were exiting the building.  Mr. Depp was never alone with Ms. Heard.  And the poorly conceived lies are falling apart.
     L.A.P.D. Officers Melissa Saens and Tyler Hadden responded to the 911 call.  They are trained in Domestic Violence--and if there is evidence, they do not need to have the co-operation of the victim to bring charges.  They examined EVERY Penthouse Apartment, and Amber Heard's person thoroughly, and found ABSOLUTELY NO EVIDENCE of any violence.  They confirmed everything in their Police Report, and will testify on Mr. Depp's behalf.
     Since the plan fell apart, Ms. Heard and her co-conspirators attempted to ""re-do"" the events.  Ms. Heard had iO Tillett Wright call 911 again, at 10:07, saying she was being assaulted AT THAT MOMENT...But, Mr. Depp and his security are on camera leaving at 8:29, and they did not return.  iO Tillett Wright, lover of Amber Heard, had NO qualms lying for her.  This is the quote from Tillett Wright, ""I was on the phone...when he hit her.  I HEARD HER SCREAM.  I will testify.  Here and in court.  Under Oath.  WHAT ELSE DOES A WOMAN NEED?!""  Well, every woman AND MAN needs EVIDENCE...NOT the word of a bold faced liar.  This is what Tillett Wright had to say about Mr. Depp ""He is my brother"", ""who came to my rescue in my darkest hour"", ""and who I have credited with saving my own life"".  That was before Mr. Depp discovered iO and Amber were having a sexual affair, and he asked her to leave his estate where iO had been living free.
     A SECOND set of L.A.P.D. Officers came to the penthouse apartments, investigated, and came to the same conclusion as the first two Officers.  Their Police Report and testimony also support Mr. Depp.  It is NO wonder that the Judge took a look at the PROVEN to be falsified ""evidence"" of Ms. Heard, and the police reports and sworn affidavits, the security guards sworn statements, the video footage, and the multiple testimony that Ms. Heard had no marks on her...and DISMISSED the case with PREJUDICE!",NIBS,32,2020-04-27T21:28:21Z

211,UgxjGJhOdXKUKidFdsB4AaABAg,Ok. She could want to stay anonymous because they're celebrities and the call is public so the media could get ahold of it and if so you would be hounded at home and work by every reporter in entertainment new. Ugh. So I can see that. It was her attitude that bothered me. It was like she was bothered by making the call. Most people would call 911 out of concern. More of a worried voice. Her voice was more of a kid responding when asked to clean their room.,craig mosley,87,2020-04-27T19:10:55Z

I've been in a situation where a loved one was being assaulted and I guarantee you I didn't sound cool as a cucumber when we called 9-1-1.   This is ridiculous.

217,UgyyfQlt1mOrQvt_T4l4AaABAg,"Hahaha calling in to make an alibi. Doesn‚Äôt proof anything. Only thing it proofs is that Amber wasn‚Äôt doing this whole scam on her own. She had accomplices. The plot thickens. Listening to this persons sinister voice, I actually begin to believe they set him up to fraud him out of his money.
