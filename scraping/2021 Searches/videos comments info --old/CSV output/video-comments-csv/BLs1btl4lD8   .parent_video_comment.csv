I'm not gonna say someone is wrong or right when it comes to abuse but when it goes public like this no one should jump to anyone's side until actual evidence comes out and or wait until this gets investigated when it comes to celebrity news like this. They almost ruined him, even when there was apparent evidence she abused other partners beforehand. She literally gets away with this cuz shes a woman and this goes with the fact that men stay quiet cuz who's gonna believe a man can be abused as well. Not saying he was an angel either but hes been staying quiet and that's sad to me.",Cpn. Beartato,0,2020-02-28T11:28:55Z

She was the poster woman for a movement that in reality was against and was attempting to aide people suffering from what she herself has been subjecting Johnny and past partners to. She claims in rve recordings(after admitting to hitting and throwing stuff at him) that what she hates most about him is that he leaves when they fight. Definitely doesn't sound like an abuse victim to me.

Heard maybe a violent psycho, but I doubt she's leather face violent, just advise people from hooking up with this fruit cake. But at the very least she hasn't expressed the virtues of dating children unlike what gunn has done. Although gunn claims to be contrite, he doesn't act like it. What makes gunn  ' s  situation worst is that if he's allowed to go through with the big projects he's currently attached to or will be, there may very well be others with similar issues who get inspired and even emboldened by the fact that Gunn not only got away with his past behavior, he was lionized by people. If y'all are calling for heard ' s head, then y'all better be prepared to purge  every other asshole in Hollywood like gunn. 
Bottom line heard maybe a sadist, but her violence seems to be contained to certain situations which are probably avoidable. It appears she's not a danger to the general populace,  and she's able to act professionally while on the job which means unless she's involved in another verifiable incident there's not much that can and should be done unless current legal and civil proceedings find that the onus for this situation falls on her.

93,Ugy8q1PI04gjT9jxuaR4AaABAg,"Facts: BEFORE she met Mr Depp, in 2009, in the Seattle/Tacoma Airport, Ms Heard was arrested for the domestic assault of her partner, Tasya van Ree. Ms van Ree did not protest the arrest, left Ms Heard in jail overnight, and did not appear on her behalf at the arraignment the next day. The judge admonished Ms Heard, which she did not protest, and because they lived so far out of state, ruled to keep the case open for two years in case Ms Heard re-offended. Ms Heard tried to expunge this from her record AFTER she met Mr Depp. Fortunately, airports have to keep files on crimes committed on site. Ms Heard then had Ms van Ree state that the arresting officer was homophobic and exaggerated the assault. The arresting officer was an openly gay woman, who volunteered at domestic abuse shelters, and didn't mistake ""grabbing someone's arm"" with assault. BEFORE the divorce, Ms Heard SOLD her ""evidence"" to the tabloids, but when she had to submit it to the court for testing and verification, she DROPPED her allegations of abuse. The judge dismissed the case WITH PREJUDICE (she can never bring charges of abuse against Mr Depp again), an extraordinary circumstance indicating an intrinsic fault with the case, usually the evidence. We have been presented with EVIDENCE Ms Heard is violently aggressive to her partner in public. We HAVE NOT been presented with ANY EVIDENCE that Mr Depp has EVER been violent to ANY of his partners--as EVERY partner has issued a statement saying that he is NOT. So, please state the evidence you have that Mr Depp is violent, or STOP saying that ""You are sure that Mr Depp was violent as well"".",NIBS,0,2020-02-07T09:23:49Z

147,UgzlZqh11DU8g9fRbf14AaABAg,"And THIS is why I always tell people that it's usually best to wait until all the facts come out about an allegation before blindly believing in it because you never know what facts might come out later.  Of course, this is also why I tell people when judging an athlete, movie star, music star or whatever, you should never associate your personal opinions and biases with their performance.  More often than not, people will usually make that mistake to where if they like a person, then they'll ignore all their flaws and mistakes, while only acknowledging their accomplishments and good traits.  While if you hate a person, then most likely you're only going to see their bad traits, while ignoring all of their good traits, because it would ruin the narrative of hating that person completely.  I've seen that happen more often than not in my life time, and it's sad.


That's why when I watch a movie, I don't associate what I know about the person with how their performance was either behind or in front of the camera because those are two totally different things.  Let's take OJ Simpson for example.  Even if you want to say he was innocent during his murder trial, it still doesn't negate the fact that he was locked up years later for armed robbery from my understanding.  Not saying I think he killed his wife or anything because truthfully I don't know.  But I'm just saying that regardless if you think he's a murderer or not, it's still a proven fact that he was locked up for armed robbery.  Nobody can really dispute that.  


However, when I watch the ""Naked Gun"" films with OJ in them, I'm not going into those movies thinking ""Oh god.  There's that man who allegedly killed his freaking wife, and went to jail for armed robbery.  That freaking criminal....HOW DARE HE BE IN THIS MOVIE THAT IM TRYING TO WATCH!  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!""   In fact, I don't even see OJ when I watch those Naked Gun films, as all I see is Nordberg when I see OJ on screen playing his character because at the end of the day, his real life issues have nothing to do with his performance on screen.  Same thing in any part of life.  Even if you hate a coworker in real life, you shouldn't let it negate how you feel about their work ethic or performance at a job.  It's the same story here.


That's why I'm probably one of the few people that can openly say Roman Polanski is a criminal and should be locked up in jail, while still saying I loved his work in Chinatown, Rose Mary's Baby and the Pianist, without sounding like a hypocrite.  Same thing with Woody Allen. I personally think he's a criminal scumbag too for having an affair with his underage adopted daughter, when he was married to his ex wife, but that's not going to negate me enjoying any of his films.  Yeah, I think he belongs in prison, and he's a jerk.  No argument there, but he's still a damn good filmmaker.  Can't take that away from him.  


Anyways, the point I'm trying to make is nobody is perfect, and we shouldn't expect all these celebrities to be role models.  And most of all, we need to stop jumping to conclusions in society.  Let the facts come out first, and then make a decision whether you think someone is bad or not.",Lone Wolf,0,2020-02-06T18:51:27Z

Women can use that abuse card at the drop of a hat whether it happened or not and ruin a man's life even without evidence simply because maybe a man hurt her feelings or really anything that some women feels the need to and it's so easy for them to do because people are told they automatically have to believe a woman because no woman would ever make up something like that to ruin an ex career or their life for no reason. But there is plenty of evidence to support the opposite of that  it seems to be the actual go to attack for women against men even if she has been abusing a man for years and the man has never raised a hand in her direction. There are plenty of cases where this has happened that a woman accused a man of abuse because that's a trump card in a divorce case that can assure they win the divorce case and get everything they ask for and then some. Woman are devous beings who will use any tactic they have to , to get everything they want And more because after an abuse claim usually a judge will add even more as a punishment so the man suffers even more for something he absolutely never did. It just shows the greedy and heartless actions  woman will  go to too destroy a man simply because she can and everyone will automatically believe her because that's the narrative we have been forced to take and believe that woman are always to be believed and would never lie about abuse if it would help them in any way",hatred is power,0,2020-02-06T16:17:46Z

168,Ugwz8tBxsgvplfHc5oR4AaABAg,"There is a double standard and women hit men all the time, even in fairly healthy relationships.  The thing is that on average (please not the use of that phrase) it's harder for a woman to injure a man just using her fists than it is for a man to injure a woman.  That's just due to differences in muscle mass and bone density.  As a result, it's far easier for a woman to show the results of abuse than it is for a man, even if you take out the social stigma and embarrassment a man would receive for admitting it.   

In general, men are raised to tolerate and ignore pain to a greater degree.  Despite what Gillette ads try to imply, part of ""boys will be boys"" is wrestling and fighting each other and it is a normal part of how they socialize.  It can and does get out of hand and that's when parents and authority figures have to step in to tone it down. And that's where there's also a problem.  Most men will get to the point where we'll defend ourselves, but judging how much strength to use isn't an exact science, especially when you dealing with women who even in relation to a similarly size man has lower muscle mass and bone density. 

This is not to excuse anyone's abusive behavior, just point out that there are physical differences, not just social ones,  that probably make man more willing to take it.",Carl Rood,0,2020-02-06T15:55:46Z

While it's true that most domestic abuse is mutual, everything I've seen points to this not being such a case. Heard has a history of domestic abuse.

That being said: Mob justice isn't the way. Rather than cancelling Heard, petitions should be aimed at justice reform and increasing punishment for perpetrators. Punishment that can't simply be bought off by rich people. If she can't make the movie because she's in prison, then that's fine, but let's not as an audience decide who gets what punishment. Torches and pitchforks are a sign of a crumbling justice system, but they're also really, really bad at nuance.

Supposedly, Amber brought up having a 3-some and (allegedly) introduced the girl to Johnny as a random stranger, when in fact the girl and Amber had known each other for years. In fact, Amber also cheated on her previous partner‚Äìthe one that she abused‚Äìwith that same secret gf. Not knowing this Johnny and the two women (allegedly) had an encounter or two, but that was supposed to be it. 

Following this, he went off to film a movie and was away from home for weeks, whereas Amber moved the girl into their guest house without telling him. When he came back, Johnny's house cleaner informed him of Amber's tryst, and he became furious after catching Amber and the girl in the guest house. Johnny threw amber out then and there. I personally never believed that Johnny was totally innocent, but it was obvious that Amber was using him and I was so pissed when Amber announced that she was still gonna be in Aquaman.

At first, it was all the gossip, but eventually, the media stopped reporting on all the drama, and the general public's short-term memory kicked. Amber took her grief to the media, trying to downplay the situation, but the court of Public opinion was not on her side. Then, out of nowhere, Amber and her not-so-secret gf (by this point it was just a ""friend"") came back with accusations of Amber being abused. The witch even went as far as trying to reach out to ex-gf‚Äìthe one she abused‚Äìto help her by promising to give her money. I initially thought that the news outlets would look at the timeline, as well as the people involved, and see that things weren't adding up. But nope. Even after the ex-gf came out against Amber they wouldn't listen and attacked Johnny. 

So to me, this drama is coming back full circle. Again, I don't believe that Johnny was totally innocent, I could easily by them being dysfunctional and emotionally abusive towards one another, but I never believed that Johnny was the monster that made him out to be.",lucariomew358/2,0,2020-02-06T11:59:40Z

Amber Heard is one of the founders of the MeToo movement and she has used this to further her career. She is a spokesperson fir the MeToo movement as a whole, and frankly is setting a despicable example. It is because of her and her sycophants that we have the cancel culture that is destroying lives every day. It is because of her and those like her that Vic Mignogna was forced to take legal action to save his career and reputation. It is because of her and those like her that Zoe Quinn was able to drive a man to suicide and then get rewarded with a multi-million dollar contract at Marvel Studios. It is because of her and others like her that it's become acceptable to hate all men (especially white men).


MeToo may well have been founded on noble intentions but everybody can now see that has devolved into a malignant witch hunt driven by extremist ideology that has deliberately destroyed lives all across the world of entertainment and media, and this disgusting abuser is responsible in part for all of that.


She needs to go, and ANY studio that hires her in the future will NEVER get a penny from me. Hollywood needs to root out these evil people otherwise the paying audiences will do it for them by voting with their wallets.

I've been following this for months, read the documents where she admits under oath that she abused him. 
Saw the pictures where she cut part of his finger off, where he had bruises all over his face.
Saw the mobile messages her parents sent Johnny. 
Read the statements from the police officers that were there when Johnny apparently hit her and this whole shit started. Where they did say that the evening they arrived there, nothing had happened and she didnt have any bruises.

(Heck, I'm planning a book series about a Half-Orc woman who's a swashbuckler.  Not a pirate, but still a swashbuckler.)  Regarding Amber Heard, I was dubious of her claims right from the start.  I have witnessed enough false accusations and seen enough people who will ruin another person to attain their own goals to recognize that oh-so-telling stink of B.S..  The city I live in has had no less than... I think it's at least four or five fake hate crimes within the past two decades, for example.  The thing that gives them away is that they're always something about them that seems scripted.  The fake hate crimes were always a little too perfect for the headlines.  Likewise, when someone (male or female) with a personality like Heard's accuses _anyone_ of anything, you should always maintain a healthy level of skepticism.  Prima donnas like that will not hesitate to lie or misrepresent things in a way that makes them the poor victim and the other person an absolute villain.  Yet there's invariably something off with their performances.  Real victims don't behave the ways that they do, at least the vast majority of the time.  And, again, their claims are always just a little too perfect for the headlines.  Click-bait.  That's what it is.

279,UgwFekTyPMMlZKwPmER4AaABAg,"I'm going to say something that will likely make me unpopular. 
Abuse is abuse.
It doesn't matter which gender, age, social or financial status of who abused whom.  There isn't an excuse.  I admit I am passionate on this because my parents spent their entire lives working with children's organizations and other abuse advocates.  I've seen too much, and it make my blood boil.  
I also caution the natural instinct to rush in headlong.  I have mixed feelings about Johnny Depp.  I have mixed feelings about Amber Heard. 
Also, for the record, no, I do not 'believe women.'  I believe abuse ravages all people. I believe we should take all accusations seriously, but at the same time keep a level of reasonable doubt in favor of even the accused.  The human race is gifted with many things, but too many of us lie.  Too many of us will do anything to harm someone else, including falsely accusing them. 
So what do we do?  As best as possible, separate all parties involved. Speak with kindness to all parties.  Fact is you may not know WHO is the abuser and who is the abused. Get the facts. Keep a rational head while keeping a compassionate heart.  And when the truth comes out, pass sentence to the fullest of the law, regardless of how popular, attractive, or whatever status the abuser may have.  We owe it not only to the abused, but to ourselves, and to our future generations.",Gryffen,1,2020-02-06T05:13:04Z
