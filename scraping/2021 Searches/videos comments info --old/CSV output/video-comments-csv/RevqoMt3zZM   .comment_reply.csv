It means a lot to have your support especially since I'm such a tiny creator. I actually suffer from depression as well. I made a video on it a couple months ago.

18,UgztIhZnq5_HE_ZH6rF4AaABAg,NIBS,"@Karmas Facts , I am a survivor of Narcissistic Abuse, and now I counsel young adults who are experiencing Narcissistic Abuse. I deal with the suicidal thoughts of youths caused BY people like Amber Heard. Victims of narcissists actually commit suicide. In forty years of practice, not a single narcissist has ever committed any act to harm themselves. Narcissists fall into a very narrow psychological band of behavior.

Professionally, I deal with the victims. They are innocent. They do not deserve to be pushed to the brink of possible harm. In this case, the victim was Mr. Depp, and, by his own admission, he became suicidal. No one cared BECAUSE of the ""false narrative victim"". It takes years of therapy to become emotionally stable after surviving Narcissistic Abuse. I will continue to work on behalf of the victims. If a narcissist is suffering because of the horrible devastation and actual crimes that they have purposefully committed in order to destroy their victim, I will still stand with the victim.",2020-05-09T06:17:33Z,0
19,UgztIhZnq5_HE_ZH6rF4AaABAg,Karmas Facts,"All these very dramatic and unpleasant events happening to a person simultaneously isn't healthy to any human being ever. When that happens it can bring up suicidal thoughts in a person. So weird that people , adults even, rather say it's the person's fault so it doesn't matter. Just saying it's the person's fault and just refuse to understand that negative emotional events happening almost all at once realistically can open the door to suicidal thoughts which can become actions.pointing fingers at the person and of course bringing up whose fault it is really is so odd for an adult to focus on. Adults know pointing fingers, saying whose wrong, who started it, isn't the point when the topic is that a lot of human beings, especially younger individuals , don't fair well in an atmosphere like that whether they caused it or not. That the actual topic is it's concerning since that combination can lead to suicide.",2020-05-09T05:54:45Z,0
20,UgztIhZnq5_HE_ZH6rF4AaABAg,NIBS,"@Karmas Facts , then Amber Heard should have thought about it before she created this perfect storm. Mr. Depp was older (55), but HE had to deal with the death of his mother, his children receiving death threats from Heard supporters, being publicly accused of domestic violence, and discovering that the Management Group that he trusted had spent a large amount of his wealth, and had mortgaged his Hollywood estate, and defaulted, so the bank was foreclosing within days, and he lost his ""Pirates"" franchise...and, unlike Ms. Heard, he was not the cause of all these things.",2020-05-09T05:12:17Z,0

22,UgztIhZnq5_HE_ZH6rF4AaABAg,NIBS,"A lot of people lose parents in their teens. Thirty-four is young...but not THAT young. Ms. Heard, herself, is responsible for the divorce and the airing of dirty laundry. If she hadn't courted CONSTANT publicity, and sold herself as the spokesperson for domestic abuse victims, Mr. Depp would not have had to sue her to clear HIS name. In the recordings, he BEGS her to settle quietly. If Ms. Heard had not been so obsessed with hurting Mr. Depp's career, and personal life, she wouldn't have been fired. The blame for all of this can be laid squarely at Amber Heard's feet...and...as she is a narcissist, intentional suicide is very unlikely. They threaten, they even pretend, but they are the center of their universe, the only person who counts. I would be more concerned that she would take one of the guns that she brags about owning, and be gunning for Mr. Depp--because, even though he tried to divorce privately and move on, Ms. Heard is going to blame ALL of this on him.",2020-05-09T04:54:20Z,0

Even if it is fake, we know 1) AH is pissed off and outraged and 2) the studio will see the public support that the fake tweet gets. While I hope they have fired her, their lawyers are probably telling them to pay her, have her sign an NDA, and pretend they chose to amicably separate. A conscious uncoupling..... Otherwise they will probably wait to see how the courts are leaning. The only thing that would be worse PR than hiring an abuser, would be firing a victim. Even though there are recordings of her admitting to hitting him, and not being a victim, her lawyers will spin it saying she was so scared of his rage that she learned ""the hard way"" to just say what she knew he wanted to hear to ""keep herself safe.""
