0,UgyCzz6JwPzKU-fsgwV4AaABAg,S Storm,"Yes and no questions are always traps... Serious traps so she will have been coached to absolutely avoid answering them in that way. Not much in life can be reduced to such simple facts when you need to explain complex ities or fully testify to events. Only Caesar had the arrogance to reduce his conquest of Europe to ""I came, I saw, I conquered"". It is not the entire truth of the matter and that is equally deceptive a statement as forcing someone to reduce an event to a yes or a no. You do not have to answer such a question with a yes or no just because somebody else wants you to. Give her some credit. Everybody here sounds like  bloodthirsty Romans paying pennies to watch lions tear apart prisoners in the arena. She is surrounded by enemies and defiance is braver than false capitulation...

9,UgwZV5bwxnuOxhSn3jt4AaABAg,Kirsty Fairly,"@007nadineL -And his falling in love with her makes him deserving of being abused & having his life ruined? Utter bs, no one deserves that. First off narcissistic abusers are very good at hiding their true nature from their prey until it's too late and then it's incredibly difficult for the victim to get out of the relationship, Johnny didn't know when he first got involved with AH that she would turn out to be the monster that she is. And secondly he was also dealing with the trauma of having been abused as a child by his mother which made him incredibly vulnerable to someone like AH. By sitting there and trying to blame Johnny for her abuse of him simply because he fell in love with her you have basically insulted anyone who has been through abuse. Abuse victims already find it difficult to speak out against their abuser as it is, especially when the victim is a male & comments like yours are exactly why many victims don't speak up. Go educate yourself on abuse & why it happens & try having some basic human empathy instead of blaming the victims, & please don't bother replying because I will not be responding to you.",2021-04-28T12:33:16Z,0

I mean come on, if Johnny was really the monster she claims he is then why is he the one who was clearly trying to lock himself in the bathroom to protect himself from her while she was the one trying to force her way in to get to him, and she even admitted that she punched him once she got that door open. I honestly can't wrap my head around the fact that she's been caught out lying so many times now & is proven to have been the abusive one in that relationship, yet poor Johnny's the one losing work & seeing his life torn apart over something that he did not even do.

93,Ugwk8wIEqLCVm8qVa5B4AaABAg,Angela Baird,"I think they make the best studies because their audacity to push the envelope of their lies and manipulations is larger and bolder than the average person‚Äôs. Most of us would not have the audacity to lie blatantly and boldly attempt to manipulate everyone around us.   We have empathy and therefore know how horrible and disrespectful it feels to gaslight others to this extent. But because she has no empathy and has tried and succeeded at gaslighting and manipulating  people, she believes she will continue to have success.  Most of us have too much respect to even attempt to do this to others!",2021-04-10T21:53:13Z,9

99,UgxchT6M0w2sNWBIGyd4AaABAg,Caroline R,"You were spot on attributing Heard's behaviour to entitlement.
Lundy Bancroft states that abusers (Narcissists) are driven by the dysfunctional attitude of entitlement and are addicted to the rewards of their behaviour.
Heard's a Narcissist from the aggregate of her behaviours.
See HG Tudor's YouTube video about her where he accurately analyses her behaviours exhibited and her demonstrated Narcissism.
It's enlightening and engrossing.",2021-04-16T10:03:19Z,1

It's actually quite common in depositions to have the person being deposed eat or drink to help distract themselves from what's actually going on.
You also commented that an actress should be a better liar.  I see your well placed point and raise you this: a liar should be a better actress because she sucks at both! üòÅ",2021-04-27T07:38:16Z,1
