5,Ugyrtklgf0OsLLR9uJl4AaABAg,Rock Candy,"you are remembering correctly.  she didn't pay anything to children's hospital.  Johnny paid the first $100,000 and she insisted he pay the $$ to her instead so she gets the tax break.  Turns out she didn't want the tax break ...she wanted the $3.5 million. The letter from the CHLA asking about the donations can be googled. When it comes to the 3.5 for the ACLU - they are covering for her.  i have a strong feeling we can expect a similar situation with that charity donation (lack of).",2021-09-08T07:30:23Z,1

Rarely is this the case. Mostly it's circumstantial evidence that proves guilt. Have you read Damien Echols' medical records? Where it's noted that he drinks blood, that he thinks he's possessed and that his family is scared of him because he threatened to kill them? His previous girlfriend also gave evidence that he planned to sacrifice their 1st born child? Listen to William Ramsey investigates or Gary Meece's podcasts to find out more.",2021-09-08T14:38:48Z,0

44,UgzvIwrqfuvb255TNRt4AaABAg,Rock Candy,actually amber was very much believed when she first made the claims. Then the evidence started coming in that she was arrested for assaulting her exwife in 2009.  then people realized she was asking for penthouses and 50 thousand a month for spousal support in the divorce just days after his mother passed away.  Years later the audio tapes were leaked and there's Amber mocking Johnny saying no one will believe him that a MAN is a v1ctim of domestic vi0lence.  Then we have the LAPD bodycam footage showing she made up the TRO incident.  Then we have elevator footage of her cheating with Elon and also showing her with james franco.  then we have evidence that she had NO bruises on the james corden show and also before or after getting the TRO etc.  In fact...she has NO evidence at all...,2021-09-08T09:19:14Z,0

53,Ugx1VWYveZQXXL89qYZ4AaABAg,Brooke,"@Rock Candy oh I'm sure he was very unhappy. Toxic relationships do not make much sense. It's a push pull thing. When it's good it's great, when it's bad it's real bad. The people in the relationship know its sick but there so much love and hope and it was honestly one of the hardest things to let go. Even knowing full well it needed to be done. In these types of relationships you tend to lose people close to you because they just dont understand. Then you feel like the only one there for you is the toxic one. Again, pulling you back in, being there for you, wiping your tears and so the cycle continues. Noone is holding anyone hostage, they could leave at any point. When people go through something tramatic it pushes them together, seemingly creating another bond. Its sick but yet it continues because there is love. Once you get away you look back and think ""wtf were we even doing?"" And feel like such a fool. I bet they would have done it a few more times had it not been in the media.",2021-09-09T13:04:26Z,0

There is a clock in the background to prove that. The wine was his 1st glass, hence the need for a new glass from the cabinet. If he had been drinking all morning, he would've already had a glass. She said that (about the wine) to make people assume this, just like you did. That's what narcissist do. She new she was going to use this against him from the start. I'm not trying to change your mind, but to say he is just as bad as Amber based a minute video of him losing his cool, doesn't seem fair.
