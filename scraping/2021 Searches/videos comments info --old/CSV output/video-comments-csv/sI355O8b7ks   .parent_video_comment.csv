Especially because it's much harder for a man to seek help... Either no one is going to believe him or the society will just laugh at him. Some women (in my country for instance) are even allowed to not to treat men as HUMANS at all and it's perceived as something normal XD It's sad how men are treated by the society. 

Btw, YES I KNOW that men can be abusive too, I don't deny it. I just say that it's easier for women to get help and empathy, while men are usually left alone. And they can't even fight back too much neither (even verbally only) because they'll be accused of being aggressive and dangerousü§∑",Áå´„Å∞„Åã,0,2021-11-11T20:59:23Z

It's been a very hard time for him and he suffered mentaly. After a few weeks some collegues steped to my fathers side and it was revealed that the collegue who told lies, told lies about other collegues as well. She had to pack her stuff and was dismissed from Work. She only did this to my dad, because he was in her eyes a weak person and she wanted to climb the ladder of the Company and to get rid of every collegue she didn't liked.

37,UgyTUKFAd8QIWb5DLZ14AaABAg,"A senior in school announced that she ""saw"" me steal a few cubes of sugar from her classmate who happened to be my friend. 
Most everyone, including those who ""took"" my stuff without my permission, called me a thief.
Now the accusing senior is one of the most beautiful of my gender(female) I have ever seen.
Gentle, soft-spoken, polite and was nice to me. Even after the accusation.
Mehn! If I didn't believe the devil was real before that time, I sure did then.
Face of an angel. Gentle, quite and kind.
No one would ever believe it was a lie.
Of course, they could. I had been in the hostel long before she joined. And no one had had any reason to accuse me of theft.
But then when people hate your guts for their own unspoken reasons, anyone who can slander you is their heroine.
I will never forget.
Not because I was wrongfully accused.
But because the accuser looked and behaved too angelic to do such a thing.
If I didn't know myself well, I might have believed her!
Now that I recall, there were about two of such dark-hearted ""angels"".
One I just described.
The other somehow had me look like I was ""dating"" her boyfriend.
And I was treated like a pariah in the Girls' Hostel for that.
Story for another day.

62,Ugz9MgZTvvzEz97GvYx4AaABAg,"I feel so bad for Johnny depp and anyone who's been through an abusive relationship. As someone who lives in a country where women being abused/raped is barely believed (especially if she is someone who comes off as 'too strong' or 'too promiscuous'), *and* the men who have been abused are laughed at, no one wins but the horrendous abusers. 

What I hope comes out of this situation is for people to pause and *not* take any preemptive sides or villianise any party until more information is out. For people to listen to what the alleged victim has to say, then look/read the evidence presented, and check if the accused party has had a history of mistreating their partners in the past, and what those previous partners have to say. The worst thing is if the pedullum ends up swinging back the other way, then swinging back around and people end up continuously villianising the wrong person regardless of gender based on the most recent abuse case outcome being a man or a woman. 

Long story short, *everyone* can be abusive and manipulative. In terms of how we react to this, we can't turn around and disbelieve future female victims nor can we blindly believe them without knowing more, same goes to male victims. What we need to do is just to listen to the individual cases, see the patterns, share whatever facts come up and emphatise with the party you believe after reading all the factual information.",Sea the Parade,0,2020-11-25T10:20:18Z

He was white with almost blonde hair and a scraggly stubble. Well there were like 17 people and they all were going to help the girl. Only me and my Grandma stayed with the man.

We should look at the individuals, always. And definitely put off the labels - in this case, the labels of the ""good one"" and the ""villain"". And stop choosing sides. No one is either one or the other. We are all just human, with our light and darkness, all at the same time. That's my perception of it.

amber heard abused her ex girlfriend and tried to call the cop who was called on scene homophobic even though the cop was a gay woman. 
amber heard abused johnny depp and took HIS ABUSE STORY and made it her own and ruined his life.
amber heard abused her ex assistant verbally and mentally and used her CHILD for a publicly stunt without letting her assistant know.
amber heard abused her sister physically as well. from what we know one time but there could be more fights we don‚Äôt know about.
amber heard almost killed johnny depp because she hid medicine from him after chopping off his finger.
amber heard recorded johnny WITHOUT HIS CONSENT harming himself because he was so mentally gone from the abuse
amber heard stole a sexual assault story from her ex assistant (the one she abused) and tried to frame johnny depp for R*PE. let me repeat this. she stole the woman she mentally and verbally abused PERSONAL TRAUMATIC SEXUAL ASSAULT EXPERIENCE TO FRAME HER EX HUSBAND FOR R*PE!!!
and that‚Äôs just a FEW things out of MANY things that‚Äôs been revealed and PROVEN.
amber heard is an evil horrible person. johnny depp has dealt with a lot of trauma in his life. he was also abused by his mother but he still cared for her. even after being constantly abused by amber he refused to take her to court at first because he didn‚Äôt wanna ruin her career.. amber on the other hand is a spoiled rich brat who lies constantly and hurts and uses everyone in her path including her own family. she‚Äôs an manipulative racist monster.",cheri618,1,2020-07-28T00:50:05Z

133,Ugzq-Kd1kncR7DoG4M54AaABAg,"Not defending Amber, but I would like to point something that Pierre Xo says. It is true that you often hear women say these things like *""you don't fight for me"".* As a woman and having chats with many friends about their relationships, when they say ""you don't fight for me"", they meant more something like ""you are not interested in me"", ""you don't want this relationship as hard as I do"", ""you don't value me"", ""you don't show you love me"". They never meant ""coward"" or ""lazy"". If that is what men understand then there is a problem of communication (on both sides).
Not the case of Amber, and not saying all women are innocent. Just saying that what is often considered ""manipulation"" it is more often a different interpretation of the same situation. Two people in the same room, having the same conversation, get out of that room and the getaway of the conversation is going to (very likely) be very different. I have seen it in both men and women. 
What I hate of the Amber case is that it perpetuates the stereotype of women being manipulative and treating men like muppets. I don't know in which reality live people that say these things. Is it a mentality thing in the US? Have I been lucky that almost none of the women I know are like this?

Now that the world know who is the abuser and who has been the victim, where are feminists to support and believe him? Because as far as I know, this woman is still making speeches in feminist forums about equality and violence. When she accused him with no evidence, she was believed and defended, and Johnny got cancelled til the point of losing his job. But what are feminists doing now? Nothing! because male victims don't count for them, because they actually don't care about real equality.",Leu Mamk,0,2020-06-08T17:51:56Z

143,UgzupUPLDfCNARnLk9x4AaABAg,"The problem is that this case is not common at all, not because it is a man being abused, but because she seems to be a sociopath. Even today women have to fight to listen to and take into consideration, the cases of abuse we suffer are numerous and what commonly happens is because we have a misogynistic culture any accusations we make are ignored or distorted, especially in cases of sexual abuse. Women can tell they were raped and still listen to "" are you sure you did not want it?"", "" sure? he does not seem to be that kind of guy"", etc it is like even if 5 women are getting together to say that a guy raped them, their word is not taken in full consideration. I am not saying that proves are not needed, this is the police job, but that as a  society we should protect victims more. But when these victims are women being abuse all people say manly put them to be doubted. Society itself listen to men so much more and almost always given them the benefit of the doubt. The actress from The last tango in Paris spent years saying she was abused during the makings of the movie and nobody gave a shit at least to try to know the truth, just not believing her at all. Some years ago the director admitted what happed but not even admitting it. Just saying he called the actor one day before the scene and both decided that if the scene was real and a surprise it would be better for the movie, more believable. A scene of abuse, being making through actually a real abuse, basically. What happened? Fucking nothing to the director, the actor is already dead and the actress had died after a difficult life of drug abuse to deal with trauma.",Dayanne Paiva,0,2020-06-08T10:50:32Z

148,Ugxw-VJ61oszrx-BMrl4AaABAg,"The thing is with that type of issue it's a lot more complicated than it seems. Most of the time when a woman says that someone abused her, she's saying the truth, but because of ONE person like Amber Heard, all abuse survivors got scrutinized to an insane degree. Where I live, 1/1000 rape survivors (mostly women) report their rape because no one believes them in the justice system and they got blamed for the abuse... So it's not true women get immediately believed. Amber is not believed because she is a woman, she was believed because she manipulated people. She is a bad individual and does not represent all women or ""alleged"" survivors of abuse. On the other hand, men aren't believed either because of toxic masculinity and because people don't understand how manipulation and gaslighting works. It's terrible that when men face abuse they aren't believed or outright dismissed. Both of these things are part of a culture surrounding  abuse survivors that really needs to change and yes we need to treat equally someone's accusations, but we don't want a society who dismiss everyone either. We need to learn how to recognize manipulation from whoever does it so those people stop abusing the system as well.",Prince Ollie,1,2020-06-07T06:25:18Z

Physical abuse does not happen without the break down of someone's personality through psychological abuse first. No one goes on a date and gets physically abused right there and then. That's usually reported by the person being abused straight away because they know what happened is wrong. In the cases of domestic abuse the abuser introduces abuse slowly and gas lights the abused into silence. 
Mental and emotional abuse is also very hard to spot so it's easier to get away with and therefore more dangerous.",Pixel Senpai,0,2020-06-06T21:12:23Z

I just have a small disagreement with some of your overarching comments in the beginning about the pendulum on the entire ""patriarchy vs feminist progress"" issue which I mention because a lot of people won't watch past that. The pendulum hasn't swung anywhere close to the other way in an overall context, but this is certainly an example of a problem and what to expect if this kind of feminism actually goes too far. You really hit the nail on the head by highlighting the ""there can be no physical violence"" - this is really all anyone needs to hear to understand the situation. Most cities and locales, the police are required to arrest (or somehow remove and put in jail) any male present in a domestic violence dispute. Yes, if your woman starts beating on you, you stick around, and someone else calls the cops. They have to arrest the man in that situation by law and statute (which can more restrictive to laws). Johnny Depp was spot on with this, and if he was a normal black man, you don't ever accept any women creating a domestic dispute situation and stick around. You have to leave, or your ass ends up in jail.

I'll certainly defend or stand up for myself or any individual in a particular case where this is happening, but I wouldn't want to stop the overall feminist cause on a few, or even a lot of bad examples because we live in a society with millions of interactions and examples. You can find a lot of Amber Heards out there, but that's not enough for me to be say a movement of many more is bad.

See, she wasn't very kind to me. In fact she was disrespectful, like treated me with NO dignity, spoke down to me, demeaned me with condescension at every turn, tried to break me down when I was doing well, used me,  lied to me and our mother and then gaslighted me into believing that I was an abuser because : I had no other recourse but to shout LOUDLY. 


Like. . . .This girl, would not hear me, she would not respect me, she would put her hands on me, she would escalate things and treat me however the fuck she wanted and I yelled. When I yelled, she got scared and started crying and ran away. Eventually she got so scared that she left. 


I tried reconnecting with her, but she just ignored/  blocked me. 


I got angry and I sent her an angry message calling her a monster, and a cunt while pointing out that while I wasn't perfect, the way she treated me was always dogshit and declared our relationship to be over.


She then projected EVERY single little thing that sucked about her onto me.


Inability to act right because of a worldview. (She doesn't even know my worldview.)
Mom and dad enabled you. (They actually enabled her.)
My therapist enabled me. (This is the same therapist who told me ""All lives matter"" to my face when Black Lives Matter was becoming big and I told her ""No they don't, here is why."" and she was taken aback. THIS. LADY. CHALLENGES ME. AND I HAVE KNOWN HER FOR YEARS. She is NOT an enabler, she is my north star in a world that is cold and uncaring.) 
She ""agreed"" and our relationship was over. 


The next time I saw her, the first thing she did was invade my space, slam a door on my arm to start a fight, laughed at me, called me pathetic, we both broke the door and she yells : ""HES NOT EVEN TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR HIS OWN ACTIONS!"" She then proceded to try and ruin my reputation with my Older Sister and brother in law telling everyone how vitriolic and terrible I was. 


You should have SEEN the look on their faces when I calmly and quietly told them EXACTLY what she did.


My brother in law paused for a good long second like a fog lifted over his eyes.
My older sister had a look of pure disgust on her face. 


Full disclosure : I was NOT a saint in that car that day. I said some pretty fucked up shit. I told her ""Nobody wants you here."" I called her the N-word with a hard R. I wanted to physically assault this girl who was laughing at me. I still do.  It was a fake laugh, but the gesture itself drove me up the wall. Like you are supposed to be my sister and I have TRIED, but all you do is test, and belittle and treat me like shit and now you're laughing at me? Why shouldn't I fucking hit you at this point? But, I didn't and she laughed at me knowing full well I'd restrain myself. 


The worst part is, this is a common thing with my family.


My father needs me to be strong for him, as I'm his therapist.
My mother is cold and unfeeling as long as I'm functioning and she will never admit this, but we don't really have a relationship, and I have TRIED.


I will literally avoid going to restaurants with her because she is uninterested in anything I have to say that doesn't have to do with her.


She also broke me last semester and nearly caused me to commit suicide. 

And as for my little sister? Well, all of her flaws are my flaws and everything is my fault.


Remember how I told you how rude and disrespectful she always was? ""That was because of your big ego.""  was her reply to that.
I was a kid. . .Who was bullied. . . From age 5-19. . . . I was ostracized from 3 friend groups because of my uncallibrated behavior. I had to go to the hospital. 


SEVERAL TIMES. 


For mood disorders and suicide prevention. Once my mother sent me to a hospital because she felt that : ""she could not control  me."" Yeah, a teenager gets bullied, is angry and humiliated every day and you want to lock him up in a fucking loony bin?


Right now, I'm grappling with these insane mood swings and suicidal tendencies and EXTREME depression. 


Hopefully, I don't die. But, the distance from my family has done me some good.",Matthew J Barnes,0,2020-05-22T03:23:53Z

We are not uber fans or anything it just was so out of character for the actor. I know that we dont ""know"" him and people can have hidden sides but the heartwarming videos and first hand accounts of him showing up in costume to schools and hospitals didnt compute with the violence she stated. When the truth began coming out I felt relieved because I worried I had turned my back on my ideals by not believing her.

248,Ugwxk2CmDcuFm_hngqx4AaABAg,"Not long ago, I watched a documentary on victims of domestic violence here on YouTube and realized the whole thing was very one sided. The men were only seen as the aggressors and the women as victims. I know that there are certainly way more female victims, but the situation for male victims seems very dire! Well at least here in Germany where I'm from. There are hundreds of shelters and specialized institutions who will do their best to provide help for female victims. But at the same time there are less then 10 shelters for men in the whole country and the abuse isn't taken seriously as a whole. 

Heck if the abuser is female there are often little consequences for her. I read of a case where the guy got beaten up from his ex wife everytime he came to pick up his children for the weekend at her place and the court refused to do anything and said that they should find a solution themselves. So the poor guy had to relive his trauma everytime he wanted to see his children and bring someone with him, so that she wouldn't go bezerk! 

People in our society act like it's not possible for a man to be a victim sometimes! By the way, there is not 1 german documentary about this topic with a male as a victim on the Internet! Heck if a guy did hit his girl in public people would freak out, I mean we don't live in the 1950s anymore. But I have seen guys get hit and psychologically violated by their girlfriends many times before, even while out in public and people never take it seriously. If a girl hits a guy in front of the club for example, people will ask what he did wrong and be proud of her like girl power and so on... Heck I watched Titanic a while back with my aunts and they applauded when Rose spit on her assholish fiance. There is a massive double standard here. Johnny lost a part of his finger and the media still hasn't said anything about it in Germany, while they couldn't stop talking about drunk abusive old Johnny a year ago!",12wer3 wer,3,2020-05-04T19:22:17Z

271,Ugwa_nD4NkyZaHXC7b54AaABAg,"So many people focus on the physical aspect of abuse that they don't understand the psychological parts of it. It almost never starts out physically. It starts out mentally, emotionally, verbally. Gaslighting is a very power and very dangerous weapon to wield. I have had it used against me and I still suffer from the effects. The things that were done to me didn't go away just because I got away from the person. That isn't how it works. 


Yes there are double standards and as someone who was abused I don't want to have to question a victim when they come out and speak about what was done to them but at the same time giving someone 100% belief can also be dangerous. It's a very fine line to walk and one I don't think anyone has a true answer for how to handle such situations. 


We for sure don't know how to and a lot of the time many people refuse to even try to handle men who have been abused and that alone is just so incredibly wrong.


As for being blamed? Yes I was. I was blamed for a lot of things. I didn't find out till after the divorce that when the ex borrowed money from his parents he always told them I spent our rent money or whatever when in fact I wasn't the one who did it. He would blow our rent money or our money for bills on all kinds of random shit. 


I lost friends because he painted a picture of an emotionally unstable person and to be fair.. I had been hospitalized twice because at a few points in that marriage I thought the only way out was a very extreme and permanent way out. So he had 'proof' to flaunt around about how I was 'crazy' and 'unstable' and that is the reason he had to divorce me because he couldn't handle my issues. What he wanted from me was to fight back, to try to prove he was wrong. A lot of abusers (especially ones that use gaslighting) want that fight so they can use it as further 'proof' for their argument, but also because it means you are engaging with them again. They can basically keep you under their control. I however decided it wasn't worth the fight and anyone who was willing to believe him completely without asking me for my side wasn't worth fighting for.",Burning Shadows,0,2020-04-28T20:04:15Z

I was under their spell and believed every lie they fed to me, they made me hate my mom and to not trust her. They told me that no one should come between us. (They told me I was so important to them until I was just a nuisance, aka when they dated a mutual friend and left me to my growing mental spiral for three months.) There was a point where I started to believe we were no longer compatible as friends, and we were slowly drifting. Do you want to know what they did to try and get me to stay, even if it was only for pity? OD‚Äôd on a hallucinogen while on a trip with me and my mom, and ended up in the ER.

I was fighting for competitions. We both agreed to spar. We were both there to compete when trophies and move up in the ranks. Trust me women can drop them in just as fast as a man can drop a woman. I have never had the delusion that I was weaker because I was a female. This is something about society I've never understood. And I think it's because I grew up training and competing oh, and I didn't see my gender as a weakness. However as a trained fighter I am not going to get in a fight unless I absolutely have to, life or death situation. 
I know that society says that men are strong and women are weak but in my life I've never experienced that on a personal level.

I was in an abusive relationship both psychologically and physically, and I was able to finally walk away from it less than a year ago. It was a traumatizing experience that was really difficult to put into words for me, cause I endured a tremendous amount of gaslighting. After looking at these same Johnny Depp & Amber Heard vids, I'd get upset because memories of my past relationship would just come flooding back in for me too, and hearing you explain how your past relationship had taken on the same dynamic with tonality and pattern really helped me feel understood and feel a lot less alone. I'm learning a lot, and it's weird how abusers tend to be similar in these behavioral patterns and ""fit into a box.""

Although I do think it is important to be aware of the fact that incredibly many women are abused/killed/raped by their partners and there is still so much injustice there- so believing the victims is STILL important, because in many many cases still women are NOT believed, for example when they go to the police. (+ everything the #metoo movement was about) 
BUT 
there is not only black and white, people must realize that talking about violence (or sexism) against men does NOT invalidate women¬¥s struggles with these same issues. It is crucial that we raise our sons to believe that their feelings are valid, that they do not deserve to be hurt in any way (physical fights don¬¥t need to be a normal day to day occurance in a boys life!) and just have to ¬¥tough it out¬¥ (what feminists mean by ""toxic masculinity btw) but that they can voice their fears, concerns and express their hurt. 
AND
women have the capability to abuse, hit, punch, rape, lie, cheat, be pedophiles and overall horrible people. Funny how society is always so quick to judge women on everything they do, EXCEPT when it comes to violence and abusive behavior. This topic is so huge I could write and essay about it right now.

I currently live in a developing country (Pakistan) and in the society here, majority of the population blames women for lying, it is a normal practice for men to abuse their wives and children here with zero consequences. Just recently, a famous writer got away and was even applauded for disgusting verbal abuse of a woman during a debate (because she had the slogan of 'my body, my choice). This is the reason why it is necessary to have a  conversation about abuse and tell these people that women do not lie because here the rape victims are blamed for wearing inappropriate clothes. It is also often difficult for women to give evidence of abuse as well because they may report late due to fear of stigma. This is the reason why preference is usually given to the victim who reported abuse and if it's disproven of course the other should be punished. With celebrities, we should be even more careful and analyze the case thoroughly, perhaps without immediately putting blame on someone because of the gender (especially in developed countries) but it is a fact that we have to listen to the potential victim carefully and also not accuse them of lying because then it will be engrained in the culture like it is in Pakistan.

JOHNNY DEPP‚ÄôS HISTORY OF VIOLENCE

Posted on

December 15, 2017

Author

kyra

There are some advantages to be a middle-aged woman with Asperger‚Äôs syndrome, and one of those is that I lived through the 80s as a teen and remember it. And what I remember is that Johnny Depp was known as a ‚Äòbad boy‚Äô with a ‚Äòtemper‚Äô and a substance abuse problem prone to attacking people.¬†



The people who defend him online, which now tragically includes a woman I had hitherto had nothing but the utmost respect, JK Rowling, seem to have either forgotten or don‚Äôt know that the accusations of domestic abuse and assault against Depp by his ex-wife Amber Heard (which include pictures and video and a restraining order against Depp and a text from his manager admitting it and documents from other court cases involving Depp) are just the latest in a line of charges.

Johnny Depp is very pretty and (like Mel Gibson) seems to be very nice when he‚Äôs sober, but he‚Äôs also prone to getting wasted and hitting people who anger him. In 1989, Depp was arrested for assaulting a hotel security guard in Canada after the guard asked a drunken Depp and his friends to leave the premises. Charges against Deep were dropped after he promised a judge to be a good boy. (This works only if you are white or rich or preferably both.)



Then, in 1994, Depp was arrested again on charges of criminal mischief¬† when he destroyed a hotel room ‚Äì allegedly because he was having a fight with his girlfriend at the time, 20 year old supermodel Kate Moss. He had to pay almost $10,000 in damages, but again he got off. Likewise, in 1999, Depp was arrested for threatening the paparazzi in London. While it is easy to sympathize with a star threatening paparazzi, it still reveals Depp‚Äôs tendency toward violence when he‚Äôs hammered and annoyed.

Incidentally, he was involved with French model Vanessa Pradis at the time, and although Pradis has defended him as a ‚Äúsensitive, loving‚Äù man who never abused her, its obvious he was still capable of attacking OTHER people during their relationship. Bill Cosby didn‚Äôt rape every woman he met ‚Ä¶ it doesn‚Äôt mean he isn‚Äôt a rapist. Moreover, court documents by Depp‚Äôs former management allege ‚Äú[Depp was being] interviewed by public authorities relating to a serious and troubling issue involving his family ‚Ä¶ [Depp] knowingly lied to public authorities in several respects in connection with these matters‚Ä¶ [His actions] marked lack of concern for certain serious family issues.‚Äù So is Pradis lying for her children?



Johnny Depp was physically abusive to Amber Heard. People accuse his ex-wife for his actions by saying she ‚Äòegged him on‚Äô so they can still enjoy the fandom fantasy of who he is. Just like his friends and fans claimed his rages and assaults in the past were ‚Äújust Johnny being Johnny,‚Äù merely the kind of ‚Äúoutbursts they have come to expect on occasion from an actor who can be as otherworldly as the character he played in Edward Scissorhands.‚Äù

Just like people blamed Mel Gibson‚Äôs ex when he hit her, or the alcohol he drank when he called a cop ‚Äúsugar-tits‚Äù. Just like people claim Mia Farrow lied so they can still watch Woody Allen movies in the pleasant denial that he raped his adopted daughter. Just like people have always blamed the victim and given the abuser a pass.
-As for me, I won‚Äôt be watching the Fantastic Beasts sequel. I don‚Äôt watch the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. I don‚Äôt listen to my old Bill Cosby comedy albums or watch his videos. I don‚Äôt watch Woody Allen films, and I am hesitant to watch films with actors who have even worked with him in the last 20 years. (Oscars are so much more important than raped little girls?) I eschew any former favorites with Mel Gibson in them.

I am torn about Miramax films ‚Ä¶ which ones were the result of Harvey Weinstein‚Äôs sexual abuse? I stopped watching How I Met Your Mother, even the reruns, when they had Mike Tyson, a convicted rapist, on the show as a ‚Äògood guy‚Äô. (Which was a good move because the last season was reportedly shit.) I try my best not to collude with or support abusers and rapists.
-
But what to do about actors or authors whom I otherwise like when they support or collude with rapists and abusers whom they insist are actually ‚Äògood people‚Äô? Do they get a little leeway for having the same delusions about their friends and family that all human beings are capable of? I still love Rowling‚Äôs books; am I hypocritical to do so or would I be throwing the baby out with the bathwater because she defended know abuser Johnny Depp?

Denial is certainly EASIER to live with than the complexity of dealing with the fall-out of sexual and domestic violence. I can see why people prefer denial to facing uncomfortable reality.",The Amber Heard Playlist!!,0,2020-03-29T17:46:18Z

I have seen this kind of mental manipulation happen and have been on the receiving end of it multiple times. In my case it hasn't escalated to being physical but I can't say the same for some others. I remember years ago at NIFCA(Barbados) there was a skit about a man whose wife physically abused him. As a kid it was funny. How can a man get beat up by a woman. Now years later, as an adult you realized it was a possibility. It has been engrained in our psyche for generations Men=strong. If a girl is better or stronger than you, you're weak.

464,UgxKwkILNXLBLAUcGUB4AaABAg,"I have been narcissisticly abused and gaslighted by women, because I am more of a tomboy. My own mother and sister abused me psychologically. I have been abused by women who have been unsatisfied in their lives my whole life. It is hard to explain why they weren't satisfied, though, but I don't believe the world today is in balance, and actually masculinity is suffering very much when it is being in opposition to femininity. The idea of them both is to help out and complement each other, now madness narcissism has infiltrated most people's lives, it seems, and it is a widespread disease to fight for gender roles bullshit stuff, instead of just be a traditional man and woman, and have sex and interesting experiences, and mate with someone you share values with. The problem is people are not left alone by the media and if they are being narvissistically abused they are trapped in victimhood, in a prison almost, from which I personally can't escape even though I want to have a relationship and by now there is a person I am interested in . I am so scared of the emotional immaturity of my abusers that I am afraid of being wild and normal with him out of fear to not hurt him like they have hurt me for wanting to protect the reasonable rational, I think masculine, part of myself that I have. I may be wrong doing it, they feel I am a betrayer to my gender by not being a crybaby but looking for trouble to understand boys better. But I feel this is my responsibility, and I'm sorry if I am being wrong to both genders, messing with them, but I like being a tomboy. I just enjoy it. There is enough aggressiveness to receive in that role, too. I can assure you. People with slave mentality hate free spirited people, like me, like you, like Johnny and others'. They areinsane because they become abusers because of receiving abuse. They need to make peace with themselves in the past, to free others from their abusive was. There is no other way to deal with this stuff. It is epidemic, bigger than the corona. But nobody fucking shut down supermarkets because of it! The world is a very abnormal mess....

497,UgxXiAcZVFwJMykJtuF4AaABAg,"Yeah. Here's a quick story: I was a rather quiet kid at school. But I was also rather smart, tolerant, and somewhat empathetic(not sure if this is the right word, but I tried my best to not insult anyone on their race, gender, weight, height, whatever). And here we are in 4th grade. I have a female classmate that can obviously be deduced to be a bit overweight. Some of our classmates rarely missed an opportunity to make fun of her for her weight. And one day the straight up bullying was a bit too much for her. I was a bullied kid as well, mind you, one classmate even practiced some wrestling moves on me for real and regardless of my agreement or not, but I digress. SO, in that day she decides to blame ME for the insults and bullying. Unfortunately there were no teachers or adults around to prove what actually happened. So what happens is, she calls her two parents, they come, and in front of them and our class' leading teacher she accuses me of insulting and harassing her. As far as I remember, I attempted to defend her. But what I said to the teacher and in front of her parents was: ""I am not talking, until I get at least one of my parents here, It's not fair!"". Luckily, at least up to 12th grade, we have a designated teacher that is in charge of a certain class. And our teacher knew pretty well the type of kid I was and that I never really wanted to do any harm to anybody. So luckily we resolved the case somewhat truthfully, but it was still quite ridiculous. At first I was assumed guilty, even though I get it - kids are kids, they do stuff like that, apparently. But what was done about me and my ""personal bully"", who insulted and abused me for about 6 years? Nothing. Thankfully by 6th grade he did himself in by having too much low grades and absences, so he was forced to transfer, but it was ridiculous...",Simeon Tsanev,0,2020-03-06T23:45:40Z

i remember being accused of things i know not by the parents of older relatives for playing ""house"" with their kids even though at the time i was the youngest of the ones that were older but knew not except do what i was told..

i remember being groomed to do things, things i was taught is how you show love but later being told those were wrong later on and just end up confused especially after being yelled at like a monster and that i should've know even though an adult taught me those things..

living in a house filled with females whom always picked on you, body shaming as you grow and laughing at you as you try to learn because you don't learn like everyone else but then being punished by your own parent for giving back what they gave you saying ""you're a boy, it's not that big of a deal"" when in reality it really was..

being forced to live with bullies that shit on you, emasculate you in front of others making them comfortable to the same telling me ""stop wining, all i did was finger your butt, girls have it worst anyways"" like wtf man..

that type of fuckery, abuse can make you be someone you don't want to be, especially being sheltered in areas - with people that don't make it easier and always saying that the abuse i am going through will make me stronger like wuh??

how is incest powerful?? you growing up fucking confused as hell, falling in love with the wrong people and having fantasies you should not be fucking having..

how is getting fucked by a lesbiana at 10yrs telling you're her boyfriend learning the hard way after being made fun by her friends that the bitch is always on bottom powerful??

how is getting fucked by a policeman for 2yrs cause you believe he's a man that loves you, a figure you never had giving you the love movies always portray just dump you on your bday and tells you to ""keep it to yourself cause your g@y now"" a powerful thing??

you become so lost like you don't know what you are and who you want to be to the point you end up wearing a mask that reflects the world in front of you becoming a parody of your surroundings so you can blend, constantly lying because lying is safer than getting beat for telling the truth or being pushed to the side cause your now the ""touched one"" like idk..

it sucks when you talk about it and folks say ""and you didn't do anything?!?"" but when you do you're ridiculed and treated like a weak ass bitch or you're a terrible person if you fend off a female for yourself or even another male being abused because a female can't be touched whatsoever and you're not a real man if you can't take it..

folks talk about how terrible abuse but honestly i ain't seeing too many trying to mend things unless it gives them attention, benefits their narrative, or any other way beneficial for them.

smh.. being alone is lonely but at least i am safe.

In the case of the Amber Heard recordings it is plain to hear she is being manipulative, gaslighting, re-framing, re-writing history, attacking his identity and being verbally abusive. In some countries if a man was recorded saying what she had said it would have been jail.


In the case of Amber society tried to reframe it as Amber being the victim and Johnny should have been more sensitive to her needs, thus he is the abuser.

Are you aware that a boy, statistically, is just as likely (although certain studies put the percentage way higher making it about twice as likely) to grow up to become a rapist as he is to be falsely accused of it? If all men are immediately assumed guilty and carried off to the gallows, why did Shane Piche not get ANY punishment for raping a 14 year old girl? How about 33 year old Michael Wysolovski, who groomed a 15 year old girl online, convinced her to come live with him when she turned 16, who he then raped and sodomized, but got off without as much as a slap on the wrist because the age of consent was 16 in his state? Were you asleep when Brock Turner sexually assaulted an unconscious woman and spend only 3 months behind bars? Joseph Meili sexually assaulted an 11 year old girl and got off with probation. Eddie Martins and Richard Hall raped an 18 year old detainee in the back of their police van after they arrested her for marijuana possession, and guess what! They got 5 years probation! How about the Alaskan man who strangled a woman until she was unconscious and then proceeded to masturbate on her body, he got a free pass! How about Logan Osborn who tied a 14 year old girl up and sexually assaulted her (Osborn had previously assaulted another girl) and got his entire 10 year prison sentence suspened by a judge who earlier released a man (despite the state's request to deny his release) by the name of Dana William, who was incarcerated for raping his ex-girlfriend. Dana William ended up killing his ex-girlfriends father and mother shortly after his release. These are just some little highlights ofcourse. Should we have a conversation about all the rape kits that go untested? Do you want to talk about Harmony Allen? How about the 17 year old Irish rape victim who's lacy underwear was presented in court as some twisted ""evidence"" of consent? The 27 year old man who raped her got off free by the way.

It is important to look at the evidence and not to blindly believe one side, but there remains overwhelming evidence against Johnny pointing to  sustained domestic violence, and even evidence that suggests that the finger injury was self-inflicted as a part of his own abusive outburst. I don't doubt that Heard has had her own violent outbursts (which should be taken in context of what seems to have been years in a domestically abusive relationship) and no violence is acceptable, but to ignore the evidence against Johnny which is far stronger and far more detailed, as soon as one audio file allows people to turn against the woman, to me shows the underlying sexist bias that remains.

623,UgwH4w9PXP-_uBI-VzB4AaABAg,"Hmm, idk if you can call it abuse, but I‚Äôve experienced something bad with my dad‚Äôs new wife.

This was a while ago. I‚Äôm talking, when I was about 10-12 years old, and I‚Äôm 22 now.
I was having a really hard time with school, so I would often skip, and use the time to comfort myself with food instead (basically overeating).
And my dad‚Äôs wife made this whole system, that if I went to school and lost weight, she would give me a gift or something. Simple right?

Well, she also had a sort of punishment system. That if I didn‚Äôt reach the goal she set for me, we wouldn‚Äôt be going on vacation to Greece. She basically told me, that I would be responsible for our family not going on summer vacation.

Then she would start calling me lazy, if I complained about me being sore after a long cycling trip, or she would blame me for stuff disappearing from the fridge. She also tried to sign me up for a ‚Äòfat camp‚Äô.

Just so you know, all of this happened after we found out that I had social anxiety.
So there was a pretty big reason why I would start crying and shake like a leaf, every time I thought about going to school.

And my dad didn‚Äôt do anything in this situation btw. He let her do it all, and even threw me and my little brother under the bus sometimes, if we accidentally told her something we shouldn‚Äôt have, that our dad had told us, he would just straight up say to her that we were lying. Right in front of our faces üôÉ
(It‚Äôs safe to say, that we‚Äôve lost a lot of trust in our dad after all that)

But anyways, I moved into my moms place permanently after that shit show, and later found out that the social anxiety was just the tip of the iceberg. I apparently also had ADD and autism. So that‚Äôs wonderful.

And they‚Äôve never apologized, or even acknowledged really, everything they‚Äôve done wrong. Both to me, but also my little brother. My mom also got thoroughly attacked, them saying that she was a terrible mother and that it was somehow her fault that I had all these mental problems. Just criticizing her parenting, when she‚Äôs the only one who‚Äôs been there for us, and *believed* us, this entire time (because yes, they didn‚Äôt believe that I had these issues. That it was just an excuse for me to be lazy)


Anywho! That was hella long, and I‚Äôm sorry about that üòÖ(and for any grammar mistakes. English isn‚Äôt my first language, but I try)

630,UgyqAz7luNNdxeDNoud4AaABAg,"The sad thing is, more people I've talked to seem to be willing to believe Amber over Johnny when it's so, so clear to me that Johnny is the victim here. I don't know much about either's past, but I know that in the present situation, Johnny seems to be doing everything he can to just be civil, if not find a way out of it, whereas Amber seems to want to keep going on and on about it. I can't be certain as to what is exactly true, but I do know that our society is often so quick to accept female abuse victims with open arms, that it almost entirely neglects its male victims as well. I do believe Johnny is the victim here, full stop. But he's not milking it for what it's worth. He's not drawing it out. He's trying to come to terms with everything, and honestly, it feels like he's losing -- as sad as it is to say. It's almost like Western society has this idea that women ""have"" to be the victim, whereas it's ""impossible"" for men to be victims in their own right. I know there's something deeply psychological and even sociological going on here, but I just can't fathom it. We support female victims with almost no question.

702,UgyvoAFvZ9lLDXLtJ8p4AaABAg,"Hello my favorite Son in my head and heart,
The one thing you didn't touch on but we're spot on with in the beginning of your vid was Loyalty!!
In this convo from Hell between them what she is absolutely Pissed Off about is she wants blind loyalty and for all of her button pushing and her false compliments to him, is the fact he will Not BEG her to blindly stay with her, be there for her how she sees fit, to PROVE his loyalty to her and then belittles him for walking away and refusing to Fight with her and for her!!!! She's lost control of him. And here he went and did the Absolute Best thing Ever in these sorts of situations, Walk Away!!!
There are great points to be made from 2 other times her true colors were shown clear as day and show the mask slipping. One is the footage from the elevator cam with her friends and she's walking into the elevator eating something and the girl took a bite then hocked the rest over her shoulder and on to the floor behind her. Gross, no lady there!
Another is the film of her giving deposition of and incident involving her sister where she couldn't keep her story straight, oyyyyyy gaslighters man, gonna have to start calling her the little matchstick girl, anyway,, just as that is about to start the narcissistic sneer of, Oh I Got This, is beyond freakishly clear!!! Palpable!!! And to tell ya the truth, as an actor she just plainly really sucks! Those are just the facts Jack. At least she fessed up to saying she could not say she won't hit again in the future. Oh ffs!! 
She has the eq of a drunk 13yr old mean girl! She's a real Katie Kaboom lol The blind and stupid leading the blind and stupid an in utter amazement that she's not fawned over, believed, fought for her way and gobsmacked that Her behavior is questioned at all! 
And Bingo was the bitches name O! 
This is a Very important topic for millions of men out there battling the shame they feel for being abused. I'll march beside him and Terry Crewes (sp?) and carry a sign saying, US TOO!!!! 
What her and quite a few other females on that Me Too stage 
have done TO others is absolutely reprehensible!!! More than one hypocrite there. She needs some falsifying evidence charges pronto!

703,UgyApgoQy1Dzn4Aeza14AaABAg,"My ex was emotionally abusive. She would constantly make me feel bad about myself, or like I did something wrong. Every time we had issues, I tried to fix them and talk, but she would gaslight me until I became very angry. I'd never been violent with her and would leave the room if I was angry, and I did throw things in a different room, but she started acting like I would hit her. In public, it was the complete opposite; she was clingy, would ''show off'' our relationship, tell people how wonderful I was and the nice things I did for her. In private, she would ignore me and blame every problem we had on me. I was constantly doubting myself, constantly apologizing even when she was wrong. After we broke up, I realized how toxic she'd been, but also that she had ruined my reputation. The friends we had in common refused to talk to me and wouldn't even listen to my side of the story. I was labeled as someone abusive, with problems, who made her do things she didn't want to do. Several years after we broke up, I was still learning about things she had been saying even while we were still together. This relationship was the final straw that really made me fall deep into a depression, and destroyed my self-confidence at that time. Everyone around us believed her because she has a ''naive'' personality. She seems sweet, innocent and sensitive, she's small, has a soft voice. No one ever gave me the benefit of the doubt, because I appear to be the opposite. And I'm a woman as well. I can't even imagine what men who suffer from abuse have to go through.",Mhye R,0,2020-02-19T03:17:23Z

705,Ugy8NUsoG_MwPSyAXPh4AaABAg,"I have never believed Johnny Depp was abusive to Amber Heard. And if he did anything it was in self-defence. He has no history of being abusive and his ex-partners publicly quoted their support bearing witness to this. But, Amber has a history of being abusive to at least 2 partners. What makes me sick is this woman manipulated and painted herself into an abuse victim survivor and one of the pillars of the MeToo movement. As a woman, I find Amber to be a disgrace on women's rights and for those who actually are victims of domestic abuse.

This woman has some serious issues and clearly needs therapy.

When you listen to the audio tapes, you can hear how unhinged, aggressive and unreasonable she is. And she totally gaslights him and twists his words, and he tries desperately to keep the conversation calm and reasonable.

It was so painful for me to listen through this whole audio recording as she constantly insults him, gaslights him blames him for why she loses her temper, yells and hits him. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aca0KWoHtqQ

The exchange starting at 48:00 when he said, ‚ÄúThere can be no physical violence,‚Äù and she says in response, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt promise you I won‚Äôt get physical again,‚Äù seems like a succinct summary of the conversation and a prime example of blaming the victim. And people wanted to cancel him? This is why due process is important.

And this sheds a light when it comes to the unequal treatment of both genders when it comes to domestic abuse. All a woman has to do is claim abuse with just her word, and she is believed in this ""believe women"" culture. But, when the narrative is the opposite and it is the woman who is the perpetrator of the domestic abuse against her male partner; the male has to provide proof of this in order to be believed. And even then, he will not see his deserved justice

In saying this, I am not negating at all the women who suffer domestic abuse from men...leading to fatal outcomes. But, there is also a large number of men who suffer domestic abuse from their female partners at almost 48% on average globally, but out of this average only less than 1/4 will report this domestic abuse because, of shame, embarrassment, feeling emasculated and also fear of not being believed or not taken seriously especially, by law enforcement (who are bias). When men accuse women of domestic abuse they are vilified and demonized while, women who accuse men of domestic abuse are automatically believed without question, and praised. 

I am totally against domestic abuse or any form of abuse towards anyone, period! However, I am also in total support of pushing an evolution of change in how society (and the justice system) treats men who are the victims of domestic abuse by their female partners. There needs to be gender equality in how cases of domestic abuse against men by women are treated without shaming the male victims, and with the same respect, serious consideration as the opposite narrative. And there needs to be a change where women who accuse men of abuse should not just be automatically believed without due process and corroborating proof. #justiceforjohnny

And the generally ignored part is important. When my mom did call the police, after being beaten, and with obvious physical abuse showing, the officer still asked my mom if she wanted to take away the ""breadwinner"" (note: he wasn't at that point). They definitely gaslighted her, convincing she needed him to get along. She often went to work (this was in the 1960s) with black eyes and bruises. No one ever commented or tried to help. 

It took her over 20 years to leave my dad, who abused her until the end. It wasn't until she hit back (she slapped him, and his glasses flew off his face, breaking when they hit the ground), that he realized he didn't have control. My mom was so passive, this was a shock.

People (both women and men) are demanding justice for Johnny Depp and if he wants to sue her for destroying his career and reputation, with all the evidence there is, he will win. The way you are generalizing about society, I don't think it's fair either since your argument is contributing to more conflict. But I understand that this must be a sensitive issue for you since you have been through something similar... I do agree that society has a lot of flaws and injustices for BOTH men and women... but to fix this we must stop taking sides and start treating each other as fellow humans.

779,UgyvJQTCohlVplOPfAZ4AaABAg,"These double standards we hold in todays 'modern, progressive, civilized, just & morally/ethically superior'  society in regards to how abuse is drastically distinguished between the sexes, from its merit to prosecution extent & severity is DISGUSTINGLY unequal, hypocritical, & beyond inexcusable! & what makes blindly assuming these sexual biases & assimilating condemning prejudices against the whole male populace even more despicable, is how its entire justification, or rather excuse, for doing so is due to a grossly established understanding of women being historically primarily the sole victims of violence & (predominantly sexual) abuse. & I know that me pointing out the blatant inaccuracies of this assumption is gonna make ppl infuriated w me, but I actually believe in genuine equality,  & the hard factsb& truth of the matter is that the Male sex has historically been much more assaulted & abused then the females on whole in western societies. (&I am distinguishing WESTERN SOCIETIES here! Cuz that's what we live in &what we re stereotypically addressing.  Now if we are to look at other global cultural & social establishments & regulations/customs we d have a different state of facts, but I'm operating in the western scope right now,  so I digress) 
But starting all the way back to the foundations of western society, the Greeks & Roman's,  we see an array of documentation with little boys being the predominant source of socially sanctioned sexual proclivity for the masses. (i.e. adults going to rape lil boys in whore houses being social acceptable. Even today u can see in Pompeii or numerous other preserved cities/ruins/artifacts the countless penises still carved into the streets serving as advertisements as well as signs pointing u in the direction to any number of these child whore houses where one could put their dick inside lil boys -none of whom where paid, mainly slaves or just taken advantage of/abused children.) & however these child whore houses weren't the only socially acceptable lil boy rape that was going on, because even the empires of Rome we re documented of being raped as children (Nero was raped as a child & raped many lil boys when became empire,  both of aristocrat birth & free-born, as in adherents to what was done to him. & this practice was rampant,  ridiculously common,  cuz you can get lil boys pregnant& a girl child is only worth anything to her family if she can be sold off/married & virginity is a requirement if u ever wanted to grey b anything for her) & unfortunately,  this simple fact that girls are considered a burden to a family unless she can be sold in marriage & lil boys cant get pregnant was enough top allow this DISGUSTINGLY overlooked common practice to continue on all through out the rest of western history,  until these our now 'modern, civilized, just,  morally sound & ethically superior' era.  & that's just the 1st starting example from the foundation's of western society demonstrating how historically the Male sex has been just as violently assaulted & abused as the female sex, if not more so, & do not deserve on Any level, manner or merit to be falsely  persecuted w unwarranted presumptions of automatic violent perpetrators of abuse, when circa now/2dayb& historically  they are just as likely to be the victims (&historically even arguably More so the victims compared to the girls)
Just had ta put this lil nugget of history out there, cuz ,.... yeah, ..... idk,.....  WE JUST ACTUALLY NEED GENUINE EQUALITY BY NOW GUYS! I MEAN FUCK,  COME ON! & these feminists being sexist, acting & doing what they claim to be against  (which I thought was inequality,... but who knows w the way they carry on) , ISNT HELPING US TO ACHIEVE & REALIZE REAL TRUE GENUINE EQUALITY OF ALL HUMANITY!

And when we heard IT talk on those tapes WE ALL GOT FLASH BACKS!

My beautiful brother Pat was murdered by the narcissistic violent bitch he was in a 10 year relationship with... we didn‚Äôt find out about the stabbing, him being put through a glass table, cut with a broken china saucer, her pinning him with a car against a wall in front of 30 people outside a pub, cos he dared stop to have a drink after work with his mates etc... 
we knew about her exhausting way of taking over every convo! He couldn‚Äôt even pop to my parents for a cuppa without her blowing up their house phone, his mobile, our mobiles, same if he popped to see a friend.. so he stopped visiting people
She killed him, because he was leaving her, she was 34 and he was 20 when they got together and she sucked the life outta him... she drove a car after him from behind as he walked away and drove over him 3 times.... (4th Aug 2007) the team at the hospital worked on him for an hour before they pronounced him dead...
There was a three week case at The Old Bailey in London 
And it was 2009 when it went to court... all the top specialist  forensic testified that she lied and she changed her statement THREE TIMES... and all the witnesses to her violence came and gave testimony. She had cocaine and alcohol in her system when she used that car as a weapon... 
but hey, 12 of her peers found her NOT GUILTY as how could this charming little 5ft woman do such a thing even though the evidence was 100% clear! 
She said he was the narc same way heard did, and NOT ONE PERSON GAVE WITNESS FOR THAT... so that stupid jury took her word! And ignored astounding evidence.
She did not even get a point where on her licence... but this was 2009 and Battered Men was not a thing... 

that‚Äôs why I got so upset with your older gf on that vid! I could see her manipulating tactics... gross...

Yes, it happens.  Worst part, the law usually believe the female over the male.  Good part though, when she is continually reported over her behavior, eventually the law will take your side.

When they arrested the crazy bitch I was married to, they had to put her on suicide watch every time, according to many.  Supposedly, she would run in her cell, and smash her head into the walls, smash her head on the toilet and bunk, and finally throw her meal tray at the guards.  But hey I was the mentally unstable one (sound familiar?)

855,UgxA6eVu7hwPzLoRSI14AaABAg,"This is an extremely poignant, logical and well-made video. I am throughly impressed by it and grateful that you touched on this topic! The hypocrisy and double standard about this case is appalling! The fact that Amber Heard is STILL a spokesperson for DV victims, the ACLU, a freaking UN ambassador for women's rights and is apart of the ""women of worth"" campaign for L'oreal...is utterly sickening! Especially now that she has been exposed as an abuser. I am glad more people are starting to see through her lies and schemes, but it's disheartening that she has not been fired from any of her advocate positions or that she even got them to begin with! After all, Johnny had alot of this same evidence way back in 2016. The judge in their divorce dismissed her fake abuse claims with prejudice. And it was Amber, not Johnny, who had been arrested in 2009 for DV violence against her girlfriend. Did any of these organizations do a background check on ScAmber before making her their spokesperson?! If they did, they suck for turning a blind eye! If Amber were a man, she would have been dropped the second these tapes were released. Because of these audiotapes many people have come to the #JusticeforJohnnyDepp side, which is great. Yet there are still many, especially in the mainstream media, who chose to remain silent and ignore the irrefutable evidence of his innocence. Why? Because Johnny Depp is an inconvenient victim and it goes against their bias narrative that only woman can be abused. Well that's wrong! Anyone can be an abuse victim,  whether they are male or female, old or young. Sadly, Johnny Depp is not only a victim of DV, but of cancel culture, an unfair gender bias, victim blaming and a vindictive media that refuses to do their job and report fairly. JD deserves a sincere apology for the way he has been unjustly treated and falsely vilified over these past few years, because he was and is the real survivor.

Narcissistic Personality Disorder.

I would have to say that Amber Heard fits the description in the narcissistic personality disorder spectrum,.
A covert-malignant narcissist.
This type,..
Is a really nasty one,.. and probably one of the worst kinds.
I'll give you an example,.
Go to..
YouTubes search engine.
Type in the names Jodi Arias and Travis Alexander.
After watching a couple vids.
Then type; Jodi Arias psychological profile.
Jodi and Amber are not exactly alike, but they share alot of the same characteristics of NPD.
Now think about all the cases that have gone unchecked without any investigations whatsoever.
Then think about the percentages of how many innocent men are currently serving out prison sentences on falsified domestic violence charges.
Then start investigating it for yourself.
The numbers are staggering.
No one's doing a thing to expose this.

But it's now an epidemic.

883,UgyUhC44ASAaOSvFMXN4AaABAg,"the fights are used to ''bring you back'' to the shape of existence the abuser wants you to be and REMAIN... they hate any moment of peace or absence of ''the mood'' where you DON'T have to think about them, what they said and nor do they want to lose control over you and how they CAN MAKE you feel (about them and yourself), scared of the reality sobriety moments when you could get out of their inflicted condition over you.... the fights are never meant to ''solve'' things but to maintain the condition and keep the control and ''remind'' of the shape of existence they want you to be.
anything for them in an ''argument'' is a selective reality - they will admit what they want and they need you to do what they want, any arguments raised are treated as such of a selective reality - ''I admit ONLY what I want, anything else hasn't happened IF I don't acknowledge it, ignore, deny or rephrase things with sounding I want to, so I spare acting guilt, don't have to fix or apologise for anything and still keep the upper hand of being ''right'' about everything and keep the reality as I want to''. 
Their power sets into the interaction they initiate and the participation they can push you to take - they know the selective reality they have made in order to control you and they are in bliss to see you rly try to argue or raise a point... as if you are still ''confused'' about what they do and don't see it, still doubt yourself and more trust in what they have made you to believe in....

Some trigger gets hit and she will come at you with fists or fingernails or the worst kind of verbal abuse you can imagine. As a guy it's a situation you cant win. You simply have to remove yourself from the situation and end the relationship as fast as you can. Unfortunately yes, it was a different situation but I know what it feels like to be accused of something that I was actually the victim of, and then thrown under the bus by someone lying to cover their own ass...it's soul destroying.

Him being a man doesn't make it any less different, abusers always say they've experienced the worst but does it justify giving that pain to others? Absolutely not! We must learn to be independent thinkers, I realise that we tend to be influenced by what others say, may it be blamed on our gregarious nature? Maybe, but we're still individuals, and we ought to think for ourselves and draw our own conclusions. Of course, the gender bias is quite real, and an accurate representation of that would be what you've covered in your video. In summary, people are behaving more and more like sheep in society and if we ever have a different opinion or perspective, we're shamed. Women shouldn't be allowed to go scot-free in such situations because they're such ""fragile"" and ""pure"" creatures. For flip's sake  look at history and the various mythologies of the world! Double-check your gender bias, and let's try to think for ourselves, it'd benefit ourselves and our surroundings, instead of caging our own minds up, and putting them on a leash for society and others to drag around.

Does this dismiss violence against women? No I don't think it does it just means we should always objectively and logically look at these situations and not think with our emotions. Because emotions are not an accurate way to assess a serious situation and can lead to things like this. Where Johnny has lost so much because everyone decided to charge him as guilty until proven innocent.

I just want to say I really appreciated the way you presented everything stylistically in this video. When you were standing up the way you had the camera plus the brightness of the room gave it a sci-fi futuristic feel but when you were sitting down on the dark screen the change helped bring things down and the change helped keep focus. Your energy and presenting style also helped digest things too.

The reason I bring up the style is because I have watched many videos about the Johnny/Amber situation even before these audio files got released. I noticed a lot of these videos were in the same style, presenting the same information usually without anything new to contribute to the topic. But the way you did your video for the reasons outlined above not only kept attention on the topic, but helped add a different angle to this topic.

When it comes to Johnny, even back when that video got leaked and the story first broke I thought there was more to the story than was being shown. It felt odd that this had been filmed and I got the vibe that there was an ulterior motive. Them being celebrities my mindset was that my gut feeling told me there was more to it, but what that something more was I couldn‚Äôt pin.

Sure. Maybe. But that always leaves a doubt. I never thought he hit her. Johnny has always come across as a gentle soul to me. There is something about him that made me believe that he was innocent. I hope Amber (appropriately named. Amber is fossilized tree sap that often has innocent creatures that could not escape it trapped within it. Killing them as they could not escape the sticky substance) loses what little she has and that Johnny sues her for all she has done to and cost him.

If they love you, they won't be tempted to leave. If you treat them right, you're giving them reason to stay. And if they don't love you, you need to leave because you're never going to receive the same amount of love that you give. And if you think you can't leave them because you don't want to be alone or because no one else will love you, than you need to learn to love yourself before being with anyone because you can't go through life believing that you don't deserve as much love as you give.

Nice video, liked how you mostly let the situation speak for itself instead of giving a concrete opinion. Clearly anyone listening to the same conversation though would side with Depp. From my perspective, they both fucked up, it seems Amber more than Him, and I agree her speech revealed that much. I think that the over hype of feminism has gotten to women's heads, for them, it's more than being equal and heard, it's about taking that domination they see men have and using it the way they see fit to make up for the generations in which they had no power. 

The way I see it, that's just as bad as a man taking advantage of a woman who may or may not be ""weaker"" than him. Whatever took place( and we now know that Amber was capable of violence) during their disputes she should be held accountable for her actions just as he would if he'd been the abuser.

1128,Ugxd5b2Q3cOWcE_t22l4AaABAg,"I haven't commented in a while, but here goes: When it first came out that ""Johnny was physically abusive to Amber Heard"", I thought it was all a load of bull. I told my kids, ""I'm sorry, but I don't believe it. There's something about this that doesn't feel right, and I don't trust the bitch!"" Then it came out that she used to abuse her ex-girlfriend. I point that out to my kids (who, at the time, wholeheartedly believed the woman in the relationship). I was told, ""...but It still doesn't give him the right to, blah-blah-blah!"" 

So, when it comes out that Johnny was the abused one, that she somehow cut off the tip of his finger, and did all this shit, I told them, ""I TOLD you she was the abuser! I TOLD y'all!"" They said, ""But you didn't say that! You just said that you didn't trust her! I said, ""I told y'all that their servants, police officers and all different witnesses always said that SHE was the aggressor in all the situations, and he didn't do anything! I even told y'all when that video came out of him yelling and throwing a wine bottle or whatever... I said, 'I wonder what she did to him because something had to have happened to get him to that point,' and you looked at me as if I grew another head or something!"" 

Now, my kids are all about #Justice4Johnny (as they SHOULD be!) when I've always been on that train. I have an uncanny ability to read people. Even when I don't want to. (Just like those two lying assholes going after Michael Jackson and effectively had him silenced on radio and even on MTV Classic. Trying to completely ruin his legacy for their own financial gain.) I don't know what this gift(?)/curse(?) is that I have. I just know that it developed over time, and it comes out even when I don't want it to. 

I never heard of Johnny doing this to anyone in any relationship he's ever been in. Being an abuser isn't just something you decide in your 50s is pretty dope, and you want to keep doing it. It is a pattern in all (or at least most) relationships that the person has been in. I hate that he's going through this, and I hate that it took THIS long for it to come out. What I also hate is that mainstream media refuses to cover this, as if coddling her somehow, when the rest of society (or at least, a good number of us, anyhoo) feels it is time for Johnny to be given justice! As much as I love Jason Momoa, I will never watch the Aquaman movies as long as she is in them, nor will I consume anything she ever takes part in.

1133,Ugw1NAvABp3wi_xsNJV4AaABAg,"You can never be certain what goes on behind closed doors, and the crying, sobbing person who claims they've been assaulted may also be a manipulator who will go so far as to punch themselves in the face or throw themselves downstairs to get their partner arrested (seen it, many times), or who acts so hysterically that their partner is forced to restrain them in self-defence... and again gets accused of assault. Can be male/female/other/straight/gay etc. Domestic abuse is seldom as clear cut as big nasty man hits poor defenceless woman, despite the stereotype, although obviously that does happen. I've met abusers who are also victims, who are in relationships with fellow abusers/victims - never a good combo. Violence at least leads to bruises that can be used as evidence in court (barring those that are applied with make-up - like the alleged mark on AH's face, where she claimed to have been struck by a thrown phone - I've seen bruises from that kind of assault, and I've never seen a real one look like hers). As Pierre says, coercive control (now a crime in the UK) is much harder to deal with or prove, and victims often don't even realise what's happening, until it's ground them down to nothing. That's why so far, we've had very few coercive control convictions. I'm glad JD had recordings of his conversations with AH.

Thanks for shining a light on this Pierre, as uncomfortable as it made me feel for a couple of minutes, it makes me so very glad to know that this is a real 'thing' and others are waking up to this narcissistic psychological abuse, and that I no longer involve myself in such relationships. I know what you mean when you say you hope others experience this, because if you haven't been through it you probably wouldn't recognize it.

Amber is disgusting and should pay for all she has done including pretending to stand up as some kind of representative figure against domestic violence. What a sick joke.

My fair weather baby boomer parents don't even know me or anything about me or what I have done in my life. Yet, at dinner in my own home in December I was accused of ""probably ignoring my younger siblings"" who I actually took care of, called arrogant for stating I am an expert on a topic I have dedicated my entire adult life to (23 years or so), told not to ""talk about things that occured in the past"", told to ""chill out"" about my financial situation (I am physically disabled and extremely ill with a genetic illness yet cooked them dinner), and it goes on.

I mean, there‚Äôs a petition going around to get her fired from Aquaman 2, but why in the hell is a petition even needed??? There was certainly no petition to get Johnny fired from Pirates and he‚Äôs WAY bigger than her! She, and women like her, make me sick.

We see it in movies, TV shows and in other forms of media where the women are always right even if they're wrong and the men are painted as sexist and toxic males and made to look absolutely stupid, basically saying that all men are like this which isn't true. Honestly, I think feminism is great, empowering women is a good thing, but when its used to intentionally destroy men, its no longer feminism. You just use the word as a shield to hide behind while you attack someone which in turn disgraces the word and the movement. I see bits of that In this situation. A woman who feels that she can abuse a man in whatever way she wants and placing all the blame on him for why the relationship is failing. Im sure there were arguments between the two much like this one. I don't believe they escalated into physical violence or abuse. At least, not by him anyway.

Yeah, we've becoming hugely inxperienced in eye-to-eye conversations in this mass digital era, which grievously effects live action relationships. Less you practice, the more disabled you'll be. When you move from one abusive relationship to another multiple times without learning anything about personality and communication and changing your own pattern, you victimise yourself to the point where when you have the upper hand for a change, you became an abuser yourself. It's like a chain reaction. So if you want to move forward to more healthy connections and change the pattern, give yourself time and avoid new relationships till you completely heal, deal and work on your problems with/ without professional help. PTSD after dysfunctional relationships is no joke and affects all your aspects of life. Seldom men complaint about abusive women and they're are not believed at all due to gender stereotypes.They are laughed at, as is some kind of a joke ting, as they're imaging stuff. It's sounds like bull*, so it's men's fault obviously. That's why men prefer to stay quiet and rarely stand up for themselves. Society make them to believe they're reaping what they've sow, that they somehow deserve it. But it's not. Official research prove that abusive women are not that rare as we thought and that men are prone to keep quiet about it, keeping all the blame on themselves. Unofficial research shows that it that it takes 1:52 min for the neighbors to react to any kind of strong, unpleasant sound, but no reaction at all to the sounds of abuse, because hey, that are all personal matters and doesn't concern us. Diffusion of responsibility is in the centre of many deaths by abusers nowadays aside gender. It's a human thing and a society' problem. I've been raised by an abusive parent, been in abusive and dysfunctional relationships, as a black sheep that stands, it's always my fault. Kinda used to it. But after all, I do my best to learn, to grow, to enhance my knowledge and skills in order to change and break the pattern for the better. I owe it to myself. Thanks for the video!

For what should she be sorry if she didn't do anything? I think he had enough and maybe he even realized that he was fooled by a young ""I'm money thirsty"" prick, and to decide that he marries her. In the audiotape you clearly can hear that she literally forced and fight for his decision to marry her. Also her fake bruises. Someone pinches you and you have the bruise for at least a minimum of 7 days, and her so called ""bruises from a punch, black eye"" got away in two, three days? There is NO make-up that can hide a real bruise (I am telling you this from my experience). You can try the most expensive products who promise to hide every scar, birthmark and BS, but  it still will be visible! 

But I must admit that I am also disappointed in Johnny Depp's choice of woman. He fell in love with her beauty and with the character from the scene, where they met each other. She was just an illusion. He is a grown man and how didn't he act smarter, especially in today's time where people just try to use someone else for their needs and wishes?",DaisyFlower,3,2020-02-15T18:02:39Z

I lost friends and there‚Äôs a subgroup of people at events that I go to who have taken her story as 100% truth when I was also a victim of gaslighting and toxicity and lies. It hurts but it‚Äôs helped me to weed out those who don‚Äôt stop to think truly about multiple parts of a situation. I don‚Äôt want to surround myself with people like that.

1212,UgyAZeCfAYVkl2JktK14AaABAg,"Thank you for covering this Pierre! You brought up the MOST IMPORTANT part about all abuse....the psychological abuse is what's most damaging. 
 Johnny Depp, like most survivors, was driven to suicidal ideation by this.  His ""white male privilege"" as Heard loves to say, did not protect him, it harmed him.
  Even though he KNEW he was being gaslighted, her smear campaign  "" He cut his own finger off in a fit of mood swings & drugs"" & by the 2nd audio (phone call) has publicly accused him of hitting her with fake photos, he was still so hurt by her EXTENSIVE betrayal. Even hurting his kids (in the audio).the only time he shows real anger. 
 Pierre asked if there were any hero's left, I said Johnny Depp.
 He was abused, subjected to years of smear campaigns, & he was able to CARE about the BIGGER PICTURE & OTHER VICTIMS. 
 HIS 1 PERSONAL STATEMENT after suing her for defamation. ""I'M NOT DOING THIS ONLY FOR MYSELF, BUT FOR ALL THE WOMEN & MEN AFFECTED BY DV..."" 
 You would have to be a victim to truly understand the amount of character & empathy under duress it takes to consider the damage done. 
 How do I know he wasn't lying? He shows in the audio he's already starting to consider the consequences of her actions, he's only on the phone for damage control. 
 1) Female victim's credibility is destroyed
 2)#metoo exposed as a joke that excludes male victims
 3) Heard is UN AMBASSADOR FOR FEMALE ABUSE (bought by Elon Musk)     who spoke before Aly Raisman who was there representing 500 gymnasts age 8 & up sexually abused by convicted Dr. Nassar!!!! I'm a former Elite Gymnast, triple trigger for me! 
 Surely anyone can see how insulting to victims  this is! 
 4) L'oreal WOMEN OF WORTH! 
 WRF? 
 Upside down World for victims & they are bought &paid for!
 Men are INFURIATED! ALL women are like Amber Heard! (Untrue but they are traumatized).
 It's men vs. Women. When it should be ALL victims are important, & men need more support because "" You're a baby"" (because you don't like being abused?!? ) is something all men have heard...vicious vile creatu≈ïes who emasculate men with verbal abuse that sticks long after the bruises heal. 
 Please sign Amber Heard's removal from Aquaman!

There cannot be an equal amount of guilt when there is an abuser and a victim. The probability of 2 abusers in a relationship is unlikely because abusers prefer people who are submissive. There is a lot of evidence and witnesses suggesting that Johnny was a victim. The victim doesn't hold blame because whatever they do is self defense. They are trying to survive. I see many people blaming both sides and saying they were both toxic. No. One person is toxic. One person wants to treat you bad and is instegating a fight and running your emotions and making you so predictable in a addictive cycle. The Abuser.",Seto Freakin Kaiba,252,2020-02-15T03:00:20Z
