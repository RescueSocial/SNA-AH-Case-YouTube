16,Ugy2h1Yi0A-fNHeC0n14AaABAg,"My thoughts?? Well, you asked.  I think Johnny  got really screwed, either the judge was paid off or didnt have enough balls to call an ace an ace. They saw the proof, heard the witnesses,  heard the phone recordings  and they let that skank lying witch ruin this man because  they cowards!  I will not watch anything heard is in and will boycott any company she works for. Team Johnny!!!",Sheila Gravely,4,2020-11-30T01:53:26Z
17,Ugw5Ybst2N64PTvjbjp4AaABAg,After all that hard work Johnny Depp put in to his work they never awarded him in the way he deserve to be awarded from ever since!  And now he is being JUDGED fot his hard work due to his personal problems outside of 'WORK' and that is WRONG!! Why try to belittle his professional talent treating him as if he just came to Hollywood for auditioning! His work is MAGNIFICENT but like all of US our personal life has its ups and downs! Render to Ceaser what is Ceaser's and DO right by this TALENTED  Actor/Performer. Shame on you all!!!,Sandra Sylvester,2,2020-11-30T00:09:28Z
18,UgxoSPL0YEpdJf-Mufd4AaABAg,"I am unimpressed with the decision to remove him from FB .... Yet Heard who had admitted to hitting him.  Has a history if violence, IS still in all of her films.

21,UgxkoqRLWLRsfLeJ27p4AaABAg,I predict that every movie that Johnny Depp was scheduled to play in will not turn a profit. I predict that Disney is going to go bankrupt and I also predict that first they will see a surge and then crickets. The big five communication companies within 10 years will be broken into pieces.,Calvin Barrett,7,2020-11-29T02:09:38Z

24,UgxobH9gDjHlKTquI8x4AaABAg,"I think this movie should be boycotted because they fired Johnny Depp. Johnny Depp has millions of fans and a lot of these movies were made so popular because Johnny was in them. I hope he gets a big settlement from the dirty ex-wife that took a dump in Johnny's bed. Somebody that would do that would do just about anything to hurt their ex. ""For better or worse.""

Justice was not served this time and it‚Äôs sad! I support women who opens up about actual abuse. But girls who just do it for attention and even worse - actually is the one abusing - that is just a whole other level of disgusting behavior and shouldn‚Äôt be justified just because of a gender. What a sad time to be human, and a sad time to be a man. And this is coming from a woman, who actually was in a abusive relationship when I was 15 to 21.

37,Ugyt4xXxeuPxUnHzykp4AaABAg,"The whole trial was a con from the start. He refused to use testimony from several witnesses who were there when she claimed incidents happened who not only denied them but testified it was Amber who did it to him   He also chose to ignore statements from police officers and medical personnel as well as the tapes where Amber admitted with glee to attacking him and instead believed people who had never seen anything happen and only repeated what Amber told them. I have seen many people who deal in law say they have no idea why he did what he did as it makes no sense but seemingly he had links to Amber and the Sun beforehand which they say should have had him recusing himself as a conflict of interest. What's worse, he is now saying Johnny shouldn't appeal...",Nut Shell,5,2020-11-27T23:00:33Z
