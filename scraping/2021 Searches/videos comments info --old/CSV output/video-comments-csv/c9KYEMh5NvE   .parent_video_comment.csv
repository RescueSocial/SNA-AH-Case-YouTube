23,UgxfZl2UYH6-VQdOU8B4AaABAg,"Johnny Depp is doomed without a question. His desire to revenge is slowly consuming him. In my opinion, Amber Heard is not a smart woman, but Johnny Depp is basically brain dead to fight a battle that he can't win from the very beginning. He never thinks things through. He used to still have his Fantastic Beasts role, so he can still take the chance to recover. And he lost it. Don't say he has noting to lose. He has kids and a life that needs to live. That's more important than whatever humiliation that he got from Amber Heard. Even he successfully sued Heard out of Aquaman. The money, the time, and maybe his mental, has already been a permanent damage. Amber Heard will never lose as much as Johnny Depp. That's why people can't be emotional driven. To survive in a place like Hollywood, you have to follow the rule. The rule that is not written in the paper but the rule you can only feel by yourself.  Especially for celebrities, the less they share their personal life with public, the better they can keep their reputation",HMW,6,2021-01-15T16:24:33Z

- Her using the story of a rape/assult victim and saying it happened to her
- The bed pooping situation that was very obviously her 
- Her already having been physically abusive against her ex-girlfriend 
- The finger situation
- Johnny Depp's ex wives siding with him and saying that he was never physically abusive towards him 
- The fact she didn't try to help him with his drug abuse, she's his wife afterall
- The tape that came out where she was berating him and talking down to him, also admitting that she hit him",morg,1,2021-01-15T12:54:29Z

She started this fight as soon as she accused him of abuse and started milking the public sympathy for her own publicity and collecting awards and speaking engagements from organisations against domestic violence. Since in America, silence is the same as guilt in the public sphere, one way or another it was goin to come to a head once Johnny Depp tried to defend himself. She enlisted the public and industry to fight her battle and he enlisted the courts. Johnny ain‚Äôt a saint. He has problems but it‚Äôs entirely possible for him to overcome them. But Amber using the industry and public opinion to beat up on him is a furtherance of the abuse he‚Äôs already received from her and u always having to add the caveat that they are both at fault every time u speak on this issue is just part of the social problem in dealing with this issue. The guy in these situations always gets a portion of the blame whether he did what he‚Äôs accused of or not. When a woman is caught out for something like this in that environment, ppl never just say ‚Äòshe‚Äôs shit, let‚Äôs move on‚Äô.
