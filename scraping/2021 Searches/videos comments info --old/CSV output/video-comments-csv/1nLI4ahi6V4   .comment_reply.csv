219,UgwlDsSRW7LYOhCVbgh4AaABAg,L G,Not much will happen to her unfortunately...even if it's a sentencing it will be very light...that's why these narcissist people keep doing it ...many choose to do it but it's a behavioral habit incredibly hard to break worse than addiction ...if they are repeat offenders finally caught they should be committed to undergo a very lengthy therapy and rehabilitation.  It will discourage others to get caught if anything.,2021-02-16T00:30:55Z,4
