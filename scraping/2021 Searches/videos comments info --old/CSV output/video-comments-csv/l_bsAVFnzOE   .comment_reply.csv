0,Ugx8mQ5kAn3xxcf_TEJ4AaABAg,Thea Nt,"@Margarita  If you read some interviews it is obvious that his relationship with drugs is a very complex one. Specifically the Lawrence Krauss interview where he speaks almost appreciatively of drugs. And based on the tapes he sounds like someone who doesn‚Äôt even believe he has a drug problem when he clearly does. I‚Äôve followed Johnny for more than 8 years so believe me I know that he‚Äôs been using since he was a teenager. He‚Äôs probably tried to cut down on it (and I believe he was sober while he was with Vanessa Paradis) but detox/intervention isn‚Äôt rehab.
Depressed people can be toxic. Believe it or not there‚Äôs a thing called emotional manipulation and that‚Äôs exactly what he does in the ‚Äúcut me‚Äù tape. I don‚Äôt even want to defend AH because she‚Äôs just as messed up but Johnny certainly isn‚Äôt blameless. Just two very fucked up people who unfortunately found each other. I hope Johnny gets the help he really needs.",2020-12-19T15:33:04Z,0

On that ""cut me"" audio he sounds so depressed and devastated. Wanting to hurt himself doesn‚Äôt make him a wife beater or toxic person.  Being toxic is being poisonous to people around you, as I undestand it. Did he ask her to cut HERself? No. Did he cut her? No. The fact that he was (is?) so depressed and tired and in pain is indeed scary. That is what she had done to him, like all abusers do to their victims.",2020-12-16T18:04:20Z,0

14,UgxrHSHk6HDVDGItfVt4AaABAg,skyclasp,"@britta Male suicide rate, male homelessness, men being disparaged by media, TV and general pop culture, the law itself being female biased with women being treated far more leniently when it comes to criminal offences. And in this topic itself, male victims are taken far less seriously than women in the same situations. This case is a prime example of that. The list goes on. In a way you've proved my point because even in a case where the man is clearly not at fault and the woman is the abuser, you want to somehow twist that and make a defensive argument. I'm not saying that all women are like this. I'm saying that the media will tend to side with the female and if you've seen the BBC covering this story you will see how. It's disgusting. 
Imagine someone saying oh sure Harvey Weinstein or whoever was a rapist and sexual abuser but you know there are many issues than men face that you don't know about...No, we call something that is immoral and wrong for what it is.

The audio tape is revealing Heard‚Äôs rage fueled mistake of cutting his finger tip off is beyond even mere claims, Heard can even be heard (pun unintended) trying to lesson her role in this occurrence sometimes in the tape, even trying to shift blame. 

For Shallon to say she‚Äôll never cover the subject of men being lied on by women on on this channel ever at all is morally deficient.

However, to speak in such absolutes that is and could not be common at any rate, and especially that you‚Äôd would never speak on the subject on your channel is misguided and seemingly intellectually dishonest in approach in my opinion, very dismissive. And actively skewing key details on a case that has damning evidence against one particular party only to level things out as if they are inherently equal, is a bit amiss realistically speaking.

I will say Shallon makes so many good points later on as the video rolls out (I still have yet to finish, but I‚Äôm all most to the finish line) I am however a bit sorry to have sounded so harsh to her being very critical of the beginning of the vid, but that‚Äôs why I clarified I only saw a little of it, and would watch it more thoroughly later. I don‚Äôt agree with some of her premise in the beginning because she negated key details in the beginning in ways that aren‚Äôt rationally feasible, but I think she makes lovely points later on in this vid on the subject of narcissism in relation to the Depp vs Heard situation and on Narcissism in general.",2020-07-21T15:16:45Z,0

He's a very screwed up childhood & mother rather awful: & yet he stuck by her.....he sees his own sh*t, & others, - he's got an enormous amount of compassion - hes empathic (why such a great actor)....but these types can take WAY too much from others (& their environment) to their own detriment.
In fact, I think it is his own inner turmoil that allowed him to accept so much from Heard: he got it, understood it, wanted to help etc

If he was so violent as she claims, why does that clip even exist? Why did he not destroy the phone and assault her on the spot? Why did he just walk off after seeing she was filming him? He walked off because he‚Äôs not an abuser. Try listening to the audio tapes where Amber admits to starting physical fights and berates him for running off and hiding in rooms to escape her.

You can be both ""good"" and guilty. I like his work for example, but. The matter is whether he threatened and abused her or not. And honestly , seeing that video of him being threatening and yelling, and her crying. That's already abuse.",2020-07-21T13:03:23Z,1

263,Ugy56KkU5IA1bzpqwdh4AaABAg,E C,@MissLadyMo My point is it shouldn't take one lying woman for you to not believe in the next 10. If it does then you are the problem. Not the lying woman.,2020-07-20T04:23:17Z,3

272,Ugy8ZQZeDYXy9ViohAp4AaABAg,Cindy Blount,"Meh the phrase is over-used. Look to the diagnostic manual - BPD: narcissism: Doubt Shallon, or most accused, have these traits....Shallon is very caring & empathetic - a narcissist will NEVER be like that.
Our society looks down on women who believe they deserve the best & make their own effort to create that reality.
It's deeply misogynistic.
Shallon is NOT a narcissist.....
(eta: if a narcissist ACTS caring, empathy, etc: it's just that: an act...so convincing & sometimes can create co-dependency(whic is the narcs goal) that when the mask is off their 'victim' will deny it.....anyway: Shallon is genuine in caring, it's not fake on any level: & she gives on very many levels: including this channel)",2020-07-19T21:41:10Z,5
