If you can't walk away then do whatever you have to do to create separation, and then walk or  RUN at that point, away.  Everything this woman is saying and doing I've been  through, and I've had to wrestle them until they calm down. I'm a little bigger guy and if I leave a mark it don't matter if I've dodged 5 arrows, the fireplace irons (took one of those to the chin just the other day) a master lock to the dome (same woman, a few months ago) if I scratch her creating separation cause she keeps swinging on me while I try to leave, I'll be in the wrong. Sure enough when I confronted her about her violence, she told me I was too rough with her and that she was laughing when I took her to the ground which clearly meant we should have transitioned into a sexual event. I'm actually almost with her on this point but that little problem called stitches i need in my skull. I showed her the pics I took of my head and she said, I DID NOT DO THAT!!!",2021-09-11T01:48:35Z,0

Both parties handled things in less than ideal ways. Her getting physical doesn't make him an angel by default. It makes the situation more serious, but they both have shit to work on.

Johnnys exes, one of whom was in a relationship with him for 14 years, came forward saying that never had johnny even come close to the stuff amber is claiming he did, whilst she has actually been ARRESTED for domestic abuse against her former wife in 2009, and once again at an undisclosed date. It is completely irrelevant that johnny didn't engage amber in her ""fights"", and i think it says incredibly much about johnnys character that he always chose the peaceful route rather than engage with someone who would attempt to hit and throw stuff at him. And quoting you we dont believe the abuser is ""the one being passioante about their cause"" .the abuser is the one physically and emotionally assaulting their partner. It is again completely irrelevant ""how much damage"" amber could cause, she has shown herself to have almost no limits - once throwing a bottle at him resulting at his fingertip breaking completely off, bones and all and him later getting MRSA three times due to this, close to death all those times.

She confessed to stabbing her previous boyfriend in the hand because, in her own words, ""he knew how to wind her up and she just lost it"".

They prefer to dodge it and hope it works itself out. It doesn't. Just frustrates and confuses the other party, makes them feel insignificant to you and eventually themselves, and makes them want to do bigger and more extreme things to get your attention again, to the point of violence if need be.

It's feminists who have been the bullies lady.  Let me give you some history.  The first women to build shelters for domestic violence in the UK was a women name Erin Pizzey.  She was a victim dv, and created it to help young women, but she noticed some of the women were just as violent as the male abusers.  Therefore, she tried to build a space for male victims and was booted out of HER OWN SHELTER THAT SHE BUILT BY FEMINISTS!!!!  Erin Pizzey is now a Men's Rights Activist.  In fact, many MRA's have been feminists, but it's been feminists actions against men & boys that have helped turned them into MRA's.
There are men's shelter in North America and ALL have been built by their local men's rights organization.  There's one in Toronto that's being proposed by the local MRA's in the works.https://equalitycanada.com/torontos-first-family-shelter-male-victims-domestic-violence-children/  It's hard to build them without government support because feminists have spent their time defaming mra's.  Here's a CBC interview of feminists on MRA's:https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/mra-political-parties-1.4016680?cmp=rss  It doesn't help when feminists have been brainwashing society saying the men are always ""the oppressors"" and women are always ""the oppressed.""  
Also in Toronto, when mra's had a conference about men's and boy's health by Warren Farrell (a former leader of NOW, hey another one of those former feminists), and here's the reaction from feminists: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iARHCxAMAO0.  In fact, anywhere MRA's want to even dare TALK about men's issues, they're harassed by feminists often times violently.  In fact, there's a movie on MRA's called, ""The Redpill,"" which was made by Cassie Jaye, hey another former feminist.   
Which leads to the Amber Heard case.  Did you know that she was a speaker recently at the Women's March this year?  She was also a UN representative for Domestic Violence as well, despite not only her situation with Johnny Depp but her past accusation of abuse of another women?  Where are the feminist organizations condemning this?  Where's the retraction from the Women's March?
""STEAL THE HARD EARNED SPOT-LIGHT THAT WOMEN ARE USING....""  What a f**king joke you are, lady.  Feminists don't want to share, and have gone out of their way to prevent ANY help that they can't control or manipulate for men.  Maybe try and do a self analysis on your movement, and maybe you'll find out why feminism is having problem with not only men but women as well.

If he was an average joe he wouldn't have been able to afford to defend himself properly and his life is now ruined due to a sentence released from someones mouth. Same goes for women too.

In my personal experience though I've seen many more women hit men than the other way around, and they do it in public without in repercussions. What does that tell you? The only time I've ever heard of a guy I know hitting a girl I knew turned out to be him pushing her into a bed frame because she scratched the shit out of his face during an argument.

421,Ugx6WMa20dqz2QXo71x4AaABAg,Families Supporting Trauma Recovery,"After 36 years in Alanon and working in a battered woman‚Äôs shelter for years, I can tell you that it is a common conversation and can be easily misinterpreted by onlookers. The false premise is that there is one abuser and one innocent victim. A majority of battered women suffer from personality disorders and delusions, as do family members around addicts. It is common for abuse victims to speak and act out of character, to admit to things they haven‚Äôt done, to participate in the abusers deluded reality as if his perceptions are accurate, and to abuse reactively. Clues that depp is disturbed and manipulative are that he ignores her concerns and spars with word salad. He also seems to have no conscience about average guys obvious distortions and fallacies, and it is crystal clear that he has black out drunks during which he is aggressive.  It is very common for alcoholics to talk about a monster that comes out when he is drinking. The kitchen episode is abuse. We see him throwing and breaking things and it is intimidating. He also admits to hitting her with a door yet focuses on her reaction. He also admits to throwing her phone at her while facing away. It is very common for abusers to ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù hurt someone and deny it. And for alcoholics to do outrageous things and tell others and the victim that the victim did what they did. And believe their own lies. He treats her like a red headed stepchild by missing her birthday and then uses her reaction to tell others that she treated him like a red headed stepchild. He is lying that the texts are doctoredhe is telling her to say things nicely and she is saying he says terribly things to her and she doesn‚Äôt do that.  and he Gave his assistant 800k. Seems like a payoff. She had every reason to feel threatened and frightened and no choice but to bring things out into the open. He was smearing her reputation. His outrageous accusations are now out in the open where everyone can see. The lowest common denominator on the internet falls for his lies and games. He had no business getting involved with this young woman with what he himself admits is his ‚Äúillness‚Äù. It is common for addicts to be psychotic and storm off all the time and distort why. Why she thinks it is ok to hit or throw things is incomprehensible. And she is wrong that people won‚Äôt believe him. He is telling her that people won‚Äôt believe her also. Abusers can lie adamantly and very convincingly. In spite of her comments it is clear to me that he is the major offender. It is par for the course for a victim to be questioning her sanity and to be losing it after five years of this craziness. He avoids discussing specific behavioral detail like the plague. Why does she her angry?  What specifically does he do?  Why was he over at isaacs?",2020-05-12T22:37:19Z,1
422,Ugx6WMa20dqz2QXo71x4AaABAg,4c-able8,"@Families Supporting Trauma Recovery The reality of the ABUSER is clear and sound, to all of us, on these tapes!!!..SO YOU are clearly in denial!! Expedient Wolf Crier!!",2020-05-12T22:08:49Z,5
423,Ugx6WMa20dqz2QXo71x4AaABAg,Families Supporting Trauma Recovery,Yes I understand. Assuming a false premise that a man who abuses one woman and not others means that it is the woman‚Äôs fault is erroneous and fallacious reasoning. People can be biased for hundreds of different reasons and treat different people very differently. A narcissistic family can be so deluded that they claim everything is fine and great when it is not true. Abuse victims can be unaware they are being abused and the level of profound denial and tunnel vision can be incredible. Some people accept reality in a way or are very sensitive and are able to deal with sick people in a way that seems functional on the surface or is as functional as you can be under the difficult circumstances. but when you see one person being defamed and scapegoated and blocked from reasonable grievance procedures and cast into a rigid fantasy role then the entire group comes into question. The reality is that Johnny depp has had many violent episodes in his life and been arrested many times. Kate Moss was misled by him as he admits and was severely depressed after dealing with him. There was also a severely destroyed hotel room. Winona Ryder was ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù shot by him and has not denied these reports. A bodyguard was shot at his house and this is also way outside the norm. Depps lawyers and the commenters here and the lawyer average guy you tube channel play distortions and fallacies like evil people of the lie. The truth is that amber heard was abused. It is called narcissistic abuse. She was consistently defamed overtly and covertly and he played staging and framing games and bait and switch and stir up the mob. He evades and diverts and deflects from objective standards of conflict resolution with common maladaptive defense mechanisms. His severe addiction is a major factor in this situation. She was labeled multifarious publically from the beginning.  He expressed torture and murder ideation. He does not level and he exhibits common language and behavioral patterns of an addict with psychosis and personality disorder. Obviously his marriage failed and two young children affected. The ex speaks in silly cliches. At one point she says her children are grown up now. They were nine and fourteen. He says children make their own decisions. Actually good parents are very involved in making decisions for children.  His vague generalities falsely empower children and it is actually beliefs associated with satan. Yes sometimes children make their won decisions about certain things. They may make mistakes or make good decisions for themselves. In functional families the parents make many of the decisions. Obeying your parents and receiving guidance and direction from them is an important aspect of child development. Even after they are 18 good parents do give positive and negative feedback and have a right to be heard about things that concern them. Adult children may have rights to independence or to avoid or neglect or cut off contact with their parents and it may be confused or abusive adult children who think or feel we have no duties or responsibilities to family members. For example amber heards parents try to call depp down and ask him not to tell her they spoke. This was a mistake. I hope they are forgiven and that they are reasonable and righteous people and don‚Äôt take sides with this abusive and manipulative addict. Good parents in a functional relationship with an adult child would have been speaking up loud and clear a long time ago about the folly of getting involved with this man. He is a much older man and had teenage children and a serious addiction. There was very little hope she was ever going to be able to have a decent relationship with this man. The writing was literally on the wall and the fact her parents didn‚Äôt see it means they have some serious issues themselves.,2020-05-04T19:29:20Z,1

430,UgyNpIkYkU0ZKod1TaB4AaABAg,Claire Willow,Matt G I would argue that a narc can only have some traits of BPD because a lot of them are the opposite of narcissism (like caring too much about someone) Narcs want to ‚Äúwin‚Äù. They enjoy the pursuit. They have things in common with BPD but the lack of empathy is more a narcissistic personality. A person with BPD would often blame themselves where as a narc will always blame the victim. But def she could have traits of both. I think she meets criteria for NPD though,2020-02-09T22:46:47Z,0

I'm just calling her out on the (very probable) hypocrisy she might be displaying here (her avatar pic is black, as is yours, hence why I brought up the female vote and the female black vote). I obviously can't know that from a single comment from a person, but if I was just to guess this I'd be right most of the time. Her statement of ""...the heck?"" and yours ""Most women...it's common sense"" implies that this is generally understood by all (and maybe it is) as common knowledge, but it does not translate into meaningful action where and when it matters (voting, law, divorce,...).
Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe I found the unicorn. Maybe she is what she writes. All too often I see her virtue signaling statement of ""If I put my hands on a man, of course they have the right to retaliate...girl, if you don‚Äôt want to get knocked out, keep your hands to yourself."" when they find themselves in a domestic dispute with a man and she calls the police, quickly translate into ""men should never hit a woman"" statement.
Again, maybe I'm wrong and I wrongly challenged her on a potential hypocrisy. If I did and she finds that insulting, I am more than willing to apologize here. It's just that the odds are in my favor.


(Just briefly on the voting (slightly off topic,no need to respond). I agree mostly with what you said. Sure we should all be responsible for ourselves, but you can definitely also pick out clear group voting patterns. On the black vote...why should any politician give one damn about you and your well-being , when your vote is  practically guaranteed  every 4 years (something like 87% black men, 96% black women for dems)? )",2020-03-31T12:59:02Z,0

 There was another study that I remember reading as well that came to the same conclusions but I can‚Äôt seem to remember the name of it. I‚Äôll link it if I can find it later.
 And yes I agree that correlation doesn‚Äôt equal causation especially in this case. Regardless it still raises an eyebrow particularly in the wake of men being ridiculously vilified in this area for the past 5+ years.
  To clarify, I don‚Äôt think that higher rates of lesbian DV means that women are automatically more likely to be the instigator in every case of household violence but I do think that this is at the least revealing in the potential for violence in both genders, rather than this men are evil hysteria that‚Äôs been carrying on for the better part of the past five years.

523,UgyNGQPWsLJXbIAAoFp4AaABAg,Lydia Vasia,"@w0bbl3r The scene with the krabs was just five minutes, would you have been seriously pleased with a five minutes scene if the Kraken was dying like it was nothing?
Like I said, because of its lore the kraken needs its own movie, a twenty minutes scene (with your case of complain with Jack scene only five minutes) would have been the worst shit ever. It would have seem like the Kraken all this time didnt mean shit.  Imagine the almighty Kraken, a beast of legends was taken out like it was nothing in a five or twenty minutes scenes. Sure like you said Kraken plot wise was pain in the ass, but also its lore for Potc was really complicated thing that still would had end up dead. The Kraken only listens to its master Davy Jones, Beckett couldnt use it since Davy Jones is its master. It was better killing it off screen for lore wise too, not only because of plot wise and because of movie. Than having a five or twenty minutes scene with a plot hole on the lore of the world. Sometimes fan service if not most of the times are bad, really bad.
I didnt said the second was the weakest link, you said the third was and I said that you are wrong. I said they are on par.
And no, it doesnt matter if I like it or not or if you like it or not, what matters is criticism and being honest, for example I like Twilight and I dislike dark knight but this doesnt mean that Twilight is a better movie than dark knight, I am honest with what I like and what I dislike. I like bad things and good things, nothing wrong with that, everyone likes bad stuff too. What I am trying to say is yes, opinions are different but this doesnt mean opinions neglect fair criticism, and of course fair counter criticism.",2020-02-16T12:18:39Z,0
524,UgyNGQPWsLJXbIAAoFp4AaABAg,w0bbl3r,"@Lydia Vasia A twenty minute scene would have been better than what we got.
What happened was, they realised the Kraken was a big problem for the next movie that they hadn't thought a way out of. Like killing a character off between sequels (or bringing them back, like Palpatine in the new star wars), because you have written yourself into a corner, or the actor won't come back for the role again or something.
So, kill it off-screen, just have done with it.
Then waste all that boring time with Jack on that stupid island with the crabs. I literally fell asleep in the cinema while that was going on.
But of course, all this is subjective. I wasn't so keen. I wouldn't say it was terrible. It just kind of ok.
You say the second was the weak link. I say the second, for the most part, was the best one.
We have different likes and dislikes is all. So you like one, I like the other. It's all good. I'm just offering my opinion, same as you.",2020-02-16T11:33:15Z,0
525,UgyNGQPWsLJXbIAAoFp4AaABAg,Lydia Vasia,"@w0bbl3r I disagree, the third is not the weaker link. Kraken wasnt wasted at all, if they had done a scene with the kraken dying, it would need at least half of hour (actually it needs its own movie to be honest). Why? Cause Kraken its a beast underwater, a ship cant dealt any damage on it the way a ship would do. So how they would deal with it? They would harpoon it like a whale, but still it would have been a way worse cause Kraken has ""arms"" and lots of them.
My point is, a 20 minutes scene wouldnt have been enough, and right now you would had a different reaction of complain like ""Kraken had only 20 minutes screen time"". Believe me sometimes less its better than enough simply for the fact of what I said. I get what you mean, but if you look at it with logic, you can agree with why they went with what they did.",2020-02-16T11:05:11Z,0

Now to be fair, I did enjoy the third one. My original comment was more talking about the movies after the third one.
I thought the first three movies went together in a nice full story arc. If they left it as a trilogy it could have stood like that pretty well. The third would have been the weaker link, but all trilogies have their weakest and strongest movies, don't they?",2020-02-16T10:18:42Z,0

580,Ugy7j5OhSn879yZd2ZN4AaABAg,MG,"@carlykpdx Actually, there hasn't been a single drop of evidence that Johnny ever hurt/abused her. The ""worst"" evidence against him is the audiotape in which he admits to ""pushing"" her, a claim Amber does not deny or attempt to refute. They also both agreed he only pushed her because SHE was the one on the offence.
There HAS been A LOT of evidence against Amber. There's audiofootage of her admitting to hitting (punching him), throwing pots and pans at his face, throwing bottles at his face, severing the top of his finger, etc. These aren't up for debate anymore, they are proven claims. The worst Johnny got accused of was punching her in the face and breaking her nose/giving her bruises, but the thing is that multiple witnesses have said these things never happened, and the dates SHE claimed when these events took place, do not add up with other pictures, evidence, etc (the ""bruises"" were literally gone after a day, something which her own stylist confirmed, Johnny was also already out of town and has an alibi when the ""worst"" of the abuse he was accused of happened).

There is literally no evidence whatsoever that Johnny ever abused her. SHE is the one with a history of DV, NOT him. That all being said, do I believe he never touched her? No, he probably lost it at some moments, but that's the thing about DV. More often than not, it's reciprocal, but the thing is, Amber is clearly the one who initiates theses fights (she admitted this herself). At worst, you could still EASILY make the argument that Johnny was just defending himself. Amber doesn't get to have that excuse. If you say Johnny is ""guilty"" of ""extremely violent behavior"", you're honestly an idiot.",2020-02-09T15:25:36Z,1

It's like convincing yourself there is no sun, then sunbathing for four hours: You're gonna get burnt. In my experience, the women who do this to men are women who have a very low opinion of themselves. The right move would be to improve yourself, but some only seek to equalize, which ultimately hurts everybody. Sometimes, it's not even a conscious act, but a behavioral defense mechanism that people have trained in themselves due to past trauma. The power of women lie in their wiles, and their physical attractiveness. They have different advantages than men, but they can use them just as wickedly. Such is human nature. I just think we work so hard to convince ourselves that people are innately good, when that's not the case. It takes work. Those women, as well as the real cases, came out of the woodwork with the MeToo movement. We have to realize that everybody lies, and in the case of women, they're better at that type of subterfuge and are societally afforded that advantage. That is why it matters. These aren't women just beating up men, these are women forming elaborate lies in order to ruin lives. It's a different type of fighting, but it is violent nevertheless and shouldn't ever happen. That's why the sex is relevant. This is unique to our generation. It used to be the job of men to protect women,  and now there are women who want to be men.

Have you seen the video Aba & Preach did where women were videotaped _admitting_ they hit men all the time?  It's far more common than most people realize.  Yet our society tells men that we just have to accept it because we're physically more powerful than women (except when it comes to trans women in sports apparently).

For me, it's not even about whether or not it hurts--or if she can do any actual physical damage.  For me, it's about putting your hands on someone else...period!  I have met women who will say a man has no right putting his hands on her (correct), only to believe she's entitled to hit a man ""because she's a woman""(wrong).

Our country is dividing because there are forces at play that want to destroy the US.  It's just sickening that there are people who accept these kind of narratives without doing any actual critical thinking on their part.",2020-02-04T15:30:39Z,6

737,UgwWm9aUvtCa3pcaAdF4AaABAg,Haven,"@tashboog My dude, this is clearly going nowhere. The first point I'm going to make is that you seem to think that walking away means never talking about it. Which is flat out wrong. When people fight and things are heated-screaming or not, nobody is fully in control of themselves nor should they be expected to be. So you walk away and revisit it when you've calmed down. Doing that can be one of the hardest and healthiest things to ever do. The second point is that therapists are here to dismantle and test unhealthy habits and logical fallacies we've learned through bad experiences. They're there to help people be the best, most efficient people they can be, they arent there to just hold your hand and nod while you talk. I know this for a fact because I spent a good 20 years dealing with stuff on my own and I fully understood who I am and why things happened, but I was still suffering from mental illnesses and no amount of introspection can stop me from spiralling into dark places when I find myself in bad spots. Therapists teach people how to cope, how to process situations differently than we've learned to, and give us unbiased perspectives from an outside source. You can't put out a burning building from the inside. 

I fully understand that I dont know everything but I think you definitely still have some hard lessons to come your way. Hopefully you realize that those kinds of choices are neither selfish nor cowardly. But yeah, here's me walking away from an argument that has clearly plateaued.",2020-02-05T19:00:21Z,0
738,UgwWm9aUvtCa3pcaAdF4AaABAg,tashboog,"Haven OK so you‚Äôre not reading and interpreting my responses correctly. I‚Äôm speaking in the hypothetical sense for a reason as I‚Äôve stated a few times over now that I‚Äôm not sure how the sequence of events played out with them nor was it entirely clear in the recording. There is nothing I need to learn or unlearn as what I KNOW isn‚Äôt bull shit at all babe, nor ask a therapist as no other imperfect human being w a fucking PhD the credential professional on myself or anyone else. Therapists simply listen and walk you through your thought processes which we are individually capable of. We can all provide our own therapy by listening to our thoughts and having introspection, some people just accept being weak minded enough to pay someone else but that‚Äôs another conversation. Also your viewpoint is quite subjective; the people around YOU wanted to scream. Your experience does not account for what angry people in general want to do. There is such a thing as being angry and calm at the same time; it‚Äôs called self-control as we established she doesn‚Äôt have. Therefore you‚Äôre also re-stating my point that self-preservation (which is called such because it takes place during unstable emotions) is the prerequisite to effectively talking something out, smh. 

Your last paragraph is selfish as fuck because when you do cause somebody else harm (which can inspire a range of emotions including anger) you are responsible for taking ownership of your actual contribution, otherwise you leave the other person with the burden of non-closure which isn‚Äôt entirely their fault, Foh. As humans we all have to live in this world and therefore nust recognize that we each have impact; caring is about  having regard for the impact you cause other human beings, the earth, and the complete physical & spiritual stratosphere you exist in. And while caring is a choice, that choice is a clear reflection of one‚Äôs character which in this example makes eluding cowardly. Furthermore, that (assuming responsibility for oneself only) is not what any relationship looks like. No you‚Äôre not in control of other‚Äôs behavior but there‚Äôs this thing called influence which is holds quite a bit of weight when you‚Äôre cohabiting with anyone and especially where one is invested in another in a partnership, you know where you work together and shit üôÑ So no, you‚Äôre not just responsible for yourself, especially in a marriage, the fuck are you talking about? You are supposed to support the other person practically, mentally, spiritually and beyond - that‚Äôs how that works. And if you are being unhealthy for that person, you either work through or agree to separate but not dealing with it IS cowardly as fuck. For example: if I spank my child out of my own frustrations the burden is on me to then sit that child down and explain to them that it wasn‚Äôt personal and that I am wrong, even though I could never undo the event. Better decisions have to then be made moving forward. But if I know I did something that will stay with the child and just choose not to address it at all, that‚Äôs neglect and worsens the pain. I don‚Äôt need you to point out the differences between children and adults either as we are all living a human experience and know pain & anger. Again, his wife or ex-wife is toxic and they should separate bc she‚Äôs clearly out of pocket. You‚Äôre missing the mere point that avoidance less any aggressions (meaning not walking away during an escalated situation) IS cowardly and frustrating to the person deserving to be heard.",2020-02-05T18:31:48Z,0
739,UgwWm9aUvtCa3pcaAdF4AaABAg,Haven,"@tashboog No, she said she got aggressive in the 11th hour of fighting. Now he walks away before she can even start. That is learned behavior and self preservation which is not at all cowardly. He said that things dont get better when they fight and if things get physical he needs to leave. She says she needs to be mad. She can be mad in a room by herself or venting with another person. When he says he'll promise to stay, she says she can't promise to not get violent. I grew up in a few abusive household both as a teen and an adult and when people are screaming, they dont want to talk things out. They want to scream. Nobody deserves to be a verbal punching bag, so yes, people need to leave rather than escalate the situation.

Case and point, this whole recording. He was nothing but level headed and open to fixing the situation. He asked all the right questions for a healthy relationship, ""What did I do wrong? What do you want to change? When was this a problem?"" But in response to that she got angrier and angrier, screaming and blaming him. He took his half of the blame, but when he tried to ask her about why she did things like lie about hitting him, she hostiley deflected and told him to go suck another guy off. 

Working with abuse cases is what I'm trying to do for a living. If someone needs to have space away from someone who is making them uncomfortable or upset, they are allowed that. Nobody should be forced to stay in a fight. They can talk about it again when they're both calm, and considering they learned to do the recording from a marriage councelor, he isnt avoiding it at all. As you said. It's impossible to talk things out when you have no self control and she clearly doesnt have any irregardless of where he is.

When I walk away from arguments and fights it's because I dont want to tell someone I love that I think they're a -insert overblown insult birthed from anger here- because I dont really think that and it wont help. When I walk away from people screaming at me, it's because I have PTSD and will either disassociate from the world or have a panic attack. But when things are chill? Hell I can talk about anything. That isnt cowardly to walk away, that's looking out for yourself. If you feel like the issue is that you caused someone to be angry and you need to stay to fix it, then you need to learn that is complete bull. Ask any therapist. ""You"" dont need to do anything besides look out for yourself. We can only control ourselves and how we react to a situation. We can't make others do, think, or feel a certain way. If someone got angry, that's on them to deal with. They can come back and talk when they've calmed down.",2020-02-05T17:42:50Z,0

Unless you don't actually believe in equality when it's inconvenient for you. Honestly this never hit a woman bs is some of the most toxic shit we get drilled into our heads growing up. It teaches men that they can't defend themselves and teaches women that they should get a blank cheque to get away with assault and the like (aside from perhaps legal consequences but that always comes after the fact).

Bottom line is you don't always have the luxury of removing yourself from a situation, and assault with a (deadly) weapon is also a thing. The man does not always have the upper hand nor does that matter when your health is put in danger by a violent person. Not to mention that as the victim you should not HAVE to just take it or run. Yes legally you often get the short end of the stick and that is worth mentioning, but that does not equate to a moral argument against self-defense, which is what you are trying to sell here.

And as the perfect cherry on top you then turn around and not apply that same standard to female victims. Which to be fair you shouldn't, but the same goes for men and you seem to care little for them. And if there's two things I dislike it's hypocrites, and those who espouse double standards without even a hint of self-awareness or shame. _Rights for me but not for thee._

How about as a general rule we just don't lay hands on each other, and acknowledge that if force is used against you then at the very least you are justified in protecting yourself with a _proportionate_ response. That is not only a common sense position to take, it is also the _only_ one as far as this issue is concerned. But instead you speak of 'truth' while peddling sexist double standards in the very same breath.

But just as soon as he was about to defend himself, she said Oh, you can't hit me, I'm a woman. So he backs off she turns around picking a rock and smack him on the head with it. Everyone's just sitting around looking don't even bother to stop. Yeah, there's a double standard. It's not okay to hit anybody men do not do most of the Domestic violence its women right now.  There's so many facts and evidence and statistics to prove a problem is people like you Grew up with a certain thought process and refuse to believe it.

1046,Ugx6Vhfra4Qisr2wJEJ4AaABAg,Karen,"@Scott Sommer the over correction with ""gender equality"" is ridiculous. As a survivor myself, I have always argued that the legal system and society needs to take all allegations seriously, and not just believe the woman at face value. People lie and bluff all the time and a woman's ability to destroy a man's life and career is insane. 

Hell, even if the man dies, women are able to use a ""battered wife syndrome"" defense to either get away with it completely or get a drastically reduced sentence. 

Men need to have access to shelters and protection services. With any luck the pendulum will swing back towards the middle, because this is not the ""equality"" feminists initially fought for.",2020-02-04T05:22:19Z,0
1047,Ugx6Vhfra4Qisr2wJEJ4AaABAg,Scott Sommer,"@Karen 
Real talk...it is very hard for a man to file for domestic abuse. This is why men don't file it that much nor do they call the police for it. More often than not, the woman could be beating him right as the police get there, he could be bloody and more, and they will arrest him before they even begin to even think about accusing her of it.

This is why alot of domestic abuse cases go documented because the males know the cops won't believe them until they are murdered. 

Hell, I have seen cases where a woman called rape against a guy and arrested him without any hesitation until they got the footage of her beating him up just for flying a drone over a public beach.

For a woman, sometimes the woman herself can say ""nothing happened"" and yet the guy will still get arrested because someone else reported.

That is society today. The law and practices are thrown out for third wave feminism. Their idea of ""equality.""",2020-02-03T23:59:11Z,0
1048,Ugx6Vhfra4Qisr2wJEJ4AaABAg,Karen,"Serious answer..... Unless the physical abuse reaches ""felony level"" I think the victim has to press charges. If the physical abuse is considered ""felony level"" then the state/grand jury is able to indict without the victim starting the process. But, due to the level of proof required to convict, if the victim is not cooperating chances are the DA won't pursue charges. Also, I have no idea the degree of violence that changes a misdemeanor into a felony, or that would change assault into attempted manslaughter or attempted murder. Personal opinion, given how wealthy they are I'm assuming they have really nice, professional chef level, cast iron pots and pans which are heavy throwing those at a person could be as deadly as a metal baseball bat therefore if they connected I'd guess minimum felony assault. 

(I'm stressing the physical abuse because I don't think mental/emotional/psychological abuse can be prosecuted unless there is a direct threat on someone's life. They might be able to use those details when determining the sentence)",2020-02-03T22:34:33Z,1

Spouses can do crazy and horrible things in what Johnny said is demonic activity around them. The main thing is for him to get off the revenge train and take care of himself. In the audio she is talking to the disease. She also abuses. It isn‚Äôt black and white. She did the right thing since as we can see he was covertly trying to destroy her reputation and career. He admitted throwing the phone at her. It is unlikely the laws of physics support his story about how the finger was cut off. He is playing dirty and consistently showed a willingness to do that. His ways of distancing and disengaging sound like coercive control techniques and gross immaturity. It is not possible to have functional relational intimacy with an addict.

1056,UgwdIB1QlYyHXPlY7yB4AaABAg,Families Supporting Trauma Recovery,Not sure selfish is the word to be caring for a late stage alcoholic drug addict for four years. Who was smearing her behind her back with rape and murder ideation and planned to give her world wide destruction and ordered his sister to get her fired. In the audio he spars with troll salad. His lawyer consistently spars with troll salad in all those videos.  He admits to having blackouts and mistreating her and being horrified and now they re saying they were just patronizing a deluded person. If they want to understand the communication in the audio it is coercive control techniques. There is a name for every cognitive distortion and logical fallacy. She is fair game for evil people of the lie. In the anger management classes she hoped he‚Äôd  take they go over the issues with lying rhetoric. Evil people of the lie. It is too bad she is promoting atheism and scoffed at his aa recovery attempts as if learning about that was beneath her highness. Having a young woman deal with his attempts at withdrawing from drugs with all the mania involved seems irresponsible. It is too traumatic. It is common for drunks to run off and shift blame to the spouse and they just want to go get high alone. He assaulted a person on set as well. Hopefully they both get help for their own issues.

1116,UgxNzfORY1NUNtHxnL94AaABAg,phoenix jones,@African RumPunch nah the average dude would seriously fuck up 99 percent of women in a fight. There's weight divisions separated by a few pounds in all professional fighting leagues for a reason. Women only win fist fights because dudes ain't gonna catch a prison sentence for defending himself. Hella chicks delusional as fuck about this fact though.

1120,Ugyt4gTGrQp-ODJZCrV4AaABAg,GOW,@Malik Jackson you should always be skeptical. My mother got accused of cheating on my father with another man by one of the family members of my father. My father believed it and they had a whole bunch of problems because my mother said that was not true but my father did not believe her and chose to believe his blood family. At the end his blood family denied ever saying that. It's crazy they denied it because I heard it myself. My point be it a women or men family or not family be skeptical until you are sure.,2020-02-03T22:44:06Z,3
