7,UgyxgQ3EZ2UNtOHgF6x4AaABAg,jadoredepp,"I understand what you mean but as someone who experienced abuse myself, she admitted to being the abuser. There is no doubt. Also, yes there is no perfect victim and people react differently but never will a victim of domestic violence behaving so cocky when having to recount what she has previously described as a "" near-death experience nightmare"". NEVER. She smirks when hearing herself admitting to hitting him and rolls her eyes, this is the act of a narc showing no remorse. If you have also listened to the tape, you'll know that no victim of DV will ever dare to speak the way Heard so often did with Depp. This is a display of domination and control, she isn't scared of him but he is definitely scared of her to the point that he can barely put a word in when trying to have a rational discussion with her. I know that exact feeling. You can also clearly tell that she makes up the story as she goes, one second stating something and the second saying she don't know, she can't decide what lie to pick which is different from ""not remembering because of trauma"". There's more than enough evidence out there to prove that she's a sociopath hiding behind the real horror of what so many women actually go through every day and it's time to stop trying to find an excuse to her actions when the same people have blindly attacked Johnny Depp back when she first accused him.",2021-08-11T17:16:45Z,2

11,UgwEJtQ95PxGbOztfKJ4AaABAg,Rock Candy,i think we can also look at her behavior and see it.  Example: an adult who throws a tantrum because a spouse is late for the birthday party (and for very legitimate reasons) might have some issues.  A person that spends hours complaining that their spouse leaves the room instead of staying to get hit and puunched might have some issues - also because they are doing the hitting and puunching.

Before jumping to more conclusions about the victim, you should concider that 1) she was illegally recording someone in emotional distress, who does that ?  2) he was ignoring her all along and she was the one pushing for a reaction from him so that she could frame him.  3) he smashed a cabinet door, again, fully ignoring her. This is not abuse.  4) this video is included because Amber leaked an edited version to TMZ and the full one shows her laughing and being proud of what she did. 

There is no ""Johnny isn't 100% clean"", Amber has fully admitted to being the one and only perpetuator in their relationship and also admitted that Johnny would always run away, which means he never raised a finger on her. This is a decent person who has not only been defamed and wrongly accused but who also has been the actual victim of abuse and as someone who knows abuse, this kind of comments full of ignorance is simply no further tolerable.",2021-06-02T21:35:27Z,4

But I don't know - I'm just like you, no doctor here. Just reporting the information that's been discussed in court and I just want people to know that I never meant to make all people suffering certain things, feel bad or think that they're like her. She's just one case. And in my opinion, her personality has a lot of clashes.¬†
For example; she knows damn well what she's done and that she has anger issues but at the same time, it seems that she's completely gaslighted herself to the point that she's become delusional about her lies. She really thinks her story holds together, no matter how many more random made up details she creates on the spot to make herself appear even more victimized.¬†
To give you a clearer idea of what i'm saying: In one of the assaults, she claimed JD pushed an airplane SEAT at her while on a flight. An airplane seat. You can't move the bloody thing around! Also there were other people on that flight, surprisingly (not) it's just her words, she sought the declaration of no one, no stewart to back it up.
