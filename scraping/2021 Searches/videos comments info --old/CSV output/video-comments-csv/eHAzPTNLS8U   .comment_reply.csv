132,UgyQq7SI9pEPTcSQro14AaABAg,CJOK,@Mimi B thanks. I am a fan of Johnny depp but the biggest reason I'm so invested in this case is because like many here I'm also a survivor of domestic abuse at the hands of narcissists. I hope to see her have to answer for her crimes. It doesn't matter that it's a female. To me its simply  a case of a victim of abuse trying to get justice & an abusive person that needs to be stopped. I'll give them hell because they deserve it for backing an abuser.
