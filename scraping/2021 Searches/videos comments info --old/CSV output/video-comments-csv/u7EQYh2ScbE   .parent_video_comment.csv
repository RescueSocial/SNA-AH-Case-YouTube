15,UgxAPGIMSbIfGUBmcF54AaABAg,"she hasn't done anything illegal or being charged. She hasn't broken contract, so they're obligated to keep her around. The only reason why Johnny Depp left was because he agreed to step down, they didn't tell him he had to, that's why he's still being paid for his role. The fact he's stepped down has shone a light on her wanting to stick around with her job, putting her in the limelight to be scrutinised that much more. I will be seeing Aquaman 2 because I am a huge fan of the character and DC properties in general but I won't enjoy seeing her on screen. Fingers crossed that her role is small and I won't have to be distracted by her.

473,UgyJDgC_gBos2S1Hh1Z4AaABAg,as long as AH is in this movie I will be boycotting. She is a husband beater and for WB to keep her in the movie is crazy and dismiss JD on a drop of a dime is amazing to me.,Annessa Swafford,555,2021-06-15T17:19:25Z

Guess WB is ready to lose tons of money over a ""high paid actress"". It's funny cause I'm sure it the roles were reversed she would've been fired on the spot. Even with all the evidence they have on her its crazy that she still has this role. She's also making it harder for ACTUAL VICTIMS! ü§¨üò°",Nashelle Suarez,50,2021-06-15T17:04:12Z

There is no way on earth I am going to boost the bank balance of that mentally twisted, abusive liar.  Sorry Jason but you should have pushed for another Mera.
