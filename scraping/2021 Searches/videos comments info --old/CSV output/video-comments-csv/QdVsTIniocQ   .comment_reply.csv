1,UgyJtnZO-R6ZOsW3o594AaABAg,gaysy1st,"I agree. She was told that if she claimed he had abused her, she would get to keep the apartment. She makes it clear in one of the audio tapes, that she doesn't want to move out & he tells her she can stay there for as long as she needs to. He obviously expects her to move out at some point, but makes it clear that he wouldn't force her out. This wasn't enough for her though. She wanted to keep the place, bloody cheek of her!",2021-05-03T10:21:01Z,0
2,UgxzdlVZu3rkj6NBtYN4AaABAg,gaysy1st,"It wasn't though. Just because she said it on a show, doesn't make it true. Like the judge in Britain should have realised, people LIE. The hospital stated that they never received it & she later admitted that she just hadn't got around to doing it. It's obvious she wanted to keep the money & even tried to justify keeping it by saying that Johnny had 'caused her' legal expenses that she needed to pay.",2021-05-03T10:24:26Z,1
3,UgxzdlVZu3rkj6NBtYN4AaABAg,bianca devino,LOL...yeah except they proved the hospitals didn't receive hardly any of it. She's such a liar,2021-04-22T04:10:03Z,4
4,UgxbZ3CnXl2mQY-ZrNN4AaABAg,bianca devino,yep...And she isn't the least bit scared of him. He's more scared of her by far.,2021-04-22T04:07:54Z,2
