25,UgyZk4Xso9fcssg6oV94AaABAg,"EB was quoted as saying that what the case is about is whether or not JD abused AH.  Using the the UK verdict,  AH's allegations were found ""substantially true"".  If Judge Penny would agree with that premise, the case would be dismissed.  However, even in their own petition 2 important pieces of admitted information were left in: 1) that AH was not a party in the UK trial, but a material witness; 2) that the OP-ED was written about JD and allegations were from his abuse if AH in their marriage.  Together, these blow holes in her own petition. JD's team states that there are substantial differences: different country, different partied involved, different set of discovery rules; therefore, they cannot be compared. They contend that this is a waste of the Court's time and want sanctions to stop the nonsense. 
I agree with JD's team. I hope sanctions are placed against AH.
