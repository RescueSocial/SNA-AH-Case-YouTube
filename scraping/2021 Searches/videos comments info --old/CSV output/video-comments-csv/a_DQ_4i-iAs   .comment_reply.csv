32,UgzsuGy_qc8Auzpwjp54AaABAg,YUVAN,"I study personalities and have been studying Johnny through all of his interviews and the way he perceives life and etc. Johnny is incapable of hurting someone, he's just a na√Øve fool that believes in love and got trapped by it. He has obsessive problems, where he can get easily addicted to something, be it drinks, drugs or even the person he care for but he has a huge moral compass where he don't mind destructing himself but never others. That's how people of his personalities operate, they stick through any abusive relationships like a lost child. Things to note is that Amber has a history of physical abuse with her ex, Tasya while 3 of Johnny ex'es, Allison, Paradis and Ryder have gone public on how Johnny is incapable of such thing. A person's history will tell all about them.",2021-03-30T22:28:36Z,1

He scoffs at his own claim that she deliberately chopped off his finger, even though it happened, but he feels he's exaggerating it. He sees it as an accident, but ""having my finger chopped off"" sounds like she took a chisel and a  hammer to it, so he feels he shouldn't really claim she chopped off the finger deliberately.

I came back to see the hair flick again, what does it mean... I started thinking I got it wrong. And I think I did. He's saying he'd like to hear some scientist's view on that, then he realizes he just made himself THAT IMPORTANT that the freaking scientific community should be involved in his domestic drama, and that discomfort of facing his own sense of self-importance makes him swipe his hair.",2021-02-16T01:24:10Z,0

I really want to believe, that he is the victim and there are indications that make it more likely to be the case. Its just weird to me, that the court has given the judgement on her behalf and making Depp the perpetrator. There might be more to this case then we know and get to know and we still have to await the upcoming investigations for the 2nd round in court (sorry, english is not my mothertounge so I am not aware of all correct wordings) - in any case, as a Depp Fan since my early teenage years I want him to turn around the tables so that we can finally speak about domestic abuse against men, too, with a public example. To be honest the pictures of the injuries make me doubt Amber quite a lot, really, mostly because it seems staged. The biggest issue I am having is that both are actors and they could be able to convince people because they are are good at their job. Anyhoot, I am not saying either one of them is guilty until proven in court, so I give doubt to both sides here - drugs and alcohol can change people, domestic abuse can be a result of alcohol abuse, Depp could perhaps been simply defending himself against her flying vodka bottles and whatever else she was able to to hurt him with (which I would classify as self defence and that shouldnt be charged as it was).

135,UgyA8AkenSkkCnQ29Mx4AaABAg,umahope,"@Jun Jeanne Victims of DVA eventually turn to self-harm, alcohol. Depression in most cases of DVA follows. Some people who are abused want a way out, thus Depp, started avoiding Amber. Depp opened up about his depression after the break up.  Only to be mocked by our ever so gentle media. Besides, I worked as an extra in "" Sweeney Todd"",  Depp was extremely kind and thoughtful with  everyone on a  set.

136,UgyA8AkenSkkCnQ29Mx4AaABAg,Jun Jeanne,"@umahope I havent considered these points, really, but its the same symptoms or warning signs as with depressions or addictions, especially the weight gain - so not sure if its the one or the other. What I find suspicious however is Ambers reaction and behavior in all this, presententing herself as the victim and calling herself a survivor. If compared to other people who were proven victims of DA here behavior differs a lot from others. Its still difficult for me to really set my mind on ""one culprit"". However all past partners of Johnny Depp have stated that he has never been violent before, which lets me believe that he is more likely a victim. But: I dont know :/",2020-12-16T07:31:07Z,0

To this day i'm still so self conscious most of the time, that I honestly don't know if i would be strong enough to deal with the kind of public scrutiny Johnny's had to deal with, on top of the media bulllying, ever since AH first tried to frame Johnny for what she did to him.",2021-01-03T04:46:37Z,3
211,Ugxkw8KQWlNl8y9oqsZ4AaABAg,Mimi B,"@Kirsty Fairly I am an extremely shy and introverted person, and I think people often misinterpret me when I have to speak in social situations. I was also raised by an abusive grandmother much like his own mother. That only exasperates the shyness and, of course, profoundly affects your self-esteem. I guess I feel like I understand him in that way. I remember noticing in his early interviews that he seemed to be so painfully shy. He's gotten better over the years, but I still see it sometimes. I can only imagine what I would be like if I had to get on the stand and divulge such personal and embarrassing details of my life to a roomful of strangers. I respect him so much more for going through with these lawsuits for that very reason.",2021-01-03T04:07:01Z,7
212,Ugxkw8KQWlNl8y9oqsZ4AaABAg,Kirsty Fairly,"@Mimi B -Makes sense, from everything i've heard about him from those who know him best, he's also incredibly shy and not one for confrontation as a result of what he went through as a child which could make his stammer worse for him if he's feeling stressed. It's heartbreaking that he's had to endure so much abuse throughout his life, as well as the way the media bullies him, he seems like such a warm & gentle natured guy, he really doesn't deserve any of the abuse he's experienced.",2021-01-02T17:22:24Z,9
213,Ugxkw8KQWlNl8y9oqsZ4AaABAg,Mimi B,"He has said that he developed a stammer as a result of the abuse he went through in his childhood. It seems to be more prominent during stressful situations. Probably why he usually speaks so slowly and meticulously in interviews. A lot of people want to blame it on his drinking and drug use üôÑ but no he has always spoken in this way. It made me so angry when That Woman requested he sit 5 days for his deposition in VA. It was implied he'd need more time because he had such a lethargic manner of speaking. Again, it felt as if they were alluding to his past issues with drugs and alcohol or perhaps his age. Since she often liked to refer to him as an old man. Just another way for her to try and insult and humiliate  him.ü§¨",2020-11-27T06:15:16Z,24

222,UgzbsYHJH1bSZNwg-_94AaABAg,Deborah Corbett,I have personally witnessed this. My ex-husband was telling a story about an experience on our way to a party. After telling the story people made comments and jokes. When he told the story to the next group of people he incorporated the comments and jokes from the first group. This continued throughout the evening and by the end of the party there was no resemblance to what actually happened. He felt no shame in telling this tale in front of me throughout the evening as it grew and became so distorted. It was a fascinating yet disturbing experience for me.,2020-11-29T12:40:58Z,0
