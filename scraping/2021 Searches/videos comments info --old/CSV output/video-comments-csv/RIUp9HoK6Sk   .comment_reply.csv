55,UgypJEs4iLhNayWnz-F4AaABAg,The Hero Robert E. Lee,"@Daniel Byrne if you think its above average ""for a mobile game"" youre either lying for personal gain and paid for by Raid, or you are SEVERELY sheltered and living under a rock. You can play old final fantasy games on mobile and pokemon on mobile and download gameboy advance and psp emulators and play persona on mobile. If you think Raid is ""good for mobile"" and even slightly compares to the games I just listed then you are wrong. Raid isnt even a game. It auto plays everything for you and requires zero skill or strategy. Its a predatory casino simulator bogged down with unethical micro transactions that prey upon dumb kids and minors so they purchase more heroes and more gold and items in order to get the next best thing. Its predatory as f, and a fake game. Honestly, anyone who promotes it is unequivocally an unethical person and should be unsubbed from immediately. Its not even comparable to a mediocre chess app. 

Its no surprise money hungry, tabloid trash channels like the quartering promotes this garbage. I agree with 99% of his views, but he honestly just not a good person. He constantly is sub begging and promoting predatory trash like Raid despite being called out dozens of times by his viewers. Yet he continues to do it. He pretends to be about the little guy and supporting the average gamer and being consumer friendly, but thats all an act. Honestly, Upper Echelon is the only youtuber I know of that calls out Raid and garbage like it and the channels that promote it and is probably one of the only honest, consumer friendly, youtube gaming channel i know of.

58,Ugy6DM_MrsPR9kFssL94AaABAg,Gamemediafan 17,"@Dr Jonesey actually, just saying, there's only a vocal minority that's on Heard's side. Most people, men and women included, are on Depp's side. Cause most people are normal enough to realize that abuse happens both ways. 

Also, Depp losing his role of Jack Sparrow and Grindelwald is kind of mixed for me. I do agree with everyone else that it's unfair and just plain sexist, because he didn't do anything wrong. 

But on the other hand, the roles that he lost are those that were in movie franchises that were just getting worse and worse. I'll dive into it:
POTC was pretty good and the first movie was fuckiny iconic. The first two sequels (Dead Man's Chest and At World's End), while not being as good as the first one, were still decent movies that added to the world of the first film and built a genuine story arc that was interesting to watch, even if the first two sequels were unnessesarily long at points. It was when we got to the fourth film (On Stranger Tides) that the franchise officially became dull and just not as fun. The story wasn't that interesting, the shtick was getting old, etc. And then we have Dead Men Tell No Tales, the worst of the franchise so far. On Stranger Tides wasn't good, but at least it was entertaining in areas. It felt big and epic at certain points. DMTNT was just a ripoff of the first film with none of the charm or excitement. It was also around the time where Depp's drug use got worse, and you could tell in the performance with how he slurs every one of his sentences. A lot of people didn't like the film and just thought the franchise should end. 

The Wizarding World is a similar case. The Harry Potter films weren't all that great and they did leave some parts of the books out, but they were still decent adaptations of the source material. Then we got to Fantastic Beasts, a planned pentology of films that just ARE NOT NEEDED and are incredibly lazy and dragged out. It's clear that JK Rowling is just grasping for straws here. The first film was just boring. None of the characters are interesting. The action is a mess. And it was so unnessesarily complicated that it was just a pain to sit through. Crimes of Grindelwald, at least in my opinion, was a slight improvement, with it being easier to follow and having some more memorable imagery. But it was still pretty boring and just dull.  The best parts of the film were Jude Law as Dumbledore and JD as Grindelwald. But even then, when you think about it, they're just ripoffs of Charles Xavier and Magneto from Xmen. ""I want to rule/get rid of humans because they're oppressing our group of people, and my old friend thinks they can live in peace together"". It's the same concept but with wizards replacing mutants. The film just isn't interesting and the twists have no impact because you don't care about any of the characters.

So yeah, both POTC and the WW franchises are basically in ruin, and even when JD was IN those franchises people were hating them. So, at least to me, JD being gone from those roles is a blessing in disguise. People hated DMTNT and Crimes of Grindelwald even though JD was in them. Whether JD would still be in the roles or not, people would still dislike what the future of these film franchises would offer. I think that this is a chance for JD to do the roles that made people love him in the first place, the ones that are new, real, and dramatic. I heard Minamata and Waiting for the Barbarians were fucking good movies. So, just saying, maybe JD dodged a bullet. Margot Robbie and Mads Mikklesen think that JD being gone from those roles was amazing for their careers, but wait and see what happens.",2021-05-28T16:25:40Z,0
59,Ugy6DM_MrsPR9kFssL94AaABAg,Dr Jonesey,"@Gamemediafan 17 I don't really care outside of the morality of this issue. I want her to get punished because she's doing evil and he didn't seem to do anything wrong. That's it. If Depp did nothing wrong to her, she needs to get her punishment, he gets his role back and life goes on. I don't care for celebs, but how we treat them and what we wish for them has an impact on culture. You see females routing for Amber Heard, that's in indication of a cultural issue here which is much more of an issue than what's going on in this case.",2021-05-28T16:04:52Z,0

Raid Shadow Legends is a very popular game with lots of cool and interesting heroes, a cool story, fun to play here and there, pvp, limited by energy each day to choose what you want to do each day, once you beat the story however this game starts to fall, once you reach the end you will need some great epic/legendary heroes, you WILL need to spend money to continue doing more of the content, such as the raids, dungeons, you will have to gamble on the LOOTBOX system  spending 1000's to get the correct team and to obtain the better heroes so you can do better content and unlock the rest of the game, so if you got a fat wallet and like to gamble, this game is for you! The armours in game look different and cool cosmetically but will also require you to gamble for the correct perfect stats to do the content further in the game, this game cannot be thoroughly enjoyed free to play or even by spending just a little, you will need 10's of thousands to get these epic and legendary heroes that can do the top dungeons in the game, not only that but the events in game to get the better rewards that you actually need but get very little of, you will also need to spend money just to complete them and get the heroes on the reward list for getting so far plus the items that you'll need to either upgrade your heroes or the better lootboxes to have a chance at your epic and legendary heroes, this is a mobile game that is full of gambling, player discretion is advised if you choose to play this game I'm endorsing.

 However all this Information, referenced to, in the article, is available since weeks (sometimes moths) for everybody who cared (Umbrella Guy made a lot of Videos about it, just to name one source). 
The officers Statements are available since the uk process - (only the judge dismissed it, because the acctress is such a good person who donated... (said she would donate...) ... (And Perhaps, since his family is tied to the Sun. 
In fact - all that is so messed up I suggest to dig into it like it is a true crime Video. Lots of twists) 
So in this special case I'd say - if it takes 'BILD'  and the capital Letters Bild is famous for, to ram down some truth/statements/facts (which are somehow continously missed by other Media) into the public mind - so be it.
