3,UgwU0ncBclZWMAq8cJp4AaABAg,"Shame on her, I believed her. Now it's going to make people not believe women. AH is feminist and man's nightmare. The facts are Depp's finger was cut off, her behaviour is extremely manipulative on the tapes, she admits to hitting her, they both acknowledge he leaves whenever things get heated, she lied about donating 7 million to the charities and the UK judge looked favourably on the donation. Even if her injuries are real and there's witnesses who say they aren't, she is the main aggressor and had the audacity to be a women's right activist. How are we meant to believe women when one can have a VRO taken out, be believed by a judge and photographs of injuries and some witnesses and in the end be the main perpetrator. This is why people don't believe women. What kills me is Johnny got cancelled and she's still a spokeswoman for women's rights and Loreal and is still in Aquaman.",Anna Ruby,0,2021-10-11T14:49:57Z

We know that the whole idea, of being a victim is abhorrent to her,  a victim is weak, a ""doormat"".

1. Lawyers say 'allegations.' If Johnny hasn't been found guilty of anything, it's allegations. 

2. There is lawyer-client privilege. Howeveeerrrrrrr, if your client tells you something, even if it ruins your case, you have to bring it up. Sometimes lawyers, as a tactic, will bring up the information that ruins their case before the other side to get it out of the way. 
Also, this is why alot of lawyers will tell their clients to ONLY answer the questions they ask them. Lawyers don't want to hear everything, for literally this reason.

3. No they won't throw anything out if there's an error. This isn't a cops legal charging papers. It's a memorandum. They'll state that it's wrong and move on.",Stefania,0,2021-07-19T23:22:45Z

180,Ugyyt2g75ZWKG4vf4714AaABAg,"My opinion is it is a last ditch desperate attempt to get the lawsuit dismissed by claiming the subject of the article is of global importance. Basically arguing that the article brought necessary awareness to DV around the world so the the contents within the article shouldn't matter because the need for awareness trumps that. I believe JD used a similar argument when appealing in UK, stating that the issue is of great concern to the public therefore it must be reviewed due to the impact the ruling would have. That said, I don't think it will work. The judge all but said the effort was futile and the case had no chance of being thrown out. It seems Amber's team is starting to try to mirror some of JD's arguments, but JD has the evidence to back his up.",TracyTriesStuff,0,2021-07-16T00:55:54Z

They are still trying to argue about that and say, “Well, she meant this and that.” No. She needs to come forth and say she said things that weren’t true, and either pledge a donation with money up front, or just take an L. I doubt either of those options would affect the case, but the first option, to admit fault and give some big money, might help her in the public eye.

They can state that they believe the allegations to be true or false, but they have to refer to them as allegations until JD is actually convicted (which should never happen if there is any justice in the world). 

This whole thing has been so frustrating since the justice system here in the UK has failed, but at least it highlighted the failings for us and now a lot less people will have faith in the process and will want to do something about it if it's at all possible.
