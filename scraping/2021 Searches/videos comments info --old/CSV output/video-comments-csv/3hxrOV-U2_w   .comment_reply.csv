7,UgxlJugVyvCa7sx6uzd4AaABAg,Freeda Aghakhaineyan,Absolutely agree. No genuine victim blatantly goes out in front of the world's press and paps with bruises trying to act like a shy timid person and then tells everyone everything that apparently happened. Its not like its something to brag about and normally the victim feels ashamed and embarrassed about it and they either don't go anywhere til the marks are gone or covers them up. Not parades around with them like its something to boast about. Knowing you're a victim is really hard to cope with and you deny it to yourself. She does not behave like a victim in any way possible,2021-07-17T05:16:04Z,5
