4,UgynCO0DXmraYpYhMJF4AaABAg,Aquaman 2 should have an open casting call. Emilia‚Äôs acting doesn‚Äôt merit just getting the role because she has chemistry with Momoa. If she really wants it let Emilia earn it or get someone else,Tammy Martinez,0,2021-02-21T23:04:28Z

9,UgzrSZAylKQiemp079B4AaABAg,"Forbes magazine reported it in an article about Emilia Clarke. 

‚ÄúHer badass Thrones role catapulted her to A-list status, leading to other physically demanding film roles as young Sara Connor in Terminator Genisys and Qi‚Äôra in Solo: A Star Wars Story. She also signed on to replace Amber Heard as Mera in Aquaman 2. Daenerys, Qi‚Äôra, Mera‚Äîeven her full name, Emilia Isobel Euphemia Rose Clarke, is a chore.‚Äù

11,Ugz1yCVkjeFIJ9MmMR14AaABAg,"Who o why o why Amber? You just couldn't help yourself to stop these accusations, you pushed and pushed and pushed once too often to cause this. You could have climbed up the ladder on your own without pulling someone else down, now I don't think you will have that chance again, and it's all your own doing!!!! #Justiceforjohnny",Ms.G,1,2021-02-19T21:04:28Z

19,UgycAM1swtFAG7D7nrV4AaABAg,"Choosing Emila for this role is a better choice she's a better actor the fans love her , she better acting like she has done with dragens on Game of Thrones she has it all . She is the best choice to replace that terrible person AMBER Heard.",Mary Brennan,6,2021-02-19T02:21:08Z
20,UgzSZRf1sAaYCUAkSMR4AaABAg,"Amber Heard can play a villon because she's a lier, an abuser she's a very hatred person she doesn't belong on a heros film . She's not the type of person you want for AQUAMAN and I myself did not think she was a good actor on AQUAMAN she doesn't fit in as a hero or a good person on this movie. That's before the truth about her came out how a terrible person she really is . She even deficated on her own husband's bed my God what kind of sick person  she really is , just think about this thats so gross. Does Disney really want this type of person on there movies a family movie at that . I surely hope not she's disgusting,  abusive physically and mentally,  she's a horrible lier that ruined Johnny Depps name which caused him to lose all jobs and rolls in his movies for Warner Brothers and Disney.  I hope they send her to prison for her lies in court and to the police , all her pergery of lies should put her in jail for a couple of years.",Mary Brennan,0,2021-02-19T02:13:11Z

30,UgzmS8DKShigmz8e_eF4AaABAg,"Everyone seems to forget that Amber Heard in a fit of anger put a cigarette out on Johnny's face.  This is clearly assult causing bodily harm times 2.  You can see the mark on his right cheek when his picture was taken in the hospital for his severed finger, which is probably now a scar.
