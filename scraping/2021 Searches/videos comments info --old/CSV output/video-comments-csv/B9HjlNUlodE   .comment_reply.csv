I can't imagine staying in marriage so long. I'll pass on a second date at the slightest irritation. Not that it makes the man wrong, it's just that it's not right for me. 
I think the only salvation Amber has right now is to come clean, and tell her story and admit to what she's done. And admit she was wrong. Amber's friends are all sycohants and aspiring grifters. Her sister looks terrorized. I believe the texts where her and Johnny were bonding. 
I'm am so sure that this court is going to go full on madness when it starts. Adam has 8 months to prepare and I think he is giving this case everything he has. I have full faith in him and am happy for Johnny to have a guardian angel in his life to help him get through this nightmare.

178,UgwK_c-ZuPFpPBPNXmd4AaABAg,ann brown,"@Deborah Rose  I have read that her father was physically abusive to the mother and the two girls but that Amber and the father were closer, that though is hearsay so you can only take that with a pinch of salt. 
I'm not quite as relenting when it comes to giving leeway on a past of abuse being a reason for adult behaviour. My father abused my mother in ALL forms and he went on to abuse me physically and sexually from the age of 10 my mum had no idea he was very good at hiding it and I never spoke up. At around 13 I decided enough was enough that he was not gonna touch me in that way again nor was he going to hit my mum. So I fought him every step of the way, the sexual abuse changed then to a grope when he had the chance. I was stronger as a person than my mum he ha ground her down to nothing so I fought for mum to when I needed to. He soon got the message and his bullying became irritating. Mum finally divorced him when I was 21, he is well out the way now serving 20yrs in jail for what he did,
For all that we went through I could never put another person through what i saw my mum go through and what i went through. I raised my son and 2 daughters, to be aware of their bodies and what is and isn't right.
