One thing doesn't exclude the other, it's not a bad thing to want Johnny to be given back his role as Jack Sparrow in Disney whilst also wanting to see Amber Heard be fired from Aquaman 2 and ostracized in Hollywood without any chance to perform any other role. No one is saying that Johnny shouldn't get his career back and his role as Jack Sparrow back but teaching Amber Heard a lesson isn't vengeful, it's putting her in her place. Narcissists and socipaths don't learn the easy way, these people only correct their behavior after they had to go through a living hell, narcissists don't have empathy for other people and even though forgiveness is a thing, you can't just ""forgive and forget"" everything someone does to you just because you don't want to be vengeful, some people need harsh treatment in order to recognize the worth another person has and in this case, let Amber realize the kind of person she lost because of her toxic attitude.

Instead of being upset because people are asking Warner Bros. to remove Amber from the role, try to ask feminists to reform their stupid #MeToo movement or else, more innocent men like Johnny Depp will have their careers, their lives and their reputation destroyed permanently because of this radical feminism that teaches society to see all women as inherent victims just for the sake of being women and all men as rapists and opessors just for the sake of being men.

Some women who took feminism and twisted it into a sense of something like, ""women should be treated equal, oh but if we date and the guy doesnt pay for the whole meal hes not the guy for me"" this cherry picking of ""equality"" was noticed even more so than the actual movement itself so now usually you hear the terms like ""feminazi"" for situations where a woman cherry picks the good part of equality. And men on the flip side of the coin are taught they are supposed to be kinder and gentler, some fail to learn some take it too seriously,  it results to either pampering a woman and her ego just because shes a woman doesnt matter her character her actions her personality, or just downright dont give a shit there are plenty out that that get into the good area of be kind and sincere. But a girl is usually taught and raised if you need something say it, I have 2 sisters and a father's love for sons and daughters is slightly different, sometimes in a good way sometimes in a bad, but it is noticeable if you ever stopped and replayed the way you and you sister were treated, the father is doing a good job by the way paycheck to paycheck we're making it theres so many can of worms, raise your daughter so she knows how a guy should treat her, teach her value of hard work and money, raise your son to know how to treat others as well as women, teach them values as well but since everyone is different everyone learns a different lesson sometimes and I honestly believe it's the ""cherry picking"" good equality and disregarding bad equality that has changed the feminism movement for the worse  even women are against it to some degree because other women will try to abuse the movement into their favor",2020-02-23T15:57:39Z,2

 Much info has been available through Virginia Fairfax Court, Incredibly Average on YT, & @thatBrianFella (last 2 is the same person).... Brian has done a phenomenal job providing Evidence.
 The media is slow & mainstream totally ignoring it, though they picked up Heard's claims because it fits their narrative!!! That they want to promote...showing they, #metoo, & #timesup (Heard's & Weinstein's  attorney's) DON'T CARE ABOUT FEMALE VICTIMS! MUCH LESS MALES! 
 Please sign, share & don't see Aquaman2 unless she's removed or POTC ...it will suck anyway, Jerry Bruckheimer (acclaimed director) refused to be attached without DEPP, everyone has walked but one writer. 
 Disney uses POTC in NAME only, it won't get good reviews, & won't be POTC with Depp's replacement, in fact, I sense a disaster for Disney!

109,Ugzukn16xzAJ3UVQqCt4AaABAg,JulianaHereOnEarth,Veronica - Yes!! And Emelia is a REAL actor and she would kick so much ass in that part. But I think it's too small potatoes of a role for Emelia.

As for as my original statement there is never a correlation made all I was stating is if they fired DiDio for losing them money tells me that Amber Heard who stands to lose the studio a lot of money with all the people speaking out against her will also get gone. It's not hard to understand, DiDio loses company money he's gone Amber's antics causes company to potentially lose money it only makes sense she'll be gone. WB ain't playing no more they are starting to realize the fans are fighting back against all these shenanigans taking place in our entertainment and we have the power to make a difference by not spending our money on their woke b.s. hence bye bye DiDio bye bye heard",2020-02-23T03:43:49Z,0
