9,UgwN6s6KRvxtnVxds9p4AaABAg,SuperJackster01,"@IcyCoolDefaultGuy  Warner Bros is just saying that because they refuse to admit that they made a mistake by interfering. The theatrical version is literally just a parody film. How could anyone consider that canon. It makes way more sense for the Snyder Cut to be canon because 
1. The Story is consistent 
2. Itâ€™s a direct continuation of Batman V Superman and expands on the stuff that was set up on the film
3. Continues the arcs of Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman 
4. Great introductions to Aquaman, The Flash, and Cyborg
5. An improved villain with an actual goal
6. A huge setup for the future of the DCEU",2021-10-26T20:16:34Z,0

15,UgyTWz3D87ZI55HbXCZ4AaABAg,Ihaveproblems It'strue,"Someone said that Whedons version of DC is apart of the multiverse, aka the failed DC, in Whedons version the Justice League knew nothing of Darkseid or why Steppenwolf was their. In Zacks version they knew they had to prepare for an invasion which is why they one and the Knightmare Timeline never took place, so the Knightmare Timeline takes place because of 2017 Justice League. Meaning Meraâ€™s accent is apart of a different Timeline that won, while her English accent is apart of the Timeline where they lose, which is why her crown is different compared to the one she wore in Aquaman.",2021-04-09T15:57:54Z,0

32,Ugy1icSZ1icADpJABBN4AaABAg,wonder girl,Those scenes with mera's accent were filmed before aquaman and in the josstice league version of mera she doesn't have an accent because they reshoot it. James Wan probably decided it was better for her to have anamerican accent. And it will make a little more sense if they reshoot mera scenes with her American accent in snyder cut sofans don't get confused.,2021-06-28T22:48:51Z,0
