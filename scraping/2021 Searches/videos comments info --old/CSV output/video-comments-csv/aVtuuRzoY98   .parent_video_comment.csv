Plus, this is Amber, if she was still in there - and had her letter - it would be all over her social media just to give her bragging rights and annoy people. I think all the newspapers etc., reporting she's still in it, it's nothing more than a PR stunt to try to put any more people off signing the petition...

That said for recasting Mera it better be done by someone who is very close in appearance to Amber the actress you show in your first side by side comparison would be great . But the cast director for Aquaman 2 needs to be very careful with whoever he picks-- my complaint is this loved Katie Holmes in Batman begins but when they recast her for Maggie Gyllenhaal it total ruined the movie for me. Almost any other girl would have worked but I'm sorry in my opinion M.G. is ugly  and did a bad acting job.  Just ruined the movie for me. Sorry that's just my opinion mean no insult to M.G. it could have been her hairstylist or makeup person who made her so unattractive to me.,Lon Knight,0,2020-09-03T03:04:55Z

It doesn't matter to me if she just starts making low budget indie films, though we know her ego would never settle for that. No more Amber in anything for me.

113,UgzXBY7QzfBnrU_ABzR4AaABAg,"they won't risk losing viewers and millions by keeping you know who in AM2, they know there are more people against it than for it and that they could make even more dough by doing a replacement. Also, you only need high heat when doing something like a Flamb√©, bringing water to a boil or for searing, most cooking is done with medium low and simmer heat settings, this prevents burning and ensures food is cooked thoroughly.",Ezio,1,2020-09-01T16:25:53Z
