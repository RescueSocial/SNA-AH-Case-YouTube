Technically that means that the sparks produced by the flare would still be there, yet wouldn‚Äôt bring any light at all. A 30cm radius at max.

80,UgxlWDoI2kulLE68F5V4AaABAg,mk km,"First  please  dont  assume about things second know  James wan is a much smarter  person that  you could ever imagine  to be let that sink in third . The first thing you must realize is that a flame requires a combustible substance and an oxidizer. In the case of a candle flame, the combustible substance is the heated wax which rises up the candle wick and is vaporized by the heat of the flame. The oxidizer is the oxygen in the surrounding atmosphere. These two ingredients can sustain a candle flame.
In the case of an underwater torch, both the combustible substance and the oxidizer must be supplied by hoses leading down to the torch, since no free oxygen is available underwater. The combustible gas, which might be hydrogen or acetylene, depending on the application, can be combined with oxygen gas (the oxidizer) to produce an underwater flame at the tip of the torch.
In order to maintain a steady flame, it is necessary to have a stable bubble around the flame which the exhaust gases from the combustion (typically water vapor and carbon dioxide) cannot maintain by themselves. The gas must be supplied at a high enough pressure to overcome the pressure exerted by the water. An underwater torch must therefore have a separate means for sustaining a bubble around the work location. This is accomplished by separate jets of compressed air introduced around the tip of the torch to protect the flame from the surrounding water by forming a rather large bubble enclosing the flame and the region directly adjacent to the work location.",2020-02-24T21:36:02Z,0

They are fictional race of being that have a durability that already defies science plus they mostly live underwater so I imagine their bodies must be a little suited to pressure cause as far as I know so why would try to apply science on it.

No light at all penetrates it, meaning night vision doesn‚Äôt matter. Night vision is based around light sensitivity, there‚Äôs no light so animals rely on luminescence. Plus, it still makes no sense as to why they weren‚Äôt crushed to death even before they reached the bottom even if they are magical or not. What makes them swim that fast btw? It would take them perhaps an hour to travel down there but no merely seconds.
