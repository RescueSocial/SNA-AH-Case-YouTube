The golden age of DC cartoons was during his era and there's no doubt if he was alive and at the helm the DCEU would have absolutely smashed the MCU. She's too good because with how things are her talents are wasted in a cinematic universe that doesn't seem to have any plans. The Snyder Cut is giving us Darkseid, is that cannon or not going forward? If it's not, don't you think casual viewers won't be confused? I just have no faith in DC after all the shit they've done.
