24,Ugyr5xtipb0ymT-FxPB4AaABAg,"I normally agree with everything you say in your videos as being very factual and accurate.  You're probably not wrong about this one either. However, I just want to make a note that my ex husband was a covert narcissist.  I had never dealt with ANYTHING like him before.  He did what Amber described...someone who had his own storyline of super-over exaggerated extreme vocabulary that didn't accurately portray our situation and there were simply far too many mis-statements to correct them all in any given conversation.  I gradually learned to apologize for anything true he said, ignore the rest and then try to verbally steer the conversation toward a goal (which changed depending on the incident) such as to bring us both to personal responsibility or to how to solve the problem for next time.  Coverts are extraordinary at diversions and retellings.  I would eventually get so frustrated that if a therapist walked in right then, I would look like the only one upset and he would be calm, cool collected and happy with himself for making me look nuts to a stranger.  So, as I gradually learned more, I learned how to stay calm, how to walk away and not try to get to a goal.  When I hear the two of them, I recognize Johnny's communication sounding much like my ex..calm but making false accusations the whole time, telling a false narrative which upsets the ""victim"" and confuses them and they apologize to fix it.  However Amber using violence is not ok and maybe she's a narc too but consider the possibility that she may be telling more truth than we assume.  Maybe she's an overt narc and he's a covert narc and they met their match in each other.  He does admit he would drink and do drugs and become a monster and he said he couldn't contain it.  So I know Johnny is much more likeable than her but I wouldn't presume his innocence unless you're privy to ALL the facts.  If my ex was in court, I'd smile hearing his absurd retellings and roll my eyes about it and that's not me having duping delight, it would be an incredulous shock that anyone believed his crap.  I'm not following the case closely, so maybe I'm wrong.
I remember Johnny telling really disturbing dark stories that you can google so I don't know if Hollywood has many ""innocent"" people.
I agree with not victim blaming normally.  I'm just not sure he's innocent.  The public would have forgotten about it along time ago if he hadn't sued.  They originally both signed a paper agreeing that they both abused each other.  Why is his story changing?",Christian One,1,2021-04-24T07:02:27Z

Amber Heard is a very obvious golddigger. And hitting men is not okay just because they‚Äôre men. And oh how short the American attention span is. Johnny Depp regularly got shitfaced and trashed hotel rooms in front of his then partner Kate Moss. He was well known for his angry, drunk shenanigans and sadly his authoritarian control of Wynona Rider whom he sexually pursued on the set of Lucas when Ryder was only 15 years old. Too bad she succumbed to Hollywood peer pressure to speak well of him as a past partner. It‚Äôs an energetic Universe and Karma is the most patient gangster of all. The mainstream press covered Depps drunken rages for years ( only the tabloids called him out on it ) so I‚Äôm gonna piss everyone off and say even though Amber is a money grubbing slimeball HE HAD THIS COMING.",Stef Doyle,0,2020-11-22T18:43:36Z

83,Ugyin1zldw_9PTODEqV4AaABAg,"It‚Äôs clear that Amber H is a product of a very unhealthy childhood.  I am a young child mental health professional going on 17 years.  I specialize is 2-6 year olds.  I can almost picture in my mind‚Äôs eye what her young childhood was like and maybe what her adolescence was like.  It is no excuse for her mistreatment and abuse of JD or anyone else.  But it is informative.  I have learned so much from you about personality disorders.  I have been formally trained but your detailed analysis of various public personalities had been truly helpful and fascinating.  My prayer for AH is that she gets intensive psychotherapy twice a week for up to 5 years...and frankly, the same foe JD who has allowed someone to abuse him so horrendously.  There are pathological reasons why these two joined together.  JD is clearly the victim but he must learn what is in his pathology that moved him to join in matrimony with this deeply sick woman.",Sarah Stevens,0,2020-11-09T02:50:31Z

Trouble was it never happened. I think many of us could see through Heard. Beaten women don't have red marks they have swollen clack & blue bruises, broken noses & jaws. Lost voices from being throttled & there's fear in their eyes. Nothing like that was seen with her & the way she spoke while goading him on tape was confident & hardly a woman in fear of getting a beating. She has abused a sensitive topic & put a huge question mark over it for all of those real victims.

Don't ask me why, I didn't even knew who she was before this, I like him but I am not a die hard fan. Then his exes came out in public defending him, come on, who does that? Everyone that knew him said it wasn't possible. Then we started hearing about her being abusive in other relationships.  I actually know at least two couples in the same situation, where the woman in one case is very abusive verbally and keeps humiliating the guy in public and the other couple she does the same but also is physically abusive, both are very sweet and feminine, almost fragile looking but very manipulative and one of them pushes her husband almost to the limit provoking situations that could be dangerous even if the guy wasn't such a gentle man,  so perhaps my alarm bells about her rang loud because of that. BTW, I firmly believe that no man should ever beat a woman, they are stronger physically than we are, but no woman should beat a man, not only because it is disrespectful, but also because ...they are stronger physically and usually men are more likely to react to a physical interaction, and I mean react spontaneously, not in a deliberate reaction.",zauza marisa,0,2020-10-27T00:15:31Z

I know countless women who are never believed and treated like little more than just a bunch of Amber Herds. I'm just questioning if we really do believe women like we claim. We say that but. That doesn't actually seem to be the situation. Why is it so hard in this day in age to distinguish a real predator from the rest. 

When I herd this story the first time. I said what no way. And as I thought of Mr.Depp I kept thinking but he doesn't have that ""vibe"".

Then this person would suddenly become cool, calm, and collected. They would retreat, take the space that I had initially wanted, and then call me ‚Äúa psycho‚Äù for not respecting their space. It was incredibly manipulative. I think my point is there is a difference between rage, and being enraged. And because Depp has had substance abuse problems and has alway seemed to be pretty damn narcissistic, I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs possible that she really is a victim of narcissistic abuse?

124,UgylZMZ940BIgeaM1G54AaABAg,I heard about this quite awhile back bc there was a video going around that she secretly recorded of Depp drunk and yelling at her as proof he's abusive to her. Even then the situation didnt seem quite right to me and had a hard time believing her claims of abuse. Aside from hearing about his exs speaking out on Johnny's behalf I never kept up with the story or the outcome bc it all seemed like a total sham on Amber's part and just a way to get his money in the divorce. I definitely remember feeling sorry for him tho bc I knew he was already having some financial issues then here comes Amber trying to suck the man dry and finish him off in the divorce settlement and especially considering she claimed the divorce was due to this SUPPOSED abuse! What initially struck me as odd was right after Depp she was in another relationship except this time it was with a female! It's not everyday you see a woman separating from her husband then immediately jumping into a gay relationship. So it made me wonder if she was in that relationship the whole time and only with Johnny to get his money then live happily ever after with her gf!! But whatever it is theres still NO DENYING that Amber was the crazy and abusive person in the relationship!! No sane person would throw POTS AND PANS at their spouse or knocking doors down and  punching them in the face!! ALSO Johnny has been around quite awhile now and also was in a 20+ year relationship with the mother of his children and not 1 time has a bad word been spoken about him or any type of abuse shown in previous relationships! In fact they all jumped to his defense and vouched for him so Amber Heard has got an uphill battle on her hands!

In a way I couldn't blame him as he was attracted to a fantasy and reality was not his cup of tea that's why he went for me. I can't blame someone for not being into the 'real' me with a real voice and real issues and real needs. Amber on the other hand is a very different case. I never hit my ex. I never married my ex and my ex was also not 20 years my senior. I'm sorry but Johnny Depp also deserves some bit of blame here. He paraded around his new love when they got together and berated his last relationship. The tape has amber mention how he's older or 'has been around for a long time' something he himself seems to push but he was also more than happy to see a young woman crossing boundaries no one should cross to prove how much she loves him that is what BPD makes one do. If one boundary was ok he has to think long and hard how this other boundary was also then asked for. 
I know I'm going to sound like a complete jerk but he's over 50 and works in HOLLYWOOD a place of people with severe issues and emotionality. That's the difference. He was having a midlife crisis and amber was his leather jacket that wore him off instead.

It sounds like if she just owned up to the abuse and put the real work in to get better he might have even forgiven her (not that anyone SHOULD forgive abuse, I am just thinking that her calculations/goals are all wrong here). I hear him trying hard to set boundaries and understand; she‚Äôs not trying at all and is being defensive (with gaslighting). Amber, if only you accepted fault and responsibility and let love in you would be happier and still have a career!

I‚Äôam a DV survivor and like Johnny tried to always cover up for my abuser. That was my reality at the time. You cover up for them as you are afraid to let people know and feel extremely hurt and embarrassed. Johnny I feel felt the same way as I read the court documents and heard in audio. He always blamed himself and was bantered by AH barrister regarding his abuse to substances which is a disease! I‚Äôam a nurse and have worked with others who have tried to detox on narcotics, heroin, alcohol ect... it‚Äôs a horrible thing to watch and see. You need compassion and patience. Just so very sad he felt unworthy as it‚Äôs beaten into his head how he is a drug addict ect... then she has the audacity to turn it around and says he does not remember?

I am somewhat concerned however that we tend to try to find a villain in these narratives rather than looking equally at both sides of the story. Both Amber and Johnny behaved terribly in my opinion. Recording each other, setting each other up. But the reaction seems to be unbalanced in more focused on her behavior, Which I am not supporting or excusing by the way. A lot of her behavior is very unhealthy. But I think they are equally damaged and toxic in the relationship. He slams things around in his drunk or high a lot.as a woman, this would be a nightmare scenario for me to be living with. and I do not believe his walking away is solely to get away from her bad behavior. I think that he is intentionally dismissive retreat is actually an ""f*** you"" to her. And I think he knows exactly what he's doing and what reaction he will get. This is passive aggressive and manipulative. I like both Amber and Johnny in movies. But I can say that they have both displayed very troubling behavior from what we are hearing. And I think that we should shy away from trying to find a villain and a hero. They have both done significant damage to this relationship, to each other, and to themselves. I am truly baffled with all the attention on Amber, the female, when everything I hear from both of them is equally unhealthy. And who is more truthful?

A few things that jumped out at me, from her sneaking the video of him, is when he says ""did anything happen to you this morning?"" and ""if you want to see crazy, I'll give you crazy,"" is that he endured something, whether at her hand or otherwise, and that she called him crazy for however he was acting or responding. When he slammed the cabinet door, he first opened it, then when it swung back while he was reaching up, that's when he whacked it; I've done that very thing, and not even out of anger, just to avoid getting my fingers stuck, so if he was already angry, he would have responded more forcefully, and it was still just not a big deal. And, for him to discover her covertly filming him and his restrained responding to that, he doesn't yell, he just wants to be able to trust his partner to not expose his difficult moments to the world.

I have not been abused in anyway but men can't go anywhere with their stories. I think women like you will be key to put this in the spotlight. Women's words have more weight in these cases. 

Women have sons, fathers, male friends they would't want this happen too. Just an accusasion and your reputation man's or woman's will be tarnished. Proof doesn't change that. What goes out in the ether, the web, will stay there indefinately. A dangerous development. I work with children and my reputation is what I build my whole career on. 

We don't have to guess what the #Metoo movement will do. They can't really make a statement about it. Her name will just fade out and she will naturally lose her spokeperson's status.She is really ill and her career is probably be over. None has to help her with that and give her an extra push. She went too far.he miscalculated the whole thing and insttead of just taking the settlement money she went to extortion.

The words coming out of her mouth don‚Äôt match her body language or demeanor at all! I have no sympathy for this woman and I think she totally Antagonized him.

I don't know how you feel about doing videos on religions/cults, but I grew up a Jehovah's Witness and so much narcissistic behavior is present in their publications and training that it felt like I was growing up surrounded by people who watched my every move. This was only worse with relatives who were manipulated into believing that this toxic behavior was loving, and I ended up with family, friends, and even simple acquaintances believing they had a right to knowledge about my sexuality, and when I did bad, I was forced to sit in a room alone with 3 ""elders"" and tell them intimate and gritty details about what I did in my first sexual experience.

I have since left the religion and I plan on doing debunking videos of their movies and publications in the future but I would love to hear your take on things!

The throwing a phone at her her face. No bruise but a red (not swollen) mark that no one else saw, which also moved in every photo taken over the following week.

So I chose to provide Sophies name and the year it occurred, wrongly. Provocation cannot be used as a defense in NZ anymore. Sophies Mum create a foundation and travelled the length and breadth of NZ to talk in schools with pupils to try and raise awareness on Domestic Abuse. I also think it is highly significant that it was an asymmetrical relationship. Again, my very sincere apologise. With assurances this error will never be repeated. It is very unlikely I would ask you to consider another crime, this one alone, hurt the majority of NZ'ers quite profoundly, not the least because Sophies killer sat on the dock, smirking and mocking through-out his trial. One last note, out of this wondrous depth of Love, Sophies mother sought to embrace her killers parents, who in an interview said they found it presumptuous and unwelcome. Will leave this now,  Do take best care of yourself.

But at such a cost, for she was also a chronic violent alcoholic who was insanely jealous, insecure, utterly negative and able to start a fight from the most positive of situations. I've had a hammer coming at my head, I've had her coming at me with a carving knife. I've been punched, slapped. She never apologised. She always had a reason why she acted this way. Never showed remorse or guilt. She'd always accuse me of shit then abuse me as a result, which would lead her to hurt & reject me on purpose. Through it all I would try and bring hope, help her and l'd do my utmost to create good times. Many of which she'd ruin, turn into a drama, or fight, or she'd just bring utter chaos to.
I'd never known happiness like it before when we were together and when it worked. But l'd also never known such despair, unhappiness, turmoil and heartache either.
I'm 54 years old. She was 12 years younger, beautiful but damaged.
Why am l writing this? Because l can see parallels in the Amber/Johnny relationship and my own.
There's 3 sayings...
""No fool like an old fool"".
""The road to hell is paved with good intentions"", and lastly, an old Sussex, British one that's relevant,
""The man's cunny struck"", which means once a male fool falls for a younger beautiful woman who's no good for him, but with whom he's enjoying THE hottest sex and best times with all of his sense, sensibilities and ability to be intuitive goes straight out of the window.

It's every man's Achilles Heel. If she meets a smart man like Depp, that does not put up with these shenanigans and removes himself from conflict, she freaks out.

I am convinced that once he married her, without a prenup, she reached her goal and she was hell bent to destroy him to win any divorce settlement. The easiest way is to provoke a man into retaliating. IT is pretty obvious that this was her ultimate goal.

I've a good feeling about this case, because right from the start The Sun thought that it would never go to court, but the judge saw through the the nonsense and allowed it to go ahead. He will have access to the same videos and recordings that we've all seen. At the end of the day, its about equality for all humans. The fact that its not a criminal trial, but whether the Sun has destroyed his reputation helps. So clear whose the abuser to anyone with any brains. The ones who say they are as bad as each other are the fortunate ones, because they have never really experienced domestic abuse or violence. They need to be educated and pray that neither they, nor anyone in their family will ever experience it. The world is demanding integrity.

But my last ex did very sick gaslightning and was very ""hidden"" disturbed. To others he was very charming reasonable helpful and very sicially scilled. He even fooled a policewoman. I had to change lock after subtle threaths. He brought the Police in saying I was suicidal and mentally instable. She believed him totally. Even asked me why it was a scissor laying on a table(as I would have choosen to commit suicide with a small scissor) she refused listening to me, and tried to get him inside. Fortunatelly he did not come in. He turned and I saw the same contemt and smug on his face as I can see on Heard during her deposition. His last words was he was going to ""tell everybody"" about me. Meaning spread rumours that I am mentally ill, paranoid and who knows what else. He still has control over all my technology. Most numbers are blocked and I am locked out from most of my social accounts. And other accounts as well. It has been two years now, and I have not heard anything from a single friend. The once I contacted sounded different as they did not want contact. Only one neighbour friend, who never trusted him is the one I have left. He hasdone so much more.

441,UgzvNJT7g-U850osPmJ4AaABAg,"Abusers use projection constantly, they make themselves the victim or project their own thoughts & feelings onto their victim. The 2nd saddest day of my life (& that‚Äôs saying something) was the day I realised that every horrible thing my abuser called me was a reflection of how this person I LOVED thought  about HERSELF. But she‚Äôd been dead for years before I figured that out & I cried in my mother‚Äôs lap to think that all the psychological trauma I was going through was a drop in the bucket compared to what this person went through & that trauma at a very early age made her what she was.

447,UgxiIc0EsLqpdNTMj9B4AaABAg,"This is why BPD, and personality disorders in general, are so stigmatized. BPD can give you toxic traits, it can lead to abuse if you never learn to process your emotions and don't care to try. It can make you do terrible things, i can never deny that. Its an incredibly difficult disorder to deal with BUT with a lot of hard work, therapy, and medication you can live a pretty normal life. Its very upsetting. BPD doesn't make you an inherently bad person, it doesnt make you inherently abusive. Its people like her that give all of us a bad name. Ive seen people say that if you have borderline personality disorder youre automatically an abuser. Its painful to hear. Ive been professionally diagnosed and ive still had people in my life say ""I dont think you have that"" or ""you dont want that one sweetie"" because they KNOW the stigma, they know that they're first gut reaction is ""bpd makes you a bad person"" 
All she's doing is giving people a reason to not believe women who suffer from abuse. Its a sad really. Especially since(if she does have bpd) she's probably endured some real abuse in her formative years. She's like a super rich thirty some year old woman, its not like she can't afford treatment. She doesn't even feel like she needs to try. It feels terrible to be lumped in the same category as her. Its like embarrassing to watch tbh",zarouliaall,8,2020-08-07T12:08:51Z

Every single time, he was able to provide evidence and witness testimonies proving otherwise. So I stand by my opinion that he never hit her nor abused her. He accidentally headbutted her when she was being violent to him. That's the only thing she can claim where there are no witnesses. But according to her, she almost broke her nose then. But then she's able to gallivant the next day, caught in pap photos, bearing no injuries. She's a liar and abuser through and through.

They can't be on Johnny's side because they're spineless. And unfortunately, some people will believe that narrative just bc someone in the media said it. This is about a woman accusing a man of repeatedly beating her. The evidence shows that it's a lie. She didn't say ""he's hit me once or twice."" So I don't think we should assume he's ever hit her just bc she lied and said he does it all the time. I think it deserves a very strong response in order to protect true victims of abuse who don't need to lie or embellish for their experience to be real.

A recording in July 2016, can hear Depp saying to Amber: ""I headbutted you in the forehead. That doesn't break a nose"".

Johnny‚Äôs security guard Jerry Judge could be heard on the five-hour recording taken in the house in Australia saying that ‚Äúhe saw cuts on Ms Heard‚Äôs arms‚Äù and Amber had permanent scars on her arms 

Johnny said in a text that his severed finger came from him throwing a bottle, but now says it was Amber

There is a tape of Johnny‚Äôs witness saying that they were pressured to give evidence for him 

A Nurse who saw Amber just after she said that Johnny had attacked her noted that she had bleeding to her lip

Make up artist Melanie Inglessis said she helped Amber cover up bruises and marks before the James Cordon show

Ambers neighbor says she saw her with injuries the night the police were called 

Raquel Pennington told him Mr Depp had 'shoved her' and he 'got angry' and went and 'banged on the door' of another apartment before going back to his own.

Joshua Drew said to Johnny‚Äôs bodyguard something like, 'He beat the shit out of her again and you guys stood by and watched it'.
and he responded ‚Äúit's not his business, they are husband and wife‚Äù 

Depp texted he was going to ‚Äúsmack the ugly cunt around‚Äù

Ellen Barkin claims Depp threw a wine bottle across a hotel room during a fight with friends.

Depp man in Canada in the 80‚Äôs who asked a group of people to leave a party at a hotel and was arrested for threatening the people in London in 1999 threatened 

Johnny‚Äôs manager texted Amber Manager - ""When I told him he kicked you, he cried. It was disgusting. And he knows it.""

511,Ugz5yIZh4w88a0uVNG94AaABAg,"Thank you so much for shining a light over this. As a survivor of narcissistic abuse myself following the Depp/Heard case triggered me alot. Thankfully I am 4yrs divorced from my narc, and through self-education progressing steadily on the road to recovery. I could say so much about this video, but there isn't enough space. The one thing however is when you show the video of AM giving evidence in court. You will be familiar with the term her mask slipped. That slight smurk she gave when being cross examined reminded me of a time I had to call the police to my daughters pre-school because her mother, and daughters grandmother had turned up create a scene. When the police arrived. My narc ex wife was sitting in the car. I could see her whilst i stood there traumatised, talking with the police. She wasn't crying. Instead she was laughing. Not a humorous laugh. A deep dark evil one. Like AM, my ex narc wife are highly dysfunctional dark souls who will stop at nothing to destroy their victims.  

I appreciate you mentioning towards the end of your video about how AM plays the victim, using the gender card to her advantage. Abuse is abuse and it has no gender.  I would be interested to hear your opinion on what you think AM is? You mention BDP.... I would also add malignant NDP to that.

I wonder if I could ask for your analysis of why someone might not only lie, but change their story/version of an event repeatedly.  This situation with the door and Johnny in the bathroom and Amber trying to get in appears from this conversation, at the time to happen just as you describe it.  As you also describe, Amber turns the situation around, switching the roles in the questioning videoed here.  Yet, in the recent London court case, Amber changes the story completely.  Perhaps as so many questions were asked about Johnny Depp's drug taking, or for whatever reason, Amber now says it was indeed Depp who had locked himself in the bathroom, as he also says, but she says he didn't go to the bathroom to escape her, he went there and slept or passed out when he was on drugs and she was worried he'd choke on his own vomit, so the only reason she wanted to get into the room was to make sure he was still alive and ok.  She must know this is yet another, completely different version of events and it is a struggle for me to ascertain why she would do this.

Did you know, it is entirely HOPELESS for a person to change narcissism personality disorder?  Impossible, hopeless, leave them and never talk to them again advice!  And when you look at what makes a narcissist there is abuse, abandonment, and huge unwarranted praise.  How is a person so shot down plotting and scheming? My mom for instance has loads of these traits. She says messed up stuff, but to be advised to just cut her off is hurtful. Why is it ALWAYS suggested to walk away and never speak to that person? Is a narcissst never allowed human emotion? Wouldn‚Äôt human caring influence that person? What if a person suspects  NPD in themselves?  What a hopeless mess. There is Zero hope for someone that thinks this could be there problem, and that is sad. To be told there is zero hope for change.  How can you group people into such a hopeless corner? One thing I kept hearing is the NPD person plots to use you and belittle you.  My mom wasn‚Äôt plotting, she has a sick mind from loads of abuse and doing it all herself without Guidance. She made loads of mistakes, but she means well. Til that monkey jumps on her back. It never seems like she sat down and plotted how to ruin the day, or us. It just happened because she never had a real chance in life because of how her parents abused and neglected her.  Let her get molested..   any who.  It would be cool to see hope.

562,UgyBr34dqUh4tO6y1pZ4AaABAg,"I just goes on in a circle where the attacks are presented as something happening because he is not fighting them out. 

The truth is her rage has nothing to do with the couple. It is about her trying to escape from an unpleasant feeling of being abandoned, useless and confused about who she is. She is defined by her interaction and need to repeat patterns that make her feel defined and nurtured.

 The fights she has found cures the bad feeling and also gives her a moment to ventilate and soothe without applying much intelligence. The problem is she have no access to the cause of her feelings so intelligence will not even work.

She externalizes and gets the problem away from her and creates an image of her feelings being his fault not being ever present to ""help"" her. The help she has prescribed herself is rage and fights and entertainments that makes her feel appreciated and important. She needs him 100% of the time and with him available she can always make the feeling go away.

The problem is her self made therapy is hurting him and it destroys what they imagined was love.

The ""relationship"" the victim thinks they have, is the investment she initially made by being extraordinary affectionate and an unlimited resource to sex, drugs and rock & roll. She has made herself extremely delicious to him and when he responded she also became extremely satisfied. Now she had a relationship where he loved her and she could keep him using her attraction. She is also presenting him with simple problems he can solve for her and she rewards him when he returns the stick she has thrown.

The problem is once the relationship is secured the fun is changed to a psychodrama where she switches from sex to poking him with a screwdriver in the eye.

He starts to fear her and have to share more and more of her insanity and lifestyle where he tunes in to her madness by drinking when she drinks and be irresponsible and check out when she does.

What the victims drawn to the illness can not get their head around is the inability to reason and stear where it is going. The ill person is like a machine that can not be affected and has to run its dumb program to the end.

Because this is at the core of how a person is defined and is covering up for a trauma or serious development problem, there is not much you can do to change it. It is so integrated in the persona it can not be accessed by just talking.

The victims to abuse normally ends up with having to exit the disaster and heal on their own. The abuser is not useful in the healing and will not ""get it"" and confirm they harmed you or give the victim any recognition.

If they do admit anything that make the victim feel great in the aftermath, it is a narcissist speaking so it is just designed for a purpose and without true insight or compassion.

How they talk is conditioned by the illness that owns them and there is absolutely no way out that can replace what the illness require from them. If 1+2=5 is the answer the illness requires to obtain the next tranquilizing doze so be it.

The illness is like a heroine addiction. If you try to get off it you will feel terrible and have a near death experience.

To get hit with the door, he has to be on the opposite side of it from her‚Äîregardless of whether he was leaving or following her‚Äîso, if she was retreating from him and kicked the door into him (which I don't think she denies, as far as I'm aware...), she would have kicked it closed... Otherwise, SHE was following him. But if she kicked it closed, is she saying she then opened it again and punched him in the face WHILE retreating? lol, wtf..? 
Because even if she denies punching him, she FREELY admits to it on that tape and is trying to make these little excuses for herself about why it was basically ok for her to have done so; because she was ""angry and so it just _happened_ ."" Which absolutely no one does if they're just ""saying things"" to support the claims of an abuser. 
She'd have just said, yes, she punched him. That's right. You wouldn't give yourself an entire fake personality problem and then _excuse_ that problem to _seem_ like you're then protecting your own ego, but then with it all coming off like you're not necessarily even _aware_ that's what you're doing, just for a TAPE to clear an abuser on something...",Meladjusted,0,2020-08-06T06:55:56Z

With regards to whether she has a ‚Äòdiagnosis‚Äô of anything, I remember hearing the audio from the time that she threw a bottle at him and cut his finger tip off that the staff were talking about giving her ‚Äúmore seroquel‚Äù because she was hysterical (he had been taken to hospital at this point). Someone wanted to give her 50mg and someone else said that she was only prescribed 25mg. Seroquel is quetiapine I think, so it sounds like she must have been diagnosed with something; in the UK at least, you don‚Äôt tend to see people prescribed quetiapine without a good reason (however, I work in general medicine, not psych so take that observation with a pinch of salt!)

I'll look through your videos again but I really need advice on co-parenting with narcissists and dealing with stepchildren who are bound to the abusive parent!!! 
My husband who has narcissistic traits himself has a narcissistic/possibly sociopathic ex wife. They have a 9 year old son together. We went for custody 5-6 yrs ago due to neglect and abuse. And husband has kept communication with ex narc to a minimum which is great. However, my struggle is now dealing with the 9 year old that exhibits narcissistic personality traits as well. I know he's too young to diagnose but all the behavior is there. He's still very much loyal to his mother and she has expressed a dislike for me of course. He is not allowed to like me or have a relationship with me even though I was basically his mother since he was 2. My husband cannot understand my position. The frustration, the pain... I'm so over all the drama I've endured over the past 8 years I constantly consider divorce. We've been through years of counseling and I don't know if it could help the child. Mother couldn't care less about the child's mental health and Dad pretends to... He never follows the advice of therapists which leads to fights whenever the child is here (otherwise my husband and I get along!!). My husband doesn't understand why I don't want to be around either of them--especially the child as he is still verbally abusive towards me and treats me like a punching bag because he's mad at his mother. He acts as if I should ignore the abuse or downplays it... ""It's not that bad."" He avoids confrontation with both the child AND the ex... Interestingly he has no qualms fighting with me.
I don't want to tear up my family because of this. We have a child together too. I stay mainly because I fear what will happen to my daughter if I'm not there. I need some help!! I need the truth. Can it get better or should I cut my losses and get on with my life? All counselors act like they can't tell me what to do (and I get that) but I need someone to level with me and tell me what are my chances of us ever living a semi-normal life. I'd like to build a relationship with my stepchild also, is it possible? I stopped going out of my way for him since nothing I do is good enough and it doesn't matter anyway. This child is so delusional he has accused me of abusing him like his mom did... And giving her credit for things I have done which were all good. He makes us switch places.

I strongly support Depp, since this story broke, as I try to do my due dilligence anytime a story like this breaks - similarly sided with Aziz Ansari when news was revealed about him. I think people should form their own opinion before jumping on the #Metoo wagon; not like I am trying to downplay the movement, but it has both positives and negatives as do all movements. But going back to Amber, reading up on her past, one point stood out - I read she abused her previous spouse/girlfriend.... and she was arrested for it.... and yet, she posts a video about #Metoo and domestic violence... unbelievable. Makes me quite sick she is using a serious cause to push her agenda. Amber's credibility is very low, so you can make a fair assumption that she hasn't been abused here even though you rightly state 'we don't know'. The justice system will fail him and others, if Amber Heard gets away with only a slap on the wrists, or worse, if they end up believing her, over Depp.Thanks for the high quality video! p.s.

628,Ugy718TIggFYQqldm3B4AaABAg,"Narcissists know to play their cards with their victim in isolation with no witnesses. They fear groups and families as they are hard to safely manipulate.

What the play out when in public is how innocent and loving they are. They will not put on that intimate show when in private.

 Narcissists are uncomfortable with guilt or being at fault. They have a set of tools to confuse and stay out of trouble. 

One is anger and temper where the abused is careful not to go to far in the intimidation. They also know what is the core values of the victim and mocks him on what he is proud of and honour. They are also ""licenced to be incoherent"". Using twisted logic makes the victim engage as it seems easy to disprove, but when the victim engages it becomes more complicated than expected. It may take hours but no conclusion is reached.  They reward you if a subject is of interest and turn cold when it is not. The lack of empathy makes it hard for them to put themselves in your shoes. They rather see only their side and is not ashamed of the imbalance or them getting all the airtime.

The narcissist will not conclude anything or promise anything that leads to commitment or can be verified later. If they fail they will blame you or anything else anyway. The will just invent something to escape the bad feeling.

They are happy if you say you love them and you declare your commitment to them. They make you feel you are not trusted by them and they need to be consoled by you. What is actually true is you do not trust them but they manage to turn it around.

They can also withdraw , cancel or disturb something the victim holds valuable. Punishments are carefully selected and narcissists prefer ""punishes"" that at the same time relieve them from a promises or assignment. They are disappointed in you and you have to reassure them you are on board.

The toolbox is full of things to trick the victim and permit them to have gratification and service without a question of what they bring to the party.",Tore Forsgren,1,2020-08-06T00:18:54Z

AH is a great example of how a narcissist abuses, manipulates and gaslights their victim. She downplays the abuse and says to JD that no one will ever believe him. She even stole her former assistant's rape survival story (I admit, when I learned that, I felt physically ill).
Many people who are interested in the story are survivors ourselves, and although AH lied to everyone for personal gain and by doing so, caused harm to countless of women and survivors of all genders by making it harder for them to come forward and be believed (as if it wasn't hard enough already), the massive support that JD has received from the public warms my heart and the strength he showed during the trial is truly inspiring to me, and I hope to others as well.

639,UgybHdpQ_7DHJK2bCa94AaABAg,"An Icelandic perspective. My text ended a bit long but I looked over it and I think there interesting angles there. I break the text up in paragraphs so they are easier to read.

 As a teacher I have wittnessed the discourse on domestic violence opening up but mainly from the angle that men are more likely statistically to be more agressive than women and therefor the fighting back focus should be on the and leave out for awhile or forever the vice versa situation which is more common than political correct movements want to hear about. #MeeToo is exclusively for women. That is a fact.

There has generally been a witch hunt here in Iceland against men for many years and women express their unfiltered anger out (righly so). But it has been going on for so many years now and there are generations of boys here who have had to listen to how bad men are (plus all adjectives) and it has had had a visible impact on the self image of many good boys and men who look at themselves as in a negative and shameful way. Haven' t harmed a fly but have a quilty feeling over what men in the past did to women. 

One article after another over equality but hardly ever is the focus of the article men. It is only women and the equality discourse here has long ago been hijacked by the Right Opinion And Only Right Approach Groupver.We (who dont want to see a whole gender trodden down to elevate another) are now getting a word in here to make a strong objection and offer mores sensible arguments against the politically correct statement ""if you don't say? you are a feminist and support the #meetoo movent you support abuse against women"". 

It seems not enough to say you are a humanist and condemn all abuse in all direction. You have to proof it somehow select movements who have the judicial power at the moment. 

It is no loner enough for taechers like me to teach the kids respect across all spectrums of human live and things about love and sex, boundaries and concent. Now you have to sign the right petions from the right self chosen guardians of truth and approach. As if there is one way to approach things and have a sensible discourse. I mean a circle is 360 degrees and so many angles or approaches and opinions are to any topic. 

I you don't support our right approach you are against us. Only 2 choices.it went so far few years ago when they saw peodophiles in every corner here and went on a witch hunt to expose them. Because of a one potential threat. A suspicious man seen in front of one school. An isolated insident. Police cars lurking outside schools. My happy and talkative father, like me, chats to any living creature and really likes kids spirit and enjoys talking to them.He said I have totally stopped talking to children in the street. I am afraid he said that someone slanders or accuses me. 

I  am a teacher and my job is talking to children. One day I was talking to my students in front of the school at the end of the class and we walked together out of the building to the parking lot and kept chatting there. Kids around 10-12nd. The police officers watched us from the car with  scrutiny but I gave them an evil eye and they left. I knew what they were doing. Did they do it to female teachers?  I don't think so. I took my time to chat to them like everyday despite a mini-manhunt out there.But it left a bitter taste in my mouth. Sad fact: I chose carefully with which kids I talk, where and how. In many countries (I do it too) teachers have doors open to the class room or even have some colleague present so they can protect themselves against potential accusations of some kind. I once hugged a crying teenage girl but that was the first and last time.

Men are not part of the #meetoo movement and are highly targeted and dicriminated against when it gets to equal status in who is the victim or the abuser in volatile relationships. Quiet obvious is the bar of where women start to violate men's right set much higher than the other way around. I have wittnessed violence and abuse from women to men (male friends close to me) and they always get easier of the hook. 

 A famous comment comes from Jay Leo, a real story on his show and there are newspaper articles to be found on it on the net. There he says that his mother regularly beat him with a steak pan and everyone in the audince laught. I thougt what if the title was reversed saying  ""a father beats his daughter regurlarly with an metal object""? Would you laugh? Both episode and article on the net. It is as if boys pain and tolerance level is higher than girls. 

Sexual abuse of women is now in the limelight a lot (rightly so) It it is my personal opinion that boys have had to endure way more physical violence in their upbringing generally than girls (excluded sexual abuse) mostly from their moms. Keep in mind few decades ago and still in some countries fathers worked out of the house all day but the women took care of the house, upbringing and the discipline and.handled their boys much harder then the girls. This is my personal experience and some of my friends. 

This has canged through the years where in most parents now work both out of the home and share chores more. 

The cases (like Depp vs Heard) where mostly a woman accuses a man of a sexual or other abuse and it is a word against word and little proof are tricky and on the rise. But in that case although Depp loved the bottle a bit too.much and slammed cupboard doors it is obvious that she fabricates and improvises on the fly and has no evidence herself but there are a lot of lies from her that have been exposed to be false and the audio exposes how abusive she is. It is so important that Johnny wins either the Sun defamation case or the civil case against her I think next year. It can't just be enough to say somone has beaten you for years; you never report it and none saw any marks on you, neither police, health professionals or staff at the Late Late show.

It is important that Depp wins at least a moral victory for all equal living people. One accusation, true or false can destroy peoples carrers, reputation and any remark put out on the web will stay there for the coming future. More men would share their stories in the #meetoo movement if it weren't so seclusively for women.

I know of so many indecent behaviour on part of women just from my ring of friends, myself and my society. A side note; take a look at the Danish film Jagten which is on what an serious accusation can do with your life and reputation. A classic in Scandinavia for many years and a brave movie from the cast.

He had literally lost his mother and discovered he had money stolen and then Amber decided to leave him?  All at the same time... it seemed off to me.  Also considering he had a long-term relationship with the mother of his children and there was never any allegations towards that. Usually abusers have a history of abusing people and Johnny Depp had none. And then when the allegations came forward about Amber Heard and people did a background on her and they discovered that in the past that she had domestic violence charges against her and a former lover. So she has that in her past.  Thankfully these recordings prove that Johnny Depp was not the abuser. I really hope that he is able to clear his name and to restore his career.

Thanks for posting this, people need to see the inequity that exists, where there is some sort of belief that women cannot be abusers and men cannot be abused against.
Like most things there is a 50/50 split but the inequity here is that for numerous reasons abuse against men is not seen as actual abuse, you articulate this really well in the video and I like you cannot understand why in this day and age where people become offended by the smallest thing that this utter biased, immoral, unjustifiable and contemptible status quo continues to be perpetrated by people in the media, social services and even the judiciary.

Just quickly, as someone who grew up with an incredibly violent father and I'd often sit up all night at the top of the stairs so I could listen out for mums screams n run down and get in the middle of them screaming to dad to get off her. We'd then lock ourselves in the bathroom while I cleaned her blood up and we sobbed together, then I'd fall asleep at primary school bcz I'd been awake all night. I then went on to be in incredibly violent relationships of my own having my jaw broken several times, shattered eye sockets, fractured fingers trying to protect my face, and I wouldn't dare speak to my bf the way in which Amber does to JD. She has ultimate confidence in her safety around him while they're discussing. I'm sure that may have changed when they were both intoxicated and maybe JD after hours of harassment retaliated at times but i can tell that was actually her goal so she could illicet sympathy and guilt from him.

It also sounds like she thinks women can hit men and the only thing she's truly shocked about is that he's not putting up with it and defending himself loudly and by hitting things.

696,UgxPq0VeZGg4w1s6HSZ4AaABAg,"This was such a great video! I think many men will be so relieved and touched by some of the things you said in your opinion segment. It's great that you mentioned how Amber is using a very sensitive issue as another tool with which to abuse Johnny. I really hate how she's purposefully done that.
My father has acted aggressively, much like Johnny in the previous video, but in his case it was intentionally meant to intimidate my mom and me. And, especially in my case, it certainly had the desired effect. So I tend to initially have a default bias in favour of the woman in these situations, as I'm sure so many of us do. 
But from the moment I heard those initial recordings that came out, I started to feel very differently about this situation. Even then it was a little hectic seeing Johnny's behaviour in the previous video. It's horrible to think of Amber exploiting people's triggers to actually perpetuate abuse. Completely poisonous, like you said.
On an unrelated note, the way you spoke to the mosquitoes at the end was so cute! I can't wait to rewatch this with my boyfriend (as I often do) and see his reaction to that. He's from America and he always comments on your equally cute ""Hello!"" intros  ^_^",Cygnelle,3,2020-08-05T21:05:41Z

746,Ugz4duJJOqIIRstd6Tx4AaABAg,"Abusive women like Amber Heard rely on everyday people not believing the male victim. They also say look at the size of the man compared with me. However, the size of the targeted male victim is irrelevant. Amber is slim-built but can lash out, punch and use objects to hit her victim in the same way that Jordan Worth (first female convicted of coercive control in England), who is slim and half the size of Amber, was able to inflict severe injuries on her male partner, knowing that he would not fight back or defend himself.

It never occured to me that someone might construe such a vicious net of lies, not even after I went through a divorce with a narcissist (the perpetrator painting himself as a victim indeed!) Then I noticed the matter was going to the court, and one of the first videos I watched was Amber's court deposition. I had known next to nothing about her prior, and seeing her behaviour was a true shock. It made me realize two things: that she is deeply disturbed, and that she cannot be trusted a single word. I dug into the details afterwards to see the whole picture but everything simply confirmed that impression from the deposition video. I am very sorry for Johnny, and though I am rather abhorred by Amber, I can't help and feel sorry for her, too. I know now why my ex is the way he is, and I wonder what happened that this beautiful rich young woman is so terribly damaged.

Although I don't like to concern myself with celebrities, the sad reality that was Depp and Heard's relationship really exemplifies so many of the obvious hallmarks of abuse that can be so subtle for the one on the receiving end. Time and time again I have heard myself unconsciously in my head excuse Heard's behaviour (e.g. saying 'well he must have been really difficult too'), only to realise when I become conscious of that voice that it is a consequence of my own warped beliefs after having suffered abuse myself. In their case they were married and divorce was sensible. But what if that's your family member? I would really appreciate your insight on how to deal with such abuse within families. What if that's your parent? What if that's your sibling? Is it ever possible to rebuild those relationships?

770,Ugyv-DkLdYSwDdK6IyJ4AaABAg,"One thing I was thinking about with this case is just how bad victim blaming is for men. I knew it was a big problem for women but I think it's much worse for men actually. The things I've heard people say about Johnny would be called out as victim blaming immediately if the genders were reversed but they never are in this case. Such as what you were saying where people chalk it up to both of them being toxic. If it were him hitting her they wouldn't say that about Heard but they will say that about Depp. 
Why does he have to prove he never hit her even once? He admits to pushing her to get away, he admits to throwing something at her once, we don't get the context of it because Amber cuts it off but I get the sense that she did that because her own behavior was so outrageous and if his had been really terrible in that moment she would have said. But we've seen her own behavior is extremely aggressive. She put a cigarette out on his face and severed the end of his finger. That happened one month into their marriage. Doesn't a man have a right to defend themselves, do what they can to get away? I don't think it's right to keep saying there could have been one time one day he was wrong. It doesn't matter. Same as it wouldn't if the genders were switched.

790,UgyJINKHmwvaXeJjQX94AaABAg,"Her assistant testified that when they began dating Amber wouldn't tell her who she was seeing only saying he was a 'fat old man'. Something she also called him during their marriage. I actually think she was angry when he left because she wanted him to loose control and hit her. After they were getting a divorce and she had said something to the press about being abused he's trying to get her to walk that back so he doesn't have to sue and she mocks him and says, 'who would believe I'd been doctoring photos all this evidence for years, time stamped and everything to blackmail you with later.' Something to that effect and I felt it was one of those truthful moments where a narcissist out themselves, because it is such a crazy story who would believe it, who would even think of it. I think that's exactly what she was doing. It seems crazy but sometimes a sociopath will marry someone to murder them and take their money. How about murder their reputation and take their money and any attention they can from it. I don't think she ever loved him. I'll point you to his friend Doug Stanhope for backup. I think she wanted this from the beginning. 
The stuff about his mother, during the year of abuse she was slowly dying over 6 months, she filled for divorce from him two days after his mother died. Yes his managers had stolen hundreds of millions of dollars AND hadn't been paying his taxes so he OWED a hundred million dollars, even if you are Johnny Depp you don't have that laying around. I feel so badly for him and I hope he wins. There's so much testimony over and over from friends former partners and decade long employees about what a nice person he is. I hope he has justice and healing. He's a great artist and musician, man I'm in love with him now, how was she not. 
I adore Audrey Hepburn and read everything about her, she like Johnny, was someone no one who'd met them could say anything bad about them. She was beautiful and elegant. A dream woman. He's many woman's dream man. Audrey was cheated on by both her husband's. These sort of things happen to everyone. It's not about you. You can't blame yourself. Anyone can be treated badly by their partners and it's not because you weren't enough. There was something wrong with them.",Mellon Lord,56,2020-08-05T18:47:30Z

793,UgzLOaUVDE5wwC-bSOl4AaABAg,"Sounds like Heard is the type of woman who keeps pushing verbally and/or physically until she gets a physical (over)reaction that she can then sit back and say, ‚ÄúSee? *YOU* are abusive.‚Äù When your partner tries to leave the room, _it is to protect the other person as well as themselves._ He knows himself well enough that if he doesn‚Äôt want to get to the point where he loses his temper in the heat of the moment and does something he will regret later on, he has to remove himself from the immediate environment. That‚Äôs trying to cool down or no longer escalate. That‚Äôs adult behavior. Heard following him is poking a bear, to put it bluntly. It‚Äôs infantile. 

Obviously, I don‚Äôt want to paint Depp as some sort of complete angel, but I really do feel sorry for him that he didn‚Äôt see what looks like a toxic partner earlier on and never married her in the first place.

821,Ugw_kDbF1XMLHhLUT9h4AaABAg,"Wow, she seems deeply evil. It's kind of horrifying just how many people are like this. I've been around and been abused/attacked/etc. by so many of these narcissistic (and sometimes sociopathic, I think) people, it's just scary how many people are this way. Very unnerving to me.",zzevonplant,259,2020-08-05T18:13:42Z

826,UgyXfCgigl8eC9dk2tx4AaABAg,so many things she does and says during these recordings are not the actions of someone who is being abused by the person she is talking to or acting towards. I have been in two particularly violent and manipulative relationships and alot of the things she's says to Johnny I could NEVER have seen myself saying to them. At all. The way she acts during the recordings is not that of someone who is scared of him. Yes everyone acts differently but there is usually a spectrum of behaviour that people experience in these situations and how she is behaving is quite the opposite in my opinion.,Amy üåô,57,2020-08-05T18:06:30Z
