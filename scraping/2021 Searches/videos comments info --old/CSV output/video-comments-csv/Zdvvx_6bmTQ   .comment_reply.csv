I wouldn‚Äôt doubt that one bit, from what it seems she was planning this all out from the beginning. It reminds me of what Johnny said to her at the end of the second tape: ‚ÄúI've loved you for so many f**king years but you know what? You didn't exist. You don't exist. You're not there. You're a f**king made up thing in my head, and I can't believe you're doing this to me.‚Äù
It‚Äôs almost like it finally clicked with him right then and there that she was nothing but a fake. All that poor man wanted was true love, and she pretended to be everything he wanted. It wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if she never really gave one solitary fuck about him.",2020-02-09T01:34:39Z,6

It's just that we don't listen
And if we even listen, we pay no heed to it

Infact people have been pointing things out a lot

Incredibly average, the original maker of the tapes shown here and Autumn on venus, have been voicing their legit concern since past two years.

Autumn focused on the tells of the abuser and pointed how actually Abner is the abuser

And Incredibly showed all the proofs, even though, at times it felt like a conspiracy channel. But I have to say that he was one conspiracy that turned out true.",2020-02-08T02:08:39Z,6

221,Ugw0bdTBeW-MgVzNj5F4AaABAg,D Mac,Thats honestly the most sensible thing. I think the pendulum was on 1 side too far against women and now w the current media stance it swings too far the opposite direction. Me too becomes believe women. When honestly it should be a case where we treat accusations seriously and investigate them without bias towards either side. The thing w following 1 narrative as a default is that it will often make you look like a hypocrite at times.  Thats why I fuck w Ti's channel. Whether you agree or disagree no one can say she isnt consistent. She is always for getting infornation and getting to the bottom of a story. Big up to Ti,2020-02-08T02:49:32Z,2

None of that would be necessary if that essential first step is taught. However, men have indeed been vocal about it at police stations and laughed away because a girl hit them. Just like she said in the tape, you're such a baby, you'll be alright. People literally think that about men that report it.",2020-02-08T00:56:15Z,21
