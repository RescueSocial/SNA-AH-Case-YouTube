1,Ugwcb0p_ALLh4ZceMeV4AaABAg,"🍃🦋I DO NOT HATE AMBER HEARD, JUST PISSED OFF AT HER FOR LYING TO OUR FINEST LAPD, COURT SYSTEM, LAWYERS, HER FAMILY AND THE REAL VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE.  MAY GOD HAVE MERCY ON HER, FOR DESTROYING 40 YEARS OF JOHNNY DEPP'S AMAZING ACTING CAREER.🦋🍃

2,Ugwj12tmyKVIg9GBacJ4AaABAg,"THESE ARE VERY OLD PHOTOS OF HERSELF... SHE HAS MENTAL ISDUES.. NARCISSIS.. I DOUBT SHE WILL BE IN AQUAMAN 2, SINCE SHE WILL BE IN JAIL. PROBABLY ELON MUSKRAT WILL PAY HER FINES!
I AIN'T WATCHING IT... KEEP IN MIND WU THE DIRECTOR HAS BEEN SEEN WITH ELON MUSKRAT, SO MAYBE HE INVESTED 2M WITH DISNEY INC. FOR AMBER'S RETURN.
ALSO KERP YOUR EYE ON VIN DIESEL, WORD ON THE STREET, IS THIS BALD FOOL WANT AMBER HEARD IN THE NEXT FAST AND THE FURIOUS MOVIE!   HECK NO!
SCRATCH THIS MOVIE OFF AS WELL.",Elizabeth Torres,1,2021-06-24T02:22:01Z
3,Ugw5y47G9AQfMxfrDgF4AaABAg,"Honestly no one really knows......that's the problem.....like we have a bunch of teasers such as her own written note! ( Benefit of a doubt maybe a female flower delivery person I dunno but alot of the lettering actually matches up to her 2016's police report for a car accident? Or some document I saw on Twitter, fact or not no clue! 
IF AMBER NUT TURD AIN'T IN IT!  hell yah I'm down! I'd probably murder for a premiere ticket if Amelia Clark is in it and that's FACT! ( PLZ COME BAIL ME OUT OF JAIL...... if she's in it and I kill someone for a premiere ticket JK JK JK ) but uh then again I'm kinda spilt; like whoever is actually in the movie I don't honestly am 100% confident if I'd even really see it because I want WB to actually realize like oh damn.....like maybe everyone was right while johnny lost all his roles she didn't....talk about UNJUST! Like they all jumped the frickin gun; he wasn't sueing Amber Turd that's in VA.....that case he lost was against the newspaper......the sun amber turd was only a witness and nothing more!
So I'm honestly split!!! Like to see it if Amelia Clark is in it or still force WB to suffer from the hit because you can't ALWAYS believe a woman! Men can get ABUSED too.
So that's where I stand like I'm confuzzled and I'm angry because I really do like Jason and Amelia's chemistry they have; they worked together they know each other and yah know I would like that but I also don't wanna give WB the satisfaction that they can kick innocent people off before hearing all of the truth! Like damn man JD really needed those movies to keep himself busy and frankly SAFE from insane psycho AMBER NUT TURD! 
since he's been booted he's gone like radio quite...not a peep on IG no Twitter obviously....but uh yeah poor guy is just hiding until this all over and his name's is rightfully CLEARED! 
I guess that's where I stand....I'm 50-50 Amelia Clark...or stuck to my guns and teach WB a lesson! I'm actually shockingly am leaning towards teaching WB a lesson!",Trinity Haasenritter,0,2021-06-23T18:16:35Z

88,UgxkclZpy5a5qgLkaJJ4AaABAg,"<ehacker you're romanian...elizabeth now she’s being called out for using racial slurs. As you may know, the 31 year-old doesn’t use social media, ironically after deleting her Instagram account last year when Marvel fans began spamming all of her previous posts to criticize her for not paying tribute to co-star Chadwick Boseman quickly enough following his death, which is simply madness. The latest backlash, though, stems from Olsen describing Wanda Maximoff as a gypsy, which has been deemed offensive to those of Romani origin. She previously used the term in a 2015 interview with talk show host Graham Norton, who told her it’s a phrase she shouldn’t be using. Apparently, though, the actress has made another slip of the tongue, with social media users rounding on her in double quick time,>",mose jon,1,2021-06-16T13:21:53Z

94,Ugwirqwf1b2xz-lKGqR4AaABAg,"You *KNOW* that if AH was confirmed in the film... she would be shouting it from the rooftops, and posting pictures constantly!  Posting all these old pictures from ""Aquaman"" and ""Justice League"" is strange.  Some of the large sets are built in the UK, and some are built in Australia, and of course, the beautiful beaches that they film on are located in Australia's Gold Coast, but they filmed in Italy as well.  AH should be worried that Australia *WILL* grant her visa, and then will arrest her when she is filming there.  There is a far more critical concern for her, and that is cast insurance.  Robert Downey Jr. was no longer insurable after his problems with substances and the law, and Mel Gibson literally stepped in and personally covered the insurance for ""The Singing Detective"", which turned RDJ's career around.  Lindsey Lohan is uninsurable. Cast insurance will be exceptionally expensive for AH, as she is in the middle of serious ongoing litigation, *AND* is under felony investigation in two countries... *IF* she can even *BE* insured.  She could be months into shooting when criminal charges could brought against her, or the subornation of perjury/perjury charges could be levied by Australia or the United States... which would mean that ""Aquaman 2"" would have to go to the expense of reshooting her role -- and would have to deal with the bad publicity.  That's only *SOME* of the many things a studio has to take into account when considering AH.  

There is no denying that AH has been out of the information loop for at least a year.  In 2020, Mr. Depp's team made direct reference in court documents to the ""Aquaman 2"" shoot beginning in June, while AH's team were still stating the film would begin shooting in the Spring.  AH would *HAVE* to be in serious training right now, but even her last Tweet with the picture of Jason Momoa isn't current.  He's promoting ""See"" right now, and is sporting a much longer beard than he has in the picture with AH.  Something's up!  If things are looking unfavorable, even Elon Musk stepping up to pay her insurance wouldn't secure her the role.  She may be too much of a liability for the studio.  We can hope!",NIBS,9,2021-06-16T13:10:36Z

96,UgxSYom65twd_IlEg_R4AaABAg,SO many cowards.....just fire her or refuse to work with her lying abusive ass.   Terd is forgettable and replaceable....and easily discarded.  SO many talented and deserving actors out there who would play a way better Mera and look better doing it.  But the director wants us to watch a soulless sea witch who is unrelatable and could not act her way out of a paper bag.   Momoa should be afraid of being left alone with her at anytime.  Ugh humans... you would think people would realize that Terd is not a role model for anyone and deserves no public platform to preach her delusions.,Ruby Sultra,1,2021-06-16T13:08:24Z
97,UgxgbhmkhL369EPz0Od4AaABAg,"Hopefully, she’s not because I’m a fan of Aquaman & I’m a DC fan (& a Marvel fan, too). Her character could easily be removed & the film would be better for it. As it stands now, I’m worried that she might still be involved. 

If she is, I’m not gonna watch it, support it or buy any merchandise for it because not only am I a fan of DC, I’m also a fan of Johnny Depp & she did him beyond dirty. If Princess Mierda was replaced by Emilia Clarke, I would watch the daylights out of it! That would be the perfect choice to replace her & I’m sure that everyone could get behind that. For us to see Khal Drogo & Daenerys Targaryen reunited would be a dream come true 😍",Akasha Eyre,2,2021-06-16T13:00:05Z

Meanwhile, we also should consider her role helping JD's case and making her counter claim essentially non-existent.
