25,Ugyo_5ucwML5Yge8Mrp4AaABAg,Rob Mills,"Well, that's another debate for another time. I certainly don't disagree that her behaviour was appalling. Let the law deal with it as best it may, that's why we have laws.

My take. What we should be doing is supporting those we want to prosper, not dogpiling on those we want to destroy. As Bill Burr said recently, 'just be an individual and buy tickets to people you like.'  When Gina and Johnny release their new movies, go see them. Vote with your green.

26,Ugyo_5ucwML5Yge8Mrp4AaABAg,Geralt of Rivia,"@Rob Mills except the law is incredibly biased in favor of women when it comes to domestic abuse thanks to feminists. We've already seen the law in action in the defamation lawsuit. There is video and photographic evidence of Heard's abuse of Depp, like his finger being nearly severed and the recording of her literally saying no one will believe he is an abuse victim because he's a man. If the evidence is that clear, it's not cancel culture. Just like with Cuties, underage girls were put in revealing outfits and made to do sexual and provocative poses.",2021-03-01T14:10:45Z,6
27,Ugyo_5ucwML5Yge8Mrp4AaABAg,Rob Mills,"That's fine. If she has broken the law, then let her be charged and convicted and then we can all declare that she's a nasty piece of work. No problem. And Warner can hire and fire who they like, that's their business. But hounding Heard on social media, making petitions to get her canned, and taking pleasure in her firing, is plain wrong. It's mob justice, cancel culture, textbook.

To be clear I'm not defending Heard. Having checked her filmography I've only seen her in two movies, Justice League, which she was barely in, and Machete Kills, a movie I'd hoped to forget. If she has broken the law let the law deal with her. We aren't going to win this culture war by stooping to the level of the woke left, and we aren't going to get rid of cancel culture if we employ its tactics when we think it is justified.",2021-03-01T13:21:30Z,1
