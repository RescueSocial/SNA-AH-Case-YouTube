Clearly you didn't read any court documents or evidence. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è And it has been documented why the outcome was ridiculous by actual lawyers as the judge is now a laughingstock for ignoring evidence, being biased, having a conflict of interest, etc. He also found Depp guilty based on likelihood of events taking place because Depp accidentally headbutted Heard ONCE. Which was her verbiage which makes me think she was trying to headbutt him. It actually had no forceful intention on his side, but he used her verbiage. So it was actually an accidental collision of heads as he tried to get away from her hitting him. She recently tweeted something about fighting or hurting an abuser when trying to get away..ah.. the irony. Even despite that, the judge also said Heard made up at least 2 events.. which if she made up 2.. ü§î Everyone agrees they argued.. but all but Amber and her friends say she starts them and he tries to leave before she makes it physical, which all physical aspect is on her part. She even says this in the audio. The audio that was disregarded because according to the judge people are more likely to tell the truth under oath in court than in their own personal lives when things aren't on the line..  So according to him, no one ever commits perjury. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è That's why he's a laughingstock. The idea that one does not use audio at trial. Smh.

All Amber has ever had as ""evidence"" is her own word, unsent emails and diary pages lmao, and her word has already been proven UNCREDIBLE with the amount of times she's lied on oath; whereas Johnny had multiple medical records from the time she severed his finger, causing him to contract MRSA twice, a host of unrelated witnesses, and of course her admitting to abusing him all through the tapes and then acting like the victim. 

You claim to know so much about domestic violence and narcissistic personality disorder, when you're actively supporting someone who was previously arrested for domestically abusing her ex girlfriend. Have you also noticed that all Johnny's witnesses are unrelated to him whereas Amber's only witnesses are her inner circle? How's that for reliability? Get a grip for god sake.
