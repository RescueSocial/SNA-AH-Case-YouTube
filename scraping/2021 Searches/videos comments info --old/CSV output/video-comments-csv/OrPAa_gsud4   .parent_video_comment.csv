112,UgxsR17V61TBWnFbrax4AaABAg,"My wife has thrown things at me and struck me too. It's funny how people have this idea that men are the only ones who can get crazy or violent. She KNOWS I can't hit her back - I'm nearly a foot taller than her, outweigh her by a good 60 lbs and am probably 4 times her strength (literally - I do one-hand overhead presses with 100 lb dumbbells and she tried and failed to get a 25 lb weight over her head with her stronger arm, so I think that is actually a fair statement to make in this case), so it's pretty obvious WHY I shouldn't and cannot - and that emboldens her at times, I think. If I hit her back, even holding back, I could accidentally do a lot of damage or put her life in danger if I really hauled off and punched her or something. She KNOWS that. Women KNOW that. And they take ADVANTAGE of that. They think the fact that we're bigger and stronger than them means we should just shut up and take anything they throw at us without lifting a finger. And in the six years we've been together I have NEVER raised a finger to her, so I suppose they're right about that - for most guys anyway who are not wife beaters. 

I also chose to overlook my wife's own actions because I realize that she can't really hurt my by slapping at me or punching at my chest. It's like a child hitting me. It doesn't make it RIGHT, but I think she also knows better than to REALLY try to hurt me, too. She was frustrated and I probably did piss her off a lot in those scenarios, so I am willing to partially accept that I caused that to happen and I LET it happen because, let's face it, I have the strength to hold her down and prevent her from trying to hit me if I want to - even if I don't hit her, I could RESTRAIN her if I chose to. But I didn't. Because I felt that would ALSO be an abuse of having that physical advantage over her. 

Now, if I were a little 5'9"" guy, coming in soaking wet at 150 lbs and my wife was some 6 foot amazon of a woman, THEN maybe I could see some justification in knocking her silly if she was striking me. MAYBE. But we all know how SOCIETY would see that, don't we? Even if the man is weaker and smaller than the woman, SHE'S the victim. Anyone see how SICK that is? How sick this whole me too manhunt is? What it has done is embolden all the batshit crazy women out there who feel NOTHING about lying about a man and destroying his entire career, and worse, his relationship with his friends and family and his legacy as a man and a human being. 

THAT is one of the most vile, despicable things you could do to a person - even if they DID wrong you, to destroy their very mortal legacy so that their children and grandchildren not look at him as anything but a monster after he's gone - that THAT is his legacy in the world after he dies - because a woman got mad one day and decided to destroy everything he is JUST BECAUSE SHE CAN....yeah, women can be absolute vile, evil pieces of shit. I'm telling you this. There are WONDERFUL, sweet, amazing women out there who I'd support to the end of time - but there are some really wretched pieces of FILTH out there worse than any one man who got mad one day and slapped someone who may or may not have deserved it. And let's face it. SOmetimes, ladies? SOMETIMES....SOME.TIMES. You DO kind of deserve to get full-on punched in the face by a man so you can understand how much we DO hold back with you. If you're attacking a man and taking advantage of his unwillingness to hurt you, yeah, you kind of deserve to get laid out cold.

264,UgwWbCotFFWSpnitNZZ4AaABAg,"The idea that we must, or specifically, the police must believe women, or believe children, is not right nor just. What it SHOULD BE, and MUST BE, is that we, or specifically the Police, is that they should 'take ANY charge seriously' and not brush them off as once happened years ago. If anyone, man or woman, brings a charge of abuse (be it emotional control, physical abuse, or sexual abuse/rape), then the police need to, have to, should, must take the charge seriously. Same if a child (under the age of consent, etc) brings such a charge.
Then the police needs to investigate - BOTH SIDES! To make sure that what they have been told is true, to interview and investigate the accused and the accuser. The Justice System is in place to defend the rights of the Innocent, and so often these days, both here in the UK and elsewhere, the idea has become that it is better for an innocent person to be found guilty, than for a guilty one to escape justice. This is not what the justice system was put into place to do. We need to be more careful. We need to - NEED TO - take ALL charges seriously. For God's sake, we need to support and help those who HAVE been abused. But we cannot and should NOT be going down the line of ""Don't worry, we believe you"" and making snap decisions. Too often someone with a beef against someone else has ruined people's lives for no reason. There have been numerous cases of legal children (under 18s or under 16) ruining the lives of teachers simply because they got failed in a class. There have been numerous cases of ex-partners/ex-wives ruining the lives of others simply as they were ""offended"" by being dumped or divorced.
Yes, many MORE cases where the charges were true, that is not in dispute. But we CANNOT sit back and let innocent people have their lives shattered without doing due diligence to make sure they are in fact guilty first: there has to be something to answer, and the one bringing the charge has to KNOW that they will be investigated themselves.

I say ""self proclaimed"" because frankly, if youre refusing to remove an obvious sociopath with violent tendencies and no shame JUST because its a woman - youre not anti abuse, youre anti men, specifically. You dont give a single crap about the violence victims if you allow such an atrocious human being represent and speak for you, as well as lie like second breath about her experiences ... because shes female. Fucks sake. Also still waiting on mainstream media to start talking about this the same way they talk about it when its an alleged male abuser. They seem to be slowly getting there now at least (thanks to the fandom and non main streamers pushing it like no tomorrow - WHICH IS GREAT because if thats what it takes to get attention to this issue then thats what must be done).

Ive actually dated someone like this crazy bitch before, except he didnt shit the bed (what the hell even?!), but narcissistic sociopath, textbook example. Scary shit. My heart goes out to Johnny for having to put up with that, you really need nerves of steel, as well as the ability to just disengage mentally from people like that because they will try everything to wreck you and pull you under. Before during after, doenst matter. Im glad hes got actual evidence, witnesses etc to bury her in court. She bloody deserves it. She and anyone else pointing fingers and lying about these things, its fucking vile.

I hope shes behind bars for 3 years. Maybe they can get her into some psychotherapy and figure out what the fucks wrong with her. If its a mental or personality disorder,  you can treat one but the other... not so much, and she'll likely do this again once out. 

Metoo movement wouldnt be taking any damage from this if the moment the tapes surfaced, theyd point the finger at her and tell her shes fucking nuts and needs to stop crying wolf. Instead they chose to remain silent and continue on supporting her bs claims. Reap what you sow I say. Maybe this will launch a real change in how the west is currently handling accusations (I have personally witnessed this shit and it needs to STOP. It ruins lives and makes it harder for REAL victims to be taken seriously and get some actual justice).

414,Ugw0Cw6l58D2Xf7a-UB4AaABAg,"Years ago I returned from work to hear the hysterical screaming of my friend and neighbour's  4 and 7 year old daughters. I ran into the house to find her boyfriend, a bodybuilder, kicking my bloodied friend in the face. When he saw me I was terrified but he just left. My friend suffered two broken eye sockets, a broken nose, a ruptured spleen, two lost teeth and a multiplicity of other wounds. When interviewed by police her 4 year old said he started hitting her when the opening theme tune for Neighbours started and ended when I arrived as the closing theme played 23 minutes later. When he was arrested and the case was made public two women who had been in a relationship with him came forward to say the same thing had happened to them. Aside from the physical injuries requiring extensive reconstructive surgery my friend was so traumatised that for months she came to my house for me to accompany her to the local shop. It is strange that none of Depp's former partners have attested to his violence. Kate Moss has said he drank too much and his former wife and mother of his children has said that for all his faults violence was not one of them.

So in any given situation, knowing nothing more about the parties involved, it's appropriate to take the claims of the alleged victim as having enough merit to warrant looking into them further. But its precisely because false claims are so rare that they cause so much damage--the victim of the false claim, and actual victims of actual abuse, of course, but also other people who initially stand by and lend their support to the false claimant.  They feel foolish and will be much more guarded in the future, much less likely to advocate for an alleged victim.

Countless men are tired of us being hit and abused by women, yet we are unable to do anything. Even if we call the police all the cops going to do is lock us up for false statements.

Now people can ignore me but you might want to start staying away from these drama and performing arts geeks they might've what created these situations saying we have hit and abused a woman and they use our acting methods to practice crying on que as a weapon. trust me I can be safe that's why women in my town hate me because I can cry at a moment notice because of those exercises. so they learned to fear male actors because we are taught to know the game and better counter act it using another acting method. That's why the average man falls so easily because they refusing to go after the men in the drama department who haven't been corrupted into their little fold.

Metoo was an abomination to democracy and our Constitution.  Criminal charges should have been launched early and often for the fraud committed by this organization and its founders.  Because Metoo was a direct violation of due process.  Innocent until proven guilty is not just words.  If someone chooses not to patronize  someone who has displayed morality which does not agree with their own, that is one thing.  If there is evidence.  But to organize people to boycott people without a shred of evidence is disgusting.  With Amber Heard, we heard actual evidence for ourselves.   With Ezra Miller, we saw actual evidence for ourselves.   And at least some of us analyzed that evidence before drawing a conclusion (I know I reviewed the video and clip of both in slow motion, repeated times).  And followed the subsequent information coming out.  I think their behavior is despicable,  and likely will not support their products.  But as always, I reserve final judgment regarding that until I know all I can.  I do feel bad for the others that, through no fault of their own, may be hurt.  But I am tired of the false morality and hypocrisy, not to mention completely faulty products we are getting from Hollywood.   And if they do not stop producing terrible shows, I will not watch them.

But involving this, this is too much of a wet dream to come true.
 Amber is a rich and attractive woman, and in the city courts of California, they will let any female off of any crime.

 Case in point, Amber Gyger, the female police officer that murdered an innocent  black man in his own apartment is only serving 10 years in prison instead of life/ death penalty. Casey Anthony, the bitch that murdered her own kids in her bath tub didn't serve a single day in jail. There's not a snowball's chance in h*** that she will get punished.   Granted, Johnny Depp has not only dozens of witnesses through his body guards, but also tens of hundreds of surveillance cameras that will make the judge and jury face the fact that she is the aggressor. The slap on the wrist  will be that she gets black listed from Hollywood and that is like pulling a wishbone on that.  

Even if any judge were to punish her with any terms of jail, that judge will be quickly disbarred from his job. Why? Because the city officials cater to the voters, the majority voters that are primarily female. This broken system will not punish those that are a the opposite sex ,  because they see that it will hurt their job.
