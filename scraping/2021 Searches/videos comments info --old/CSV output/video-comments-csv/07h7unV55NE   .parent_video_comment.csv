Fox News‚Äôs defence was that a  ‚Äúreasonable viewer‚Äù would not accept such claims as fact because of the tenor of Carlson‚Äôs show. And a judge agreed, dismissing the case. -- fox news is being sued for defamation. Thank you for all you do :)",Tj.. a work in progress,0,2021-03-30T18:20:34Z

Are they so profoundly biased as to be unable to even think outside their box and  prejudice? Are they structurally incapable, fooling themselves,  or unwilling?

She has now produced this ""10 year donation pledge"" signed by the ACLU which is trying to say that she never said the money would be donated at the time but over a period of 10 years. Come Geek Some has covered this and he says that the heading on the notepaper is incorrect. I think it has the new logo of ACLU on or something and not the one that would have been there had this been done at the time. He reckons that she panicked and got them to write this about a year ago. Even if she is now saying this, this still contradicts with her saying that the  money HAD BEEN donated. Past tense. She didn't say that it had been pledged. She said it had been donated. Luckily the children's hospital has not produced such a document so it still holds that she pledged to donate and didn't.",Shwee Franglais,1,2021-03-24T10:02:18Z

She also bounced these documents and arguments between the Court in Virginia and the Court in California. Johnny's team took close to 2 years getting this evidence because she was actively trying to prevent the discovery.

47,UgzPwSrMqFMmQh1R0FF4AaABAg,"I got a bad feeling about it. The qc was a bit flustered and uncharismatic and from what I can remember his response to the ‚Äúso what if shes an abuser too‚Äù question was nowhere near as robust and persuasive as how you put it. The court system is under strain, a retrial would take up time and resources, and they are probably all secretly thinking ‚Äúmeh, with 14  allegations he probably did something to her at least once so why go through all that again with such high risk of the same result‚Äù. Then theyd probably come under fire for wasting court resources on abusive celebrities. Personally I wish the qc had talked about what the parties were entitled to expect from a judgement that starts from the presumption of innocence. Ie. If not starting with the presumption that the hoax narrative is true, then the presumption that both are equally likely. Then considering every piece of evidence against what you would expect as evidence of a hoax v evidence of genuine abuse. And reinforced the point that credibility is at the heart of this because none of the evidence relied upon by the defendant inherently supported one narrative and not the other. But hope im wrong.

68,UgwGDWh0qNzwzW0lpuV4AaABAg,"Donations are not payments. If you are meaning they come voluntarily. But there are three things/facts that make this a special case. 

The couple make a divorce settlement of 7 M$ which AH says publicly she will donate to charity.

1) Johnny starts to pay one of the charities on AH behalf but she doesn't like it and gets all the money to take care of it herself.

 2) On Dutch TV she said she had 'paid' it in past tense and names the charities. 

3) The only 2 payments found in reciepts are the one done by Johnny and an anonomynus in her name (if I understood it right). And both those amounts are alltogether only few hundred thousand dollars, far from 7 M$.

 She has had some years to pay and has already said she had done so. None really checked it out because who would lie about such a thing. 

So she has lied to the public and the court but what does that means legal technically since donations are voluntarily? Is lying about a promise a crime? Is that promise (a lie) punishable by law?

My answer is yes in this case. She  uses this promise/pledge platform to launch herself into stratosphere as a DV spokewoman and this fact earned her a lot of respect and spotlight. 

At the same time like evidence shows she just used the money for herself and very little or if anything on her behalf paid to charities came from her pocket.

 She was elevated on lies (pledge plus false accusations) while Johnny was made an outcast sort of. Plus all the wittnesses against there not being any bruises on her I can't she that she will not get a punishment.",Gunnar Freyr Valdimarsson,1,2021-03-22T11:20:50Z

I've had a few answers of ""That's conspiracy!"" But in reality? Is it? I mean those connections are clearly accurate. I get that just because his son works for NGN, doesn't mean the judge does. But is it really that far fetched to think a parent is going to do what's right for their child? We see examples of that, in the most basic ways, every day. Why wasn't that brought to attention, and a judge without any connection selected? It's an honest question. Isn't that supposed to be a factor? Or am I misunderstanding how the selection process works? This vetting, happens in jury trials, right? Wouldn't they hold their judicial selection process to equal or higher standards.

80,UgzVHecOQB4cam_Gbhx4AaABAg,A point to be made about the donations also is that the original or first judgement by Justice Nicol emphasized on the fact that the donations made by AH prove that she is not a gold digger and it proves that she is a person of high morals and principles therefore making it difficult to believe that she can be deceitful or a liar <<< this is a big reason why it is important to prove she never made the donations because it was one of the main pillars the judgement was based on of which the judge considered to be of relevance and weight,slimway,9,2021-03-22T07:15:45Z

The OTHER one is HUGELY IMPORTANT, too, though as it is asking to admit Jennifer Howell's statements that Whitney Henriquez (the only eye-witness called) perjured herself about the staircase fight and actually stated that Amber was attacking and Johnny was nearly pushed down the stairs. This was definitely not available pre-trial so I am hoping that that's why it wasn't challenged. The judges seemed to have done their homework very well and had a good grasp of the arguments already, which is why their questions were so apposite.

In my mind it sounds like The Sun (UK)argued it's too late, so the defense shouldn't be penalized simply because oppositions failure to fully prep? 
The two judges are saying just because someone lies about a donation doesn't make any abuse accusations false? Kind of similar to someone breaking furniture. Where it doesn't automatically mean they're beating on someone?
Honestly, it sounds to me an appeal being granted has a better chance via the judge's bias in accepting anything favorable to The Sun & AH. Then having disregarded any evidence from JD. Evidence that includes her own words & testimony from law enforcement, employees & the medical testimony. I'm probably wrong, but it feels like the US trial, A H's dishonesty about her donations will sink her. In the UK, appeal granted based on the prior Judge's own biased reasons.

160,UgxbXbm4Zf8CkDDWxDR4AaABAg,"Their trial was supposed to be in March 2020 was it not ? And the only reason that Johnny decided to use this evidence was because in February amber mentioned it in her statement. So how would they have gotten this evidence earlier ? There is not enough time to send subpoenas and be provided with that information in the span of a couple weeks... then prepare their case and all the other steps it takes in the short span of a few weeks ... lmao that argument falls through. But regardless of why she wasn‚Äôt cross examined about it - it doesn‚Äôt change the fact that she f*ing has been lying about this for years and wearing the badge of a DV victim and accepting the accolades of a woman who donated $3.5 to helping women and young girls who are victims. By her lying about donating that money, it shows that she doesn‚Äôt care about them, and she is not a victim. Because a victim would have donated.",DeltaBleu,0,2021-03-21T21:24:47Z

163,Ugz0Wt-llestMPSakv14AaABAg,"Dear Head plutoniun OR plutonium,  another simple, clear and concise video, (the best kind that usually require the most work!).   I am begging you to look into the Marilyn Manson case.  Amber is very involved in it and has been friends with the two main accusers for over 10 years.  Evan Rachel Wood and Esme Bianco have been photographed with Amber dozens of times over the last decade.   Evan Rachel Wood was one of Ambers biggest supporters when she first alleged JD had beaten her.  At this time Evan had been split up from MM for over 6 years and had always spoken highly of him.  Then, within DAYS of JD agreeing to pay Amber the 7 million dollars with NO court case and NO trial,  Evan made a statement that a former partner had raped her.  She refused to name the party but said she would release the name when she felt strong enough.  (MM has had this hanging over his head this whole time)  Evan,  as a long time member of JD""s  inner circle,  knew that Amber was the abuser.
I know this seems like an open and shut case with 11 accusers.  ALL of the women had been contacted by Evan and her side kick Esme Bianco and they have all been ""groomed"" and organized, including the ""order"" the allegations would come out.  The evidence they are lying is overwhelming and irrefutable,  this is realized  after 5 minutes on google.  I started looking because I knew Amber was friends with one of the accusers and because I could not believe that one of JD's oldest and best friends tortured women!  This whole thing has been planned and set in motion by Evan, Amber and Esme and they knew full well how devastating all of those accusations would be.  I  am ashamed to say I believed them at first.
These women know the statute of limitations is up, I believe the plan is to get a quick cash settlement with NO trial and NO court case, in exchange for a promise to STOP LYING ABOUT BEING ABUSED,  just like what Amber diid!  The last thing they want is a real investigation!
A relative newcomer to youtube, Colonel Kurtz,  has done an incredible series on the MM case as well as excellent work on JD as well as on Meghan and Harry.  This weekend she dropped a 100 minute interview with Manson's PA, Paula,  from 2005 till 2016.   Paula knew Amber and JD and she was actually at the penthouse Thanksgiving Dinner and man she has some incredible stories to tell!  You must watch her video just to find out what a drunken Amber and her father did to Paula that night!
Amber, Evan and Esme are the FACE of the Me Too, Times Up and Domestic Abuse movements.  They have been working in the background and they are on the same speakers circuit making $33,000 per speech.  They have done numerous speeches in front of Congress and have actually had numerous LAWS CHANGED in some terrifying ways like changing the statute of limitations etc.  One of the most concerning is called ""Coercive Control""  where the victim can claim they were brainwashed.  How could you even prove/disprove such a thing.  If you are found guilty it means you are guilty of Domestic Abuse!  Somehow they have managed to even speak in front of the UN!   These three are really in heady company and can do no wrong!  I always assumed it was Elon that had all of the ""pull"" Amber had with the press and even you-tube bias but now I wonder if her political ties are the reason.  HOW MANY AVERAGE PEOPLE CAN PURCHASE A BRITISH JUDGE?  That is punching above even Elon's level.
One other reason I believe these women are tied into high level government circles is due to the fact that they have a ""charity"", known as the Phoenix Act that is  also  the name of the law that Evan  herded through the process and had passed into law.   When you look it up you find the legislation but then the Government has a link for the ""charity"" run by the women.  It has video's of Esme and Evan's speeches before Congress and  a DONATE button.  Since when does the government promote private charities with the EXACT same name as a new law?  
 Something is VERY wrong here,  both with the Manson case and what these three women are up to.  We should not be too surprised at the lies Esme and Evan are telling, can you imagine what ANY long term friend of AMBERS is capable of?
This whole thing has been in the works with Amber and Evan even before JD married  her, remember all of the photos Amber had taken of JD ""sleeping"" in odd places?  This take-down of Manson right now is just the next step.   JD can NOT come out and support Manson right now (those women are waiting to pounce IMO)  even though Manson came out in 2016 to support JD.  It must be making JD nuts as he knows damn well Manson is innocent and he also knows AMBER is  one of the the main reasons this is happening to his friend.
I think the best thing we could do for JD right now is to help Manson.  I can write this but I don't have a channel to worry about.  I keep dropping these letters to the JD crowd to encourage them to look into it even if they can't put it on their channel.  Colonel Kurtz has said these Manson video's are completely de-monetized.  If I had any previous strikes I would probably not cover this subject!
Please look into this, especially how high up these women are that they can change laws and HI-JACK a very important issue and turn  it into a cash grab with their scam charity!!",tammy koble,0,2021-03-21T21:16:27Z

I thought I saw a little shake on one of the judges head when they said she was feisty and probably did start physical fights .

177,UgxmRnyUkm57ByM1Jyl4AaABAg,"Chain of evidence is very important.
This has been effective for JD's defence, as he now has the documents of value to prove her alleged lies.
The Judge who found against JD actually was the one who placed weight on the donation issue, so that gives leverage to JD's team to state truthfully that the donations werent made  and they have all the evidence they need to prove the money wasnt given.
Legally, the appeal should proceed as all issues are relevant to how that original judge found and wrote his summary. 
In effect, the judge believed something,  even though there wasnt any evidence to assist him with that belief, he went with oral evidence, when there were documents that could prove otherwise...",I.M. De Marco,13,2021-03-21T20:53:42Z

182,UgyMolOqOvgRZ3u50rR4AaABAg,"Because she was trying to get the ACLU to type up a document which imo is fraudulent and something like that cannot be backdated with a brand new logo when in 2016 it was totally different. The ACLU needs to be looked into. She has opened a whole can of worms and is going to take down multiple people and also businesses because of her lies.

183,UgzWqh8co2rJECb3ch94AaABAg,"The problem I have is that Johnny Lawyer gave the court a way out. Johnny lawyer agreed that a finding of both abused or toxic marriage would be a fair one. I fear that is how the court of appeal will find that both have abused each other. Then order the sun to run an article stating both are abusers. 

This finding is very unfair as Johnny never has abused Amber. I hope this feeling I have is wrong. I just wished Johnny lawyer never agreed it would be fair if Nichols made such a judgement.",Steve Kass,8,2021-03-21T20:42:00Z
