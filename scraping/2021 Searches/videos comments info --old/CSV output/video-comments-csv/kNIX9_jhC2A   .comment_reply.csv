158,UgykHx_IfAsbfXnzLdV4AaABAg,S. Knight,"​@Binge Central Agreed! Especially since I was an avid comic book collector, starting in the 70's and up to the early 2000's. I had about 7 mid 50's and over a 100 of early to mid and late 60's collectible editions and in mint condition comic books. I passed it on to my son in 2012 as a family heirloom when he was of age to understand and appreciate what this collection meant both in ""monetary and sentimental values"" that was an above average in high end collectibles and in a high number of different issues of my favorite characters, which he still has today and locked down in the same old safe that I had bought in the mid 80's to replace the older safe I had my collection locked in prior to buying a better safe in the 80's and then giving him the entire collection in 2012 and from that moment on, he even started collecting more himself asking me advice when hunting down specialty issues on their values and prices, that and asking me for a few loans along the way to purchase certain issues and help pay for the special insurance for it all...lol. 

One of my most prized collectible edition was the ""Journey Into Mystery #83, rated 9.4 and signed by Stan Lee on the third page"" which impressed Stan Lee due to how in good condition it was. Stan Lee even gave me advice on when you get an artist/writer to sign a collectible edition because I had asked him to sign the cover page and that advice was ""to never have the signor sign the cover page or the back page of the cover page so to preserve the art, therefore always get a signature on the third page with a pen that contains ink that won't bleed through the pages and never ask the signature to be dedicated to your name and/or any other names because it would devalue the collectability of the issue "".

So, bottom line is, that's why it is so much fun and a must see for me to see all my favorite characters come to life on the big screen. Even when Disney/MCU and WB/DCEU gets it wrong and nerfs and use the wrong characters as comic relief. There's two characters that the MCU definitely botched and that's ""THOR and The Black Widow"". And as for WB/DCEU their casting of actors and portrayal of certain characters has been off and they are still off in their upcoming comic book projects. Seriously, casting Robert Pattinson as Batman, what a bonehead move when there's so many better choices of actors that they could of chosen, that would of made great ""Batman's"", yet they went with Pattinson, for which they'll need to pad up his costume to make him look 40-50 pounds bigger/more muscular since he's so scrawny.  Wow, I wonder if they are going to let him wear make up/lipstick? (insert face palm here)",2021-08-04T18:19:19Z,0
