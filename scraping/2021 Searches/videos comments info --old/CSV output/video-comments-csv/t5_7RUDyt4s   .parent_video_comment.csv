AH is the one who abused Johnny she should be wearing an orange jumpsuit.  AH admits abusing Johnny, taunts and ridiculed him and berates him when he leaves to get away from her violent outbursts and this is all recorded on audio.  Hollywood is rewarding the real abuser and the public is disgusted by it",Linda Landry,0,2021-01-23T02:01:08Z

I like how you ask about the orange ribbon for the UN stopping violence against women - wish it also would be online! Also Amber Heard clearly loves answering your questions!",Christina Taft,2,2020-04-22T17:51:22Z
