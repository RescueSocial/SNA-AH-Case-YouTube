2018: Johnny Depp paid final portion of 7 million settlement. 
2018: Amber wrote the op-ed in December.
2019: CHLA Mailed her a letter and asked when they would be getting the 3.5 million dollar donation. Crickets. 
2019: Depp sued Amber Heard for defamation in March.
2020: Amber Heard’s attorney, Elaine Bredehoft, states in legal filing that Amber meant she would eventually over her lifetime donate 7 million. She claims Amber used the money for legal fees. How did she know a year before being sued, that she would be sued?!

Amber Heard LIED!  She also lied on the stand in the UK trial therefore, committing perjury and should be charged and jailed.",Silky Shish,0,2021-01-10T03:09:31Z
