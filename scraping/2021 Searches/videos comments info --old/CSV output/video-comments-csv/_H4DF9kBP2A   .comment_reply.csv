The only difference is the others make it obvious their bias favors Depp before misleading you and this one misleads you, then gives you the same biased reporting.",2021-08-24T08:08:29Z,0
1,Ugxt9xwvSf3KtNZcyvR4AaABAg,Renata James,"How can you say he raised her when he, a millionaire, never stopped working when his kids were born (he was worth over $20M by the time Lily was 5) and in Lily's own words, ""he was never around""? Vanessa raised her. Depp just donated his sperm and did a few photo ops for appearances. He's no different than Trump. Same shitty person in a slightly nicer package. If you weren't some dingy fan girl, you'd see it too.",2021-08-24T08:01:28Z,0
2,UgxwctO-XL7PfyYrdqh4AaABAg,Renata James,"You mean she loves that having him as a father gets her an easy life and her foot in the door to one of the easiest and most lucrative fluff industries on the planet?  Give me a break... you don't know what Lily is thinking or feeling. She hasn't said one word on it publicly. All we have seen is the PR statement Depp's team wrote for her to be published on her socials. Do they call you Deppheads because Depp took the place of your brain? I don't believe everything I read on the internet, especially that person happens to be defending a wife beater, like you're sadly attempting to do.",2021-08-24T08:05:49Z,0

6,Ugy7-oX-acv4jGW0yEJ4AaABAg,Renata James,"Not exactly. There was a written statement on her social media account. Anyone could have written it and it is far more likely her PR, paid for by her father, wrote it. Lily said he wasn't a good father and was never around until he married Amber. Those were her own words sent via text.  Unless you can prove they are her words, they mean nothing. Can you? no!",2021-08-24T07:47:13Z,0
7,UgzwYu3OzLuwX91CXWR4AaABAg,Renata James,"There's no defense for abusing your wife. Lily has not said a word about this publicly. Her only statements have come in the form of social media posts which are likely scripted by her PR team, which is paid for by her father. Who do you think has control over the content? Not Lily! Without her father's connections and help, Lily has no career and may have to actually earn a living by working some day. Notice that Johnny made the decision to end Lily's contract with her agent (also his former agent), not Lily. Lily just does what daddy tells her.",2021-08-24T07:44:15Z,0

11,UgyxOnZTnU9bKMmFPjN4AaABAg,Customer Service,"Her texts said that he was an absentee father. Just because she doesn‚Äôt want her life in the papers and her fathers abusive side being the focus of every interview, doesn‚Äôt mean Lily isn‚Äôt hiding some family secrets. Look at her face.
