0,Ugw-MlYtuOrrNahcQVx4AaABAg,Joann Hesse,"People disliking Amber Heard isn’t about the franchise, it’s because she is an abusive, lying con-artist. Did you know she defecated in Johnny Depp’s bed, cut off the tip of his finger w/ broken glass, and stole $7,000,000 from charities for abused women and hospitalized children?",2021-06-30T16:29:04Z,0
1,Ugy8WD-npV-DpBQ3DR94AaABAg,Alex Brandon,@danny S you said both were guilty of participating in an abuse relationship. How is the victim guilty?,2021-06-30T21:00:03Z,0
2,Ugy8WD-npV-DpBQ3DR94AaABAg,danny S,"@Alex Brandon You need to read my post again,  I don't know how but your understanding of it is completely inaccurate.  The first and last sentence alone state she is guilty of abuse.  Cheers!",2021-06-30T20:31:56Z,0
3,Ugy8WD-npV-DpBQ3DR94AaABAg,Alex Brandon,"@danny S the way you  said, If someone gets beaten in a relationship are they guilty too?
Before you states your opinion, you should look for facts. People don't want her in the movie, not because of a simple expeculation.

There are a lot of proofs of her doing stuff and not a single thing from him. Why's that I wonder?",2021-06-30T18:39:39Z,0
4,Ugy8WD-npV-DpBQ3DR94AaABAg,danny S,@Super Nerd Video To be fair I think both parties are guilty of participating in an abuse relationship.  What people don't like is Heard claiming to be a champion against spouse abuse when she herself committed abuse,2021-06-29T18:10:27Z,2
5,Ugy8WD-npV-DpBQ3DR94AaABAg,Super Nerd Video,WB is probably wondering how many other people there are out there who feel the same way you do.,2021-06-29T17:33:38Z,0
6,Ugyd08nb5P5TPN0RgJt4AaABAg,alexpiperhalliwell,@Super Nerd Video They can cherry pick who is going to interview her but she still will be in trailers and posters. In Aquaman her character is co-lead so I think there will be plenty of her in the sequel.,2021-06-30T14:01:12Z,0
7,Ugyd08nb5P5TPN0RgJt4AaABAg,Super Nerd Video,They might hide Amber Heard in the marketing for the movie.,2021-06-29T17:33:07Z,1
