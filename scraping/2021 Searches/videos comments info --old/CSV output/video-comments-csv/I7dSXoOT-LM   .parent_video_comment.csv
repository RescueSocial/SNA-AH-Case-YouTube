63,UgwOKuvECWmt2hGiWat4AaABAg,"Are you saved friend? If you died tonight will you go to heaven or hell?

God Almighty, the Creator was manifest in the flesh. He came into the world to take away the sin of the world. He gave up his own life to save yours. His sacrifice on the cross paid the price for your redemption with his own blood. On the third day he rose from dead and offers the gift of salvation and forgiveness to those that repent and trust in him. This is the Gospel which means the Good News.

John 1:1-3,10 KJV
In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. [2] The same was in the beginning with God. [3] All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made. [10] He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.

Isaiah 44:6 KJV
Thus saith the Lord the King of Israel, and his redeemer the Lord of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and beside me there is no God.

Revelation 1:17-18 KJV
And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am the first and the last: [18] I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death.

Ephesians 2:8-9 KJV
For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: [9] Not of works, lest any man should boast.

Acts 4:12 KJV
Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.

John 5:24 KJV
Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.

1 John 5:13 KJV
These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God.

Matthew 28:19-20 KJV
Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: [20] Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen.",Jesus is God,0,2020-08-03T21:03:13Z

86,UgzNSDt_FVJzJJCOh3N4AaABAg,"I love this one. Amber doesn’t even think about the ramifications that bringing Her dogs into Australia could cause to their ecological health and well-being! If the dogs are not vaccinated for any and all diseases that dogs in Australia are exposed to not only could this possibly make Her dogs sick but could be a catastrophe to the animals indigenous to Australia! 
Anyway, as always, John Paul. I hope that She does go back there someday and has to face her music!!!!
