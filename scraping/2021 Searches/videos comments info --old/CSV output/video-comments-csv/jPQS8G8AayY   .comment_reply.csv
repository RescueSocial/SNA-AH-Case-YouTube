There are a few petitions and the one has many signatures (thus the bot claim)  but she has not lost anything yet.  So why does she  assume she can ask for so much??

46,UgxFmo0uRR_dlzqhdJN4AaABAg,Stacy,"I wanted to know the same. It's my understanding, they have to show proof of loss of income. There is nothing she has done or will do that justifies that amount.  

Just an FYI, $50mill is for the JD vs. AH law suit coming up. The Sun lawsuit had no amount applied. I believe there is a max amount that JD can be awarded (if he wins) & it's not much. Something like $350k. Don't remember exact amount but it's in that range. He may be able to get attorney fees covered, not positive on that thou.
