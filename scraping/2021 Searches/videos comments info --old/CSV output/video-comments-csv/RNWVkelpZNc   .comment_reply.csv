And you get to know exactly what happened, who said what and actually get a first hand feel of what the vibe is rather than reading articles or seeing the aftermath. You can only speculate unless you are there or read the transcripts!

60,UgwB8Fl-RMCdk9g1QAl4AaABAg,Lola Twinkle,@Debi Dooms Please we really arent prejudiced like that in the UK. Depp lost because of Murdoch and his power and wealth.

61,UgwB8Fl-RMCdk9g1QAl4AaABAg,Marge lane T.,"exactly!!  & add to that the "" Media Law"" paper that the Judge published few years ago which was specifically about how a media outlet can WRITE ABOUT PUBLIC FIGURE &  *NOT GET SUED*  he was the absolute wrong judge for Johnny's case",2021-05-23T16:29:09Z,2
62,UgwB8Fl-RMCdk9g1QAl4AaABAg,Debi Dooms,"From what I understand,  it's the end of the road for the UK case. The reasons for judgment was crazy, even when confronted by evidence and POLICE testimony, he seemed to always take Amber's word for it.. The fact that the Appeal Court stood by his judgment made me feel like maybe it was a form of protecting themselves and they didn't want to set a precedent? Because his reasons seemed to be that basically he accepts Amber's version of events.. lol. Plus Johnny is a foreigner. 

I think the simple fact that Amber's lawyer was allegedly MENTORED by the Judge's ex-wife (they are still friends too) should have been enough grounds for a retrial, as a Judge isn't supposed to preside over a case where he has a relationship with any of the parties or lawyers.. He should have disclosed this and/or recused himself. Unfortunately, I don't think there is any way to retry it but I am not super familiar with their law, the best he can possibly hope for is winning his case in Virginia, which will clear his name in the public's eyes and hopefully open people's eyes to what I think could potentially amount to corruption in the UK Court System. My friend was working as a Paralegal in London, they literally pay you minimum wage and the lawyers don't even make much either, you go to school for a few years, no undergrad, being a lawyer there doesn't hold the same weight as it does in North America. I also find it super weird that you need ""permission"" to appeal there, that's insane to me! Where's the system of checks and balances?!",2021-05-23T02:24:44Z,3

Nothing has changed that fact. The judge will eventually likely rule they have to turn them over, but that's why they haven't been turned over. They were waiting for Johnny to file the motion, and for the judge to rule on it.

The reason for concern is that they wouldn‚Äôt turn over the financial records, which was really because of the financial privacy laws. 
They have been waiting for Johnny to file a demand for  them and for the judge to make a ruling on that demand. 
Johnny has finally now filed that, and we are now waiting for the judge to decide what he is going to do, which will probably be to side with Johnny, demanding they turn them over.

Although from the elevator video they definitely look cozy, unless Johnny had cameras in their apartment it would be difficult to prove they had a relationship if Elon lies.. but he did see her after the injury so that part is pretty relevant. 

One of the things that sociopathic people can do is get dirt on people to frame them, for example Jeffree Star who admitted he has ‚Äúdirt on everyone‚Äù... I remember Amber secretly recorded her friend so maybe she does keep collateral on people? Could explain why people are so ride or die for her.. could be driven by fear rather than loyalty. Super curious to see what happens if they depose Amber‚Äôs friends again now that they have the bodycam footage... especially Rocky who is no longer friends with her, I wonder if she will still be willing to risk it all for Amber.",2021-05-23T01:45:55Z,3

I think maybe the line of thinking is that he‚Äôs helped her cover all this up or been financing her to cover this up.. I think he‚Äôs dodging deposition though",2021-05-23T00:07:46Z,2

97,UgxnTxeGZKchswk6jVV4AaABAg,Rock Candy,@Jay A Errington ACLU going to tie ERW and AH together ...so if the phoenix law was ACLU supported then now we have a connection between AH and ACLU and ERW and ACLU.  And i also believe AH and ERW connection with timing of naming Manson to remove from Johnny's trial.  So does ACLU also know or suspect that ERW was not naming Manson but knew who he was and that he is innocent as well.   i also agree because of issues with AH being perpetrator they could have seen Manson as the new poster boy or a plan B moved up to a plan A - not as mainstream or attractive as JD but famous and wealthy-maybe just as high impact for the public because of his image.  ERW much less volatile than AH. so hmmm... highly highly interesting.  omg trying to keep up with this case already takes up my free-time...now this ....is this sh!t for real?? ACLU involved in knowingly framing 2 high profile hollywood men...for funding $$$...??,2021-05-23T01:05:12Z,3
98,UgxnTxeGZKchswk6jVV4AaABAg,Jay A Errington,"@Debi Dooms I really want them to come out but by saying she definitely donated to ACLU sounds like they are not gonna disclose.
I've been looking into ACLU and they get half a billion a Yr in donations and spend a third of it on causes the other 2 thirds???  Also they were after going into the political arena and this new law they wanted passing was coming up.... The phoenix law... Then they ACLU wrote Amber's op Ed???
Then... They knew they were not gonna win so changed tactic and went for manson instead and the law got passed... The women's accusations are ridiculous... He had a dark house... It was cold... He didn't feed me... I cleaned his house üòÇ he had a bloody cleaner... He trafficked me... He bought her a plane ticket to visit him... He fed me drugs üòÇ cos u just sat there with ur mouth open... üôÑ He didn't let me sleep cos you were up all night doing drugs

I don't know if we will get to see what she spent the $7m on, but her lawyer says it was spent on legal fees? Lol!! But I am happy to hear ACLU will have to disclose if Amber ever donated to them, the main thing is she lied about doing so while testifying on a stand.. Without knowing from ACLU, she still has a veil of protection where she can allude that she donated to one but not the other, but if it comes out she never donated anything to either charity, it definitely won't be a good look!",2021-05-22T21:48:52Z,1

103,UgwAqjSSp4lZ1owjd394AaABAg,Kayte 0207,"@Debi Dooms   A similar thing happened to me in my divorce.  Before our initial divorce hearing, my ex broke into our home (where I was still living) while I was at work, and stole an inheritance check that I had just received from my aunt/godmother, who had recently passed away.  He forged it and cashed it.  At the same time, he withdrew all but 48 cents from our checking and savings accounts, including my last paycheck, that had just been direct deposited.  If not for the help of our grown son, I would have been destitute.  The judge made the decision that I was not eligible to get ANY of my money back, stating that my ex ‚Äúhad already spent it, and now cannot afford to pay you‚Äù.  My attorney later found out that the judge in my divorce case was best friends with my ex husband‚Äôs attorney, and definitely should have recused himself.",2021-05-23T22:26:50Z,0

I'm worried about outside influence, the judge being bought etc. Injustice Nicol uses his last remaining months to let the media get away with slander and to protect his son it seemed. 

Regarding the article, it's getting heavily suppressed in comments it seems.

To be honest I always felt something was off from her and never believed her.. and then Johnny made his own accusations against her and it sounds like something so outlandish and out of a movie, but over time the evidence that has come to light really does support what he‚Äôs saying.. the transcript read like a script of a movie, 100% could see a documentary or movie made about this one day it‚Äôs nuts!",2021-05-22T21:00:07Z,8
115,Ugz8jGuPZF7Rh3M00jB4AaABAg,SweetChastity,@Debi Dooms Amber said her best friend died in a car crash at 16 and it changed her life. You can see on https://www.ifod.net/thetruth/ near the bottom they discuss Amber‚Äôs arrests and it says her minor drivers license was revoked and she got a ticket for driving with a suspended license in 2003/2004 when she was 17/18 years old. So the RUMOUR is that her best friends death at 16 and her license being suspended for 4 years (if I remember correctly) might be related. BUT it is all speculation and I have not myself looked into it beyond brief curious glance when I heard the rumour. I think it is only relevant to prove her drug/alcohol use has been a long struggle and she really does need to admit she has an illness and deal with her issues if it has affected her and others lives so powerfully for so long. But her records were sealed so we will probably never know and I‚Äôm not sure we need to.,2021-05-22T20:21:28Z,5
116,Ugz8jGuPZF7Rh3M00jB4AaABAg,Debi Dooms,"True and I hear rumours that something bad happened but because she was underage it was able to be sealed.. but there is no proof of that so guess we will never know, it could explain a lot, that would mess anybody up and set a really dark trajectory for your life.",2021-05-22T19:55:42Z,5

Most lawyers I work for would never try to use the ""unprepared"" tactic, especially since this the fourth time they were demanding the same shit or pretty close to it lol.
