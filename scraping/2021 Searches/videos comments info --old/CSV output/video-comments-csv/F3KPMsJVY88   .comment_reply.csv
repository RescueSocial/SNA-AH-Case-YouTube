8,UgxMP2JaM8xnrN8lBDt4AaABAg,Doctor Soup,"Hi Laura. At the time Heard was hired, the amount of evidence against her, was not as clear as it is now. 
As far as her getting fired, it‚Äôs possible he is unable to make that decision as well. Thanks for the comment! ‚ù§Ô∏è",2021-06-14T14:50:38Z,2

19,UgxOTFDJviKgUP4NB-h4AaABAg,Deborah Mcgee,@Marianne Lloyd believe it or not I didn‚Äôt know who he was till all this happened. But when I saw her with him I said he must be rich because he ain‚Äôt no Johnny   I wouldn‚Äôt give Johnny‚Äôs little finger for all of Elon‚Äôs money,2021-06-15T20:59:24Z,0

24,Ugy9mYlmpBDL96ENOuF4AaABAg,Jennifer MARA,"@bruceleena for real though üòÇ just like at work. Have to act ""professional"" even with the people I hate the most lool. But when work is over, my professional side is over too and that person can go to hell üòÇ that's why I didn't understand when he showed her support. Musk is 100% scared of her. Don't forget that she still the embryos that he sued her for. If he doesn't act right, boom a baby. And he'll be attach to her for life. Plus, she has a bless to always record people without their consent. I'm sure she got dirt on him üíØ",2021-06-13T22:22:11Z,0
25,Ugy9mYlmpBDL96ENOuF4AaABAg,bruceleena,"Yeah.  I personally if I was working with Amber. I would stear away as much from her drama and treat her as a professional actress. Then when I get home,  I can talk to my mate about all the crazy things she does lol.  I wouldn't want to get sucked up into this mess.  Look at Elon, the guy seems scared of her and staying as far away as he can.  He's next after Johnny.  I weep for the next guy",2021-06-13T22:13:13Z,1
26,Ugy9mYlmpBDL96ENOuF4AaABAg,Jennifer MARA,"@bruceleena you're right on that one but another thing is that the other side of the ""truth"" is outta there. Even the court documents. I'm not saying that they should take time to look at it because they don't have too. All I say is that is that they shouldn't blindly ""defend"" her when they don't even wanna look at both sides of the story",2021-06-13T21:55:03Z,1
27,Ugy9mYlmpBDL96ENOuF4AaABAg,bruceleena,"Well, I don't see it that c way.  I see that she's charming and can get people around her believe her BS. Maybe people don't want to say anything because they just want to work.  Her contract must be pretty good and WB can't get her out of it. I don't want to assume,  because he's only hearing one side of the story",2021-06-13T21:24:08Z,1
28,Ugy9mYlmpBDL96ENOuF4AaABAg,Jennifer MARA,"Don't feel bad for the lead role, he showed her support like 2 months ago when she announced that she was ""back"" in Aquaman 2. He's abuser enabler",2021-06-13T15:12:35Z,2
29,UgxYxA_shUR_VWHuhNF4AaABAg,M P,@Josette Berryhill who needs James Franco? He's no use to anyone. I think you maybe meant she 'had' him.,2021-06-29T07:06:42Z,0

31,UgxYxA_shUR_VWHuhNF4AaABAg,Josette Berryhill,No johnny doesn't need her money plus she is servicing a few very rich guys.  Why give her any plubisity  fire her,2021-06-29T01:27:40Z,0
32,UgxYxA_shUR_VWHuhNF4AaABAg,Cburke502,Lol. Thats my thought too.  Elon musk will probably pick her up out of the gutter,2021-06-28T22:38:59Z,0
33,UgxYxA_shUR_VWHuhNF4AaABAg,M P,That's what Elon for. Nope fire her.,2021-06-13T22:18:25Z,7
34,UgzFnFtz7phImbY-Ojt4AaABAg,Elizabeth Briggs,I will not watch anything shes in nor will I use L‚ÄôOr√©al products until she done. I use oil of Olay instead. People should give it a try and it‚Äôs a lot cheaper. So get her out of L‚ÄôOr√©al then people will return,2021-06-16T16:55:55Z,2
