When Brie Larson was announced to be playing Carol Danvers in Captain Marvel, there was a huge outcry from a section of fans who didn’t approve of the casting.

Calls from Brie Larson to help increase the diversity in film journalism and critique seemed to be among the reasons why Larson was targeted by trolls according to Vox while others believed Larson was central to a rumoured falling out behind the scenes with Avengers castmates.

What followed were months, if not years, of online abuse and trolling with Twitter fans even claiming that she received death threats.
