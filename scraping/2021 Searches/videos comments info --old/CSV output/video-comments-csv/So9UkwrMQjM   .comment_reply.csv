23,Ugzt0K7zB5j_sPVXyIp4AaABAg,Megan McKnight,YOU DONT NEED TO TYPE IN ALL CAPS! Plus they could still have bad experiences with her and just can‚Äôt say anything because they had to work with her. Everyone on ‚ÄúTeam Amber‚Äù is usually mainly secretly Team Johnny/Team Pirate. Ambers own parents turned against her and apologized to Johnny.,2021-09-18T02:46:28Z,0
24,UgydW4ZIcnQx5kaZN0l4AaABAg,Megan McKnight,"@Crazier Things his ‚Äúprank‚Äù on Amber on the set of Aquaman 2 might be more than a prank Since he tore out 10 pages of one of her books. The ‚Äúprank‚Äù that didn‚Äôt go over well with certain people. His ‚Äúprank‚Äù could  easily show how upset  he is at her for lying even if he didn‚Äôt speak up with words. Sometimes staying out someone‚Äôs personal drama personally  is also a way to show angry ,furious/upset actions over someone lying. since we all know that lying isn‚Äôt acceptable/shouldn‚Äôt be tolerated. others Around Amber could just be showing their angry upset furious reactions in a different way that doesn‚Äôt involve speaking up against her in person because they have to work as her costars espeically since there‚Äôs no me too movement/law for men who have been abused by woman or other men even though there should be since we all know men can also be victims of things like assualt,domestic violence,rape‚Ä¶etc‚Ä¶ I wouldn‚Äôt exactly call the videos clickbait for Jason Momoa since they mention that his prank on Amber on the set of Aquaman 2 could be more than just a prank but it could show that he‚Äôs upset with her,doesn‚Äôt like that she lied. He‚Äôs just might not bash her negatively with words but at the same time he‚Äôs probably clearly not on team Amber and could secretly be on team pirate/team Johnny. It could be how Jason decided to show that he was against men being abused he could be too mad on the inside in his heart at Amber for lying since he‚Äôs a good guy he would probably defend Johnny if he could/was allowed too since men should also support other men when they are abused.  Her coworkers could just be too mad at her in their hearts on the inside for lying and secretly supporting Johnny instead since her coworkers would all be good people instead of speaking up with words they could have just decided to stay out of her personal drama but they could be equally furious,enraged,upset,angry and mad at her for lying about Johnny  just as much  as Penelope Cruz-All of Johnny‚Äôs exes before Amber,and all of Amber‚Äôs friends are at her for lying about Johnny espeically since she‚Äôs been lying about it for almost over 4 years by now and one of her friends was with her after the abuse claims came to light and noticed no injuries on Amber what so ever. 


The only person who really needs to stop protecting her is most like Elon Musk and those that helped her lie for almost over 4 years. 

Plus Jason Momoa works with Amber because of Aquaman he‚Äôd also clearly notice if she even was abused by anyone since he works with her face to face he‚Äôd also notice things like bruises‚Ä¶etc‚Ä¶ so if he could Iam sure he‚Äôd also call her a liar since he‚Äôd also clearly notice no signs of abuse from Johnny. 


Jason Momoa has been working with Amber since 2018 since Aquaman one. 


All her coworkers would also notice if she was lying or not And be able to say no she wasn‚Äôt abused by Johnny that she‚Äôs lying‚Ä¶etc‚Ä¶ since they‚Äôd notice no signs of injuries from Johnny. Her face on a daily basis since the allegations popped up have given away that she has no injuries Iam sure her coworkers would also notice her lies about Johnny as well even if they can‚Äôt speak up on it in person because they get stuck working with her and decided to stay out of her personal drama. They still wouldn‚Äôt stand for her lying about being a victim of abuse and stand for men being abused. 

Alot of people would notice signs of Amber being abuse espeically people she works with on a daily basis. So Jason Momoa-Emilia Clarke would also be able to help Johnny out if they could espeically in a court room as witnesses. The good /best/great kind of witnesses are ones that can catch a persons lie, notice when someone has gone too far,notice signs of real bruising-injuries‚Ä¶etc‚Ä¶ aka the ones that don‚Äôt lie. And with Jason Momoa being a good guy like you described  which we all know is a good person he also wouldn‚Äôt lie if he could speak up when Amber did something wrong.   People in Amber‚Äôs daily life like her coworkers would also notice when she goes too far with something. It‚Äôs obvious she needs help yes since she‚Äôs a compulsive liar,wants money‚Ä¶.etc‚Ä¶ like one article said she‚Äôs not gonna get the help that she truly needs if other certain people keep protecting her and helping her lie. 

Since Jason Momoa and other people are staying out of her drama they all have a better chance of being secretly Mainly Team Johnny/Team Pirate. 

It‚Äôs defiently more about Amber learning the error of her ways for lying about Johnny.  

It honestly can‚Äôt be fun on her coworkers side having to be stuck working with her for movies and tv series when she got caught in a lie about Johnny Depp and eventually learning that she lied through the media but not being able to speak on it opinion wise and having to stay out of it as a result because your job basically makes you stay out of or even if you choose to stay out of it yourself when Amber lied about domestic violence and being abused/calling Johnny the abuser when he‚Äôs not espeically when there‚Äôs no movement/law to protect men from being abused by other people that really can‚Äôt be fun espeically when the company you work for won‚Äôt do anything like fire the person for lying about being a Victim of a serious topic. Even if they don‚Äôt involved personally testimony the least the Aquaman hiring team can do is show their workers that lying is not acceptable by firing Amber. Other wise by keeping her it looks like they showing that lying is okay when it‚Äôs not. 

So I wouldn‚Äôt say that Jason Momoa won‚Äôt ever say anything negative about her he could just be keeping all his negative comments to himself because he‚Äôs stuck working with her but he could still deeply upset with her for lying and wanting to speak up in his heart since he‚Äôs a good guy. If she was fired like she should be from Aquaman 2 he‚Äôd probably have a better chance of being able to say negative stuff about her if she wasn‚Äôt still working with him. He could also speak up years later when he‚Äôs no longer working with her. Some costars true feelings negatively about someone don‚Äôt come to light until years later when the costars are no longer working together in a movie or a tv series. Think about all her costars who would love to say negative things about her but clearly can‚Äôt because they get stuck working with her so they have to be all nice and positive espeically when the coworker they work with gets caught in a lie that can‚Äôt be easy to stay out of something like that when you are furious,mad,upset and angry at the person deep down inside in your heart for that one person lying or for that one person doing something wrong.

Yes everyone makes mistakes but Amber made a big one about a serious topic that a lot of her coworkers would probably love to also speak up on and call her out for her lying about Johnny they just clearly can‚Äôt because she‚Äôs their coworker and they are stuck working with someone who got caught in a lie so her coworkers clearly have to find a way to stay out of it as a result but at the same time Iam sure they‚Äôd love to say at least certain good negative things about her to help Johnny out because of how mad they are at her for lying deep down in their hearts they just clearly can‚Äôt speak up in person which would be super hard espeically when it‚Äôs someone you‚Äôve known since 2018 or a lot longer.",2021-09-18T17:47:18Z,0
25,UgydW4ZIcnQx5kaZN0l4AaABAg,Megan McKnight,"@Crazier Things ik that iam just saying since he works with Amber he clearly can‚Äôt bash her negatively  or furiously react to her lying even though he‚Äôd probably actually wants to/would love to say something /speak up but he can‚Äôt because he works with Amber so he stays positive and nice instead. 



Hence why I said almost Everyone on ‚ÄúTeam Amber‚Äù usually secretly mainly isn‚Äôt actually truely team Amber but instead they are actually truly secretly mainly  Team Johnny/Team Pirate since Jason Momoa probably wouldn‚Äôt also stand for men being abused either since he‚Äôs a nice guy he just can‚Äôt say anything due to having to be stuck with Amber as a coworker.

 

Jason Momoa would just be supporting Johnny in secret. Since there‚Äôs probably more secret team Johnny/team pirate members who just can‚Äôt speak up on Johnny‚Äôs behalf/testify with Johnny against Amber because they get stuck working with Amber for movies or tv series. 

Iam just saying Amber probably barely has a team/family who will defend her since even friends of Amber themselves and Everyone else will defend Johnny. 

It‚Äôs a lot like with Emilia Clarke and all of Amber‚Äôs coworkers Iam sure they‚Äôd love to speak up against Amber in their hearts and help Johnny out against Amber they just probably clearly can‚Äôt because they are stuck working with Amber so they stay out of it but they could also be secretly on Team Johnny/Team Pirate.",2021-09-18T16:19:01Z,0
26,UgydW4ZIcnQx5kaZN0l4AaABAg,Crazier Things,@Megan McKnight no one ever said he liked her or was on her side. But he's not the type of person to spread dirty laundry around either. One of the main reasons I still follow him. He is not caught up in all the drama like most celebrities. He's peaceful and positive. The only reason I am even looking into Amber Heard is because I had report to do for class. She was perfect candidate for what I was looking for.,2021-09-18T15:56:31Z,0

28,UgydW4ZIcnQx5kaZN0l4AaABAg,Megan McKnight,He‚Äôs clearly just half being nice because he has to because of aquaman 2.
