3,Ugx9mbG8akjsPx55vr54AaABAg,Sammy Ariel,"@Ezra Anthony Teh SK lol imagine someone telling a female DV victim that of course if they run away from their abuser all the time the abuser will get fustrated & mad! That is literal victim blaming.

They are fleeing & de-escalating a situation the abuser started. If they stay in the situation the abuse is worse; as you say often deadly.

Giving the abuser all the benifit of the doubt they can't control themselves, so why do you assume the outcome of staying in their presence would be benificial in any way?",2021-05-12T18:19:13Z,4

6,Ugx9mbG8akjsPx55vr54AaABAg,Bruno Souza,"@Ezra Anthony Teh SK This is what i thought but, that's the relationship scope. In the judicial one, she should be punished.
The sense that i have is that Jhonny is not the tipe of guy who is willing to face roughness in order to maintain a relationship... well, he never needed to, he is rich an famous; why bother learning how to maintain a relationship when you can get another pretty easy.

The difficult part of this for someone who think like you (and me) is that somewhere deep inside we tend to link possession with how much a person likes you. I think those two things are somewhat related and we have difficult explaining this in today's relationship world (and she was clearly possessive, even refused to ""let"" Jhonny end the relationship), where being possessive is a sin. The contrary to possession is someone like Jhonny, who don't like you enough to don't even blink when something difficult happens and turn his back in order to leave the relationship to find another.
To have the feeling that someone belongs to you enables you to invest in the relationship without fear of investing in something that you will lose, throwing your time and resources away. In today's world this is prohibited, so it's easier to turn your back in the relationship when you think it's destined to go wrong.",2021-03-06T15:32:07Z,0
