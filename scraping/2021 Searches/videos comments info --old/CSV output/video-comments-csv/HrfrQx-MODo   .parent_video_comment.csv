10,UgxmwGu8f-Nxqobtm3d4AaABAg,I don't care if Pontius Pilate confirms whatever! It doesn't matter! At least half of movie goers aren't going to see that film if she is in it!,Gee Dee En,3,2021-07-07T01:06:52Z
11,UgyqNu7FdiUWkw7SqNl4AaABAg,"Heard is a garbage person. She is not a person with whom has an ounce of morel fiber. I hope she learns from her daughter how a person is suppose to be. At this rate her daughter doesn't have a chance at a normal life. Heard hopefully starts practicing honesty and going to anger management classes so she doesn't get physical anymore. God forbid she can't control herself. 
Heard should also think about taking  some AA and NA classes. I mean playing, being irresponsible once you have a baby is not an option anymore. Your life is about the baby. It's time to be the best version of yourself that you can be. Children grow fast and the world doesn't need a mini me Amber Heard.
Good luck baby Heard",Gennipher Lot,1,2021-07-07T00:40:47Z
