It was a complex case.  Ms. Heard had set it up so that SHE didn't call the police.  Despite telling the press that she HAD--she NEVER filed a police report.  At the time, I believe that they had little evidence against her, other than her deposition.  Raquel Pennington was clever enough to say she never actually witnessed any abuse, in her deposition.  #MeToo was all over the news at that time.  The Judge dismissed the case with prejudice, and that should have ended it.  Now Ms. Heard will have to testify in court, in the Virginia Defamation case.  Her co-conspirators will also have to testify.  That testimony, along with every story, every video, and every speech that Ms. Heard has given will provide ample evidence.  Mr. Depp's lawyer has subpoenaed every text message, every recording, every single piece of evidence pertaining to Ms, Heard's attempt to frame Mr. Depp.  They will prosecute after all the evidence is laid out in the upcoming trial.",2020-04-29T06:39:59Z,5

But Ms. Heard, being a narcissist, had to keep forcing the issue.  After the Virginia Defamation Case, Ms. Heard can be prosecuted for the multiple crimes that she committed.  Mr. Depp's lawyer, Adam Waldman, is an incredibly astute attorney, and I believe that when the defamation suit ends, he will see that Ms. Heard faces justice.",2020-04-28T23:10:54Z,4

From that description it could have been a home invader or a burglary or a trade call out gone wrong; the dispatcher was understandably confused. She just did not sound credible or coherent but rather deliberately misleading (not just evasive). There were other instances of strange priorities and emphasis too, plus the self absorption and self focus(prioritising anonymity, having to go now etc.) and how flippant, casual, and dismissive she was at being essentially told that how she was reporting the incident was potentially undermining the assistance the police department would be able to provide to the alleged victim and she just blew it off with ""Ok, ok, ok"" (2:30).

I'd be anyway severely distraught if that happened to a friend of mine (it did happen, but the police wasn't involved, because I got there first, but that's what I did, so it doesn't apply with someone else, I would understand how that line of ""going in there by yourself"" can be seen as too dangerous by a woman alone)
This is not stoicism. This looks like a ""I don't know what to say because I cannot come up with a scenario"" type of situation. 
When you report to the police you need to be concise, clear, and state facts. She was droning on about ""maybe this is happening, maybe that"", while claiming that she got the facts from the victim. Therefore how can you be unsure of what's happening, if the victim herself said it to you? (which opens a whole new set of questions, chiefly why aren't you going inside the building, getting the building manager involved, the security, or whoever is in charge of that apartment complex, to actually confirm, with your own eyes, what's going on. I personally would have stormed that apartment myself, but again that's me). It smells fishy, her main concern was to remain anonymous, not state facts. The operator had to pry the answers from her (which sometimes happens, since callers might have troubles recalling the incident, but couple that with her fixation on being anonymous, and her lack of any emotional response at any level, it is more than just a coincidence).
I don't know how many calls you've heard in your life (there's hundreds of recorded calls on here, if you want to look at some), but none, litterally none of them, go on like this. 


At the end of the day, facts being as they are, it is a credible assumption that this call was completely false, made to have a backup evidence on the alleged assault. It all rests upon Amber's words, and she doesn't have a very good track record in that department, she has a documented history of abuse in her past relationships, Johnny does not.",2020-04-29T17:14:07Z,1
75,UgxrYClEASlrqFcfPEp4AaABAg,F E,"I think that is a bad (bordering on irresponsible) way of approaching the argument tbh. 

Like, personally, I'm not that emotional. I'm not loud. My voice doesn't lend itself to screaming or shouting even when I want to. I don't get hyped in crises. Some people are more matter of fact. Some people are stoic and just not that expressive. That doesn't mean the situation isn't dire. Isn't dramatic or urgent, etc. But even without that, there's alot of questionable factors about this call.

Focusing on things like ""if this were real, then they'd be doing XYZ""(just because that's what YOU personally would be doing) isn't helpful imo. It obfuscates and undermines things and weakens the argument.",2020-04-29T16:54:28Z,0

To think Johnny was a victim of this psycho and was such a gentleman not to have reported her sooner. What a bitch!!!",2021-04-30T16:42:58Z,1
77,UgzUmQ8eRjCyvaUViD14AaABAg,Tainiabellydance,"So here is the law about lying to 911. I wondering if Johnny depp wins, then it would open a case for all involved in calling 911. 
""The individual may also claim that he or she was just reporting an emergency, but this is itself a separate crime if the report was knowingly made of a situation that was not an emergency. The false report of an emergency is punishable under Penal Code ¬ß 148.3

The penalties to violating Penal Code ¬ß 148.5 and Penal Code ¬ß 148.3 are fairly straightforward ‚Äìa fine of up to $1,000 (plus penalties and assessments that can add up to close to $4,500). In addition, a person found in violation of Penal Code ¬ß 148.5 may be sentenced up to six months in county jail, but someone found in violation of ¬ß 148.3 can face up to a year in county jail.""",2020-04-28T14:58:59Z,11

They needed to call 911 so it can be used in court to try and prove the abuse, however if the abuse that AH was suppose to have gotten (according to AH), she would have had two severely swollen and blackened eyes, a swollen and bruised nose from where it was broken, a fat and possibly  raised and swollen lip and bruised and cuts to her face. However, there was no police report, no medical reports at all and the next day AH was on  a late night talk show. Plus Johnny had taken 2 bodyguards with him unbeknownst to AH, so the ""friend"" that she had called while was happening and who rushed to the penthouse was already in the penthouse hiding..it was just another setup on AH...",2020-04-27T18:58:03Z,13
