Johnny is here forever and anyone who wants to make money, will have Johnny in their movie. We all adore him. He is liked by many, many, many people...female and male. He is a great person. He is a very talented person.",Shanan Alexander,0,2020-10-11T20:15:05Z

6,Ugw-_vJAozO2XYyF9p94AaABAg,I believe her rule in the next movie was never the leading lady. But a secondary part. And they are probably going to wait to see if she got herself in hot water and needs to go to jail. If that is happening. Then they will fire her. Probably thinking about firing her because she lied on stand. And most of those contacts do have some kind of morals clause in them. So they can fire her anytime.,Karen Short,1,2020-10-10T04:02:45Z

And for them to dismiss her without good reason. She could sue them.
As and when the verdict is known if j. D name is cleared. Then she can and probably will be removed. As with loreal. As they will not want the backlash.. Its all eyes on the UK trial",Wendy Norris,1,2020-10-08T23:02:45Z

19,Ugxlj9ZKOxVd7h0uukJ4AaABAg,From what I read out of it is that Aquapac 2 won't start filming NO EARLIER than May 31st. I don't think that that is the actual film date basically they are saying that they will have a definite film start date by the 31st of May.,SANDI THE SASSY QUEEN,0,2020-10-08T19:18:59Z

21,UgxM84sI2ySzesdE0Rl4AaABAg,I think what will happen will be similar to what happened to Ray Park where Disney didn‚Äôt want to be involved with what happened. I think Mrs Heard will be turned away so Warner bros don‚Äôt get involved or are associated with it,MAJOT,2,2020-10-08T14:32:07Z
22,Ugz9EMDhunB4VMN9Wr14AaABAg,"I think that they are waiting to see what happens with the UK case before any decisions are made.  They know that if she is found guilty of perjury that they can't afford to use her.  I don't blame them for waiting,  they have to be careful about the whole thing.  Celebrations can only begin when Johnny has proven in court that these things did not happen.  Not to her anyway. Although,  because of people like you that are telling the truth,  we know that he never touched her.  Thank you for the great content!",Tammy Lockley,1,2020-10-08T12:48:00Z
23,UgxkOBpDu3tWlTBEZNd4AaABAg,Sure hope she's truly fired. Since WB is a business you would think they would be looking at the revenue they might lose.  Perfect karma she rightly deserves.,Patti_C,2,2020-10-08T12:29:13Z
24,UgwYav7QgoGwV7cgUcx4AaABAg,"I thought the same thing when you were talking about the movie theaters . Could you imagine if all the football, basketball, baseball, and theaters closed down for good? That's Billions of dollars just in property. I  use to have the contacts for farm fresh but now they are all shut down. All those empty buildings. All the homeless people who could use a shelter. Why can't someone put that together? There are so many vacant buildings that could be used to help people. But yet they remain empty, with the power on. I just don't understand. The power bill alone for a vacant farm fresh is in the thousands.",rachel denny,7,2020-10-08T11:38:09Z
25,UgyYyqLPsp_FlzzTrFJ4AaABAg,"Rob ......I have a feeling that Warner Bros. wants to play the game. The hype game. Publicity! They're holding on to both Johnny and Amber . They are not going to fire üî• anyone until a verdict comes down from the UK trial. It will be out before she starts filming for Aquaman 2. Then we shall see. How does that strike you, Mr. Skywalker?üòÅ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è",rachel denny,4,2020-10-08T11:21:59Z
26,UgxOoyqFCxPBAcYXqf14AaABAg,"I totally agree, I read it as saying, she's available for the case etc., as not needed on set until 31st May 2021. They were very careful with their wording, and leaving themselves an out by not putting anything specific about her schedule just in case they get enough to be able to let her go without it causing them issues with filming and further court cases of her suing them for breach of contract - especially with a lot of Woke behind her...",Julie Holland Devenport,1,2020-10-08T10:43:48Z
27,UgxZJi1cyKX84H6gKIt4AaABAg,I still think its not fair if she still in it because  they were quick  enough to drop johnny from pirates of the Caribbean and he did nothing  wrong and if is about  which film would make the most money johnny wins hands down if its between  johnny and Amber  its johnnh that will bring the money in if they were honest,Judith Hodgson,5,2020-10-08T08:33:09Z
28,UgxJZyKZp30-u97N7c94AaABAg,It could mean they want her for a short part in the film or it could mean they going to see what the outcome  of the Virginia  case is,Judith Hodgson,5,2020-10-08T08:27:08Z
29,UgxbZUkMjnFM9y4i2pF4AaABAg,"I've read the mails. All they are saying is we all have no idea whether Amber is in or out of Aquaman 2 and can confirm when production starts at the end of May 2021.  So, we all do not know anything until then. I really don't understand why people saying that these letters mean she is fired, it's not saying that at all. You are 100% right to tell people NOT to celebrate, it's too premature based on lack of info.  

Ugh. She NEEDS to be fired though. Massively fired. Replace her and people will rejoice and support the movie further.",EAprima,4,2020-10-08T07:45:05Z
30,UgxzgeiUmBMl8ZEeI1d4AaABAg,Have you heard about Johnny's latest filing to the courts re a dismissal of Amber's counter case? If you look to Comic Geek Some and his latest video called JD's legal team SLAPPS the others hard. Johnnys lawyer is just awesome,ann brown,12,2020-10-08T06:32:39Z

35,UgzkDSMo4E48alpanvV4AaABAg,I know I will never see Aquaman 2 if she is in or not because of what she did to Johnny Depp I will never see anything she is in or support AH in any way,Megan O'Shea,18,2020-10-08T05:18:57Z
36,UgzdNFv3CUKKiSy0qcp4AaABAg,"I don't think anyone should jump to conclusion either way right now.  I think WB is keeping silent and being evasive with regard to üí©s role (or lack of) in Aqua2 until the time draws nearer. 
 I do find it *interesting* that WB spoke dirrectly about Johnny's ""required"" involvement in FB3 but have said nothing decisive about üí©.  Also, if Aqua2 is going to film in Austrailua, that could pose a unique (excuse me while I snicker) problem for having her in the film. 
Bottom line, I think everyone would be better off if we all just wait and see.",Denise Metzger,8,2020-10-08T05:17:34Z
37,Ugyq1RZVwVnF4FSVlwp4AaABAg,"Nicely done Rob! I think it still a possibility she'll be fired, if she hasn't already. If Aquaman 2 films in Australia again, will she been allowed back there without being arrested for lying about her dogs being snuck into their country illegally? They're stalling to see the outcome the trials. That's my opinion.",Donald Dolan,23,2020-10-08T05:13:21Z
38,UgzYjhRenViYzgwAMzR4AaABAg,"I think they are keeping silent until the court ruling, maybe that will determine what they do with her. But... I think they are filming in Australia and she can‚Äôt show her face there now, so what is poor Turdy gonna do? I hope she has to break contract because Australia doesn‚Äôt want her. üòÇ",Witchy One,24,2020-10-08T05:08:57Z
