A part of me worries she'll seduce Jason and help break up another marriage. Don't get me wrong Johnny should have behaved himself too but when an abusive narcissist wants something they will pull all the stops to get what they want. And once they have charmed someone they start to pick them apart, micromanage them, and if they can't control them completely that's when the abuse starts. From what I can tell Depp is a very easy-going generous person. But in his own words, it seems he saw through her manipulative behavior but still tried to see the best in her and love her like most deeply empathic people do. I'm proud he found the strength to eventually end things with her and hope in time he can fully heal.",2021-08-19T16:55:59Z,7

As far as their character of the type of person they are in real life. She has tried to ruin and is ruining Johnny Depp's life and he's losing movie roles, when it should be her. They have it on tape, they have proof that she was the abuser. They have proof that she's lied many many times. Why in the world would you support someone like that? That's just like all these actors in the past few years that have totally lost their careers because of their sexual conduct or whatever they've done like Kevin Spacey and the Weinstein's and there's so many others it is ridiculous. No one wants anything to do with them. Because they should not be able to gain any kind of fandom or money from being of such immoral character in real life. When you support the movies they're in, you're supporting them. I love Jason Momoa I love all the other characters, but I refuse to watch a movie with her in it. That's what she wants, she wants to get her way and she wants to ruin Johnny Depp. I think she's wanted to ruin him from the beginning. And she's so arrogant about it it's unbelievable. And they've already proven what a console Johnny Depp is and I have been watching him cuz I was a teenager nothing has ever been said bad about him even by his ex's his friends his family or anyone. And he helps so many people without seeking notoriety for it. They even have it on police cam that she lied. She committed perjury on the stand. That is a jailable offense. I'm definitely not going to help pay her salary. And the rest of the cast are millionaires so they don't need the money because I'm pretty sure this movie is going to be a flop because they're letting her stay in that part.",2021-07-07T18:10:33Z,2
