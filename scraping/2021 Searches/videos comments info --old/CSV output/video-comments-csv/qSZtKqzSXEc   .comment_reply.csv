8,UgxPF7a4w409Wx2Y_Ql4AaABAg,Colin Riddell,"@Hudson Chalmers as mentioned, the guns were old and you cant compare to the weapon, new, inside the tank, whereas these were open to the elements and, believe me, a helicopter can throw up immense dirt and rubbish, as it approaches the ground especially is the area it's dry. This doesn't take long for the weapon to accumulate masses of dirt. Plus format yankee much to jam up a weapon, any weapon, bar the AK, thus daily cleaning of a weapon essential!",2021-08-07T05:06:15Z,1
9,UgxPF7a4w409Wx2Y_Ql4AaABAg,Eternal Peace,"@Hudson Chalmers I was to say the same thing..one takes a chance with old equipment, the WW2 guns would have been brand new..",2021-08-01T21:49:33Z,1
10,UgxPF7a4w409Wx2Y_Ql4AaABAg,Hudson Chalmers,The ones mentioned WERE OLD not sure how well they could be refurbished? Perhaps the 4 barrel configuration and synchronisation was the problem for Stoppages. My cousin was armourer at the BSAP and he could fix anything?,2021-08-01T13:38:58Z,1

12,UgwiQ8YZExBTMSX1es94AaABAg,Chris Jones,"Just a point about encumbrance.  Western democracies are desperate to keep casualties down, especially fatalities. Of course the soldier likes that but the degradation in performance has to be a factor in individual soldier performance.",2021-08-01T22:05:21Z,2
13,UgwiQ8YZExBTMSX1es94AaABAg,nigel henson,"Interesting question.
Remember, Vietnam was unfolding at more or less the same time as our conflict.
The Americans used helos well,within the aircraft limitations.
The keys to successful airborne assaults ,whatever size the conflict is,remains the domination of the airspace,and the suppression of the target and it's surrounds....then many things are possible. The sheer weight of numbers in Vietnam made airborne assaults of a Battalion or more commonplace.

It also brought out that these type of actions using lightly armed soldiers should be of defined duration.
The mistakes made in Iraq and Afghanistan were very apparent....the infantryman was too encumbered with gear and other crap to really be effective.

Airborne assaults too often are confused with the employment of the conventional infantryman. Airborne assault teams need to be  very specialised units...not grunts who flew about in helos.",2021-08-01T16:00:40Z,4

15,UgzH4eqqn4RRFn5Gz3l4AaABAg,Tim Rogers,@Colcol hendy Loyal and fearless in the face of extreme danger. That is the mark of a true companion-in-arms. Never leave a mate behind for the enemy to torture and kill.,2021-08-01T20:58:34Z,2
