Its heartbreaking as I loved her casting but I dont want to support what she has done. I just pray that Hollywoke dont do something like blackwash Mera cause shes a redhead and Hollywoke hates redheads for some reason.. if they find someone who looks and acts just like the comic character and respects the source material, then im all for it.

If WB values their Box office numbers they should replace her. Cause it WILL affect the box office no matter what they say or do if they keep her.",Corey Mckee,4,2020-03-17T18:13:36Z
