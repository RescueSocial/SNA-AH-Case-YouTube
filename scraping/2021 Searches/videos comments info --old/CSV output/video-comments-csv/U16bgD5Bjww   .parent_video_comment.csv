1,Ugyg-Xr-w-xx0DsQbaV4AaABAg,She wanted to keep most of  it for herself because she would need it to pay for her lawyers and probably pay off the judges who where on her side. Karma is coming her way 😅😅😅,Helen Henshaw,1,2021-05-24T09:25:13Z

3,UgzPPHEhByAmf-MjIbV4AaABAg,"Since she claimed to have donated 7 millions dollars already. Then are claim that she pledged to donate it over a period of time should automatically make her not trust worthy. As she as benefited from the public support and the former judge that she had already donated the money. She never claimed that the donation will be over a period until she was bursted. Make her testimony questionable, can't be considered trust unworthy of any other testimony as she can change like a camellion depending on the situation and conditions. She will continue lying to cover up her former lies which makes all her testimony not worthy to be trusted. If she can lie blatantly on trivial issues why won't she lie on major issues. Besides she didn't present any proof only questionable testimony.",Yusuf Rosheed,3,2021-05-21T23:07:08Z
4,Ugz-xLLI3CIcUBkJV714AaABAg,I would pay good money to see the face of crooked British Judge Nicol after the LAPD police body-cam footage was released... Having previously rejected the testimony of the 4 police officers under oath because they did not document the event at the time... Hope you made a lot of money from your friend and your son employer... Rupert Murdoch owner of the Sun Newspaper and FoxNews... for your corrupt ruling against Johnny Depp as a wife beater.... Mr. newly retired judge... Ruling in favor of this dangerous narcissist pervert Amber Heard that is lying as she breathe,Guy Mercier,0,2021-05-21T19:03:48Z
