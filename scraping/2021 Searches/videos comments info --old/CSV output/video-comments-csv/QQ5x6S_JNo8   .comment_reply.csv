99,UgzU7-cap3LeepAE1r54AaABAg,Krystal Rowan,"@Stevie J Raw Definitely!! She has negatively affected so many people who have experienced legitimate abuse and violence with her lying to get one over Johnny.

 It's already hard enough for people to speak up and fight the victim blaming often attached with taking it to court, she has made it all the more difficult and she saw an opportunity with the MeToo movement and went for it to elevate herself because deep down she knows she will never have nearly as much success as him without taking him down. 

I don't know about you but I felt off negative vibes about her when her accusations first came out and not the conditioned victim blaming that often happens when people don't believe victims, like I could sense her manipulation, exploiting and gaslighting and now the truth has come out. It's heartbreaking that she may have affected the legitimate victims who have been speaking up, one thing I hope that can be learned from this on a major scale is to be more inclusive towards men and boys who experience violence by women and to create safety for them to come forward and anyone regardless of gender.",2020-08-16T11:38:43Z,0

Ip Man learned other styles of Kung Fu. But what he is known for the most is he is the man that trained Bruce Lee,which is is still said to be the fastest Martial Artist ever. Bruce made his own style comprised of many forms of Kung Fu, which is a Chinese Martial Art... Ip Man just came from a time area that treated women with respect. He treated everyone with respect even when they did not deserve it. IF YOU LIKE MARTIAL ARTS MOVIES THE YOU'LL LIKE THESE BUT... MY INITIAL COMMENT WAS A LOOSE JOKE, ALTHOUGH IP WAS A GREAT MAN STUDENT BEFORE TEACHER. AND LOVED BY EVERYONE THAT KNEW HIM.... I don't think it's necessary to check him out based in the Depp cases... I just threw Ip Man in there cuz I love the man he was when he was alive... So please don't think he has anything to do with anything about women's right or women getting beat except he NEVER do beat a woman. And only took challenges of Martial Arts. If you wanna ask me quest about Up Man I might know as much a Wikipedia about him, that is if you don't wanna watch the movies that are supposed to be biographical but very very loose and added stuff.

The TMZ video where he is so upset, was over finding out the Mandels had stolen $650 Mill over nearly 20 yrs, he did win in court, but they were investigated by the FEDS for money laundering, bank theft, & stealing money. The TMZ video was old, but she tried to make it look recent. The business meeting was over the fact TMG (the Mandels, his management company) didn't pay his taxes, & he owed $750 MILL!! 
 He left her, but she chose to leave then & not fight him to stay together, because she got Aquaman, had Musk lined up & waiting, wanted to kick him when he was down because his Mom just died, her attorney drew up papers that blackmailed him asking for $50,000 a mo, 3 Condos (for her lying friends), the car, money for all kinds of allowances (clothing, etc) & if he didn't give in, she would drag his name through the mud. His friend Doug Stanhope was there that night, & thought he was depressed about the death of his Mother, but he told him Amber was leaving him & blackmailing him threatening to drag his name through the mud.

To be fair what has  happened to Johnny is really in essence no different to what is happening to many people world wide. The only real difference is that his plight is being played out upon the world's stage. I guess this must only intensify the pressure. The upshot of this is that he breaks the taboo of men suffering as victims of domestic abuse and he could use his celebrity status to be one a powerful ambassador for challenging it within society. However the most important thing before this, his career and all is his physical health and his mental health. He needs to get to the root of what is causing his addictions. It is not enough to just kick habits as the chances are a person will only relapse. I read an absolute horror story about this horror of a so called woman actually withholding Johnny's medication from him while he was in the Bahamas trying to detox. Please excuse my language Stupid thick bitch is she insane? She could have actually killed Johnny. She must gave literally just been getting off on seeing him suffer.

392,UgwD6R8CY2SrHhRzg-14AaABAg,gaysy1st,"@Lilyanna Firstly, nothing comes up on your 'link'. Answering your statements, 
The headbutt incident was when he was struggling with her & they bashed heads. There is audio of him apologising to her that they cracked heads. The fact that it is referred to as a headbutt, makes it sound deliberate.
The guy named Judge also said that what he saw on her arms, he thought were self inflicted scratches. She would still have scars now & I can't say I've noticed any. The audio after she cut his finger, clearly shows that Judge thinks she's crazy & that they have to get Johnny away from her.
Johnny DID say that he was responsible for his severed finger. That was the story agreed by him & his staff, for the benefit of the production company. All his staff have said in court papers that this was the case. The production company wouldn't have taken kindly to knowing that he was having domestic violence problem at home whilst filming.
Heard often had bleeding lips due to an acne product she used on her face. Perhaps this is what the nurse saw. 
The make up artist on the JC show, said in court papers the exact opposite of your claim. She saw not one mark on Heard's face. 
I don't know anything about drugs/violence towards his staff. I havent heard of that, so can't comment.
The text saying that he hates it when he jumps & WORSE when SHE jumps, doesn't tell us anything, except that he's sorry for the argument. He jumps with words, she jumps with physicality. 
Heard's neighbours may well have seen marks on her. It's been established that much of it was self inflicted & some if it even done with makeup. For marks to appear, disappear & appear again, proves that someone is messing about with makeup. 
You can't believe anything Raquel Pennington or Joshua Drew have to say as they will clearly lie for her. Just like her Sister, who she made lie about the incident on the stairs. She made Whitney turn the story around entirely. Whitney told another friend that she feared for Johnny's life & couldn't understand why he stayed with Heard. They all had lost a lot, because they'd all been living rent free in Johnny's properties for over a year. That in itself is not what an abusive person does. They isolate you from family & friends, so that there are no witnesses to the abuse. 
In court papers his staff have said that when they heard her screaming ""Get off me, stop hitting me"" they burst into the room to find Johnny standing 20 feet away from her. Realising she'd been rumbled, she changed to saying ""Don't hit me again"".
The text messages between him & a friend did apparently say something along the lines of ""We'll set her on fire, then drown her"". If people are trying to imply that this was 'a plan', I think that's ridiculous. I believe he was letting off steam by saying outrageous things.
I haven't heard anything about him assaulting anybody in Canada though, or the Ellen Barkin story.",2020-08-20T10:26:04Z,1

421,UgxIiXSQLEB_j8z6p7R4AaABAg,Lilyanna,"The other side of the evidence (that Depp might be at least partially guilty)

A recording in July 2016, can hear Depp saying to Amber: ""I headbutted you in the forehead. That doesn't break a nose"".

Johnny‚Äôs security guard Jerry Judge could be heard on the five-hour recording taken in the house in Australia saying that ‚Äúhe saw cuts on Ms Heard‚Äôs arms‚Äù and Amber had permanent scars on her arms 

Johnny said in a text that his severed finger came from him throwing a bottle, but now says it was Amber

A couple of years ago he¬†was sued sued by his bodyguards for being violent toward them and forcing them to transport narcotics for him (he eventually settled out of court), and as of 2019 he is being sued for attacking a locations manager on a film set.

There is a tape of Johnny‚Äôs witness saying that they were pressured to give evidence for him 

A Nurse who saw Amber just after she said that Johnny had attacked her noted that she had bleeding to her lip

Johnny texted Amber saying ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt be more sorry for yet again ruining your day. I always regret when I jump or worse, when you jump. I‚Äôm a f****** savage.‚Äù

Make up artist Melanie Inglessis said she helped Amber cover up bruises and marks before the James Cordon show

Ambers neighbor says she saw her with injuries the night the police were called 

Raquel Pennington told him Mr Depp had 'shoved her' and he 'got angry' and went and 'banged on the door' of another apartment before going back to his own.

Joshua Drew said to Johnny‚Äôs bodyguard something like, 'He beat the shit out of her again and you guys stood by and watched it'.
and he responded ‚Äúit's not his business, they are husband and wife‚Äù 

Depp texted he was going to ‚Äúsmack the ugly cunt around‚Äù

Ellen Barkin claims Depp threw a wine bottle across a hotel room during a fight with friends.

Assaulted a man in Canada in the 80‚Äôs who asked a group of people to leave a party at a hotel  

Johnny was arrested for threatening people in London in 1999 

Johnny‚Äôs manager texted Amber Manager - ""When I told him he kicked you, he cried. It was disgusting. And he knows it.""

Screen shots of Staff supported Amber and said she was kicked, hit, and crying, but they were too afraid to witness.¬†https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Gy4Pw8yoPVsY3T2VZs_ZQp_9_-FMYwIE¬†and¬†https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2qFCFd-5C8",2020-08-19T16:47:28Z,0

439,UgxAB--LVlrr3Jgbq0l4AaABAg,Anna,"@Tangerine Yes in the US he will have a jury of people. I want to inform you Amber has already give the UK court every 'proof' and testimony she had against him (almost everything worked against her. The famous frontal photo for example, the one in which she claimed to have a broken nose, and if you look at the brownish shadows on her nek they have the same shade, it means color correction, that is just one photo of some in the same bathroom and all the other ones has been so color adjusted that came out pink or purple, and the shade on her face looks like someone smashed pizza on her. It's a poor job, she used her phone to accentuate contrast. Media showed us just the more credible -not for me- of the bunch) witnesses also contrsdict themselves so much they lose their credibility as witnesses. JD's lawyers, on the othe hand, they have proofs against Amber they didn't show already, because the trial was against the Sun, accused of ruining Depp's carreer and life (his honor) by publishing an article without verify the facts. If JD wins it's a good thing and they can use it as a plus in US, if they lose it, they just lose against a news paper who claimed innocense about publishing something private they culdn't verify better, based on proofs they didn't know were fake. The two trials have very different meanings.
The medias coverage og this entire case it's been a joke all arownd the world, even while the trial was going on they kept on reporting the same narrative of a young woman victim of a famous man, the Sun is property of Murdoch's son, and his father is the owner of Sky, and they're friend and involved in the Tesla company, owned by Musk...do you see the pattern? Here in Italy this case is not a big one but a couple of papers I look at (for other reasons) pushed her narrative, again, becsuse reporters just read the articles published in UK and their truth is based on that, too much work to read all the papers, all the depositions leaked. Despite all that, common people are starting to see the whole picture now, because there are too many things fishy on Amber's narrative, first of all: with all that damage she suffer, for years, why not call a doctor even once? And with all those cameras around (not her own) and add the naked photos of her (if p*rn is not a problem, try serach for them and have a look) that leaked, how it is she cannot show a real injury? Just shadows? The only two photos with real damage are: one with a single drop of blood on her lower lip (the same when I have dry lips, and it's proven she suffered from dry lips, csused by the prescribed drugs she was taking, that have lip dryness as collateral effect. Also, I did combat sports all my life and when they bust your lips the blood is much more and usually lips broke from the inside, it' unusual to have a scratch almost on the external line of the lip as the only damage, but it can happen if you use an object, but it cannot be so small if Depp punched -she claimed to have been punched- with a fist full of big rings. It's too external for a hand hit, and too small for rings that big) The other real photo af a damage it shows a piece of scalp with a little redness and pus all over...now, she did photographed a bunch of hair on the floor and show them to a witness (without showing her scalp) it's been analysed and those 'ripped' hair has no roots, that means they have been cut (I say extensions) she wasn't examined by anyone on her head, but after years a photo of a blond scalp emerged...just one photo of hair, no face attached (her sister maybe? She beat the sh't out of her sister regularly fron what we know now) another thing is that pus is not produced immediately after a bruise, it take times to batcteria to reproduce, and she claimed that image is been taken right after the incident, also...the blobd hair on the unknown head and the hair cut on the floor doesn't match in blondness (they have a different darker shade at the base). If she was the one documenting all this stuff for years, why didn't take photos of the progression of the bruises? Why don't take videos in front of a window, with sunlight, the best light to take photos. With her job she should know how it works. 
It's very unlikely for her to legally win anything. If she win, in this conditions, someone is been corrupted! But anyway, Depp's purpose is clear his name, make his version and his proofs public, finally, because he never wanted to ruin her life or her carreer until the time (we have an audio) he realize the plotted the entire thing from the beginning (when she secretely told her assistant she was the partner of just a fat, old guy) is in that moment he said: you faked everything, you never existed, it was all just in my head...I'm gonna destroy you. After calming down, he's just been concerned about his reputation in front of his children, his loved ones and the world, he said it himself: I can live as a kitchen cabinets beater, I cannot live as a wife beater. And all the people he knows personally (she send a private investigator all around the world to find dirt on him, and in court they even asked him about Phoenix death...the lower of the lowest of moves, shame on them!) only talk good about him, no one complained, at least hundred people have been secretly investigated about him, no one said a single bad thing, just one who said he can be late on set and that he, during the filming of Pirate of Caribbean 4 was calling the shots multiple times, interrupting frequently the one they were in, because....his female collegue (Cruz) was some months pregnant and he wanted to be extra sure she was ok on a boat under the sun.....that's what we're talking about! He was extra protective of a pregnant woman, so he was interrupting long takes...I mean...sticazzi!

When the story first broke, I believe it was with the TMZ video which had been severely edited as we know by now. Johnny was immediately dropped from pirates. Now the main stream media still is not reporting on it much because they don't want to admit they were wrong. There were segments about it on Court TV, and at the beginning they were all dead set against  Johnny, but they got a clip where Amber said she started physical fights.
