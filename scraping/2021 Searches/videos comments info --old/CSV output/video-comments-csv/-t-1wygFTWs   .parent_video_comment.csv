And yes, I know I interrupted this guest too much. This was only my second interview ever, and I just started my channel in January. I hope you'll give my more recent interviews a watch and see that I have improved my interview skills significantly since this one. :)

If, God forbid, you had ever been in any sort of relationship with these reptilians in human desguise, you would believe any single word abuse victims say. Because  all people with narcissistic or antisocial disorders act exactly the same. They have the same behavior patterns and you are able to reconginise these patterns, when you hear other victims stories.",eLLeNNa 11,0,2021-11-21T17:28:04Z

I never in a million years would have thought it was marylin manson I was talking to, because hes so sane and so grounded. Hes like a dad a gruff dad. I was in an abusive marraige to a muslim man who I loved very much, but we had other people putting us in a very bad situation with some people harrassing my family. Him and two others tried to talk me into getting my kids out indirectly. They were so annoying you know, so annoying, caused me so much trouble, they invaded my privacy, probably broke some laws, but I'll love those boys till the day I die , because they were the only people who risked anything to help.

23,UgyLs71cwN3UaH2kSdx4AaABAg,"This interview is very well done. You weren't afraid to ask questions that were difficult to answer and didn't beat around the bush any all while remaining respectful and polite. Paula seems like a lovely person inside and out, and it is good to get another woman's perspective on a situation like this. She's known Manson and been around him more than most the people making the accusations which speaks volumes. Somebody like Paula seems like a woman who absolutely would say something if she saw another person being abused, be it her boss or not. I maybe biased when I say this, but I don't think I am, I am thinkin' he's innocent. Honestly I cried when I found out about this because I believed it - at first. We are conditioned to believe these types of accusations at first, which isn't entirely a bad thing. We should believe victims. However there has to be proof to believe in anything. I say I maybe biased coz I have been a Manson fan since I was 12 or 13. He helped me gather the courage to be my true authentic self and come out of the closet as a trans man and also to not be forced to follow traditional gender conformity . It inspired me greatly growing to be able to enjoy his visual, lyrical and musical art pieces. He often inspired my own art. So truly & sincerely hope all it is proven he isn't guilty. I am heart broken that this has happened to somebody I hold dear as an artist and childhood hero.

24,UgyfU2bXs31Bto3wob94AaABAg,"Everybody has a right to believe what they will, but i really don't appreciate you laughing and diminishing the accusers (whom I  believe are victims). You presume Manson is not guilty but you have no proof of his innocence therefore it is very harsh and inappropriate to ridicule these women's claims.

146,UgwBtV0EWKSjxLqglyl4AaABAg,"So... I watched all your videos as a huge Manson fan and all... but this interview proved big time you are biased beyond words (even to the point of actually justifying violence) and it also proves (ironically) that Manson is not that innocent. I think she made a huge mistake by talking to you actually. He obviously groomed her since she was 17. He asked for her contact info and kept in contact for years. She put up with all his shit because she was smitten by him, a fan since she was 11. When she stood up to him cuz she got mad (she never explained the reason btw) he immediately apologized and love bombed her. He got matching tattoos with the girl who wanted to kill herself to placate her. Typical abuser behavior. This ex assistant also contradicted herself many times but the most important thing: ""SHE WAS NEVER THERE"". She was not that close to Manson either. How would she know how many months a relationship lasted or whom he met??? The bad girl room was indeed a soundproof room, it makes sense he used it as a studio. Everything adds up. I could go on but please refrain from mentioning Depp. That man is innocent and you are damaging him when you use him to defend an actual abuser. I bet Depp himself had no idea who Manson was behind closed doors. You also never mention the claims of other victims with proof. Like that one guy who said he was terrorized by him for years because Manson thought he liked Evan. He has emails and texts. I strongly believe he got into a crisis after he divorced Dita and lost his mind. Again, this comes from a fan. His own staff and management left him because they know the real truth not this ""fan"" who was called whenever he had to do grocery shopping.

She said it herself, they weren't friends. She was Marilyn's employee...why on earth would she have confided in her abuser's employee who she isn't friends with. The way she speaks about people who he's dated and she doesn't see what he saw in them leads me to believe she has feelings for him herself. She also contradicts herself when she said she didn't understand why a girl flew in for just a couple hours to see him and then later says ""wouldn't you want to spend as much time as possible, even if it's just a quick hello in between shows""?? Um okay. She also very clearly doesn't understand volatile intense abusive relationships, because it doesn't NEED to make sense that one minute she's claiming he was horrible to her then they were hanging out then they broke up then later got matching tattoos with him. THAT'S EXACTLY HOW RELATIONSHIPS LIKE THAT WORK. She's the least credible person to talk to imaginable, this is all just her opinion and sounds like gossip.

248,UgyGYRkib3pAMVl4Ze54AaABAg,"Such a terribly biased interview by a very very bad interviewer. I could not listen for more than 35 minutes. The ways she glorifies everything MM does and meanwhile belittles the horrible experiences his victims suffered just makes my blood boil. Stupid little comments on very serious accusations and even laughing it off at some points - super unprofessional and incredibly ignorant and pathetic. 
Paula tells her own experience, which was solely professional with MM. She makes it clear that she was not around a lot and of course not involved in his personal relationships too much, and its okay. As in most cases, people from outside (even those who feel somewhat close to any of the parties) do not realize what is going on really inside the abusive relationship. She can tell what she saw but not what happened to ERW or any of the other women accusing MM.
And please stop blaming the victims finally! No one deserves mental and physical torture because they happen to enjoy attention or even if they were the ones initiating contact. No one deserves to be humiliated - and its only the victims right to decide what is humiliation and what isn't.

258,Ugwii3bnqC9zQvFiy0x4AaABAg,"I don't disbelieve Paula and I respect her share. However, there's a couple of things about this interview that really rub me the wrong way. 
And unfortunately, they mostly have to do with the interviewer. 
******Why does it take you forever to set the timeline and framework for these stories?! She starts off with the first time they meet and you wait until much later (and interrupt her) to ask her. You're incredibly casual, brief, and abruptly cut her off. It's as if you are already becoming defensive about the fact that she IS under age at the time. And then you just shuffle over it---- this makes this relationship very questionable-- YET-you never ask her more details about this? And instead, completely u-turn the conversation? These parts are actually incredibly important. She's supposedly 17 (possibly younger) and you have her quickly jumping over ""let me get your information"" ""long phone calls"" ""going to his house for photo shoots""---????? What? What kind of photoshoots? We're they like the ones she is notorious for-- as an underage person? With a very powerful and influential person? Um.... What? And the artwork of her? Nude? Was that made at that time? 
** When you abruptly and awkwardly interrupt her to ask her if they have had sex*** 
And she says no, and doesn't have a chance to even finish before you cut her off and go on about how this makes her more believable? 
What in the actual.... What does that mean? You understand that reflects like you think his accusers are not believable because they had a sexual relationship with him....? What? 
You constantly interrupt her when you feel like she offers YOU what YOU want to hear like when she says he's ""empathetic"" and you have her loose her train of thought to stop and marinade on how empathetic he is. And it comes off super unauthentic. 

I will say this, I'm not going to say she's lying or anything, I think she's a decent person/friend. I also get vibes from her that she DOES actually have some hidden secret about her relationship with him. Just by her nervousness when talking about their interactions when she was younger. Yet theres none of this when she's discussing the following events which do not involve her.
I do think it's tacky for her to talk about things that she doesn't really know about. She wasn't there. She actually just seems very dismissive of these women in his life as if they weren't very important or present..... Yet, we all know that's not true. So.... Yeahhhhh....  
Lots of red flags. Lots.

The way she talks about how they got famous off of him and then ""turned on him"". Just makes me feel like something did happen to her that shes now made her peace with it and is still thankful to him for the opportunities he's given her. 
And the whole bit about how she was manipulated when she was five and that these women ""knew"" what they were getting themselves into. I just want to point out that not everyone does and people can get swept up into manipulations. And if she truly didn't have a relationship with him, maybe that's the reason why he didn't--- because she was aware.

I work with victims of abuse and mental health patients on a regular basis. Different jurisdictions have different policies pertaining to mental health patients assessments and treatment. It‚Äôs impossible to make a comment regarding a specific patients treatment unless you are the treating doctor treating. Just to inform you, a patient on a 72 hour mental health hold is often taken to a local hospital ER where they stay in a regular hospital room. Other than not being allowed to leave, they are generally treated as any other patient would be, including access to a phone. It‚Äôs not fair to doubt the woman‚Äôs story simply because she was still able to contact Manson during her stay at the hospital.

Because of the dependence on drugs and alcohol. Being an addict brings out the worst in people. Colonel Kurtz I do appreciate your opposing views and research.

331,Ugye3IGKTQqMmwS44xB4AaABAg,"I've been into NIN and industrial goth and metal as well as write it since I was a kid. I am also a Christian who is NOT Liberal at all and have issues with Manson, Reznor, and Keenan. But I also like a lot about them too. I'm about the truth. And it's easy to demonize someone who's a infamous artist while people meanwhile follow real psychopaths in office and talking heads on the news because suit and tie. I have also been a Dom with consenting girlfriends in the past. I have zero tolerance on abuse of women or children. 

False claims like Evan Rachel Wood make it harder for those who are legit victims seeking help. It's like Jerry Springersploitation. We have liberal leftist chicks on Twitter tweeting domination fetishes they pursue and want but encourage to flip the script if the ""sex or attention wasn't up to par"". So consider there's a lot of that going on. Trust me, it goes both ways. 

Same with Johnny Depp. Like/hate view of him. Hate association with Hunter S. Thompson. But on the other hand, Amber is full of it. I would believe Amber Heard would be a mother of darkness before one of their victims. 

I am MILITANTLY against lucifer and the new world order to the bone with edge and zero compromise. But let me school any would be readers of something. The Bible in context of ""thou shall not judge"" is ONLY forbidding ASSUMING and HYPOCRITICAL judgement only. But we are ORDERED to call out all evil that's open, investigated, exposed. It's not rocket science.
 And as for the hoard of accusers based on character and evidence this far, Manson and Depp are innocent and this is looking more and more by a bunch of opportunists who are giving the trash of Kardashian a run for the money. And THAT takes a whole other level of tacky. Sometimes the real evil has zero tats and makeup. Sociopaths and psychopaths come in young female flavor too.

344,Ugz2PSAVrMf5fIK6BbZ4AaABAg,"Thank you for this great interview. It allows us to get great perspective from someone who interacted with Marilyn Manson. And though I am not a big fan of his music, I am always interested in learning about anyone, including Marilyn and his work as he has been demonised in the 1990s by certain controversial media scumbags like trash talk show host Jenny Jones.
As for Evan Rachel Wood, I have never loved that woman as she always has a demonization agenda on others like Michael Jackson, Woody Allen (with whom she had no problem working with), Kobe Bryant, and others. Furthermore, her friendship with Amber Turd shows how much she has no problem interacting and befriending abusive individuals. As I know she is part of a big family of actors and actresses, I think that woman is not as innocent as she acts like to be. To me, she knows how the business works and she has an agenda. Like Paula, I think people who throw allegations on social media without doing anything serious, like going to authorities, are very dishonest and just exploit gossip culture to spit on others while building their careers.


And like Paula, one only has to look at the Hollywood culture, whether in real life or on social media, to see how so many of these Hollywood people are opportunists who build friendships they can backstab fast to build their careers. These are not the kind of people I want to be friends with and these are people I'd think anyone should be very careful when interacting with.
With Amber, it is nice to know more about how she and her dad behave. And to me, it is funny how Amber acts a sort of feminism that contradicts itself as she constantly needs the presence of Johnny, yet thinks that a woman should not rely on a man (ex: giving him a plate of food). And that she has the audacity to lie about the Thanksgiving cooking, and her massive wine drinking like she did in Court, shows how much she is dishonest with others.


By the way, it is nice of you to mention the Michael Jackson cases and showing support for MJ. Because it is always worth noting how ALL the accusers throwing allegations about MJ have also been denounced for various criminal activities they did on other people (ex: Evan Chandler drugging his patients and assaulting them, Evan Chandler assaulting his son, The Arvizos and their scamming tactics and false allegations on companies, Wade Robson and his ""Uncle Pervy"" allegations told by colleagues and dancers who worked and met him, and James Safechuck's family being sued by business associates for fraud). And it is worth noting how so many of these people who met and denounced these accusers had nothing to do with Michael Jackson. It shows how even people who are not linked to MJ are ready to denounce these people.
 
Have you taken time to see Square One MJ, Lies of Leaving Neverland, Michael Jackson the Footage You Were Never Meant To See, Michael Jackson Humanitarian, and Michael Jackson Home Videos? These are great docs that help you learn many great facts about him. As someone who studied MJ since 2019 and consulted the testimonials of more than 150 people who shared their experience with Michael Jackson (work, friendship, family, fan, etc.) and whose interviews are in podcasts, books, websites, tv shows, etc, I noticed right away how they all had good things to say about Michael; and how those people who interacted with the accusers (Arvizos, Robsons, Safechucks, Chandlers) also had all had negative experiences with them as well and denounced several of their lies as they were interacting with the accusers on the specific dates mentioned in their allegations.
Thank you for doing this great interview. Have a nice weekend. Sincerely, Simon.",Simon Barr√©-Brisebois,2,2021-04-01T16:46:37Z

372,UgzRr24sBe7os0-i-NZ4AaABAg,"Let‚Äôs just think for a second. AH tried to destroy Johnny a Depp. Johnny and Marilyn Manson have been awesome friends forever. Here is my question. Are Amber and Evan Rachel Wood friends? Why, after so many years, is Marilyn now being attacked? I have a huge problem believing these broads who come our way, way, way, after the fact and throw these men under the bus and try to decimate their lives and careers. Are they that unhappy in their own lives? Do they have to have a spotlight over their heads, regardless of how they turn it on? Johnny has never had a girlfriend or wife accuse him of anything close to the fairytale AH has spun. Dita and Marilyn are still friends. Dita and his new wife, Lindsay even have pictures together with him. I don‚Äôt believe these stories for a second. If any of this was true, these women would have come out screaming when it was happening. In Johnny‚Äôs situation, the recordings pretty much tell it all. The only guilty party of any abuse is all AH. Marilyn Manson is a very interesting and intelligent man. Neither he or Johnny have to victimize a woman to entertain themselves. They are showmen. Off screen or stage, they are people just like us. Metal is more than music. I‚Äôve been a devout metal head since age 9. I can attest that the music is part of me. It doesn‚Äôt make a person become a lunatic. It‚Äôs reprehensible that these men are being drug through the gutter because of issues of women they were involved with. It‚Äôs wrong and unfair. You don‚Äôt have the right to murder lives and careers to get whatever revenge you feel is due to you.",Laura Peterson,4,2021-03-30T21:35:55Z

""I don't even know why he would be attracted to her.."" *eyeroll* *eyeroll* ... You are embarrassing yourselves beyond repair. 

I've loved Manson's music since I was a teenager, for over 20 years. But that doesn't make me delusional and it doesn't make me dismiss several women's testimonies, and on top of that the testimonies from band members, crew members and personal assistants. There are several people backing up what these women are saying. And besides that, you could just read Manson's own book, Long Hard Road Out Of Hell, where he reveals his abusive behaviors in his very own words.  

Also, don't for a second compare Johnny Depp's case to Manson's. They are two different universes. And the fact that they are good friends says nothing about either of them, people have been friends with serial killers as well and suspecting nothing.

456,UgzOvVcpeMeIP_Lng_F4AaABAg,"I don't find Amber Heard credible after having listened to numerous recordings and testimonies. But I find Marilyn Manson's accusers credible. And it's no surprise that a personal assistant did not witness the abusive behavior that multiple women allege. Abuse often happens behind closed doors. My grandmother was abused in her home with no witnesses, and everyone in her town called her a ""liar"" because they couldn't imagine her husband possibly being abusive because he was ""so soft-spoken"". Also, you liking multiple comments calling Evan Rachel Wood and Esme Bianco liars doesn't make you look very impartial. It is possible for our heroes to be abusers-- and it's even more disappointing when fans try to cover that up. It was pretty gross to see you straight-up laughing in response to some parts of Evan and Esme's stories-- making excuses like ""hE's A pRoDuCt Of ThE 90's"" for when he physically assaults band members and other people.
 The Depp accusations and Manson accusations are completely different situations-- and trying to group them together as if they're both the same situation with the same lack of support for the allegations is just stupid.",Yes Pls,7,2021-03-28T06:29:20Z

This ex assistant was never in their bedroom. Paula was never there when everything went down. So she's not a credible witness to anything with Evan because she wasn't around to see it, it's simply not a good source. Plus the tons of multiple allegations from multiple women more than 11 now from all walks of life, saying horror stories of graphic crimes that Manson committed, plus all the reporters and employees that he abused. The huge difference between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard between Marilyn Manson and Evan Rachel Wood is Johnny Depp had no other allegations against him, not at all, Manson has multiple. And also they're were all in their teen. Evan was 18 or 19, same as Manson‚Äôs victims. There's also the fact that Manson said it himself in multiple interviews.

I also believe that these ‚Äúaccusations‚Äù against Manson ARE coordinated attacks..they are all similar and these women waited how long before ‚Äúcoming forward?‚Äù Oh that‚Äôs right, they waited until Amber needed help with HER case.
As a woman, and victim of true abuse as a child, it really angers me when woman (or men), take advantage of a man, and then turn around and cry abuse.
Don‚Äôt get me wrong, it abuse occurred, the abuser needs to face consequences.
Amber is the abuser in her situation.
I‚Äôm also an advocate for dads getting custody of their kids when the moms are found to be unfit. The courts are set up to be in favor of the women. So men trying to fight anything in court, false accusations, etc, is an uphill fight from the get go. 
In Mansion‚Äôs case, he‚Äôs been targeted for standing by Johnny and they found a few women who sold out and lied. 
I think their some be repercussions for making false allegations other than having to go to court and fight for defamation of character (which is a hard charge to fight from the get go).
Most see right thru this and stand by Johnny and Mansion.
We had the MeToo movement for women who were subjected to unwanted things. But men face similar stuff. Where is their justices? These SJW would have you believe that by nature, all men are bad and corrupt. That‚Äôs a horrible concept. These are human beings, dads, sons, friends, partners.

485,UgxoyXDijhV9LZDryTt4AaABAg,"I appreciate other people's input but this whole interview has been goaded (to be like well he's too busy to be an abuser and this timeline seems weird so he could NEVER be abusive. )A good interview would not appear so biased from the interviewer and should not be pushing a narrative that"" well it sounds like they were just complaining"".Let her speak but don't blatantly side with her. That allows less manipulation to the people watching since they get to hear a point-blank perspective even if she was hypothetically a victim in this situation. While it's important to have people come out and say ""Hey I never witnessed this and this part is questionable to me"", it's dangerous to imply that every person out there is lying.  There was a guy my fiancee and I were good friends with for about 2 years and would see at his restaurant multiple times a week. He would come out smiling and excited to see us every day so whenever I saw they were hiring and I worked there. I genuinely thought I knew him because of all the time we spent at his job and outside of his job whenever he was off. While there I witnessed and experienced an insane amount of verbal abuse and found out he drove away from his last girlfriend from that abuse. I was shocked with how bad it was and stayed there for a while hoping he was just going through a phase because I truly thought this couldn't possibly be the real him. I realized I never really knew that side of him and that you may think you know people because they present themselves differently in public but they can be actually horrible. Another guy I dated I found out was a freakin pedophile who was extremely manipulative but everyone in the community didn't see this and I had strangers literally coming up and telling me to never lose him because he was such a great guy and a wonderful gentleman. People can really have different sides of them and can hide it successfully for years. While it would be super awesome if all of this was fake, the amount of overlap in the stories and the sheer amount of people does have me questioning it. There are people we find out that are abusers that get found out every year who got away with it for like 30 years with no one talking about it. If it all came out as fake that would be great but we shouldn't be totally dismissing people just because he makes great music.",Maria,48,2021-03-27T13:35:16Z

490,UgzUfaPii2eniaKvLUN4AaABAg,"I know a couple who own bar and are very friendly and lovely to their friends and have parties all the time where they are civil and you‚Äôd never know they hated each other. When everyone left they‚Äôd start fighting like cats and dogs in front of me. 

People can put on a show for outsiders! Just because they‚Äôre laughing and having fun at the party doesn‚Äôt mean they won‚Äôt change almost immediately once everyone is gone! I‚Äôve seen this kind of behaviour with abusive toxic couples.

My sense with Johnny Depp and Amber heard is that they are both pretty toxic people. He seems quite avoidant and doesn‚Äôt like to discuss issues that she tries to approach him with and she lets her temper run away from her when he won‚Äôt sit and listen to her, which most women can empathise with this.

I mean, does anyone here understand the dynamics in Narcissistic abuse relationships? I do. 

These creatures don‚Äôt show their true face to everyone, in fact they like to keep a circle of friends and people who never see them in any way other than the nice quiet misunderstood guy! 

Friends always stand up for their friends, and narcissistic abusers know this. They employ their friends to be their ‚Äòflying monkeys‚Äô as they are known as...who will do their bidding and just to be clear...narcissists do not show their controlling behaviour in front of others. 

Abusers keep it very much behind closed doors...so she wouldn‚Äôt have witnessed anything weird!

This is one personal friend standing up for him. There are MANY MANY more figures within the music scene and Hollywood who would say otherwise, who left him behind years ago because of the behaviour they witnessed!

Why would you ever expect her to say she witnessed abuse in the home? Was she in their home at the time? 

Fans never want to believe this shit about their hero‚Äôs!

If he was using fear to control them they wouldn‚Äôt speak up about it. I don‚Äôt think any of you understand the effects abuse has on human beings. 

They didn‚Äôt say he made them stay up late with him, they specifically said he would throw them out of the house if they fell asleep or administered torture devices on them! 

Maybe you‚Äôre both minimising these women‚Äôs accounts because you so desperately want to believe he‚Äôs a nice guy?

Also, there is such a thing as the vulnerable narcissist. Psychologists are now saying certain types of people with this disorder or behavioural traits can show cognitive empathy and can be hyper sensitive. Just putting that out there.
Did any of you consider that the reason she took so long to come forward is because someone who has experienced that level of abuse is usually too traumatised to speak about their ordeal for years sometimes until they have recovered and healed. 

If she was terrified of what he would do to her if she told then it might take years to work past that with a therapist, which is what she said she‚Äôs been doing for the past 11 years.
As a survivor I can also say it can take as long as it takes an individual to get to the point where she can take him to court!

I know abuse survivors who still hang out with their abuser...there‚Äôs this thing called peptide addiction and trauma bond. You might want to do some research about it! Loads of people said Ted Bundy was a nice guy as well üòÜ",Luci Bloom,5,2021-03-27T09:33:17Z

503,UgxMPFXhKEjtFQl-F9l4AaABAg,"I want to understand though, what does Evan Rachel Wood have to gain from making the allegations she's had? Unlike Amber, she's not taking Manson to court for millions of dollars. The alleged victims are only coming forward to bring awareness and trying to tell their story. People who are friends or admirers of people like Manson, at least from what I've gathered from this interview and what the allegations have been and my own personal experiences with abusive people, people like to be enablers, yes-men, and are willing to give them everything because of their charisma, intelligence, and in most cases because they like to be subservient and are drawn to familiar people and circumstances from previous trauma. She did everything he wanted. She's proud of it. Of course she's going to see the best side of him and defend him. In regards to Johnny Depp being friends with him, abusive people don't always reveal themselves to everybody. They can have a secret side that people won't know about until you're affected and targeted by it. Her tone, language, and how she describes her accounts and opinions of Evan sound like she's not telling the entire truth. If you're being abused you're not going to broadcast it in public. I try to research both sides and be objective and I can't help but to raise some eyebrows and find it all to be biased. How can she say that something didn't happen just because she didn't see it or not even be paying close enough attention? Alice Cooper said he couldn't comment on it. He only commented on his opinion about Johnny because they're best friends. Also look up what he's done to his bandmates, what he's said about women, and so on. You can be a shock rocker and do all that Hollywood 90s rock star, but there is a point where people need to stop enabling it and being like ""Oh that's just how he is. He's a product of his time."" It's laughable that they say that his alleged victims said that they were involved in kinky sex or BDSM, Evan has specifically said they were not in a kinky sex relationship. lol They did have an investigation with the FBI and although the investigations haven't come up to anything specific yet it's difficult to make a decision like that if something happened so long ago. When you hear her saying that the women who came forward were trying to get close to him to gain something or to get ahead, she said herself that she met all these people and done all these things that she wouldn't of been exposed to before. She got ahead and advanced because of her association by being around him. That sounds awfully like projection of judgment to me. Btw, I've been a fan of Manson's music for years and have seen him twice in concert and I wasn't surprised when I heard these allegations because of what kind of rock star he is. It makes too much sense. I'm not going to hate and be biased on either camp, Manson or the alleged victims. To me, it's not right when we weren't there. I believe compassion, understanding, and empathy for both sides is the best thing to do and to pay attention to these details. Let's not project our views and personal and preconceived views of him and fandom onto this.

Another point I want to make is, how come most of us if not all of us will support the women who came forward about Harvey Weinstein for instance or even Bill Cosby who has very similar allegations against them but then it's different with Manson somehow?

My 17Yr old Daughter was Killed in 2011 by an ExBf we had Restraining Orders on. He had Assaulted, Kidnapped for 2 Days/Nights on 4/3 which left her w/Fractured Cheek & Broken Jaw. After She Finally came home, in Fear of even going to Hospital/ER. A deputy had to help Convince her to go Just for Treatment on Jaw. I had Pressed Charges as Jordi was Still 17 & by Law I Could. BUT being in Court was Insane..Judges don‚Äôt know WHO to Believe I after sitting in Court.. I got It. There are Several ‚ÄòVictims‚Äô who claim to Be one But In Fact are Abusers themselves & Have every opportunity to Leave They Dont. It‚Äôs a Total Waste of Court time/Money & takes away Credibility to those Whom Truly NEED HELP. We got Temporary Restraining Order but were to Appear Back in Court on 4/27. Early Morning of 4/26 State Troopers Advised me Jordi had been Killed in Car Crash w/Her Ex Bf. Soon as I Identified her Body I Knew She Had been Asphyxiated but Autopsy Still pending. I won‚Äôt Go into Detail about the Whys Etc as it makes No Difference now & Wont Bring her Back. I was Asked to Help a Friend of Jordis who was Also Dealing w/Same but on Different level that She Did NOT want to get Away from Abuser that CLEARLY beat the $h** out of Her DAILY. I ended up Months later saving her Thru Court Systems & Extensive Counseling where i üí≠ I was going to Have Get Rid of her Bf myself. I‚Äôve Helped a Man who was Falsely accused by his wife who wanted Custody of Daughter. The Man had ‚Äú0‚Äù clue his wife planned on Leaving When Charged w/Assault.

Abusers come in all Genders Etc & there‚Äôs just as Many False Claims as There are True Victims in Desperate need of help. I‚Äôve Helped Many & Can‚Äôt Really Discuss Many Cases.

I‚Äôm Not Going to Hold My Breath having to help her. I think it‚Äôs awful he was put out onto Public Media for Allegations. I couldn‚Äôt Watch Anymore of Thw News about this. Makes me Sick. She (Ex Gf) Should‚Äôve Shown more Evidence stating FACTS which she Hasn‚Äôt. I guess that‚Äôs WHY she‚Äôs an ‚ÄúEX‚Äù Gf? I didn‚Äôt watch all of this Video.. Sorry.

516,UgyGjlY8APQXU1gMOUt4AaABAg,"*Narcissistic & Histrionic Personality Disorders*
... along with antisocial and borderline personality disorders, are part of what the¬†Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV)¬†organizes into a ‚Äúcluster‚Äù of dramatic personality disorders.

Histrionic personality disorder is defined by the¬†DSM-IV¬†as a chronic pattern of extreme emotionality and attention-seeking behaviors. The onset of histrionic personality disorder is adolescence.

According to the DSM-IV, you must meet five of these seven characteristics to be diagnosed with histrionic personality disorder:

You¬†¬†are uncomfortable in a situation where you are not the focus on attention.

Your interactions with other people are marked by overt sexuality,¬†seductiveness and/or other provocative behaviors.

You¬†¬†experience shallow and rapidly fluctuating emotions.

Your¬†speech is vague and opinions are given without any supporting details.
Your emotions and behaviors are theatrical and exaggerated.

You¬†experience changes in your behavior and speech based on the situation and people involved.

You¬†believe that your relationships are more involved than they really are.

Warning Signs:

If you have this disorder, you may describe every minor detail of your life as if it were a grand and significant event. You may seem incapable of subtlety in your dress and your gestures and/or speech may appear theatrical.

You may also lack a true sense of your own identity and revise your statements and the manner in which you speak and behave in an effort to impress whoever happens to be in your presence. You may actively seek an audience because of your constant craving for approval, praise and validation.

More than likely you exaggerate physical injuries, illnesses and/or weakness in an attempt to elicit attention from others. You may even falsely threaten to commit suicide to gain concern and sympathy from others. You may wear sexually provocative clothes and/or exhibit sexually-charged behaviors in order to get attention from the opposite sex. In addition, you may believe that a causal relationship is an intense affair or an extremely intimate friendship. If you have this disorder, you may engage in risky behaviors such promiscuity, criminal activities and drugs and/or alcohol abuse.

Despite what you may regard as a wide circle of admiring friends, this disorder is marked by an inability to forge deep, lasting relationships. The film¬†Austin Powers¬†offers quite an accurate portrayal of histrionic personality disorder.

520,UgzXZS5bKhEthDAdL954AaABAg,"One thing that Marilyn Manson taught me is how to read interviews by paying attention to the direction taken by the interviewer shown by the questions that are asked as well as the personal opinion of the interviewer and where charm and/or sarcasm is shown and inserted into the interview. The answers given are also an important way to see the dynamic between the two. How well they connected prior. It shows if they are on the same page when it comes to the purpose of the interview. But you can also see the shadow side from slightly to largely in the words chosen by the one being interviewed. 
I find body language, facial expressions, and the tone of voice to be very telling of the truth in situations. 

And I lean towards believing this lady. However that does not mean the her perspective is correct. No witness in relation to this case is going to be seen as a sort of truth seer. They aren't going to give us all of the answers we seek. They can only give us their point of view. Just as the alleged victims and the accuser. We have to learn how to look deeper than the surface of the words we hear on all sides. 

Im curious to why the interviewer believes her to be a reliable source. Did she check up on her recommendations? Lol Is it because they share the same view of ERW? Is it because this lady appears to look back on her experience as MMs personal assistant fondly? 
We should note that this fondness doesn't have any grounding in who MM actually is nor does the fondness exist within the time period she was his assistant. 
It seems to remain in her timeline before MM hired her. 
I think this could be interpreted in a certain way that would beg for more questions. 

However her expressions and her tone changes once the questions become more and more focused upon the nature of her job, her perceptions of it, and what she witnessed. 

She's merely one of the personal assistants MM has had even back during that time frame. That doesn't mean that her chances of seeing anything is higher because it's the right time frame. You all need to take into consideration that is the allegations are telling the truth then that means MM picks and chooses the people who is in his life wisely. He lets some in more than others. He feels like a different person with everyone on some level. Which is why he isn't abusive with everyone and also why not everyone (says) saw ERW in the same light. 

If MM is as he has been abused of being? He had been doing this for many years and therefore he would know how he needed to act with different people in order to protect a levels of his life that could be misconstrued. I'm sure he is able to read character well. 

I'm pretty sure She mentioned that she was never alone with him. So that automatically means that she was never close enough to him to be able to really see further what he may be like on a level where he would trust her enough to behave on any level that could be misconstrued. 

She mentioned that she encountered Dita Von Teese a couple of times, she didn't have anything at all to say about her. Which I find interesting that no one does, and she openly displayed reasons to not take her very seriously to say for sure if she was even truly commited to her own vows she made to him. Why would anyone be in a relationship with someone for 6 years and marry them for 1 year? That says to me that she didn't truly know him either, and she thought that if he ever was out of line, then she could simply change him. But she quickly learned that wasn't the case, based on her decisions, that's what it sounds like to be fair. 

Worth a mention-- Dita Von Teese deleted her recent statement about Manson from her instagram.

The first thing she said was that upon meeting ERW was that she didn't understand the attraction. Well who's attraction towards who and what's the context? And why is there confusion? What did ERW do to inspire that thought? 
This sounds like to me, that she did see something, some kind of power struggle or fight or odd behavior that perhaps confused her. And made her wonder what it was about ERW that would inspire some kind of action or actions or why of being within him that she didn't see before. 
And perhaps it turned her off. She didn't think further into it but just chalked it all up to it being because of the Lolita interest that inspired it. And somehow she equated this interest with only ERW and not something that MM was already into. 
This already screams that she didn't have a strong handle on who Brian Warner was. 
She seems like a nieve fan who got lucky because MM needed someone like her around in order to spread the word about what kind of guy she would perceive him as while his closer personal assistants did the more risky work. 

None of what this young lady has said has made me feel any different. In fact it further worries me. And further shows me how smart MM if it all is true. He hired this girl simply for this reason. So that she would speak good of him once this all came to light because of the era and things he was into at the time. She saw her nievity and her starstruck gaze and he knew she would follow his lead and pick up the slack of the others around him. 

This delightful young woman, otherwise, hasn't revealed anything. Except alot of judgemental looks and expressions. 
However she did say quite alot that she didn't see anything out of the ordinary. 

And I don't think these two realize how much saying this actually harms their stance on MMs innocence. 
If there wasn't anything violent or chaotic about their relationship. Then why did MM talk trash about ERW from the time they finally broke up, 2010, until, 2016? In nearly every big interview he always had something fucked up to say about ERW. 
While ERW said nothing negative about Him. She didn't speak of him as often however but when she did she express that sort of big picture sort of thing we each try to hold into something heavy, intense, choatic we've experienced in the past. Y'know, that whole it was a life lesson and we wouldn't change it for anything because it help us get to where we are now? 

Yet she is heavily cross examined for saying such but not one person questions all of his bullshit he has said about her for years and years and often ever since they broke up until recently. 

Yet she's somehow untrustworthy? 

Of course ERW would have wanted to gain something out of being with Manson at that point in time! To expect that no one wants something form someone, even if it's simply their relationship? No one is involved in anything without wanting something. It's simply what we want and how we go about it is what makes it bad or good. 
And it was Mansons idea to make the film and has her star in it. Who would refuse? I think it's bullshit to assume otherwise. 

It has nothing to do with anything since the movie wasn't ever finished and I'm, ERW left him both times they broke up. 
Tell me again what she gained exactly? 
Or could possibly still have now that she's waited this long to reveal her abuser? 

Finally this lady ended the interview by saying ""No matter which side you chose, be sure you do your homework"".  I thought this was a very strange way of ending the interview considering the side that we know the interviewer is on, and obviously this lady is also taking. 
But the words she chose to express this part of it baffles me. 
To believe that ERW is the villain in the situation is a big flawed assumption if you handle it so carelessly. 
 
I believe is reason enough to believe that her perspective isn't reliable and this was a sport. It was for fun. And more of a vain decision. 

Take care",Amy Smith,6,2021-03-26T09:56:24Z

She seems to be projecting her issues with her own choices back that onto Manson to make him look guilty, when in fact it was all consensual and now years later and she regrets or is embarrassed by it or feels guilty. She is cruel and strange. Manson is definitely eccentric and sexual and if you've read his book you know what he is into but on the same hand she chose to be with him.  Paula puts so much light on this.  May Manson just do his music on his own,  his record label prematurely dropping him may be a blessing in that regard. Manson has been an idol of mine since I was 17, and like much of the comments here his music saved me.

Being a victim of domestic abuse hit a nerve with me. But after watching this interview has made me rethink what the hell is going on with said Manson victims. I mean I'm an actual true victim of sleep deprivation from an ex husband who nearly killed me. My health is still suffering after many years later. Which is documented by my doctors. I'm still scared of my ex husband and there is no way I would go public. My ex husband was a diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic with psychopathic tendencies. My ex is a very dangerous man.

There has been no legal allegations only social media allegations.  I have a hard time believing anyone who accuses someone of something this serious not having legal proof over just their words.  I think that is why I haven't known what to think of the allegations against Mr. Manson.  There is a lot of people who will jump on board with accusing famous people just to get famous or clout.

There was countless people who made accusations against him from people who worked on music videos, other personal staff and those in the industry.

I would have asked  Johnny to let us all hang out together and then I would have poked Amber until she revealed her ugly undercoating in front of Johnny (literally just have to be myself to accomplish this). I would have told Manson to get BDSM consent forms and go through a lawyer to ensure they are filled out properly.  I would have connected Johnny and Manson to good people like myself who do not care about fame and care about a good human experience.  I also cannot tolerate abuse.  I do not mind confronting abusive people who are hurting those who cannot defend themselves.

667,UgwXD2MFcZqnj3yc9jd4AaABAg,"Amazing interview! Thank you to you both for sharing the truth about MM and drawing attention to the damaging and dubious accusations by Evan Rachel Wood and her cancel culture mob. Oscar Wilde, Nietzsche, and many other artists who challenged the status quo and the mainstream all sadly faced a similar fate. Their names were not cleared until many years later. This internet culture we live in, and the voice it gives to demagogues and social media manipulators like Trump and ERW is scary. A quick glance at ERW‚Äôs Instagram page, and reading the interviews she has done over the years, one can see she struggles with moderate to severe mental health issues, her victim mentality personality traits and her heightened defensiveness when questioned about the accusations. Her accusations carry almost no credibility - but credibility doesn‚Äôt matter when you‚Äôre a celebrity social justice warrior who loves the attention and monetary incentives of being a victim. How long before the book or Netflix special is out? Whatever happened to women activists like Marlene Dietrich or Eartha Kitt who lived and epitomized a time of true authenticity and resiliency? Truth and justice has never faced a more perilous moment in all of history. Philosophy and our ability to critically examine the information we are fed is being lost.

But also, taking into consideration that she was a MM teenager fan who¬¥s been smitten with her ""musical idol"" for years (and clearly still is), how objective her perspective can be? and even though she¬¥s been around MM for years, not all abusers show to close people who they really are with their partners. In fact, most abusers hide their abusive behaviour to everyone except to their victims. Back to the fact that his assistant was a teenage fan at the time, that actually encourages the idea that ERW allegations are true: narcissistic abusers tend to surround themselves with young and easy to manipulate people who admire them, and both ERW and this woman fall into that category, at least at the time the alleged abuse happened.",Juanita On the go,4,2021-03-22T05:20:07Z

I admit I created a stereotype but soon realized Marilyn is a very intelligent, creative personality. The friendship of johnny and Marilyn began to make sense. I always believe and know that johnny was an incredibly sensitive care man. He would never harm anyone. So to be friends with Marilyn, he too must carry some of those traits. I am an artist and found all the information insightful and now believe that Marilyn to is not an abuser. He may like things a bit kinky but why not. A person sexuallity is the core of a person soul. The way Marilyn has created music that questions the juxtaposition of opposites. The way he looked at a situation and found away to express himself is quite amazing. I still don't like his music but now have a bit more respect for the man. And a better understand of his friendship with johnny who I just love and admire for his creativity.

She just was trying to be into stuff she wasn't into.

690,UgxoyeQvWGEpvRqJcxt4AaABAg,"There's something important I need to say on this whole Manson scandal.

First off, what a person does in private, has nothing to do with how they carry themselves in public, no matter if we're talking public figure or normal person. A public figure of the status of Manson has various layers he exposes to different people: 

- he has his public image, which is one, and how he carries himself on stage, in interviews, in videos, etc. Just because he has this dark public image, doesn't mean he is this dark person in real life. 
- he has another layer of how he presents himself to those close to him, but that still is a public image of him. So the way he is with friends and relatives has nothing to do with how he is in the sphere of intimate relationships. There are people who seem extremely nice and cool to hangout with, yet are abusive pieces of sh.. when you close that door and shut everyone else out.
- he has his private persona, whom he manifests only around people, whom he share the most private moments of his life with.

This being said, someone who hasn't been in an actual relationship with the guy, can't be taken seriously about knowing what he truly is behind closed doors. Yes, this lady has been present throughout the first two rings of his image and can attest to what type of personality he has on stage, how he is in his close social circles, and what type of person is he as an employer, and obviously her testimony to this widely differs what we read about him from other people who had worked for him, and that's a plus in his favor. 

Another point I would like to make, is that abuse - the type these women are accusing Manson of - is mostly emotional and mental abuse, aside from rape and physical abuse, which is rather less, imo. We're not talking someone who beat up his partners, but locked them up, deprived them from sleep, tried to break them down mentally and solicited them into performing certain acts in submission to him, allegedly. Acts like that, even consensual, are still considered an abuse, as the victim is being manipulated into giving their consent into doing these. So what's wrong is wrong, even if it's being agreed upon, and one can't simply dismiss a crime of this kind, just because the victim gave their consent. 

Now... my personal experience with this type of abuse is that the person, whom I used to work with, had one side he showed everyone: he was charming, bubbly, social, fun to be around and that whole thing is a part of his narcissistic and predatory nature - that's how he hunts. He had a completely different side to him when you're left alone with him, which was a bit sharper, which one may take as frankness, openness and honesty, but years ahead of it, looking back at it, I believe it was more aimed to hurt me. And then he had an even bigger Hyde type of personality that came out only when he was drinking. He would drink heavily, and by that I mean a horrid amount of hard alcohol. Once he did that, he would become bitter, melancholic, and tear me down bit by bit. If there was an outsider around - a colleague or a friend, he would still be this fun social butterfly; but one on one he was a monster! For instance, he would aim at tearing down my confidence and always criticize everything I did. No matter if I did something good to help him in our jobs as we worked together, or it was something I aimed for personally, it was always wrong in his eyes, always a waste of my time, always not good enough. He was depriving me from sleep and he was doing it unintentionally, I believe, as he would leave work unfinished at the office, which I had to cover for; and then he'd show up at my place right after I went home, to further break my spirit and guard down with his emotional stories of how accomplished he was as a musician, but how he can't be one any more, and how I am wasting my time on this job, when I could be doing something else, but then I wasn't good enough for it. The entire thing was a huge manipulation to feel sorry for him, to see him as someone who believes in me, but then to lose my confidence and stick with him, because I don't deserve better, as he's the only person who can love my broken self. There were even one case of rape, and a separate one where things escalated into physical abuse, so there's that. I can really understand why no one would believe that someone with a Jekyll/Hyde personality is hard to be considered as an abuser. 

Is Manson an abuser? Maybe he is, maybe he isn't. We can't be biased by his fame, by his stage image, by his public image or by his accusers, into thinking one or the other. There is never smoke without fire, so I'm going to stay reserved on my judgment and take everything with a grain of salt, and I won't jump any of the bandwagons. Does he exhibit the traits of a narcissistic emotional abuser? I'm not sure as everything so far that has come out - and I'm not a fan so I'm not either biased, nor acquainted with all sources and information available - could be 100% stage performance on his behalf. Unless I speak with him for like an hour privately and push his buttons, I wouldn't be able to see through that image. But I stand with him on one thing, and that is this whole charade of ""trial by the media"": when you have someone abusing you, you take it to the police, seek counsel and face them in court, proving your accusations, legally! You don't go on such a smearing campaign destroying a person's career and life with just words and rumors! 

In the meantime, I would suggest the two cases of JD and Manson to be kept separated, as the types of abuse are extremely different - one being mental and emotional predominantly, and the other being physical; one being alleged and highly probable as there's not much proof of innocence, while the other being obviously staged, profited by and proven fake for various reasons. These two cases, if entwined, they can damage the outcome of one another, as an alleged abuser may walk away free in one scenario, while on the other side a completely innocent man may suffer the consequences of an accusation, just by being linked to an accused of abuse who seems much more probable of being the real deal.

695,UgzgN6nwoCpMhcytAzV4AaABAg,"There is no better person I could imagine to talk about these accusations. Paula is so consistent in her talk. This interview suits with your remarks in previous videos. Btw, Manson sings about attracting crazy broken girls in Blood Honey. Evan came into radar to play in Phantasmagoria, which could be expected as edgy, controversial movie (this is why it was not finished btw). Manson admitted on his interviews he is a dark guy and it is not only a persona (for example, interview for Rolling Stone in 1997, available on line). Are relationships with dark dominant personalities difficult? Yes, they usually are. But they can be based on consensus. When you don't like it you leave, if can have sex like and adult, act as an adult when the relationship is over. Been there. I hate this victim complex attitude, it is hurtful for the actual victims.",okjutna,2,2021-03-21T20:07:50Z

723,Ugyc20hyS5v5cstyspF4AaABAg,"1:10:00 the comments here really fkn annoy me. false accusation and libel/slander should not be left in the hands of the victim to pursue, it should be treat as an attempt to pervert the course of justice by false accusation or whatever the legal term might be. what really really fkn annoys me is when men are accused, go through Hell, then just let it go and make no attempt to make these malicious cnuts pay. there was a girl who got a load of stars tattooed on her face and when she caught sht off her parents she ended up claiming she'd fallen asleep and the guy had done it w/out her consent etc etc - he did nothing. There was some gash who accused a guy of penetrating her on a crowded railway platform despite him being fully clothed - he did nothing. every time this happens it leaves the way open for some POS to try it on again and ruin someone's life. Johnny Depp is taking action, and sadly Amber Turd is still getting jobs etc, which hopefully will end when the justice system starts properly looking at the evidence. i sincerely hope Manson goes after each and every one of these maggots and the courts come down on them like a ton of bricks, because eery time they can do this and every time they get away w/ it it makes a mockery of the legal system and it shts all over any future attempts of a legitimate victim to make his/her voice heard.",Killer Wolf,0,2021-03-21T09:35:27Z

She was very obvious long before they divorced. As far as Marilyn Manson ?. I've read the accusations. They each seem in lock step with one another. But, exactly what, or precisely, what are they accusing MM of ?. I can read between the lines, but that's not good enough. I get the 50 shades of gray feeling  regarding their complaints. If so, not unless he kidnapped and truly held them prisoners, I'm not in the least convinced that anything beyond their consent occurred.",Dwight Pettegrove,1,2021-03-21T08:52:24Z
727,UgxqimIBoy8QALOdCRl4AaABAg,"Thank you to Colonel Kurtz and Paula for this fascinating interview. It was interesting to hear about Paula's take on the allegations surrounding MM; as well as her experiences as a fan, working together and the friendship that developed. When most fans meet a celebrity they admire, it's usually brief and limited. I thought it was something how a chance encounter brought Paula a unique work opportunity and friendship with MM. I'm glad her experience was memorable and positive. A question that I have, (and that could perhaps be answered in a future interview with CK?) is in regards to the allegations of racism and anti-semitism of MM. Just as a disclaimer, this question is not about ""race baiting"" or ""identity politics."" I do realize this can be a difficult subject to discuss, and I don't mean to upset anyone, just curious to learn more. I also think this topic is relevant to mention, as these claims have repeatedly come up. On the other hand, I do recall some interviews where MM seems to deny  racism on his part, and also mentions having many African American and Jewish friends. However, the only friends of different backgrounds than his own, (that I know of) are Yoshiki, (he was mentioned in this interview) and Paula, (she mentioned her heritage in the interview. I think learning about one's roots is a privilege, and I appreciated how she shared with us.) 

Having said that,  I generally do not like calling attention to a person's heritage, as I feel it's a form of othering. And as someone of color, it can be disheartening when people just randomly ask/comment on your race/ethnicity. However, in the context of asking about the alleged racism of MM, I think it's relevant to bring it up. I'd really appreciate if this question could be passed on to Paula. I get the sense she's a fair and down to earth person, and I'd really appreciate her take on this. All the best:)",power within,2,2021-03-21T08:47:49Z

770,UgyMESE2P-edMwCLL4N4AaABAg,"I'm glad I live in Ireland for two reasons: Very strong libel laws and both the defendant and accusor are assured anonymity throughout the duration of the trial. Well, maybe more than two but those are ones I'll give you that relate to the topic.

Other than telling you of my appreciation for my nation's civil and criminal laws, what I want to do is tell you about a woman from my hometown. Read it if you want cause it's a long enough one. I will call this woman Sadie for the sake of protecting her identity.

Sadie is a 52 year old woman who has accused 14 men on 14 separate occasions of rape, or last I heard anyway. All false; she's a little mad and likes the notoriety, I'm guessing. With that in mind I'll be talking about Accused No. 14 and I'll call him John. John was a 19 year man, who had the unfortunate fate of being his mum's son and his mum had the poor sense of being a close friend of Sadie. One day, John was home for a visit and Sadie was also in the house. As was as natural as breathing air to her, well didn't Sadie go and accuse poor John. Shocking, right? She called the cops and cops have to investigate all claims, even from known trolls like Sadie. These cops were cunning about it and they sent two officers: A man and a woman. Now I would've loved to have heard the conversation between the two guards before they pulled up to the house, but whatever was said the female guard was to take lead and ask the questions. And as soon as she marched into the room with Sadie she asked, ""What lies have you been telling now, Sadie?"" No bullshit. No fucking around. I hope you'll all at least come away from this story with a greater appreciation for female cops.

Anyway, no arrests were made, but still poor John comes away worse for it. Why? The last I heard is that the mum and this Sadie were still on very friendly terms. No mammy's day card for her then.

Anyway, the point of all this story is that this Sadie woman is a chaotic lunatic with a compulsive desire for the worst kind of attention. But despite all that she will still go to the police and have her claims tested with them first, long before she'll take her scandalous fibs to social media.",Ross Furey,8,2021-03-20T17:39:40Z

779,UgxbUpGmMQxHrQSt6bd4AaABAg,"When your guest is speaking about Amber Heard and how AH wanted to ""monopolize"" JD and was ""all over him""...I think abusers like AH do this for two reasons, having other people see her ""all over him"" gets her narcissistic supply, and it literally separates him from others.  Abusers like to isolate their victims a little and clearly in the audio tapes where AH continually and very annoyingly keeps saying he ""splits""...I thought at first she meant that he got on a plane and left her, but she was referring to his leaving the room during an argument that was clearly going to escalate.  Also, she was with one of the most famous, handsome, and well-liked celebrities in the world, so that clearly allows her to ""bask in the glow"", another narcissistic move.  I also think AH narcissistic and actually sociopathic ""style"" is so clear for the world to see and I think it odd how she was married to a woman and just switches to JD, it makes me feel bad for him like he couldn't or didn't see then how she was using him.  I am NOT knocking her for being lesbian, or lesbians, but the switching seems like it is another manipulation.  Also, this wife is the one AH beat on in a public place and had charges brought.  I think physically abusive people are like a tea kettle, the pressure just builds until they lose self-control and strike and hit.  It is hateful and awful.  At least she doesn't seem to carry guns or I think she would leave a trail of blood.  I liked the guest who seemed very genuine.",fishface123ism,1,2021-03-20T15:36:10Z

790,UgzYv5-GE2qrxiGcDhZ4AaABAg,"It actually sounds like Evan love bombed Manson and that the other women are twisted fantasists and bitter. If you look at Evans relationships you can see she morphs into her partner that she is with at the time, no she didn‚Äôt dress like Manson but she knew what kind of look he liked in ladies and what was his taste, then you look at her in her other relationships she dresses exactly the same, same hairstyle, clothes everything. I cannot see how a woman with no regrets, no bad words on the person at all 5 years after they broke up can turn around a year later in 2016 and say she was raped, abused, starved, isolated, sleep deprived etc. Which just so happens to coincide with the year Amber came out and the year of the massive me too rubbish. The me too movement should be torn apart, not only is it brain washing women but it‚Äôs also allowing women to make false allegations it should not be allowed, since the me too movement has reared its ugly head god knows how many men have been accused of horrific crimes which have actually been innocent, granted it helped a few women but does helping a few women at the time but does that out weigh destroying others lives who are innocent and not just men but women too who quite likely will not be believed now because of cases like Amber and Evan and although these two women specifically are evil for spouting such lies I think the me too movement should take the blame too because it‚Äôs because of this movement they have been allowed to get away with such lies for so long. If the movement never existed they wouldn‚Äôt be trying to gain, money, recognition, be activists and so on, they‚Äôre clearly making money from this, the Me too movement has just given these women a platform to lie and get paid for it, it truly disgusts me.",Tanya Campbell,6,2021-03-20T14:23:55Z

Boo-hoo, so the king of darkness is hiding in his castle now? Same goes for Depp. He has been unstable for decades.

Evan is a brilliant and talented woman, and I just don't know why she would go to congress and be public if nothing happened to her. She doesn't have a reputation of being some terrible person liked Amber did... Evan was so young and at the time, but she was already a child star from a very young age and didn't need him to gain fame. I don't know, so you are very impressionable when you are that young and hanging out with a rockstar that is so much older than you are. However, I don't think she sold him on ""the Lolitta fantasy,"" but this is very interesting, and I find this woman credible and lovely, but she doesn't know what happened behind closed doors, even if she is an assistant. This Lady wasn't with them all the time. What is a product of the nineties? And is that good? But I am not into all this cancel culture, so I'm conflicted, but thanks for the interview.

814,UgzUl32mAPCWO5-3tkN4AaABAg,"So to summarize the first 30 minutes: 
She does not think a 36 year old man has the responsibility to not enter a relationship with a 18/19 year old girl, but expects that maturity from said girl. She also thinks there is no difference in power because she didn't see it, but says that Manson liked the Lolita fantasy.
She says she didn't like Evan while also saying she barely saw her. Hence there is not alot she can draw from when commenting on their relationship. Even further, she only met Esme once.
She was not with them in their bedroom or at night, shocker. So she cannot comment on anything that happend after hours, well duh.
It also baffles me how you are laughing about ""he likes it cold"" ""he's a nightowl"" well of course she as an employee has to wear a jacket but do you honestly think its fine that the women who live with him for years don't have a say in the room temperature? Don't you think an empathic partner would not expect you to stay up with you and subscribe to everything you're doing? Have you ever heard of compromise in a healthy relationship?

It is also quite weird that the interviewer laughs about the ra** allegation. You guys have to room to say ""when was that supposed to have happened""? Did you spend 24/7 with her? Every second of every day?
The most used sentence in this was ""I wasn't there around that time"". Then don't speak on it.
Also discrediting trauma, don't speak on something you don't understand. Maybe research stockholm syndrom and  complex PTSD before saying something doesn't make sense in how a person is acting.

And was an arrogant douche on the phone and he was also a douche when he tried to make up for it. I think he's an asshole BUT that doesn't mean that he raped someone.

855,Ugxas6JDsXtSMv9-atJ4AaABAg,"So just a FRIENDLY piece of advice here - seriously. Not a criticism just a critique.  From a fellow Manson fan, scholar, academic, Social Scientist.  As she‚Äôs talking answering questions,
Your mind is tangential and going a million miles- understandably so!!! But so many questions you asked she got cut off when you asked a follow up before she answered and then we never got the answer or you asked a double barreled question but. 
And I KNOW it‚Äôs partly because you don‚Äôt want to forget. But I feel like she was cut of a lot. 
So my advice is keep a note pad and jot down some quick note about the follow up thoughts you want to explore as she is talking so that you don‚Äôt forget and can ask real quick when it feels like her current answer is done.  I get it. I Would have a ton of questions and I would want to rapid fire as well!!! So please take it as a friendly colleague giving advice.  We appreciate you SO MUCH for doing this.

869,UgwfUHx3INasgzv2-ox4AaABAg,"The accusations of being made to endure a cold and dark home, I live with a guy that doesn't like to put the heating on high. I wear a jumper and put a rug over my legs, I have one now! A cashmere pashmina! I am fine! And I don't like bright lights, my guy calls me a vampire! I guess I am saying that if they were physically uncomfortable in his home then they could have left, or put on a jumper (sweater). If they were not allowed then why did they stay? I am conflicted tbh, I stayed with a guy way longer than I should have done. But I felt guilty to even think about leaving, I had huge problems with the idea that I had value. I was pathetically grateful for this guy having helped me, where he had done what a partner should have done and no more. He had helped me when I was trying to help my parents. He turned up, at an incredibly stressful time in my life. For that I was so grateful I felt like I owed him so much, I took so much crap for years. I guess I am saying that I had my own dumb twisted reasons for staying far too long after I should have left. But I don't see how these women were staying for any reason beyond that they didn't want to leave a rock star? And when the rock star began to be not so enamoured of them as he had been was when they began to feel abused. IDK, I watched ERW and I feel like I am sympathetic to her, I think because she was so young. But then I wonder if ERW saw MM as in some way someone who could help her in her career. I am going to be 50 very soon yet I still remember being very young and thinking that I understood myself and that I was invincible? That I would not be damaged by things? And I was wrong, I wonder if ERW was the same? And maybe it is on older people to not engage with very young adults, no matter how much the young adults say that they are ok. I wonder if that is the problem here with ERW and MM? 
And just to add, when I was in my late 30s I knew a 18 year old boy, he was vulnerable and I befriended him. Because I saw that he was vulnerable and from a bad background but was trying to be better. I realised that he had a crush on me, but I couldn't act on it. I was flattered, he was a good looking boy. But his interest in me was because I was kind to him, saw something good in him and encouraged him. Told him he was a good person and to not be discouraged. I couldn't denigrate that by sleeping with him, it would have been me taking advantage. I am not saying that all relationships with a big age gap are bad, but I do think that MM having a preference for very young adults was not smart, to say the least.",Kate Gould,2,2021-03-19T23:50:31Z

886,UgwYSvaZ6iAM0hjxn8t4AaABAg,"Thank you So So much. 
 I have always wanted to ask you about the Colonel Kurtz name  - I still say Duvall's famous line   ""There's  nothing like the smell of napalm in the morning""  and  ""...it smells like victory""  whenever I am in an F'ed up situation. 
Wow, you are a ""natural"" at interviewing some-one, this was freaking incredible, factual and informative but you both got into the little nuances of his personality as well as the accusers.  I have never bought the story those women told because  A - it sounded too rehearsed B -  I knew Amber was involved and C - I would never accept that a really close friend of JD's would be this evil monster that tortured women.
We need a new law to punish anyone making false allegations in either criminal or civil court.  One of the accusers is on video stating ""MM should just pay us for our suffering"".  Evan and Esme KNEW the statute of limitations was well past but they never wanted a trial at all, they wanted to do exactly like Amber did to JD in 2016;  I'll stop lying about you abusing me if you give me 7 million dollars.  That is when Evan jumped in at a critical time and supported Amber.  Poor JD was overwhelmed and gave in.  As soon as JD agreed to pay the ""blackmail"" money, Evan came out and stated that a former partner had raped her.   I have heard interviews of her in 2016 (Rolling Stone ) and later where she states she will eventually tell every-one who it was!   Poor MM has had this hanging over his head since 2016!
We must do something about people who make false allegations, however I do not see why this type of thing is not covered under extortion, fraud and blackmail laws.  I have said from the beginning  that Amber was extorting/blackmailing JD.
Another serious issue is that these three women, Evan, Esme and Amber are the ""FACE"" of the Me Too, Times Up and other Domestic Abuse movements.  The whole issue has been corrupted  by these lying swindlers.  What they have managed to do in the background is SHOCKING!.  They are the darlings of the Democratic Party's  new ""WOKE"" feminists and have  changed an incredible number of laws.  One Law, The Phoenix Act, actually has a charity of the same name attached to it,  like it is an official charity for the government.  How connected do you have to be to have a charity with the same name as the  law given to you that the government site links to?
These new laws are terrifying, although it is still difficult to find the actual wording.  The one I am most concerned with is called ""Coercive Control"".    When a victim claims this the accused will be charged with Domestic Assault.  How can anyone prove/disprove such a thing?  My God it has taken JD SIX years and millions of dollars to get even partial vindication, how is the average person going to defend themselves against ""I am just a poor little woman and he brainwashed me!"" ?
I believe us REAL WOMEN are going to have to ensure something is done about those these new laws as well as expose  those three crooks.
Again Colonel you have outdone yourself,   I can not produce top quality videos like you do but I have been to almost every site that is even slightly related to this MM case and I inform them of your excellent series on this case.
PS.  I love your Meaghan and Harry work as well.  Have you run into a site called HG Tudor?  He is a self-confessed narcissist and has done very good work on Meaghan for a couple of years now as well as on Amber Heard -  he knew from the beginning that both of them are deadly liars and master manipulators.   Have you seen the human bite marks on Harry's hands? 
 I shall sign off and pass the word about this great scoop you pulled off.   As far as I'm concerned you are one of the best investigative reporters/hosts in the country right now with a feel for the hottest stories!

And it's difficult for me to believe the alligations because the image she is describing or the things that other people like rose, dita, Alice Cooper, JD, and so on....
Said about him is so different than what ERW and other accusers are describing.. they are describing an evil person while others say he is so nice, funny, charming, giving and even shy..
Its two different person, and i believe  he IS a good person because even ERW herself said nice things about him until some time in 2016 which is so odd for me...

928,Ugyx_MLw9J7lKBeOppN4AaABAg,"This was a great video and thanks for digging for all this information. Hopefully something comes out of it.
I've read some of the comments you've already gathered and I find them funny. Saying how the whole interview is weak just because she said the accusers weren't around much. But really, all you have to do is research a bit and you realize they didn't in fact spend that much time together. It's impossible to be on tour for over a year and at the same time spend quality time in between with your gf who is making films the whole time. It's hard enough to find that time when you're in a normal relationship with a demanding job.
Another thing these people don't consider is the fact that maybe she doesn't want to share private info about Dita so it's easier to say how she wasn't around. But really, if you're an assistant, my assumption is that you don't actually sleep at your employer's house even if you sometimes work long hours. If MMs gf/wife is working long hours too, that can easily mean that you just don't see her by the time you're done with work.
I can even give a RL example, but this is already too long.

I just think it's a testament to who he is as a person that so many people see him this way. My grandmother was the type of person that always made you feel like you were the center of her whole world when you were with her. Yes, of course, she was my grandmother, but she treated everyone that way. Not just her family members. I've always got that same impression of JD. I also think it's funny how Johnny talks to people, virtual strangers, as if he has no idea the effect he has on us ""average joes"".  It's just a down-to-earth, humbleness that you don't see in many big celebrities. I also heard a story that once he just randomly met this elderly woman in the park and struck up a conversation with her that lasted for at least an hour. A year or two later they met again, and he remembered her immediately. That just says so much about him as a person than maybe some people realize. Hearing that Manson is like that as well is surprisingly not that surprising to me now that I think about it, but it's still nice to hear.

Since a few, I was thinking about starting my own channel and was kind of ¬´¬†investigating¬†¬ª, ¬´¬†researching¬†¬ª what sort of content I better come with. Surprisingly at the end of it all , the exactly same idea as yours became the best one to me.
Your uploads are the ones which inspire me the most , they aren‚Äôt any kind of fancy sketchy useless, just clickbaiting ones.

959,UgzwYtwVDDPhQ8dVITJ4AaABAg,"The responses in this interview are too strange. All she says is she encountered Dita a couple of times but because Dita traveled a lot, she didn't witness anything good or bad between Dita & Manson, ""I didn't really have too many encounters with her"". Then says ""I don't remember much from that time because I had left because I went back to school"" referring to the time Evan entered the picture, including the divorce. And the relationship between Manson & Evan + the divorce all was developing while the interviewee was gone for school. So she wasn't a witness to any of it. Then she figured on her own that he & Evan were together because the interviewee ""had heard about the divorce, it was all over TMZ"", so she wasn't speaking with Manson during all that time. He didn't tell her about his life, and she figured things out via the tabloids. Again, didn't witness anything. It's all hear say. Then when asked about the final stages of the relationship, the interviewee says ""he was touring a lot and I didn't go with him on tour"" and ""I don't remember too much about them spending time together"". Also, from what I understood, Paula was still in school and no longer working for him at that point, so she wasn't around much. Then ""I did not (meet Esme). That was in the period that I took a hiatus"". Once again, she's saying she wasn't around to witness anything. Then about Gabriella she says ""I never really spent too much time with her to get to know her"", then ""I wasn't in there with them"" referring to the bus. I could go on and on, but this comment is too long already. Basically the interview is Paula saying: I was around during all those years, except all those years I was away in school, and except all those years I wasn't on tour with him, and except I never really saw Manson and these women interacting much. It's all very contradictory. Anyways, I'm really enjoying all the videos on the channel analysing the allegations and seeing the holes and what holds water.

The difference for example with the Jonny Depp case is that only Amber and her friends can say is true but in Mason's case there are way too many similar cases for ex workers, ex girlfriends and so on",CN SM,11,2021-03-19T18:29:26Z

966,UgzKdVINzMpwE7dqAh54AaABAg,Paula is very thoughtful and doesn't exaggerate her experiences. She is Normal! She also finds Manson to be a decent person. She was a good employee and true to him.

MM admits to all of this.  He is also an anti semite. It's illegal in most places. This lady just wants a modeling career in desperate Covid time. She needs ig follows.",Sara C,0,2021-03-19T18:24:01Z

972,UgyTOAnphcIk_JvluRV4AaABAg,"People who go to Manson's concerts and say they are surprised about anything, are either not knowledgeable about metal concerts or are lying. He does very similar ""shocking"" things at every gig that his fans know very well in advance. And would demand those if he tries to skip. His concerts mostly sell out, btw.

If you go to a Freudian psychoanalyst, he'll identify your complexes. If you go to a MeToo lawyer, he'll give you a roadmap of your ""abuse"". Except lawyers are not credible as not experts in abuse.",M T,41,2021-03-19T18:10:19Z

You actually are looking deeper than the accusations which I believe everyone deserves. I am a HUGE Manson fan, have been since Portrait and I want him to have a chance to defend himself and have due process.
