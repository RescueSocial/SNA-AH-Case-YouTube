1,UgwdEfQZgNLMvH5Edfx4AaABAg,Families Supporting Trauma Recovery,Perhaps she is freaking out because of the constant bullying. Targets of sociopaths can act out in odd ways. We live in systems and act and react off of each other.,2021-07-26T20:55:26Z,0
2,UgwdEfQZgNLMvH5Edfx4AaABAg,Mariana Munoz,"I agree, your gonna post pics why would u be in front of a computer, playing/interacting with the baby is a more real pic, especially if post is about being both mother and father!!

3,UgwdEfQZgNLMvH5Edfx4AaABAg,Freeda Aghakhaineyan,Oh rob you must admit you got to be sniggering a bit inside cos I definitely am. She went out of her way to have baby right at the perfect time for sympathy at Virginia but now theres another year to wait. By that time the world would of seen how much time she spends with her and will be old news and baby will be old enough to go to whitney while AH goes to prison. I mean it'll probably be whitney looking after baby cos we know Ah doesn't actually like spending her own money and if EM is helping financially then shes probably keeping it and still getting friends and sister taking care of baby. Plus the question should come up in court of who exactly looks after baby while AH is travelling the world for filming and then promoting as it wouldn't be very responsible to keep uprooting her hotel room to hotel room and rentals to rentals. It might even be good for AH to go prison so baby can get some stability.,2021-07-21T16:36:39Z,1

All elon did (money, connections) was basically to prevent this but...did elon say no to something? Is this elons punishment....like the legal drama was amber punishing johnny. But its kinda d*mb cause now she gave away her leverage over elon...the damage is done. Now elon actually as a motive to tell the truth and fight for custody if only to protect his daughter from her mother.

Amber is basically the female version of britneys dad. And both elon and johnny are britney. She gets off on the control she has over these men. Only difference is...johnny faught back. But ambers behaviour during those court days and her legal actions...its still her abusing johnny. And the kid is her still abusing elon.",2021-07-17T16:35:16Z,1

How can she manipulate them -gives her power and a rush.  or the baby is a prop and borrowed from whitney.   still wondering about that possibility too.
