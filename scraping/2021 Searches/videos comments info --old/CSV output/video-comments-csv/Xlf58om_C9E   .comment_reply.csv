1,Ugx-UCsjw3vvLWrLzNl4AaABAg,Roberto1212‚Ä¶,She‚Äôs an abuser dude,2021-08-03T04:13:50Z,1
2,UgzrUW3JhJmFRwI6yzR4AaABAg,Roberto1212‚Ä¶,@anthony cheesman you know Johnny only post because courts are unreliable and they do t think men can be abuser but she literally lied in court and admired she abused him but nothing happened,2021-08-03T17:59:21Z,1

4,UgzrUW3JhJmFRwI6yzR4AaABAg,Roberto1212‚Ä¶,There is tons of evidence and she confessed on tape to abusing him and there are many recordings as well as witnesses who says she abused him,2021-08-03T04:15:19Z,1
5,Ugzo1nlC7yX1rKlG7uR4AaABAg,Jens T√∂rnell,"@Ian Hampton Wasn't it Depp that did bad things to Heard in their relationship?

Anyway, here is what the producer say about it:

""‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre ever going to react to, honestly, pure fan pressure, you gotta do what‚Äôs best for the movie,‚Äù he said.""",2021-08-21T20:32:03Z,0
6,Ugzo1nlC7yX1rKlG7uR4AaABAg,Ian Hampton,But that in and of itself still presents a major problem Jens Tornell. A lot of people who are fans of the original Aquaman are understandably bothered by Amber Heard being allowed to star in the sequel. You say that you could care less about what occurs in reality but the problem with your comment is that reality in this case is far too serious to just overlook or ignore. Amber Heard is an abuser and there is clear proof of that. Now it may not bother you giving your money to a person like her but it sure as heck bothers me.,2021-08-21T20:16:23Z,0

A lot you people want Amber Heard to get fired because of what she did. Because of their evidence what she has done. But  how come no one is saying that Ezra Miller needs to get fired for putting his hands on a woman. And their is a BIG ASS EVIDENCE it was on camera which got put on YouTube.
