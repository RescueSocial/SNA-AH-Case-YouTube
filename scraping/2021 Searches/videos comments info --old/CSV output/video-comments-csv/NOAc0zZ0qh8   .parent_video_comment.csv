In Amber's case this is more obvious, but as long as the Johnny Depp trial continues and some form of legal responsibility is not placed on her, if you remove her from the role, WB could be exposed to some form of legal action. The Ezra case is even harder to gage, because to my understanding, there is no legal proceeding or some formal complaint from the women in the video vs Ezra. I know that Hollywood studios tend to make decisions based not on the legal standings, but on public opinion and what general movie audience perceive. If they think something/someone is bad, then you should not cast him/her to not associate the movie with his/her baggage. But remember that to the huge majority of movie going audiences in the world, they have NO idea of anything regarding either Amber Heard of Ezra, so their decision on going to see the film or not, is unaffected by these type of scandals.

Ezra and Amber both need to be held accountable, however the gravity of that accountability should be different I think. Amber, as much as it pains me to say because I loved Mera in Aquaman, is dead weight at this point. Very few people are on her side, and even fewer people will publicly defend her. I personally think she‚Äôs a garbage human being, and even when she married Johnny back then, she just looked like a gold digger. So she needs to be fired ASAP unless James Wan or Zach Snyder can give us a proper reason to believe otherwise, but even then most people (including myself) will probably still hate her, and justifiably so. And the situation does get complicated when you realize that Mera is in Zach Snyder‚Äôs Justice League, so we will inevitably be seeing her again. As for Ezra, he needs to apologize, and depending on the public‚Äôs response he should either be fired or kept but under certain conditions. Zach cast him for a reason, and till this very day, we don‚Äôt know why that is because the theatrical version of the Flash was awful.

Regarding Amber -, UNTIL there's a definitive court case and verdict saying Amber is guilty, Studios CANNOT get involved in ""DOMESTIC"" disputes.  
if they fired her and then this goes into litigation and she's not found guilty she can sue the shit out of WB.  And considering she's apart of a billion-dollar franchise - she would financially drag them.  I'm all for accountability, but A.  We need to have all the facts and B. if there are legal ramifications we have to consider that as well.

I'm not suggesting you guys are doing this, but the internet in general and social media has given (people in general) but especially 'fans' a bit of an over-rated sense of importance without even having all the details.  People are suggesting 'firing' these two without having all the details.  Because HBOMAX/WB is moving forward with the Snyder cut - now fans think they're justified to request the Ayer Cut and the Schumacher Cut and who should be cast here and all this grandstanding on what ""THEY INDIVIDUALLY"" want - then you have some youtube personalities attacking directors (because of their scoop on ""THE DIRECTORS SET WHO KNOWS MORE THAN THEY DO"" üôÑ) but anyway, that's a whole different conversation -  but my point is, we're so quick to jump to wanting to cancel and fire someone without having all the facts just because there is an 'online' push for something one way or the other.",Jax Ry,0,2020-08-13T22:50:21Z

I get they want to protect the metoo movement but by protecting her they're publicly stating that abuse is ok if it's a woman doing it. Hell even her original legal team that represents the metoo movement quit on her a few weeks before the trail started.

Miller might be a little more difficult to recast, mainly because of his contract, but also because he was one of the main highlights everyone took away from the DCEU films he was involved in.
