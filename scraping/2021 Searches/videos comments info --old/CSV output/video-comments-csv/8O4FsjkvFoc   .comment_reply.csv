J.D. admitted that he didn’t understand why she liked him so much because he said and I quote in his GQ interview he said 
“at the time I met her I really didn’t think that I was her “type”?” 
in the famous recordings she admitted that it was goal all along cause she said.
“Remember how hard I worked to make that marriage happen” .

And my ex did the same, cheat, blame, insult and baited to protect yourself or other to protect her (honor)

Nobody looks good with a bruise. See my previous post about how it makes no sense for actors to hit each other in the face, which is their moneymaker.) than the makeup she normally wears that makes her look more butch. Just saying, whether that bruise was real or some colored eyeliner or blush or something, those photos aren't no-makeup photos. They call what she has on the ""nude look"" but there is still makeup there. Look closely at her eyes. That makes it harder for anyone to be sure the injury is even real. Why have makeup on at all for a photo you intend to use as evidence of an injury? She should switch to the nude look makeup permanently when she's done pretending to be the helpless victim.

If your wife is cheating on you, that means she thinks you are some kind of beta-male. Once she has crossed that barrier, she also can't be trusted in any other manner, especially financially. Once she has put her money boat on the bigger financial river, there's no point in sucking from your trickle or feeding moisture into it either anymore. She can safely eliminate your stream entirely without much negative effect to herself, which appears may have actually happened somehow if 650 to 750 MILLION dollars of Johnny's money was missing and he's also been cut out of getting a bunch of acting jobs. I'm not saying she was involved in that missing money. I'm just saying if the money is missing, and nobody knows where the money went, well, somebody actually knows where the money went and isn't telling, right? (Jesus Christ that last sentence sounds like a Jack Sparrow line.) Is that someone a person who smuggled the money off for someone else, perhaps for someone with a nice ass and expensive preferences?

BUT so did she.. the huge difference is that he got on that Stand and let it all out.. didn't lie.. through all of his dirty laundry so to speak out in tbe public eye... And their actually holding that against him lol then we have her.. omg if people ACTUALLY did their own research and read the court transcripts they would see.. she has been caught in SO many lies it's unbelievable.. just on day 1! All of her doctors wrote notes about her drug use.. how she is addicted to cocaine, which she said she never did.. go look up , "" the umbrella guy"" he does an awesome job going over HER WORDS in court.. but she is her own worst enemy.. she can't keep up with her own lies and then literally just makes things up as she goes especially when she gets caught up on her own lies... That's exactly how Kate Moss got brought up into it.. out of nowhere she said she hit Johnny after rembering hearing a story about him pushing her down the stairs haha this was when being asked over and over if she had EVER hit him and she repeatedly said NO.. then they played Audi of her admitting to hitting him and BOOM I only hit him after blah blah lol it's the most ridiculous yet hilarious shit you can read.. because like I said she is her own worst enemy.. but yeah.. if anyone has ANY doubt.. do your own research.. look up her own words in court.. how she repeatedly deflect everytime something is brought up.. even the judge is getting sick of her shit",2020-07-22T19:12:34Z,3

With all the false accusations and weird world he had her living in she often asked herself: ""Is this reality!?"" she said that if she hadn't divorced him he would have made her a crazy person. The show was big, and the drama exists even to this day! Pretty crazy how they never let criticism or failure of any kind go away. I feel the same about Johnny, and others can vouch for his good character. The thing is when people say that ""Sure Johnny must have done something,"" I get pretty frustrated because the Narc is really good at getting people to act differently from who they are. They are expert baiters and manipulators.

Someone who  Definitely sounds like the classic narcissist, and I felt the same way when I started hearing about Johnny's situation. I had seen this stuff before, and when the narc 's ego or wants aren't met in any way they lash back twice as hard. Johnny strikes me as someone who shuts down when he's unhappy or withdraws, and that only makes a narc even worse. Have you heard of Sam Vaknin? He's got a channel on here, really useful information in identifying and handling these types of people.

I feel really bad for women (and men who don't speak up enough) who are in marriages that last you know 20-30 years, and don't leave because of kids or stability. I almost lost myself and I was just dating the guy and that's what I'm hoping that he would allow me to marry him (Literally, yes, allow me too).

And it was frusterating that no one beleived me becuase this guys was ""so nice"". But he wasn't. What people see in public is just the mask they put on, they are absolutely a monster behind closed doors, or in everyday life. Sure, they are loving at times, but usually when they want something in return. it is never a true genuine connection or relationship. My narc had a lot of women friends, they didnt like me from the begining, and what didnt help is he did the smear campaign against me and lied about me, took things out of context, compared me to them. When I finally tried to out him people hated me more becuase how could this guy we think is so cool be the guy youre explaining? Youre just the crazy girlfriend. Uhm, no. Im being abused. Its subtle at times, but just comments, and devaluing, and refusing to take accountabilitiy for ANYTHING, you then feel like you can do nothing right, you walk on eggshells. My one year anniversary of our breakup is soon and its taken me this long after 5 years of dating to finally become my old self again after many years of damage. I've caught this man in so many lies, and contradicitions, even the narc isnt living his genuine self. And they have 0 true empathy about them, they are so so so so so good at blending in and lying about their actions, and as soon as you hold them accountable for something, they immedietly project all their insecurities onto you, and say youre the abuser (Amber!). And after 5 years of us together, he was off a week later already dating someone new. They areny normal, they feel nothing but the fact you have a use for them, whether thats sex, control, money, to fill this empty void, and when you are no longer useful, or too much work, they discard you for another person. Im happy for information is coming out about narcs, especially, because narcissism isnt just being grandiose and pompous and think youre better than everyone, sometimes it takes many forms of different abuse, but, as i ntoiced with my ex, he had a different personality for every group, me, his guy friends, his girl friends, his family, his work, it was like being with several different people and seeing the real guy at home in everyday life. It is so frusterating that his friends still beleive he isnt a grad A asshat. But i can absolutely empathize what Johnny is going through. A traditional narc has 3 steps, get the victim, love bomb, and assimilate, and they is 2) devalue, and 3) discard.",2020-07-22T05:46:05Z,2

So if the wife is abused, she normally try to go on with her life as she didn't want to involved her in laws. The same can be said if the abused is the husband.

Of course if her own parents know about the abuse, they will saved her as it is not her own family face or honor is at stake. It's the in laws.

Normally in my country, only if there's no other ways or the case become a police case, that they bring to court.",2020-07-22T03:05:10Z,0

I'm in Asia by the way and not in the western.

Also the devices that you mentioned is a bit expensive in my own country.

Westerners may not understand us. But in Eastern, community is the most important. If you do bad things, it will affect everything including your family honor. Airing dirty laundry out will not only affect you but your family as well.

More over if you're attempting to use Stockholm syndrome as an argument for why proving a liar is a liar is a bad thing for the people who aren't liars than you have larger logic issues than worrying about whether or not prosecuting a liar for lying will effect those who don't lie. Because its as simple as don't lie -> wont be called a liar.
