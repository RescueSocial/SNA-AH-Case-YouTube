She had to go early to do costume fitting and had to stay a few extra days to ""trim down"" so she could fit. She had a weight clause to fit into the expensive costuming. It was later found out that was a lie. She stayed out of country so she could claim the bruise had healed up, instead of it really being fakeup make up. If she made the deposition (one her people had made) the lack of bruise would have been telling. That she had to stay 2 weeks, was shown to not be true, they only needed her 2 days for costuming.

So getting the heave ho over the health clause, the one she exploited before for her advantage to get out of a legal obligation? That would be sauce on the duck lol!
Even if it's not true her getting the heave? So what WB would rue the day they make that flick with her, just look at the petition page to see how much shallower the audience pool is going to be, then add that when the flick is actually in the can, the ""scandal"" will finally be a hot topic again and all her shit behavior will be revisited for those that have ignored it to this point to date.

So to actually take her out of the movie they‚Äôd have to cut out every scene with her they‚Äôve already filmed in the second film and reshoot it with someone else which is just a ton of money and time and a huge delay in the work. While they can‚Äôt cut her out of the whole thing they can reduce the her screen time by cutting unnecessary scenes and then just recasting Mera in the third film.

I figure that both of her Dr. Feelgoods cut her off when they found out.  any new dietary doctor would be STRONGLY hesitant to give her new prescription dietary meds.  if she did herself harm from abusing new meds, these doctors could be on the hook for very, very expensive malpractice suits.  this leaves her only the old-fashioned way to keep her weight under control; diet & exercise.  if she could pull it off with just diet & exercise, I don't think she would have resorted to pills in the 1st place.  so, I think it's likely she's got a modest little muffin-top thing going on.",humanbean67,0,2021-03-02T22:39:50Z

You bring in Emilia and that will probably double. Amber being fired is the best thing that could happen because anyone working for her it will drag their careers down because she is so hated and she has it coming for what she has done to Johnny Depp. I think they are saying it's her health because she is known to use drugs and drink and if she breaks the contract they can get rid of her without losing money legally.

As progressive as Hollywood is, of course when the nameless one made her accusations against JD, they were all on board the AH boat.
But as the truth comes out and the case goes on, and the more damage she does throwing everyone under the bus.
Hollywood's actors and actresses are going to start distancing themselves from The Nameless One, to the point of refusing to work with her, in fears of possible public, political, and judicial backlash.  How could anyone in Hollywood trust her.  Not to lie. Not to make drama. Not to sue. Not to publicly humiliate them.
No one trusts her, so why would anyone want to be her friend.  She is the picture of Toxicity, the definition of Toxic.
She is the Black Plaque in carnation.
You get involved with AH you'll watch your career die.

If she needs to get in shape, she won't advertise that because she is so vain and has used her looks and sex appeal to get what she wants and will never admit she let herself go. Look at how quickly she corrected herself in the audio when she said she was 115 lbs, oh no she was but not anymore. There is nothing wrong with 115 lbs, I'd kill to to be 115 lbs (not literally). If WB gave her an ultimatum they would probably also tell her not to discuss this or she'd be out.
