According to her then-assistant, Heard knew she was breaking the laws bringing her unquarantined dogs to Australia. Her assistant repeatedly told her about the dogs needing to be quarantined and that there wasn't enough time to do it legally. Heard claimed she was sorting it out. What she really meant was, ""I'm just not going to declare them at all.""

The whole ""innocent"" shtick she played saying that she didn't know, that got her out of harsher punishment, was a load of garbage.

Furthermore, Johnny Depp was innocent. He had nothing to do with the dogs coming illegally in. That was all on Heard. This was also, I believe, the same holiday where she basically cut off the whole top of his finger and he had to go into hospital for them to sew his finger back together.

251,UgwL1fbTRl6eLVccMrB4AaABAg,"USURY (derived from the word, to USE) is when you look at another as if he , or she, was a resource, AND treat him, or her, as such. ""Try my pizza ? It's the best.."" With free samples do they, the world, attempt to enslave... 

Charging another interest when they borrow money from you, may be usury - is that why you lent that money to him, or her, because you see a ""customer"", a ROIC , a resource to exploit ?

 A servant is not a slave, nor can a slave be a servant. To serve another is an act of love - ""let me help you with that good thing"", or ""teach me master, so that I might serve Heaven and not Hell""... burn books such as the New International Version, for they are satanic deception. 

A slave is a tool, like a shovel, or a gun.  Whereas a servant has self-will, a choice.
  They who promote Eugenics, (what is called ""racism""), slavery, et cetra, are the servants of evil.  

A Passage , King James Version (KJV) :

 Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world. 

King James Version (KJV) - 1 john 2 : 15-16, kjv. 

A woman, so weak : 

And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her ; and he did eat. 

 -  Genesis 3 : 6, kjv.

 Yay Team,

  Banannababy Joyce is my local MP, and I vote for The Australian Greens...; as it happens, offering to shoot the illegally-imported Pistol & Boo has been the *only* Policy Decision of Barneybaby's which I 100% endorse.

   But, CitiZen Sherples with Sycophantic Reflexes bashed into them in Long-Stay Daycare Sandpits in the Human Feed-Lots can be forgiven for being too disconnected from the Australian Life Force Spirit Energy (Tumpinyerri Morrop, ask any Wirrinun or Kadaitcha-Man...) ; which is no doubt why a Citibred Asian/Australian *just does not get it...!*

 So, Shut the fuck up, Madame Flutterby ; you do *NOT* speak for Australia, and you won't for another 6 generations  - assuming that you went inland and bred with somebody who actually fits into the Landscape...

  Such is Life..., Acclimatisation cannot be pretended, nor rushed...; get used to the Fact.

(And just because OS audiences don't ""get"" an Australian film, doesn't make it ""bad""). And in case it was a big secret quite a few ""Hollywood Blockbusters"" are made here in Sydney at the old Easter Show showgrounds. By Australian crews with American money and actors. Or are those actors you see actually Australians? Why yes, many are, fancy that. And just to ensure things are really weird, we've actually been making ""Australian Films"" OS. So why are so many OS films made in Australia; (that's why Mr.Depp and Co were here after all); well three basic reasons.

She thought just because she fooled this rich famous idiot into thinking she was into him, that she could carry her spoiled brat mindset into any other situation and scam anyone.  Nope.

Where this Australian guy showed his ass was making Little Johnny and Little Susie stand in the corner and write on the chalkboard a thousand times, ""We've been bad little boys and girls.""

Did he think he'd get anything approaching genuine contrition out of these two?  Jesus, this is awkward.  I cringed.  Even these two ""actors"" couldn't (wouldn't) muster up anything beyond a forced grade school effort.

But I give Depp a small measure of credit for changing out of his standard weirdo dress (leaving off his moth-eaten hat, etc.) for a minute to put on this phony show.

I can't fuckin' _stand_ this bitch, but at least Depp doesn't generally come across as an asshole - just a naive weirdo with enough cash and notoriety to buy himself some young pussy.",netterstyl,1,2016-04-19T03:42:35Z
