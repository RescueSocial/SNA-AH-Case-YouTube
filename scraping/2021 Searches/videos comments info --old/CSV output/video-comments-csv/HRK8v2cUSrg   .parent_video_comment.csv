38,UgytoW-uPU_C85lE-Xp4AaABAg,"It's not limited to abuse either. When women commit suicide, their entire circle gets accused and cracked down. But when men commit suicide they get called pussies or weaklings for taking the easy way out. When women have body dysmorphia, they get comforted about how it's the fault of society's expectation. But when men have body dysmorphia they get called a narcissist or ungrateful or to ""suck it up"". And don't even get me started on professional environment too. If you think unequal wage is a women problem, then men also have issues like being made to work overtime more often, or put in more occupational hazard than women, or even receive abuse from customers because they think it's more okay to yell at men.

40,UgypkKurPHfuNUSLOwV4AaABAg,"why do people feel so comfortable saying she's the abuser? I read the articles about this case and even after hearing accounts on both sides I couldn't really tell which one held the most power in that relationship. I honestly don't feel comfortable accusing either of them because both of them describe and admit to doing some form of physical abuse. Why has everyone reached a consensus that she was making things up/was the abuser? This makes me extremely uncomfortable specially because most sources on Depp's side are his friends, his attorneys.

The only conclusion I can come to is that the relationship was extremely unhealthy. But as to say which one of them was the instigator? I wish I knew why people are so sure, specially when no one is ever this sure when a woman makes the accusation.",Yasmine S,0,2020-05-29T07:06:28Z

51,UgxL7wVD5hVABy-AWn94AaABAg,"I'm a man who was in an abusive relationship for years. When  we broke up one of my friends said to her something like ""I really hope he presses charges"". 
Because of this she panicked and told the police I was beating HER through the whole relationship just incase I did. Because she was the woman making the claim and I was only a man with evidence, the police put my phone in an evidence locker and ""lost"" it, so I had no way of proving my innocence. 
I had watertight evidence of her abuse. I never once fought back or laid a finger on her, but just because she said I did with no evidence, I did 6 months in prison when I was the VICTIM. To this day no one has ever really believed me other than people who where around and saw for themselves what she put me through, because of toxic poison like meto and believe all women. It's going to be on my record for the rest of my life that I slapped my wife around when the opposite is true. She got all this mental health help and housing and they fully supported her stopping me seeing my kids, who I haven't seen in 4 years. Whenever I seek help for the PTSD, eating disorder and other mental health issues I came out of that relationship with (I literally got sectioned for it at one point) I'm either greeted with ""man up"" or ""well you shouldnt have beat up your wife"".

77,UgwgDCnOn7L9-rDLTsB4AaABAg,Thanks for calling abuse abuse. There are still so many people banging the ‚Äúbelieve all women‚Äù drum.,Blank Space Provided,18,2020-05-27T17:06:32Z
78,Ugz26Wxo6BZw35_IbP14AaABAg,"Thank you for focusing on BOTH sexes. I don‚Äôt understand how anyone who has a partner who struggles that most times has nothing to do with you thinks it‚Äôs fine.  It kills me, that my partner is doing all the recovery work IN A PANDEMIC üíî For everyone doing work on themselves üí™üôè‚ù§Ô∏è YOU CAN DO THIS!",Megan is a Crafty gamer,15,2020-05-27T17:02:20Z
79,Ugxxv_Qi_KPED9uHAXN4AaABAg,"In my humble opinion none of these Hollywood types should be considered as role models at all, most all of the are pedo degenerates,  Epstein for example, even Mathew  McConaughey who just filmed himself delivering masks to hospitals was actually being paid, it was a ford propaganda commercial, Ellen DeGeneres is a mean person in real life.

The real nice genuine good people are normally conservative Republican Christian's that get run out of the business like Kevin Sorbo, it takes a real messed up narcissistic person to make it through the gauntlet of insanity to become rich and famous.",Eric Eveland,0,2020-05-27T17:00:56Z
80,UgzUh9Rh77XNbUXaOQl4AaABAg,"Thank you so much for these videos! They‚Äôre really helping me make positive changes about how I view this subject myself. I‚Äôm just gonna be honest and admit that I have a hard time still understanding that men can be and often are victims of abuse as well. Having grown up being abused by mostly men, it‚Äôs so hard for me to see that men can be just as hurt by women as we can by them. I do feel bad for Johnny and others, of course. But videos like this and your Dear Men video are helping me see just how sad and how common it really actually is.",Anna,1,2020-05-27T17:00:00Z
81,UgxcgXWWLHi0edfPnmp4AaABAg,"Heard exploiting her clout to assassinate the character of Johnny Depp is a horror on its own

But being an abuser herself yet painting deceptively Depp as the villain disrespects people falsely accused, and people actually victims of abuse

She disgusts me",Andrianarinivo,28,2020-05-27T16:58:21Z
82,UgzsRkoSQu7X0znx0td4AaABAg,"Thankyou. My ex not matter how much i hate him i feel sorry for him. He was mentally abused by his partner before me and i knew him before that happened and it chamged him. Any man who goes through this is no different to any women. Physical and mental abuse is not ok no matter who you are. So i thankyou for spreading light on this. It needs to be said. 
I hae heard of a man hitting a woman once and got arrested but it was because she was hitting him and beating him. She never got anything as she said it was self defence.",Heidi Baltom,6,2020-05-27T16:57:25Z
