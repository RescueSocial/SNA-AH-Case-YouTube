She’ll tell us she should’ve gotten an abortion many times before has threatened to throw down and will lie to the people we ask for help from. A couple weeks ago my sister tried to kill herself by driving my car into a river. 4 out of 5 of my siblings have at one point tried to commit suicide including me. Anybody we get to help is manipulated by my mom or chanced away by her by her true rotten personality.

When she simply accused Johnny of abuse, he nearly lost his entire career while she marched and spoke on stage in women marches. Evidence is shown proving Amber is the abuser and nearly nothing happens, she still keeps all of her roles as an ambassador for abused women. There is no comparison between the two scenarios and the backlash both parties received.

68,UgzUQCIhm1hwhAP9mgJ4AaABAg,Alex Sattar,"I would disagree with your point on Feminism. This IS feminist behaviour. Much like liberating women from oppression is. There is a positive and negative side to Feminism, and you can’t cherry pick the good and ignore the bad. Rather, as a feminist, the best thing is to acknowledge the bad to then be able to fix it. Because this problem is a systemic one that can be fixed at the individual level.

To elaborate my point, there are quite a lot of Reddit posts on r/AskFeminism about this situation dated AFTER the audio recordings were released. With this evidence, still, almost every single comment was either victim-blaming Johnny, denying the evidence was even real, or saying Johnny was abusive as well. Furthermore, most mainstream media outlets who were once outraged and stood up supporting Amber Heard are quiet, or instead of writing opinion pieces like before, are now sticking only to legal facts of the case and are as minimalist as possible. This is TEXTBOOK Feminism. By that I mean solidarity of the “sisterhood”, defending women even when they’re in the wrong. But this isn’t a problem unique to feminism. Ultimately it boils down to tribalism. Feminists sticking with evil women because they’re women and vilifying men. 

It’s the same with the police. They have a tribalistic brotherhood. Feminism and the police are good things, but most of their negative qualities boils down to tribalism. Defending and downplaying police brutality. Defending female abusers and r*pists or downplaying their crimes because they have a vagina and their victim has a penis. Feminist hypocrisy. R*cist police. All of these problems boil down to tribalism.",2020-06-21T00:19:00Z,1

Corrosive Control, trauma bonding it's hard to explain it to people it's hard for people to understand. I don't want sympathy or pity I needed help getting out from my family and they thought I was over reacting. He also, like Pierre said happened to him, was able to convince family and some friends of mine that I was being dramatic and that I was the ONLY one to blame. I am not blameless I should have responded instead of reacted, I should have listened to myself and gotten out, I shouldn't have gotten so emotionally upset that I said things I later regretted. I apologised he never did. The psychological and emotional abuse can cause a lifetime of damage along with the possibility of literally affecting your physical health.

Anyway,  even people who are usually portrayed as ""nice"", ""pretty"", ""talented""... I'll look at them and just not like them. I didn't like Miley Cyrus even when she was still Hannah Montana. Years later, everybody hates her. I never liked Cardi B., but my kids did. Now, they pretty much can't stand her. People that I usually can't stand, it'll come out weeks, months, sometimes years later that I was ""reading"" them correctly, everybody now sees what I saw way back then, and now everybody hates them. It's really strange, but it keeps me safe now. I've always been more of an observer. I'll stand back and let the rest of humanity interact while I just watch. I really don't like people anyway. Oh well! LOL!",2020-03-01T00:12:40Z,3
123,Ugxd5b2Q3cOWcE_t22l4AaABAg,A HA,"@This Is Rosie!!! they do give off bad vibes, but the so called vibes are more quantifiable and actually observable even if not easy. For instance microexpressions, body language, movement patterns and so on. Smell can also contribute when you're right next to them, humans can smell anger, stress, fear, and maybe disgust. We are really bad at it compared to for instance dogs, but we can still do it. 

Bad vibes might for instance even be that they are behaving in a subtly contradictory way or in a way that implies bad things if they don't have any disabilities (for instance if you have nerve damage in your face making some facial muscles paralyzed, that will creep some people out unfortunately, but it won't be as unsettling as someone who can not do that but still does). Another thing that is very common to give bad vibes is when someone is laser focused on getting something specific from you that they know is not easily parted with. For instance getting money from you, or sex, or an item. If that person isn't really obvious about it, they will still have an unusual behavioural pattern.  

I am sorry if I have rambled on too much, this is just a fascinating topic to me. I am an autist (with ADHD) so a lot of things normal people instinctively subconsciously read from others I have to actively look for. I am very grateful I was lucky enough to unintentionally train myself from early childhood to read faces through watching a lot of acting, but real life is not as wonderfully standardized and stripped of irrelevant elements (to ""the story"") as formalized acting. 

Real people have all sorts of things going on in their life simultaneously, and for someone like me it can sometimes be difficult to know if a stranger at a party who is listening to a few of us talk and occasionally interjects  is moving from side to side too much and looking aside a lot because they are way too bored, or naturally restless and don't like eye contact (I don't like too much uninterrupted eye contact either, it feels so aggressive!), or if they need to go to the bathroom but keep putting it off because they want to finish up the conversation with all of us whether out of interest or social obligation. 
Plus I have to actively focus and look for these signs, I get so easily distracted by even random background noises that others don't notice.",2020-02-17T11:41:33Z,3

It was a pattern I had learned I had to do because ""I was wrong"" and ""I deserved it anyway for being born and causing them so much grief through my mere existence"".

Many of the women who joined us couldn't trust other women , they felt safe and ready to talk to the men in ways that they never could to the professionals . It wasnt an official support with any charity money or funding . It was at first a bunch of guys down a pub meeting up when ever we needed help . 

At first we were reluctant but decided to listen , once we heard that their experience mirrored our own every one knew we needed to help them . 

It wasnt sob stories it was what we as a group had also experienced . We knew they wouldn't recieved help because their abusers were not the right sort of abuser . 

One woman couldn't use public toilets because of the attack she underwent,  but just being part of our group she could use them  , at first only the mens if one of us were with her . Last I had heard (around 8 or so years ago after she moved away) she had a new partner who we had meet and was almost back to how she used to be .

246,UgzZfAiICAnCcdV7aAt4AaABAg,Loba Étoile,"I grew up around many domestic abusive relationships and you are wrong. Not all cases are one sociopathic narcissist who searches submissive partners to abuse them... Many cases are people who have traumas or mental illnesses or issues at the moment and so they develop power issues (distrust/jealousy/envy/deep insecurities/resentment/fear/being controlling/lack of communication/addictions/incompatible life styles, etc) and become violent with each other. I would say in most cases both people aren't evil, but have unresolved issues and become obsessed/codependent over a toxic relationship, so the psychological/verbal violence and emotional manipulation tends to go both ways. In some extreme cases there is clearly one person who is a victim, but humans are complex just like relationships, it's not always black & white.",2020-03-27T06:02:32Z,1

248,UgzZfAiICAnCcdV7aAt4AaABAg,A HA,"Both my parents were toxic and abusive before they met and had kids. Being together just made them so much worse and resentful. Their separation into becoming neighbours vastly improved my quality of life, despite it still being really shitty. Sometimes, it isn't one perpetrators and one enabler or one victim. Sometimes it is shitty people hurting each other, and no two toxic people hurting each other just makes the world a shittier place. In a perfectly just magic world people that mentally sick would simply not be allowed to date until they have healed and improved enough mentally to be a decent human being even if flawed.",2020-02-16T20:42:50Z,3

250,UgzZfAiICAnCcdV7aAt4AaABAg,Seto Freakin Kaiba,@Radical Dreamer 1029 I hate terrible things like that. I guess I haven't seen a situation were both people are at fault. So far I haven't...I just feel that saying things like that is kinda making it seem as if there is no victims and I've been told far too many times that it's the victims fault and that they started it....makes it seem as we shouldn't speak out about it because of people like Amber making women seem less trustworthy. I've heard men say that women are easily believed and therefore all women manipulate things...there's a hatred there that makes my story seem as if it was my fault...and I've question myself if it was many times and have to convince myself that it wasn't. I can only imagine what people like Johnnny must feel. Having the whole world point a finger in your direction and helping the abuser continue their torment. I'm glad you took the time to respond. I'll try to keep in mind about other situations. I know the world isn't black and white but sometimes I have to think that way so I won't doubt my sanity again.,2020-02-16T01:16:27Z,1

Do you know what guys will think of you when you say that? They’ll think you’re a slut and trash talk you behind your back lmao.

Even when he let her keep living with him after he broke up with her cause she got nowhere to go she kept manipulating and abusing him physically. Of course he never reported it because of obvious reasons even though he's a really small guy from Guatemala and she was pretty tall and overweight.,2020-06-06T21:39:57Z,0
