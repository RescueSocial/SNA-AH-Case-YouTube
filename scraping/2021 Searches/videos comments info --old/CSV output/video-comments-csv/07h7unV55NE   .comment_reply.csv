18,UgzRubLVrCaDe82Vaux4AaABAg,SweetChastity,@Deborah Shingleton yup! But her side kept claiming the $100k (each charity) donations as if Amber gave them willingly when Johnny gave them (then her lawyers demanded he give them the $200k anyway since it should have gone to her first). So it isn't any surprise they claim the anonymous donations as hers even though they can't prove the money came from her and that she used the divorce settlement to pay it. I'm very happy the judge saw through their BS.,2021-03-23T12:53:43Z,6

34,Ugwk5a46ijKpnb678Nl4AaABAg,Guy Mercier,‚Äã@OtterFan ü§ó‚≠ê Comrade I do hope so. But looking at the way Julian Asante has been treated by the British court... and his defence was also founded  on the human rights issue and we saw how it went... not even  Admesty International can be present in court :(... So I do hope I am wrong... but I am afraid we are all in very dark place at this moment... We could use a Churchill,2021-03-21T22:25:50Z,2
35,Ugwk5a46ijKpnb678Nl4AaABAg,OtterFan ü§ó‚≠ê,I share your feelings of apprehension on this. Perhaps it's just an echo of the disappointment from the first 'judgement'. But they have brought the human rights issue into it I understand. So that to me suggests an intent to persevere and not give up until every avenue has been exhausted. Fingers crossed he won't have to go that far.,2021-03-21T22:17:23Z,2

42,Ugy3Z49losyuoKNzX1F4AaABAg,TheLittleThings,"Think it was a letter Johnny's accountant sent to the CHLA, rather than the one from the CHLA confirming she hadn't donated. The argument being that his lawyers must have considered questioning her on the donation if they included information about it for the judge to see and therefore it was their choice not to pursue whether she donated.",2021-03-22T21:57:09Z,1

53,UgxRepLTBtoJaMUetDJ4AaABAg,Jay A Errington,@Hollye Rorabaugh has he said something or is it a release by WB.. I'm dubious as to how many people actually support her cos of the WB clamp down on people speaking out after JD was taken off fantastic beasts they were told to say nothing... So it does make me wanna hear it from the horses mouth plus in interviews they have to be polite... However watched first aquaman and there is a scene where her and mamoa sat on a boat it was awkward there was zero connection he couldn't even look at her.. Her acting was appalling I'm not saying tgat cos I dislike her immensely lol it just was... Whole thing was like power rangers kids TV show...
