I am just trying to make the point that I feel they could have condemned her actions OR at least found a way to get rid of her  when this all comes out. I just personally find it hard to believe that there wouldn't be some kind of legal ""loophole"" to get her the hell out of the franchise the second the recordings were leaked. However, you guys are absolutely correct when it comes to the contract. I should have addressed both sides in the video.",Doctor Soup,8,2020-10-24T17:31:48Z

10,UgxsNdlfF18g4a3dq9V4AaABAg,"They have no intention of using her in the second film, particulary since she screwed up FB3 filming schedule by demanding JD return to the US for his deposition mid filming! Shes cost them a fortune!",Sarah Walkey,0,2020-10-26T21:15:46Z
11,UgyrDw_dIm_Eik3WvjB4AaABAg,"Johnny knows more about AM2's filming schedule then AH does so ....WB know they are going to make a fair bit of money from JD given his fan base so they will want to keep him because there going broke anyway. but AH 's career has halted (the stand? no one even cares about it cause she's in it) also she made a fool of herself on the Stand panel and when AH claims that she got fired from AM2 she'll try to sue Jonny but if they haven't been in communication with her about it then WB never committed to anything in the first place,so if AH counterclaims it will get thrown out.now that Adam Waldman has been benched but not gag ordered he has even more freedom and can spread what he likes to the public,Benjamin Chew who was always the lead lawyer will take over with a seamless integration on this case and knows Evrything Adam does and Adam will. Be advising anyway....I think the Australian investigation has Really rattled AH and it should...she will only get a conviction and a fine BUT that's all that's needed for film companies to wash their hands of her especially WB.Jason Mamoa stood up for Ray Fischer but not for Amber!!?

12,UgzbPJOA3nQUvYyB06V4AaABAg,I know Amber heard hasn‚Äôt been charged with abusing but just having allegations of abuse might stop her from entering Australia to film Aquaman 2 because Chris brown banned from Australia for abusing Rihanna but he was convicted for it,Cara,0,2020-10-25T03:06:03Z
13,UgwuGBhiQMx1Yp85uTl4AaABAg,"Hi Shelby! Yes, you are correct. There are standard morality clauses in acting contracts that allow a studio to drop an actor if they do anything that would cause the studio bad publicity, public backlash, and/or financial damage. Good old A checks off all of the boxes, our shady little criminal overachiever! In addition to ALL of the baggage she is now dragging around with her, as I understand it she is uninsurable, which means no studio will touch her with a ten foot pole. If she does have a part in Justice League, it‚Äôs other old footage they are using or *possibly* she‚Äôs still covered by the insurance that existed to that project, but she will not be insurable for any new projects.",Joann Hess,1,2020-10-25T02:37:49Z

15,UgxDkjXAyZocuRkzKoV4AaABAg,What difficult to understand?...Warner brothers is acting out their own best interests...

38,UgwDlK64QQHBJTNY5qR4AaABAg,Yeah I think now that she‚Äôs being investigated for perjury in Australia they have pretty much no choice but to fire her.

43,Ugw1lqE9nSbwwDBgBPt4AaABAg,"There's a fee problems with the whole thing: 

Snyder wants Amber in. He casted her, he put her in the trailer for the Snyder Cut, and he's supposedly doing reshoots with her right now. And he has a LOT of fans backing him up. 

Mamoa and many others do not want her. Mamoa might even threaten to sue WB if she remains. 

WB executives have to be careful of firing people too fast as they already received backlash from s previous situation. 

I think they bought her contract out with a temporary gagorder. And the supposed reshoots are just another lie of Amber's.",Rebecca Vaughn,12,2020-10-23T20:17:51Z

46,UgzEiFTOXSWQCTzhnOF4AaABAg,"There is a logic behind what Warner Brothers is up to.  Ms. Heard's countersuit depends on her being able to establish that Mr. Depp's actions caused her to lose money.  If Warner Brothers fired her, she could claim Mr. Depp's actions were the reason she lost the movie, and he now owes her the amount of money that she would have made had she not been fired.  As of right now, her suit will likely be dismissed quickly...because she can't demonstrate a financial loss connected to Mr. Depp.  Warner Brothers have a experienced legal team, who are accustomed to these types of litigations.  They are making a Johnny Depp film right now, and are not going to do anything to interfere with his pending Defamation Trial. 

      I agree with you, Ms. Heard is on her way out.  She hasn't spoken to Warner Brothers for months, and thinks Aquaman II will film in the Spring...when Mr. Depp has submitted a legal letter from Warner Brothers, attached to the Praecipe, saying that Aquaman II won't film BEFORE May 3, which means it will be at least June, or a ""summer shoot"".  How come Mr. Depp knows when Ms. Heard's movie is being made--but Amber Heard *doesn't?*",NIBS,27,2020-10-23T19:11:30Z
47,UgxA1euA5w8AQ0Am8d14AaABAg,"Shelby, I really think the delay in the WB regarding Amber Heard is because there is likely an employment contact already and they are waiting for the UK verdict to have a legal reason to fire her. If Johnny wins the UK case, I believe Amber will be released from all of her current employment and sponsorships. We can certainly hope so. She has caused so much collateral damage to people not even involved in the drama and I‚Äôm sure those affected are NOT happy to be dragged into it.
