She intially love bombed him and mirrored him.  Put him on a pedestal. It's like he fell in love with himself. Finally someone who gets him.  And it was all a mask.  She is a predator. Period. And an abuser.  Although maybe you don't think someone hitting you , cutting off your finger , throwing objects and hitting you with pots and pans , and lying under oath is an abuser.

120,UgxyDRq6CcPZsd-kvQR4AaABAg,Marshall Matters,"@jazmine perry context matters. Logic and objectivity is pertinent. Johnny was upset from the death of his mother. I don't like, Johnny. The guys a f'kin idiot lefty, who joked about killing the president, and panders to the woke, establishment elite worshipping crowd, so part of me wants to say he deserves it, but logic is intrinsic to my understanding, so, I can't allow extrinsic behaviour/feelings to influence my opinion. As much as it pains me to defend him, I must remain true to objectivity, and observable reality, which tells us that she's got a serious temper problem, she's admitted to it, she's admitted to hitting him while she's was recording him, yet she never responded to his complaints with a reference to a time when Johnny was physically violent towards her, instead she stated the opposite by saying that he runs away ""like a girl"" or ""like a bitch"". Logic, and past experience from arguing with a female, tells me that if there was ever a time,even if it happened over a decade ago, she would bring it up immediately as though it happened yesterday. Therefore, I cannot with a clear conscience, believe Johnny to be anything other than a victim. He broke a bottle, so what. She cut the end of his finger off and told him that no one would believe him because he's a man, and people like you are proving her right. She's a psychopathic bully and yet she's paraded around as a hero. Says a. Lot about modern day feminism.",2021-02-27T10:24:00Z,2

Her lawyer sent this letter before she did what she did saying that if Johnny didn't accept her terms, she would go to the media to tell her story. As Johnny didn't accept, what we know about the story happened. Now, why if she was so charitable did she ask for all of that in the first place? Don't you think that when voice of it came out and people began calling her a 'gold digger' to clean her name she donated the money to charity?
Also, and I must say I actually cannot confirm this until I research it, but it is said Johnny was the one who put that in the terms in order for him to agree to give that quantity to her and that part of it was donated by Johnny in Amber's name instead of giving it directly to her.

When friends and family playfully slap each other like that, there may be a slight flinch or the person may not react in body language at all, but may just laugh.

Hahaha like I said, maybe he did, maybe he didn't. I couldn't care less. Just funny how you're so absolutely certain with your BS.

*""The cop arrested her because she SAW her attack her with her own two eyes and Tasya wasn't defending her back then.""*
GASP!!! You mean like the horrific way she ""was violent in this video""? Lol. She allegedly grabbed and hit her *arm* which could be anything. But all that's moot anyways. Or do you think committing a crime means people have impunity to commit similar crimes against you? So if you've ever slapped someone, playfully or otherwise, anyone is allowed to beat the shit out of you?

*""The LAPD had no reason to lie about a pretty white blonde having an injury on her face ""*
I guess you've never heard the phrase, ""I hope that doesn't bruise...""? I have to get hit pretty damn hard for a bruise to show up within an hour. Usually I don't even notice my bruises til a day or so later and think, ""Oh! Where did that come from?""

*""...that magically disappeared the next day btw""*
It's drastically harder to make fake bruises than cover up real bruises. But somehow you think it's impossible for a ""pretty white blond"" movie star to do basic cover up, but simultaneously be a pro FX makeup artist? Okay...

*""Slamming ones cabinets when upset and having a shitty day does not make one abusive dummy.""*
Where did I say that? *You* brought up violence. 
violent .adj- using or involving physical force intended to hurt, _damage_ , or kill someone or something.

*""the judge saw their evidence and signed off on it WITH prejudice.""*
Ah, so anything that can't be proven in court is total BS right? Isn't filing a false police report a crime as well? But wait... Amber Heard's never even been taken to court for filing a false police report! Guess that means she's totally vindicated right?

*""here you snowflakes are with excuses for literally everything""*
Ah, say no more. I didn't realize you were some MAGA moron. That explains your poor reading comprehension. Sure, anyone that doesn't endorse every idiotic statement you make is a ""snowflake"" haha. Definitely nothing snowflake-like about you flipping your shit over ARM SLAPS/HITS. 

*""Not to mention he has NO abusive history.""*

402,UgjupnhFrAfMangCoAEC,Martina,"Yeah both men and women get old but contrary to what society thinks/says, I actually think a lot of older women get better with age as well. If you look at actresses like Rachel McAdams, who is now 37, she is even prettier now than when she was younger. There's lots of attractive older women. I think both men and women get more attractive as they age because their facial features become defined, they've gained experience and they've usually gained more of a sense of who they are by then. All of these things are attractive. The reason why some older men like Johnny get together with younger women is because some of them face mid-life crises and men are able to procreate past 50, so they're attracted to younger women as well because they are usually more fertile.",2016-06-20T21:51:03Z,0
