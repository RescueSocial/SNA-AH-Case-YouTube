0,Ugxc9oBQ2FqIqe9aWc14AaABAg,Nicolas Cardillo,"I don't know how much do u know about this case but there are voice recordings of the argument/fights between them. In this recording Amber Heard admits to attacking Johnny Depp verbally and physically, admit to not promise to stop attacking him. She talks about how she has hit him with cooking wear (Pans), battles n other objects. Call Johnny Depp a coward because he leaves every time they fight n never solve the issues.  U can head her cream at him why he always runs away n then in others she tells him that going to other room or the other side of the house is not enough space of distance, that when they are in hotels n he takes other room for himself is not far enough n that makes her harder for her to deal with it. Depp calmly answers her back saying that he loves her n that every time he leaves is because the arguments/fights get physical but she can't promise him not to get physical on their arguments in order to deal with it. There is also an incident where she attacks him with a broken bottle n nearly cut one of his finger off n Depp had to surgically attack it back. J. Depp did admit to verbally abuse her back in fight n to substance abuse issues (alcohol) that was well documented while he was filming Pirates of the Caribbean 5, but that he never hit her back. This I don't know much about but apparently there is evidence of her showing up with bruises and evidence of the attack and the day later pictures of her perfectly fine without any trace of physical abuse but this I have only heard seen some pictures but not pruff of when were taken on the videos I saw. Her best friends that were set to testify refused to do so n are not on speaking terms with her and allegation of her previous relationship came out that she also physically abuse them too. That's why a lot of the people are on Depp side, at the start everyone thought he was responsible since he had drinking issues (he did get help n turn it around, fixing his life n carrier that when he made the Murder on the Orient Express), but ones this recording came out that was recorded by Anber Heard not less the public opinion flip because very clearly she admits been the abuser, n many more. PS: this will have more reactions in the media, so I believe u may do other videos about it. check some of the info and legal case J. Depp is on n it will help u a lot on ur next video.",2020-11-09T08:11:00Z,0

33,Ugy24Y7Y0ftjVKggT0N4AaABAg,Ember Fist,"@Schnick The subplots added included giving the film a central antagonist in the form of Azog The Defiler which benefitted the films as the book was just a series of random events and contrived coincidences a good example. In the book, the Wargs showed up because they just so happened to be coming to do a raid with Goblins despite never being mentioned before. The film changes it so Azog‚Äôs hunting party are the ones who attack the party which was set up with earlier encounters. Gandalf leaving for Gul Dugor was taken from the appendix of The Lord of the Rings which has established that the events happened during the events of The Hobbit where in the original book it was just a blatant contrivance to remove Gandalf from the plot because he could have prevented the Battle of the Five Armies from happening if he didn‚Äôt leave. The Battle of the Fives Armies was only so short on the book because Bilbo the viewpoint character of the book was knocked out early and learns about the events second hand. This couldn‚Äôt be done for the film since Thorin share the role of main protagonist with Biblo and given how he drove the plot, having him die offscreen would be a bad move. As for the romance subplot people complain about. If you see Legolas as a sibling like Orlando Bloom did it works great. It also helps with Legolas‚Äô later arc in the Lord of Rings where he learns to respect Gimli and see him as friend. In addition the subplot was another good exception to the portrayal of Elves and Dwarfs as bitter enemies. The sequence where Kili is poisoned is also beneficial as it gives Bard and his family a role in the plot between him bringing the party to lake town and killing Smaug. Speaking of Bard being introduced earlier as the person who brings the party to Lake Town sets up appearance and characterization before he kills Smaug. In the book, one of the biggest issues is Bard is only introduced in the chapter where the town is attacked by Smaug meaning he comes out of nowhere",2020-12-09T20:47:28Z,0

52,Ugz2_1sSgfq7yO-cApV4AaABAg,Lone Wolf,"@Talia al Ghul I can definitely see your point.    I think that's also why a lot of Hollywood directors are becoming producers or they're just outright leaving the business entirely.    

Although Michael Bay has some movies that I like such as ""the Rock"", ""Armageddon"" and etc, I will admit that his style of filmmaking wouldn't work in today's metoo era for all the reasons you just said which probably explains why he's been mostly focused on being a producer these days than directing any films.    

Same with Quentin Tarantino.   He probably sees the woke shit increasing in Hollywood so that's probably why he wants to end his career sooner rather than later as he strikes me as a man that would rather walk away on top than continue to direct films but only if he's willing to change his style which I don't Tarantino would ever do.",2020-11-07T18:27:05Z,0
53,Ugz2_1sSgfq7yO-cApV4AaABAg,Talia al Ghul,"@Lone Wolf Yeah, but I don't think Megan would have to be able to ""suck up"" to Michael Bay had she had the same protection that Amber Heard had. The metoo era is using identity politics and victimhood nonsense instead of having to cast couch (not that that is right either). By all accounts, Megan Fox would be considered an SJW heroine. I mean if Brie Larson could get away with saying racist/sexist things towards white men and if Amber Heard could get away with abusing another, comparing a white man to Adolf Hitler would be okay to the blue-check marks and SJWs. Michael Bay would either have to cave into SJW pressure and allow Megan in TMNT or run the risk of being fired. Megan Fox today would not have to take off a stitch of clothing, but rather threaten to cancel Michael Bay.",2020-11-07T13:04:39Z,2
