6,Ugyk3z280NkB8EGOt1x4AaABAg,Livonda Beach,"@Rock Candy everyone here is so sure he's going to win. Look hard at what the lawsuit is about. It's not about whether there was abuse, it's about whether she ""defamed""him.
The five requisite elements of a defamation lawsuit?
A statement of fact. Of course, for defamation to have occurred, somebody must have made the statement that is considered defamatory. ... 
A published statement. ... 
The statement caused injury. ... 
The statement must be false. ... 
The statement is not privileged. ... 
The key here is ""the statement must be false"".  Johnny's addictions are going to play a huge part in this. It is not about whether AH abused him, it's about whether her statements were false. Sorry to say that when Johnny is questioned he does not come across as blame free. Don't be so sure he's going to win just because she is an evil conniving narcissist. This is a matter of ""law"" not what the general public ""feels"" about the situation. The fact that she is a liar still does not mean she ""defamed"" him and unless she specifically said in writing that ""Johnny hit and abused me"" then she cannot be blamed for the implication. This is a slippery slope for Johnny and he is better off having her ""retract "" her statements in public to vindicate him than winning a monetary victory. His reputation is tarnished no matter what. The only plus in this would be for her reputation to be irrevocably tarnished to the point of losing any and all future work, but that won't happen in Hollywood cause it is corrupt and only looks at $$$. Boycott all her movies, that's the only way the studios will get the message that their reactions were one-sided.",2021-07-25T10:55:33Z,0

8,UgyW00ikIC8-ycOeCp14AaABAg,Hoptoit,"Hopefully that will be part of the VA case. I’m sure that JD’s legal team are working on this. In a way it’s good that the case isn’t until next year because it gives JD’s team more time to prepare. In the meantime, AH’s legal team should be doing the same but it’s stuff that’s not in her favour at all. So much more stuff about AH has come out as we know. 

She’s screwed I think. I pray that JD will get the justice he deserves and she in turn will be punished for all the damage she’s caused. A person cannot be allowed to get away with what she has done (and then to think bringing a child into the world at this time will gain her sympathy and everything will be waved away.)",2021-07-24T00:33:28Z,1

14,UgySrHrv4dfSyEuBSJ54AaABAg,Christine Venner,"@chester lestrange I totally agree with you. 
I'd go so far as to say anyone who is facing a court case after being accused of DV or rape should get the same anonymity  that the victims get  and only if a guilty verdict is given should their identity be divulged. 
Just the accusations can destroy a person's life, even if they are cleared in a court of law.",2021-07-24T02:41:53Z,0
15,UgySrHrv4dfSyEuBSJ54AaABAg,chester lestrange,"@Christine Venner oh definitely!! A big case like this is exactly what we need to finally set a precedent that can't be ignored. And hopefully put an end to the ""believe all women"" nonsense. There is a reason we have due process. People lie. Every human is capable of it. And when you are dealing with incredibly serious charges like DV or rape it needs to be proven with actual evidence. Simply being accused of thos stuff is enough to ruin a persons life. They also need to make it a crime to accuse people on social media. And to ban media from reporting on anything like this until after there's been a conviction.",2021-07-24T02:08:24Z,1
16,UgySrHrv4dfSyEuBSJ54AaABAg,Christine Venner,"@chester lestrange I really hope so, for many reasons.
Obviously I want JD to get his good name back, but this case also highlights that men are also victims of DV, and coming out and saying they are doesn't make them wimps or weak, in fact it's testament to their strength that they didn't just hit back and knock their abuser on her arse.
It only means they fell in love with the wrong person.

92,Ugy8p_1blsr5E5sC1UB4AaABAg,Emily Morton,"@Lilia Mendes she's been told twice already that the US won't throw out the case and has been warned about this 3rd time. She'll be sanctioned. A theory is she's hoping that a settlement will be agreed and the case won't go any further (but she'll still try and sue JD for $100million 😂). JD however will not settle. He'll push for this to go to court and clear his name. She's now dug a massive hole and will do anything to bury others in her place. I hope the court throw everything at her and the case is used for criminal charges on her also. She should be made an example of for all DV & rape survivors, and family law cases.  She used JD and the ACLU used this hoax for political reasons. Now it's time to show the ACLU that their fraud is up or as they like to say ""time's up""",2021-07-24T18:23:01Z,5
93,Ugy8p_1blsr5E5sC1UB4AaABAg,Lilia Mendes,She is counting to the UK  veredict that because of ter lies the  Judge gave  a Wim to the Journal The Sun . She went to the UK and lied in court  just to have the sentence favouring   the Journal The Sun  and use this to favor herself . She already new the that the case was already won by the NGN group . Cause they could change the Judge and put Nocols   to preside the case .,2021-07-24T18:03:26Z,0

It doesn’t seem like she has anyone truly close to her , that likes her .  I mean her circle says they do, but actions say otherwise .",2021-07-23T18:31:56Z,16
