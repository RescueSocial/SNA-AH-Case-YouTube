Growing up on comic books both by DC and Marvel, it's a must for me to see all those super hero's movies, even if they have bad reviews before I go see them. But when it comes down to ""Aquaman 2"" and as much I enjoy Jason Momoa as Aquaman, this will be the first super hero movie that I will deliberately pass on due to Amber Heard being in it.

30,UgyL1170irWwLNvlvgx4AaABAg,"Hello Umbrella Man! I've been listening for a few weeks to your reports yet, I have not commented but I will today.  Nobody in Hollywood or any of the movie production studios have the right to cast the first stone. Nobody has the right to condemn, persecute, ridicule or   judge any person. They also don't have the right to shun them and use them as an example. What goes on in these people's private lives, God only knows, so they have no right to use Mr. Depp as the whipping post. That being said, the truth will be told. As far as this ongoing trial and this nameless person, there are secrets yet to be told that will inevitably surface, and all the. rats will be running scared they will have no choice but to tell the truth due to their reputation. 
I believe in my heart  this is the first big wide open case of domestic abuse brought upon by women and a prominent well-loved mega movie star.  This will be an example for the US and the world to see. This abuse issue needs to be pursued and finally brought to justice.  Not all women are the victims of abuse, whether it be verbal or physical, and because they are men they secretly suffer inside emotionally, and this in itself is a serious injustice that needs to be exposed...üåπ",Donna Massa,0,2021-07-30T17:03:24Z

It was an organization as American as apple pie and Superman - truth, justice, and the American way of freedom of thought. I don‚Äôt know what they think they are doing now. Prompting a woman to defame a man, and enabling her to go to an agency and sign up to discuss her ‚Äúabuse‚Äù to the tune of thousands of dollars. Who does that? I‚Äôm a crime victim and a cancer survivor. I‚Äôve been asked to speak to various groups, and I would be insulted if I was offered money to simply try to encourage and support others who are struggling with their mental and physical health.
