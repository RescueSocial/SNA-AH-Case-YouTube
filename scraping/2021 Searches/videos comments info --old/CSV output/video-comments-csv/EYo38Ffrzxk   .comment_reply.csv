She wears whatever fits the trend of the era; very boring. She stole nothing from Johnny in those regards. I wish she had, but she didn't. I can't fathom hearing her grouped in the same style and fashion category. Nuh mmm.

Ok, let me give you an example: My mother doesn't have a beautiful body but my father has always loved her; my father has never had a lot of money but my mother has always loved him.
Of course some people say they love another because of their looks and/or money but it isn't usually like that. And if you think that is how love works, you don't know what is love or you have never experienced it and I'm really sorry for you.
You need physical attraction in order to fall in love, of course, but not money XD
And that thing about women wanting money and men caring only about looks is quite sexist btw
