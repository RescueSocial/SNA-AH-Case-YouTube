If Warner Brothers continues to reward this abuser their movies will fail.  Fantastic Beasts 3 is already doomed because Johnny Depp was the best thing about it.   Amber does not have any fans but Johnny has millions of loyal fans,Linda Landry,1,2021-01-02T23:22:42Z

3,Ugwt3IjIWvEgyPC7Tu54AaABAg,Though they probably should recast. Mera is a pretty disposable role and there's plenty of nice female actors who deserves the chance to make a bigger name for themselves. Not sure how good the current Aquaman 2 director can cast though. Zack Snyder does a better job with casting females than males I feel.,Entertainment Fan,0,2020-02-10T13:17:19Z
4,UgwtOsULPED2OTJLu-p4AaABAg,"From what I can gather, the abuse looks to be a 2 way street as there's photos of Amber with her face bruised.

23,Ugzw3YQU7EJydZLvaxp4AaABAg,I am cringing massively at both of the stans of these actors. Is it so hard to to believe these people had a super toxic relationship? #JusticeForJohnnyDepp videos are popping in my timeline by these anti-sjw shit heads because they can't bitch about star wars anymore. LOL Digging up the same fucking talking points about hypocrisy of feminists and double standards of abuse towards men  with the same stupid fucking jokes since big fucking red and triggly puff was trotted around to death for views. Also are we going to pretend there isn't video and audio of him being a drunk beligerent twat. This is either a cynical attempt for views or a simp attempt to die on the hill for the most useless cause because your  favorite character is captain Jack Sparrow. Also I am more than sure there is video evidence of her having a fat shiner in her cheek at an elevator after a big blowout fight with johnny. They have both shown to have video and audio against each other purposely to oppose each other. How much y'all wanna bet she maybe sitting on more shit against him for situations like this. And because of that these idiots making these videos will have it blow up on their face. Sometimes there are situations in life that are grey as grey can be. This is not a black and white situation. These are toxic people I don't fuck with or stan toxic people. This why I watch film gob.,Lord Mer,0,2020-02-05T00:44:11Z

31,UgxWoqUs_2K0xMk2s3d4AaABAg,"They were both at fault regardless. Did she lock him in a room and not allow him to leave? Did he or she stay in the relationship after the first time it became physical? It's just ridiculous honestly. Johnny Depp lost his role in Pirates because they got bad and he was drinking all the time during filming. I don't think he should be removed from Fantastic Beasts 3, and I don't think she should be removed from Aquaman 2. Unless they are abusing co-workers that shit should be kept separate. Both Depp and Heard have taken stupid pot shots at each other, both are to blame, she should be pulled from her domestic abuse advocacy since.... She's kind of a bad spokesperson now everything else is just people sticking their nose in other people's business.",Jonathon Turner,2,2020-02-04T22:42:01Z

36,UgyeFkKMhcCVYKg-1rp4AaABAg,They are just like regular people in a relationship with problems. No different than any other. They are just in a toxic relationship. Fights happen. They are not meant to be together. People blow this up and trying to find an accuser and victim. Its just a toxic relationship where fights will happen between both. Nothing new. Johnny Depp crying about Amber hittibg him must be a pusy. This is blown up to ruin someones image. If it was a women using a weapon then thats different. This is just a toxic relationship where both are at fault. Nothing out of the ordinary.,CyanBlue,5,2020-02-04T22:22:43Z
