24,Ugy2LfugLn-sLLPN8U14AaABAg,Rock Candy,"I'll include these blog qotes from 2011 when Amber was on the set of Drive Angry before she was dating Johnny. It's by Todd Farmer a writer/actor - it seems legit and he even provides a picture. After reading the blog my take away is she beat the crap out of pretty much everybody.
*BLOG QUOTE* - Most of this is likely due to the fact that *she beat the crap out of me . She pulled her punches with Christa, but she did not cut the boys any slack.* I snapped a picture at the end of the day. I should have taken a picture the next morning when *the bruise had blossomed the size of grapefruit.* (he provides selfie of red marks on chest)
*BLOG QUOTE* - I remember *Billy Burke* joking that he thought shooting a fight scene with the lovely Amber Heard would be more fun and less *painful. She beat the crap out of all of us.*
*BLOG QUOTE* - *And she beat the crap out of me.* By the way. There are men and more than a few ladies who would pay top dollar *to be beat up by Amber Heard. Oh. And she spit on me. Over and over and over.* And you KNOW there are folks who’d pay for that.
*BLOG QUOTE* - *We have Amber Heard punching, spitting, bitting and jumping.*",2021-05-16T10:54:20Z,1

182,UgwWm2YwF357gyWozs14AaABAg,Gesu Almonte,"@Fantasy Hub That's a bit disingenuous don't you think? If a corporation has the social grace to fire someone beloved to a franchise in order to save money and face the least amount of backlash due to public opinion, then why wouldn't they? These things are inextricably linked. The reality is that as Stefani pointed out, there's a double standard that benefits Heard. Johnny was fired from PotC in part due to public backlash for being labeled as an abuser and wife beater. The years of reputation he built being used as leverage to uplift an abuser, ironic isn't it? Worst still is the vitriol sent to those who would dare defend Depp or offer him casting roles. And regardless of whether he does get the role of Jack Sparrow back or not, history has been made and certain truths regarding his relationships with other celebrities, media representatives, or even fans have made it clear how disavowed and quick people can be to turn on a dime and make his life hell. That damages a person's sense of trust and faith, not to mention all the other abuse and economic losses he's had to take due to Heard's claims. My question in regards to that is this: Would Heard get the same treatment? Would she be willing to atone for her abuse, or excuse her crimes as a facet of humanity?",2020-04-09T18:22:48Z,2

Johnny Depp suffered alot in his career and Disney wanted to reboot the whole Pirates Of The Caribbean franchise because she framed his ass. Even when he starred in FBAWTFT, JK Rowling faced backlash just for letting him act in it as Grindelwald.

Apart from Amber Heard getting abuse charges before she was w Johnny Depp bc she abused her ex-girlfriend, too.

She had to admit under the oath bc Johnny presented evidence in which she was forced to submit. Because he had CCTV evidences etc. 

It's disgusting how her friends and her were in this to try and ruin Johnny Depp's life ). If you check her friends' and her testimonials on the night of her accusing Johnny Depp of abusing her in comparison to Johnny Depp's and his bodyguards' testimonials, Amber Heard's doesn't even link up w her friend's testimonial. Meanwhile Johnny Depp's and his bodyguards did.",2019-04-19T02:59:28Z,13
