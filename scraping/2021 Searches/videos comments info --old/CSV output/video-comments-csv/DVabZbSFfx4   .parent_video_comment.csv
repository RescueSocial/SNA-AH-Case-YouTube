Quit crying about the ‚Äú patriarchy ‚Äúbecause if there really was one this would not be happening. This is practically showing women that they can get away with physical abuse and it‚Äôs disgusting. I‚Äôm not denying that men can be abusive, I‚Äôve been abused by men myself, but there are plenty of good men in this world. Women ask where have all the good men gone? They are hiding from this crap!! I know things aren‚Äôt perfect, but they never will be. In the road towards equality we really have come along way, but women want to continue to use the excuse of the past. Women need to stop acting like children and be held accountable for their actions just like men are. We told him to suck it up and get over it, but we give women chocolate and tissues and just say it‚Äôs OK, she‚Äôs just emotional. Allowing her to treat everyone around her like emotional punching bags. This behavior is so toxic I cringe to think of the people that look up to her. I have no intention of watching any movie or show that she is in. That‚Äôs kind of frustrating because I really wanted to see the new TV series, the stand, but she‚Äôs in it so never mind. Petitions and boycotting is a good idea because this is Hollywood and the only language they speak is money. They are smart enough to know that Johnny is getting older and his career is winding down, while Amber is a sex symbol and will continue to make them millions. Sex sells, we all know this",kay Dykes,0,2020-11-13T13:32:34Z

I think they had an unhealthy relationship and the abuse ( Verbal and physical)went both ways. But I definitely dont  think it was as bad as she says it was or that Johnny really  beat her like she says he did. I think it's obvious that she hit on him just as much if not more but no one cares because she's a woman and that's not OK.  I understand I wasn't there and I don't know exactly what happened but I'm just going based on the vibes I get off both of them and the evidence. She comes across to me as a very manipulative person and I feel like she planned a lot of things. Johnny is not perfect and I'm sure he messed up a lot too in this relationship but I feel like she took advantage of the whole situation and is just wanting to get back at him and play the victim.,Jade Green,150,2020-11-12T16:09:05Z
