27,Ugxk3yocNHgtJo2De2d4AaABAg,"The diabolical nature of this individual raises so many flags on what we accept as human beings. Her values and belief would begs to question, what is it that we promote  to become advocates of justice and where is the line that we draw in being otherwise. The fact that there isn't one account where she wasn't held accountable raises the ego she hold being shown in this cold reality for so many, on the wrongs this world chose to accept. 
 A photo and words of allegations backed by close friends and allies. The questionable signs of proof of abuse that is use to dismantle, shown clearly who was out to ruin who and that is what I don't get or we blind to see who loved  who.

31,UgxN8zhqSPmcoht93594AaABAg,"Great video Shelby! But I have an open question for you and the community. We know Amber isn't as smart as she think she is, so I'm thinking that she either came up with this hoax of hers years ago BEFORE all the drugs and alcohol took their toll on her.. OR..  someone suggested that her path to fame/notoriety would best be served by following the path she undertook.. her father perhaps? The only third option I see is that she's become so delusional with herself and her stature in the acting and spokesperson community that she thinks that she was never going to be questioned or found out to be a liar.

Does she reflect on the books, join a book club or talk or text to friends about them?
