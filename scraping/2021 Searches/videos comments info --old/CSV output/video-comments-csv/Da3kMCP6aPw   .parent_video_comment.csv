These instinct for violence starts in early ages and is used to retaliate against those who have hurt them or someone they care about, Johnny Depp in this case. 

In the case Ambuser, her violence is combined with her narcistic golddigging psychopathic personality. 

The edited video she sold to TMZ was the first solid proof that she is not only violent, but also a very sick person.",Carmen Castro,0,2021-06-13T00:34:26Z
