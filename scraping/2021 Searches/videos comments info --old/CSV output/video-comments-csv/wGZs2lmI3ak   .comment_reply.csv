That does not mean anything ... I lived with a man for 4 years, and he was almost 20 years older than me ...
It was good for how long it lasted ...
Love does not choose ages ... In Johnny's case, the problem was her ... I've read a few articles about them both, and she did not know how to behave like a married woman.
There's also an article I read, I think it was at some party, at which he warned Amber, that he was embarrassed by her behavior!
Let us not forget, that Amber Heard has already been arrested for the aggression of her former girlfriend!
At least that's what I've read.
Also, the security guards said that Johnny was well away from her when she started shouting,
""STOP HITTING ME!""
So ... No doubt she is mentally ill, and psychotic!
