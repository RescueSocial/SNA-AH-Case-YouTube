40,Ugxih5RyCo1TC66MssN4AaABAg,Bat Eats Moth,"It IS a good thing. Businesses can lose a lot of money over bad optics because if they retain a bad actor, it publicly calls the company's ethics into question. They can't let one bad seed ruin their bottom line. It doesn't just affect owners and investors, it affects everyone they support with employment. If the company retains a bad actor, they lose money; loss of income means laying off workers. They can't let the actions of the bad actor jeopardize all those careers; that would be an act of bad faith on their part. They have an ethical responsibility to maintain the public's trust in their brand.

Check out the story about Megadeth firing David Ellefson for his indiscretions with a young woman. They're a band that has a reputation for having strong Christian and conservative values. Ellefson is a minister and he's married. He shit on his religion and his wife with his actions, and rather than accepting responsibility for his actions, he's trying to put the blame on the young woman and the person who leaked the video footage of his indiscretion. That makes his whole life a lie. How would that reflect on Dave Mustaine, the owner of the Megadeth brand, if he sided with Ellefson? It would make everything they say and do as a band a lie. Other bands that profess those values have suffered because of bad actors admitting it was just for show or making serious ethics violations that reflected negatively on the band. Megadeth could lose a lot of fans and money over that, at a time of severe economic depression in the music industry.

I asked Ellefson for help a number of years ago. He declined, but after losing his job in Megadeth, he might come around asking me to help him form a new band. In consideration of that, I had to release a statement on Twitter that I will have no business relations with Ellefson because of his indiscretion. Maybe not a lot of people know about my interaction with Ellefson, but it's enough to damage my reputation if those people call my ethics into question because I once asked him for help and I leave that door open. Silence in a matter can bring just as much condemnation as taking the wrong side.",2021-05-29T22:49:48Z,0

137,UgzRPIZa-ePsRa1dQ_t4AaABAg,R S,"@Logan Wittlief But public defense lawyers are paid to reduce the sentence or crimes of their clients. If you can be morally sound after having negotiated an attempted murder charge, with clearcut evidence, only the prosecution made a small mistake that you can worm your client out from down under, I really don't think that the morales of those people can be entirely trusted. Not that I don't think these people have a right to legal counsel, and they have to have their rights protected, but with hiw corrupt the justice system already is, I wouldn't trust that my defense lawyer, or prosecutor for that matter couldn't be paid off, as could a judge.

We already saw the case with depo and the Sun. The judge presiding over the case was the father of the author who wrote the Sun's article. If that can happen in a prolific a case as that, then what the fuck can't happen in some unknown courtroom, out in buttfuck nowhere.

Tl:dr, although our current justice system is the best we have come up with to date, there are far too many faults with it. Although I don't have a solution, but it is obviously not enough, when someone can contradict oneself, under oath, and still be under investigation for perjury. Referring to Amber Heard's case. It is painfully obvious, yet some people still support Heard.",2021-06-01T14:44:28Z,0

I simply don't think you should compare what she has done by saying others have done worse, because that (whether it be inadvertently on your part) downplays the bad stuff she has done.

I hope you also take care of yourself in the future and learn to cope with your own mental health as well ^-^",2021-05-31T04:55:18Z,0
192,UgwE8d3VAciHzYepzYl4AaABAg,Katlyn Shute,"@Char Macmillan good luck my friend!! It is very difficult to feel as if something is wrong but have no answers as to why. Or for people to tell you if you him just try harder you would be fine. The worst is being told you are just faking stuff for attention. It‚Äôs so disheartening. Mental health is so stigmatized and it makes my blood boil. Do we tell people with asthma‚Ä¶you just aren‚Äôt trying hard enough to breath. You would be fine if you just put in some effort. It crushes your self esteem when you are told your struggles are your fault. Especially when we are young. I was a 4.0 student, aged varsity sports, was on theatre, and so each team. I did so well because I was unknowingly treating my ADHD because I had such a crazy strict schedule that was meticulously mapped out each week because if I wanted to fit everything in I had to do it that way. So I unknowingly had been self treating. Then I became an adult and stuff got a lot harder because my schedule was no longer packed to the gills with all my activities plus school. After battling a sports injury that resulted in an addiction to pain killers my undiagnosed adhd was so bad and it made things very very difficult. I have sober for over 7 years which made actually made my adhd worse. The pills were also helping me manage my symptoms. pandemic made my symptoms hit me like a ton of bricks. Finally went for an evaluation and my doc was shocked that no one ever noticed it in my family. We need to make mental health and things like adhd, ocd, depression, bi-Pilar, substance abuse disorder, etc not so scary. These are not death sentences, you can still live a normal life, nothing is ‚Äúwrong‚Äù with you if you have a mental illness, you are simply different and you are no less of a person than anyone else. I think it takes so long to diagnose people because it‚Äôs so stigmatized. If people stopped the scare tactics and stop making a mental health diagnosis out to be the boogie man people would be much quicker to ask for help and save them years of suffering alone and in silence. I hope you find a diagnosis soon friend. Don‚Äôt give up, it can take time but finding out a diagnosis and getting the right treatment for you is worth all of that lain, trial, and error. If you ever need to vent or talk come back here and let me know and we can figure out the best way to connect (I‚Äôm not kidding at all. Totally serious. Sometimes just having a person to talk to makes you feel less alone. I don‚Äôt ever want anyone to feel alone or scared. No matter if I know them or not. I can‚Äôt say I can solve your problems, I‚Äôm not a doctor (I just play one on TV lol.) but I am a person,  I have ears, and I‚Äôm willing to be there to listen and support someone in need. I hope you are doing well and I‚Äôm sending you love and good energy this upcoming weekend. Happy Memorial Day, be safe, and don‚Äôt forget to take care of yourself . There is only one you and the world would be different without your shining presence on it, as happy and healthy as you could possibly be.",2021-05-29T03:28:24Z,1

212,UgxbGip7toe-kGSgMtZ4AaABAg,AUGH,"@William Jenkins 2nd part to my comment:

3. What studies are you referencing and where did they source their data? Because public FBI records show that more men are arrested and convicted for every crime except prostitution. Where is your claim of ""more women cause more fatalities"" coming from, if the numbers show that men commit most violent and nonviolent crimes?

4. When you're ready to actually care about men's liberation, consider this:

Why do you seemingly only care about which gender commits more crime, but nothing beyond that? If you cared about gender liberation, why wouldn't your first thought be to figure out why these numbers exist? What causes men to commit more crimes? What can we do to meet their needs and give them resources so they aren't in a position to commit more crime?

You're very obviously approaching this in a ""men vs women, gender battle"" mentality when it's not men vs women. Our focus needs to be on uniting and understanding where our needs are being failed and what we can do about it.",2021-06-02T20:14:37Z,2
213,UgxbGip7toe-kGSgMtZ4AaABAg,AUGH,"@William Jenkins My comments keep getting deleted, so I'll have to split it into two parts [for some reason this sometimes works]

1. It's apparent that statistics simply isn't in your area of familiarity. Numbers don't technically lie, but numbers are influenced by human bias and subject to bias present in the processes of interpretation and presentation.

So with your black crime example, numbers that float around on social media tend to be either completely made up or real numbers from authentic databases that they've kept sterile to make the interpretation that ""black people commit more crime"". However, if we look at these numbers within the context of the social and material realities of the black community (and American history), we get a far more nuanced, fleshed out view for why these numbers exist.

2. It's fallacious to draw the conclusion that because an institution is problematic, their numbers are automatically useless. Numbers don't technically lie, but they can leave out key points, giving you only a partial story. They can be a great place to *start*.",2021-06-02T20:13:18Z,3
214,UgxbGip7toe-kGSgMtZ4AaABAg,William Jenkins,"@AUGH  ""It's almost like statistics released by bureaus who track and quantify crime prove that the majority of the crimes that both men and women commonly experience are perpetrated by men"" 
Im sorry but when we are arguing the system is biased you cant use the systems stats as an argument. Do you accept the same departments report that paint black people as significantly more violent? In almost ever study (in the US) that has avoided crime statistics the amount of DV is pretty close to even. Men cause more injuries but you might be surprised to know that women cause more fatalities.",2021-06-02T03:06:05Z,0
215,UgxbGip7toe-kGSgMtZ4AaABAg,AUGH,"@R S ¬† The part where he assumed my position? You might want to reread the comment because it's pretty obvious if you have basic reading comprehension skills. He assumed my position by talking about the gender gap in carceral punishment and women being capable of cruelty in relationships like I was in opposition by default. I already knew all of that and I already agree with his positions, but he never *asked* me for my position; he went out of his way to link sources and make an argument without even *asking* me where I stood on those issues.

You realize that you didn't contribute anything to the conversation; all you did is insert yourself to make yourself feel better and it's transparent. Did you have an actual point or something of *value* to add?",2021-06-01T17:17:56Z,1
216,UgxbGip7toe-kGSgMtZ4AaABAg,R S,"@AUGH Alright, read that comment again, and point out to me where he assumed your position? I think you just wanted something to retort back with...

For christ sakes, it's so disappointing to scroll down here and see everybody getting personal and not even trying to listen. Just waiting for somebody to respond, so they can get outraged and try to 'outwit' each other...

I'm not saying that whoever I responded to is the only one doing this, more or less everyone in this thread is. This dude just stood out, because I didn't read that the comment he responded to called him specifically out for standing on any issue, but he responded with taking offense to him assuming he was insulted. It's not what it's about, and it just fucking escalates. It's impressive that it's actually possible to create echo chambers, even amidst people who actively disagree with you.

254,UgxIu97vxRaa-XD6J3F4AaABAg,JorgelShmorgel,"‚Äã@The Doom Negotiator It's not an ""alternative interpretation"". Here he admits it in an interview with NPR: https://www.npr.org/2020/05/26/862838384/an-avid-birder-talks-about-a-conflict-in-central-park-he-taped-and-went-viral 

For me they are both at fault. Christian Cooper is not the Central Park dog Police and he should not threaten to poison someone's dog and then record the reaction. The woman should not have called the police in this manner. I do not think she felt really threatened this much so she could have called them in a normal fashion. They both played a game of chicken and in the end the woman lost really badly. 

Anyway, my reply above was mostly about the ""choking of the dog"". That was definitely a reaction to Christian's threat of giving the dog something that could have been poisoned.",2021-06-02T07:34:12Z,1

258,UgxIu97vxRaa-XD6J3F4AaABAg,JorgelShmorgel,"‚Äã@FamiliarFound She is ""choking"" the dog because Christian Cooper threatened her and her dog. He said that he would do ""what he wanted but that she would not like it"". After that he took something out of his bag that resembled dog treats to give to her dog and that is when she frantically held her dog back at the collar because she did not want it to get potentially poisoned. Christian Cooper admitted to this on his Facebook account and in interviews. He deliberately brings dog treats to get this response from dog owners that do not keep their dogs on their leash in that area. After that he starts filming. Christian Cooper is not the Central Park dog police.",2021-05-29T09:57:48Z,5

282,Ugy2_hUejVO085_r_xV4AaABAg,David Klein,@Giant mess I think I get what you're trying to convey in this word salad but let me tell you this... If I was in the hypothetical situation you propose there are other options available to me that I would use instead of calling the police ... Like releashing my dog and leaving the area... or fighting for my dog's safety if I couldn't leave. I wouldn't even think about doing what Ms Cooper (racist) did and all the hypothetical scenarios you can throw out doesn't change the fact that what she did was wrong and there are many many many people who wouldn't do what she did either.  These flimsy defenses of you have for her antisocial behavior are looking more and more pathetic.  You've been strongly countered here repeatedly and yet you are still posing red herrings for what end????,2021-06-02T15:02:57Z,2

284,Ugy2_hUejVO085_r_xV4AaABAg,Giant mess,@David Klein your not going to like it despite the that it is a half assed threat it is still a threat.

286,Ugy2_hUejVO085_r_xV4AaABAg,Cats,"@Giant mess I completely understand your position and mildly agree. Only thing I disagree is him minding his own business, specifically because they were in a bird sanctuary area with a large loose dog problem. He was very much in his right to call her out and call non-emergency enforcers if he felt like doing so. But I get equally tilted over so so so many people ignoring the part where he himself admitted to telling her ‚Äúyou can do what you want then so will I. And you will not like what I‚Äôll do.‚Äù Before even getting out the dog treats. I‚Äôm a woman and I can guarantee him pulling out dog treats wouldn‚Äôt even make my top 50 guesses of possible plans he had.

I could even somewhat understand her trying to intimidate him away from her by using his race to his face (not during the 911 call), _if_ she had no escape route and/or was not getting up in his face on her own accord. She blatantly showed that she was not feeling threatened (instead of just not getting her way) in her actions. She wasn‚Äôt focused on trying to find safety (whether that meant fight or flight), she was focused on not letting him get away with what he‚Äôd done.

Both of them suck ass. As far as I‚Äôm concerned he used his stature as a tall man as a weapon against her as much as she used his race against him. The amount of serial r*pists/killers in recent Central Park history is shocking. It‚Äôs not like a 5‚Äô4 (Black) woman made that intentionally vague threat to her that morning, in which case the possible implications would be life-changingly different.

I am a middle class white dude, like I have a pretty stellar life, to be honest, and I am completely aware of what your talking about, I constantly struggle with feeling bad about feeling like shit because other people have it worse (especially because i am apolitical scientist focusing on human rights abuses in the global south), but, as I said, based on the things Phil says and what not, he acts like its just a given that he gets off time off for mental health shit and truly acts like he doesn't understand that that is not at all the case for most people. even those in the middle class, so I can only imagine what it like for people below that. Just because we're allowed to feel certain ways when people have it worse doesnt justify completely not thinking about the people who have it worse. Idk, I've been watching Phil religiously for like 6 years now, and I've come to the point that I hate that I am a fan ahahah.

321,UgxJB89GYr8FNIO7ZJJ4AaABAg,Geoffrey J'zargo,"@Hippo Bebee  @Hippo Bebee   @Hippo Bebee  This whole argument between us seems to be based on made up fallacies you have concocted, to push this idea of yours. And ever since your first response to me pointing out the perplexity in your argument, the entirely of this conversation has been exactly that. You, making up completely fictional accounts of my state of mind. How do you not see that? Coming from the person who takes so much offence when people do exactly the same thing to you. The fact you don't see the  irony is actually becoming painful to bear.

‚ÄúYou are denying that people call people/ use the word crazy to describe in a derogatory way‚Äù

No I'm really not. I was trying to make that clear. That even though you claimed I had said, what only you so far had said. That no, NOBODY except for you, HERE in this conversation, EVER said that ‚Äúbeing willfully ignorant, bigoted, immoral, violent, or abusive has (nothing) to do with having a mental health diagnosis‚Äù. I.E. I definitely had not said that. Quite clearly so. All you have to be able to do, is read. Despite your attempts to make it seem like I had said it. The only thing to have transpired by then was that you had falsely inferred the very thing you are claiming is offensive. Which is my very point. You are taking offence at things that were never offensive to begin with. 

I asked how in the hell is Phil stigmatising mental health just from his word disassociation? To which, you immediately jumped down my throat, not with an answer to my question, but by saying that my very question was a representation of the damage associated with dissociating ""crazy""? So then I reiterated the point that the only person so far who has said that being crazy had anything to do with having a mental health diagnosis, was YOU, in the very previous comment. I myself very clearly never said any of those things. So far I merely asked the question. Then you claimed that I had indeed said it; in my first post; because I had the audacity to point out, that 'how could one be accused of stigmatizing patients, through disassociation of a word that shouldn't have anything to do with those patients in the first place?' Then finally, you immediately, staying topically ironic, claimed I said what I had never said, by referring back to your own unsubstantiated claims of what I supposedly, but still never said, to begin with. 

Just take a deep breath, because this is not how conversations work. If I point out a flaw in your explanation, from what you describe as offensive. You can't just infer offence from me; for simply pointing out the flaw in the logic; then avoid addressing it all together, just to go off on another tangent, without clarification as to address the direct flaw, and entire purpose of my conversation, as if not a single iota of clarification was necessary. But if you are trying to elucidate your point, how is it not necessary to clarify for me the very thing that sparked the conversation to begin with. Only to go ahead by saying I'm not even entitled to clarification?

I just don't understand, AT ALL, where you are coming from? You haven't explained ANYTHING. You have just gone on and on, compounding on the absurdity of your inability to comprehend where I'm coming from. And since you can't comprehend, you just make up your own defensive argument and make it fit into your convoluted comprehension. To which I keep coming up blank on, because constantly saying I said something that I didn't, and drawing fallacious conclusions from it, doesn't mean anything. 

If that was the case, how would any conversation you have, go on for longer than a two sentences before both parties were talking complete and utter nonsense to each other? I never claimed to be entitled to an answer, I just pointed out the fact you didn't bother answering. You just made up a complete and utter trollop of a reply that even now I'm still trying to get you to see clarity on.

""Because you live in your own little world you are not behaving as I want you to behave due to your disordered personality"". Sounds a whole lot like ""I see no value in what you say, because you are mentally ill"". Which sounds a whole lot like ""shut up, you are crazy‚Äù.

You prove my very point. You somehow got from me pointing out that you can't read what I've said without inferring your own irrelevant meaning, that had nothing to do with the original intent of my words, BY DOING EXACTLY THAT... AGAIN.!? Not even a second later. Right there.... Did I ever say. ""Because you live in your own little world you are not behaving as I want you to behave due to your disordered personality"" or ‚Äúshut up, you are crazy‚Äù? No.. I did not. Apparently that's what you wanted to hear though. So apparently now that's what I've said? According entirely to you though. Not according to me. You know... the person who actually typed the words where I'm trying to sum up this very point that you keep going around in circles and inferring your own separate meaning onto everything I say, with turd tinted glasses.... So I will say again... This is a clear microcosm of your inability to hold a debate without falling susceptible to your argumentative personality. And just to be clear this time. I'm not calling you 'crazy', nor am I telling you to 'shut up'. Nor am I telling you you have a 'disordered' personality. Nor am I claiming you are 'not behaving as I want you to behave'. All I'm trying to do is find a way to articulate to you; the absurdity of your endless fallacious assumptions and immediate argumentative approach to conversation; in some definitely eloquent manner that hopefully will get through to you, once and for all.

Why are you so incapable of seeing past your idea that everyone is out to insult you? I listened to what you had to say, and have yet to even get an answer to my very first question; which you apparently don't want to answer. Perhaps if you did, you might have to admit you don't have ground to argue on. Which I can only assume is why you're resorting to prevaricating.

""And let's be real, you weren't expecting one either. You meant it to be rhetorical and dismissive, not to invoke conversation. ""All I have done is ask a simple question"". Seriously? That is a lie and you know it."" 

Again you prove my point, so thank you? I suppose. Though I don't feel grateful for this conversation, at all. If you are just going to make up whatever meaning you want, that you apparently need so hard to be true, in order to try and win your argument. As opposed to the rightful inference of the words I'm saying... Then what is the point in talking to you? There isn't. Because whatever I say clearly isn't apart of the conversation you are trying to have with yourself, that this concocted version of me you have inside your head that is supposedly trying so hard to offend you. Well I'm not. I don't know how else to break it to you so that you can understand and see reason. But I'm not trying to offend you. Full stop. No matter how hard you seem to wish that I was. 

Finally, by the by. I too suffer from chronic mental health issues. And as a bonus, I don't identify as male either. I still find it kind of pointless, and lacking within me, to be able to get offended when someone tries to label me ""crazy"". All that proves is the offenders lack of character, or better yet, their sheer idiocy, bigotry and general ugly moral disposition. It's a reflection more of their malicious and degenerate inner self, than being close to anything at all to do with me. It's also why I don't see how what Phil said is stigmatising. By using the word back at those who would themselves use it to offend. It's disassociation of the word, and gives us more reasons to personally not get offended by it. 

If you haven't fathomed by now. You never will. And so I'm essentially done here too. Because whatever I say. You seem to, without fail, make up whatever meaning you want from my words, so that you can take offence by it. I really hope that you can look within and perhaps grow from what I've now been trying to shed some light on for you. Good luck.",2021-06-18T12:23:54Z,0
322,UgxJB89GYr8FNIO7ZJJ4AaABAg,Hippo Bebee,"@Geoffrey J'zargo why do you think you are entitled to answers to your  questions? You're not. Especially when you question the lived experiences of a marginalized group. Especially when that ""question"" is intended to manipulate and deny the reality of others. I do not owe you answers, and nor does anyone else. You want an education on a topic, you pay for that labor.

 And let's be real, you weren't expecting one either. You meant it to be rhetorical and dismissive, not to invoke conversation. ""All I have done is ask a simple question"". Seriously? That is a lie and you know it. What you have actually done is write paragraph after paragraph denying the experiences of others based on nothing more than your own imagination. And I will not fall for your manipulative behaviours. I did not put words in your mouth. I have not gaslit you. 

""This is a clear microcosm of your inability to hold a debate without falling susceptable to your arguementative personality""
Wow! Way to prove my point. Let's break that shit down shall we! 

""This is a clear microcosm"" meaning 
""Because you live in your own little world"" .
""Your inability to hold a debate"" meaning ""you are not behaving as I want you to behave""
""Without falling susceptable to your arguementative personality"" meaning ""due to your disordered personality"".

""Because you live in your own little world you are not behaving as I want you to behave due to your disordered personality"". Sounds a whole lot like  ""I see no value in what you say, because you are mentally ill"". Which sounds a whole lot like ""shut up, you are crazy"". 

And then you have the audacity to claim you are wanting to have a civil conversation about this. There is nothing civil about the way you have interacted with me. You are not worth any more of my time because it is ineffectual to try to communicate with some dedicated to not listening to what you have to say. I will not giving you any more of my time or attention. Have a nice day.",2021-06-06T09:29:42Z,0
323,UgxJB89GYr8FNIO7ZJJ4AaABAg,Hippo Bebee,"@Geoffrey J'zargo ¬† go ahead and delete it again, because that is the appropriate place for your words. 
You were gaslighting. You were denying the reality abd lived experiemce of people who live with chronic mental illness. 

""Nobody ever"" my shoe.

You are denying that people call people/ use the word crazy to describe in a derogatory way those of us with chronic mental health disorders. Those of us with personality disorders, PTSD, c-PTSD, Bipolar, schizophrenia, identity disorders, substance abuse disorders, etc., experience exactly what you are denying, daily.

I know, because I do not deny reality about the way people and society treat those who are homeless with these health problems. I know, because I do not deny reality about the way people and society treat veterens with these health problems. I know, because I do not deny reality about the way people and society treat those who are institutionalized with these health problems.  I know, because I do not deny reality about the way people and society treat the with substance abuse disorders with these health problems. I know because I have some of these chronic mental health diagnoses, and I live through it. 

So don't tell me ""no one has ever"" when the lived experiences and sociological studies of this behaviour are boundless. There are literally even literture and movies about this topic it is such a common occurance.",2021-06-06T08:59:39Z,0
324,UgxJB89GYr8FNIO7ZJJ4AaABAg,Geoffrey J'zargo,"@Hippo Bebee Let me get this straight though... I asked a question; to which I never got a coherent answer; only your own perceived agenda for me; that I do not share; then when I clarified that I clearly never stated such an agenda; so far; in your own words only you have done so; all I've done is simply ask a question. Now you accuse me of gaslighting my way out of words that only you yourself put in my mouth... Please tell me you see the irony here... What you are doing is the very definition of gaslighting.

Furthermore, assuming gender will never win you an argument. Somehow yet again ironically; this is a clear microcosm of your inability to hold a debate without falling susceptible to your argumentative personality.

Simply put; I just do not understand the logic in your arguments for use of the word crazy. And I would like to; if you could hold a meaningful conversation without immediately projecting.

The way I see it is. It's like a bully, who calls you an offensive name. Well you can rightly get offended, but honestly, why bother? When instead if you blissfully ignore the offensive nature or even joyfully embrace such terms, then they lose meaning for the bully, and they no longer get satisfaction from calling you the name in question because they no longer are getting the reaction from you they want. Instead; you are shouting from the rooftops that the word 'crazy' is offensive to you, so much so, that you would like to redact certain uses of the word from people vocabulary. Well this is just fuel for the fire and is only going to exacerbate the situation you wish to avoid.",2021-06-06T08:36:24Z,0
325,UgxJB89GYr8FNIO7ZJJ4AaABAg,Geoffrey J'zargo,"@Hippo Bebee Nobody ever here said that those things DO have anything to do with having a mental health diagnosis. Only YOU made the link between calling those kinds of people crazy and then saying it's offending you.

What you are saying, is that the word crazy DOES has something to do with having mental health diagnosis, and shouldn't be used to describe something else. Yet it's that very attitude that is exactly what is damaging to those with mental health diagnosis, because you are indirectly associating the word crazy to only those people.

Using the word crazy to describe people who don't have mental health issues is not damaging to those who do, unless you start saying that the word crazy SHOULD be associated with people with mental health issues, like you are perpetuating here. When it shouldn't AT ALL.

If you let the word crazy be used to describe a different set of people like how Phil used it. Then it would become disassociated from people with mental health diagnosis altogether.

For example; If somebody came up to you and called you crazy because you had depression; you could rightly be offended; because mental health issues shouldn't be associated with being crazy.
But using it to describe someone who goes out of their way to be a morally degenerate person, should in no way be offensive to you as someone who has depression, because the word crazy has nothing to do with depression unless you make it out to be. Which is exactly what you are doing.

We have 350 homes where female abuse victims (and their kids) can flee and seek shelter in so they're safe from their abuser.
We have 9 homes for men. Each ""home"" with room for maybe 3-5 men. And in 2019 we had over 20k male abuse victims, especially victims of mental abuse, threats and stalking, as well as violent abuse with objects.
I'm a woman myself and I find it reprehensible that male victims are just pushed away, sometimes even made fun of and not taken seriously with people acting as if men can only be perpetrators and never victims.

You've clearly been asleep for a very long while. 
It's about time you at least tried to wake up.

Seriously.

Your comments read like the ramblings of a drugged horse. The only real question is; are you confused like some kind of prating cuckservative ""truth"" pimp, or are you a troll? I really hope it's the latter, but I know deep down that it's not.",2021-07-19T04:59:48Z,0
380,UgwbHnx3SFDBxTi0e2d4AaABAg,drake pendragon,"@Geoffrey J'zargo No it really is a lie.   There is no real risk to calling the police unless you are committing a crime, or are unwilling to comply with simple orders.  There is no ‚Äúplay acting‚Äù she could legitimately believe that her life is in danger from this thug.  He openly admitted that he was using treats to lure her dog away from her which is attempted theft.  Yes the police coming would be protecting the community.
No saying that "" your life is in danger‚Äù when police arrive is by being a criminal and not obeying the orders isn‚Äôt a lie it is a statement of facts.  The only systemic racism in the USA is with affirmative action, because there is no other system in the USA that allows an individual any advantage based on the color of their skin.
He was trying to steal the dog, he admitted to trying to lure the dog away from the woman with treats, that is attempting to take property that isn‚Äôt yours.  He asked her to leash her dog she said no to him and he then attempted to lure the dog with treats (HIS words),  when he attempted to steal her dog she called the police because he persisted to confront her aggressively until she called the police at which time he decided to start videoing the situation.  She was not over-acting her situation, she could have legitimately felt threatened by him or are you saying her feelings don‚Äôt count?  Because if that is the case then BLM are racists and terrorists as proven by the facts and your feelings about them don‚Äôt count. 
No, I‚Äôm going down the realm of facts and reality.  You making up racism that you want to pretend is racism is racist.  So according to someone who wants to believe that whyte peopo is rahcist defendinga  woman who was threatened and almost had her dog stolen is not racism‚Ä¶.Nothing I‚Äôve stated is false, everything I‚Äôve said is substantially factual.  
He didn‚Äôt call it stealing the dog he did admit to trying to lure the dog from the woman with treats that he keeps because he has the right to lure animals away from people that don‚Äôt obey him when he tells them to leash their dogs.  That is like me saying that I have the right to run someone off the road if they are speeding.  If you are trying to lure a dog away from the owner that is trying to steal the dog.  He should be charged with attempted theft/dognapping and put in prison and she should sue him for the harm he has done to her.",2021-07-18T19:40:31Z,0
381,UgwbHnx3SFDBxTi0e2d4AaABAg,Geoffrey J'zargo,"@drake pendragon No it's really not a lie. It's the truth. Specially if the person you are calling the police on is black. And you are play acting that your life is in danger, when all he was doing was filming her and getting her to leash her dog. In this instance it certainly wouldn't be, ""protecting the community"".

Saying that the ""only way"" your life is in danger from the police who resort to deadly force, is by doing those specific things, is a lie. As we've already seen recently that that clearly isn't the case. Thanks to the recognised systemic racism..

He was also not trying to steal the dog. He tried to get her to leash the dog and she called the police on him, then she way over-acted her situation, on the phone, to make it seem like she was in danger when she clearly wasn't. INTENTIONALLY. 

You are just going into the realm of laughable absurdity. Me calling out blatant racism doesn't make me a racist. Defending the glaringly racist woman, is definitely suspicious on your part though. All of your arguments are based on falsehoods. Either you fail to see that, or you are purposefully perpetuating racism.

He never admitting to trying to steal the dog. He admitted to trying to get the dog under control and keep it from being free to roam the park; a park where free roaming dogs are prohibited because of the danger to the protected birds that nest in the area.",2021-06-18T03:17:00Z,0

Nuclear energy I can't quite remember, but Kurzgesagt did a video on the nuclear death toll in which they extrapolate deaths per energy unit (one kilowatt hour if I recall correctly) of different energy sources. Fossil fuels were highest by a long shot, followed by nuclear followed closely by hydro etc. This doesn't take into account nuclear waste and potential issues there on the environment, nor nuclear attacks (since they're not linked to energy) but it's a really interesting video.

Btw his bodyguard said that he only told delusional Amber what she wanted to hear. And if you knew ANYTHING about cluster B personality disorders you would've known that these people will fight for hours and days until you apologise to them for things you haven't even done, and sometimes even that is not enough. Obviously you haven't dealt with a cluster B and you're not educated abou the disorders so you won't get it.
She claimed that JD kicked her on the plane while he was sitting. That is litteraly impossible to do since the  the space between the seats is so small he would have to break his knee to kick her the way she claimed. 
Also, while you can hide bruises and discolouration with makeup, however swelling can not be hidden with makeup. And you wouldn't be able to jump around with bruised ribs as that would be to painful. 
On the James Cordon show, her angular veins near her eyes were clearly showing, yet she claimed she put on makeup heavy enough to conceal two black eyes, but that same makeup couldn't conceal her angular veins? ü§îü§î Also the most swelling takes places  from 6h till 48h after injury, so her ""broken nose"" should've been massively swollen, since it was the second day of the ""attack"".
 During her relationship with JD, only one of them had to get a medical attention for injuries and it was JD not her! 
And let's not pretend that Amber hasn't showed up drunk and high to interviews and events, yet people are so quick to trash JD about his drug addictions. 
It's not fair that Johnny is paying the price for her malignant delusions! It's not fair and this is what people with cluster B do, they abuse you then claim they are the victim.",2021-05-29T01:50:42Z,1

452,UgzWyPN7lVz-FhDaEix4AaABAg,Simon Wakefield,@Antahvasin Some of it's because it's hard to prove. Abuse victims rarely report it at the time and become experts at hiding it from others. When they do report it the evidence they do have is limited. And if you do what AH did and start documenting it in secret when they do reach breaking point it's still your word Vs there's and it can be spun as Depps team are doing as a calculated move to spin a lie. It just ends up being a case that had very little chance of success so gets suggested to be dropped,2021-05-28T21:50:18Z,0
453,UgzWyPN7lVz-FhDaEix4AaABAg,Simon Wakefield,"@H Ibrahim And perhaps as a supposed abuse survivor you shouldn't excuse an abuser. There is tape if him admitting to hear but her twice, his assistant who he got to lie admitted he kicked her and that in his own words 'was disgusting' and that Depp was so ashamed he cried when he was informed what he did. I don't know if it's because you are an abuse survivor which maybe makes you need to have a victim and a monster to validate that you played no part in your own abuse situation but life isn't that simple. You have one who is a hopeless addict, a hopeless addict who beat up a rubber on the set of a movie because Depp was intoxicated and didn't like being told they had to stop shooting for the day. 

Also as an abuse victim I would think you would be fully aware how good at hiding injuries and pain people get. If we are going dismiss people who don't show signs of abuse then we may as well declare almost ever single abuse victim a liar as a big reason abuse usually goes on so long is even those close to them often  don't realise and if they pick up on a small sign they dismiss it (like when mellisa benoist explained away an injury that was really caused by her abusive husband throwing a phone at her face)",2021-05-28T21:43:48Z,0

465,UgxCtsm_DzplzTn23094AaABAg,jadoredepp,"@Simon Wakefield The question is have YOU read the court documents ? Clearly you have no idea how abuse and victim blaming from an abuser works. She constantly blamed him for her violence, he even had to apologize and promise her (as recorded on tape) to never run away again when she'd abuse him. Defending yourself from someone literally assaulting you is not abuse, it's called self defence and then the abuser twist your brain and does everything to make you feel like the one at fault. SHE clearly admitted he never abused her when she said, I quote: ""You always run away, You keep splitting, we're not allowed to fight."" and to which he replied ""I don't wanna fight, I don't want to be in a f-ing physical altercation with you.""¬†

That's more evidence from BOTH of them, of him being the victim than any misleading paragraph you could write to make him seem like a bad guy. Depp has always owned his struggle with addiction, in fact he was doing everything to heal during their marriage and Amber withheld medication from him, giving him seizures as he said it in court. But what you do is perpetuate a stigma that addiction = abuse, which is not necessarily always the case. Depp was hurting himself to cope with a bunch of shit. As for that Kate Moss bullshit, all of his exes supports him so you might want to find another pathetic excuse. Last but not least, Depp is now healthy and has fixed his addiction issue so let's quit making it sound like he still ""needs help"". NO, she needs help before she fucking kills someone because compared to him, she's in full denial.",2021-05-28T16:57:07Z,6

Let's go even more wild here and say he threatened her with physical harm or even threatened to kill her. All off camera.

Cut to the film. Said woman now fearing for her life, walks directly up to the person threatening her life and demands he stops filming her. She doesn't run away or cower away from him, but walks towards him and even attempts to grab his cellphone off him.
This ""dangerous man"" tells her to not come closer to him repeatedly as she approaches him. The woman becomes so terrified after this that she feels the need to call the police to come and save her üòÇüòÇüòÇ

An abuse victim would probably be pretty relived if their abuser didn‚Äôt want to fight and left every time things started to heat up. 

As I said, I work at a shelter; what‚Äôs special about this shelter is that it is a shelter for women with drug/alcohol addiction. I have a lot of work experience and education in drug/alcohol addiction. A lot of people see themselves as another person when drunk/high. They can be paranoid, emotional, loud, jealous, mean, abusive and so on.
That doesn‚Äôt automatically mean Depp says that‚Äôs he‚Äôs a hitting her every time he‚Äôs been using. They both have issues with addiction and abuse is a lot more common in relationships were addiction is present. 

I would like to see sources to the incidents you referred to in a previous comment (Kate Moss). It‚Äôs very uncommon for someone to begin abusive behavior later in life if they haven‚Äôt showed that kind of behavior before. Especially since, like this case, someone has been using for such a long time. It‚Äôs not a new factor to weigh in.",2021-05-28T10:40:25Z,0

It's on record that when he wasn't intoxicated he was fairly meek but when intoxicated and arguments happened he was far from that, to a point he once tried to kill Sharon (And Sharon was Equally an abuser which she admits). Deep admits in his own text messages to 3rd parties when he is intoxicated he is another person, a person he himself called 'the monster'.

513,UgwVtABJjApB7nMjf214AaABAg,Simon Wakefield,@Linda Delorme And he has previous with Kate Moss. There were regular reports in the 90's of violent situations between them and there was the time when intoxicated police were called on him as he was smashing up a hotel room and when police arrived she was on the bed with visible injuries but refused to press charges. The fact he didn't actually call VP or WR so they could be crossed is pretty telling as well. It suggests his team were worried that even if they would say he never hit them that they were worried they would under cross admit he gets violent when intoxicated and when asked about how they dealt with it would undermine the witness statement by saying something like they removed themselves from the situation which obviously if thats how they dealt with it there is a decent chance they wouldn't have him get violent to them where as someone a bit more combative in those situations who stays and argues has a greater chance of him turning the violence towards them,2021-05-28T09:33:02Z,0

AH team also did everything they could to make sure Depps team did not get hands on any charity documents, so AH could continue to lie about ""ALREDY DONATED"". And the Judge blived blindly on everything AH told. And denied any witness for Depp side that said she was lying.

555,Ugzctepw60oy6MGNjQt4AaABAg,Digital Currency Daily,@Random User You clearly don't know much history surrounding the spanish flu and the vaccines that were developed too quickly.,2021-06-02T01:02:08Z,0
556,Ugzctepw60oy6MGNjQt4AaABAg,Random User,"@Digital Currency Daily Any reaction to a vaccine is more likely then not going to happen within a few weeks of receiving the vaccine. No medical treatment/procedure is risk free. Doctors would not be telling people to get vaccinated if the risks associated with the vaccine did not out way the risks from covid. It's as simple as that. Normally vaccines are tested for a longer period of time out of an abundance of caution. The chances of people developing side effects years down the line is very slim. We don't have this luxury so instead we speed up the process and cut anything that is unnecessary and time consuming. And so far all the data related to these vaccines shows that it is effective and safe. It's either the vaccine and get back to normal or covid and continuous lockdowns with people dying.

You can't completely ignore my question by asking your own. At least try and explain to me why Pfizer is giving their employees a supposedly deadly vaccine? I mean if they are all about making money killing off a significant portion of your work force does not sound like a good idea.

This immunity does not last forever. It expires in 2024. It also does not cover willful misconduct. And simply put the government doesn‚Äôt want people suing the companies making the covid vaccine over every little thing. Because then, the manufacturers would probably charge the government a higher price per person per dose. Nothing nefarious is going on here. If the vaccines are really killing people the way you said they are that would be clearly evident to the vaccine manufactures in their testing and them lying about their test results would clearly fall under willful misconduct. It's also not like they get total immunity around the world either.

Hey you are the one coming out here with wild accusations. I am just trying to provide some information and also get some information. Although you don't really seem interested in the whole backing up your points thing.  You are more of an accuse, ignore questions and accuse again kind of person I can see.

Oh and you also haven't answered me as to why Canada out of all the countries in the world has people dropping like flies from taking the vaccine while other countries are doing just fine?",2021-06-01T23:30:35Z,0

559,Ugzctepw60oy6MGNjQt4AaABAg,Random User,"@Digital Currency Daily clinical trials take that long because testing is carried out sequentially. To speed up this process the different stages of testing was done at the same time. You can go online and have access to the testing results for the vaccine and perfectly adequate reasons for the speed of the vaccine. Even then can you point out to me the laws/requirements for that time period you gave? The only thing I can find is averages which is different to what you are saying.

It's like the space race. Without the competition between the US and USSR man would not have accomplished all it did at that time otherwise. In this case we had to speed things up from their normal pace as it would not work otherwise.

If people were really dying from the vaccine like you are saying then why would companies like Pfizer prioritize their employees getting them? Killing off a significant portion of your work force is not a good idea.",2021-06-01T19:13:20Z,0

also another example is this. thank god for cctv. 
this one is another story ive seen before, this woman was seen punching herself on the elevator while saying she was abused.

683,UgywKEN8ChkeeeGW-3Z4AaABAg,Luna Wolf,"@Alton Cyphers  Sorry but that isn‚Äôt correct. Judge Nicols included excerpts of two audios, the infamous ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt punching you, I was hitting you‚Äù audio and the one made when they met in a hotel during the divorce proceedings. And said the same applied to all the other recordings against her (pages 40-41 of the ruling)

The audio where she said ‚Äúno one is going to believe you‚Äù came out in February 2020. The trial was in July/August 2020 and was also brought in as evidence.

Depp‚Äôs team was able to present most of the evidence they had at the time (a lot more has come out since then) at the 3 week trial; the problem was that, in the ruling, Nicol rejected most of Depp‚Äôs evidence (except when it favored Heard) and accepted Heard‚Äôs excuses in ways that were biased and inconsistent. 

For example, the Judge applied his logic in different ways when it came to contemporaneous notes and witness testimony:

1. He rejected evidence contemporaneous RN notes about Heard‚Äôs jealousy. Because Heard (a witness not a party) testified they were incorrect/incomplete and the RN didn‚Äôt testify to clear up the discrepancy. 

2. He rejected the police testimony about their being no evidence of abuse or property damage at Depp/Heard penthouse because they didn‚Äôt take contemporaneous notes.

Cool so according to the Nicols, in court witness testimony and contemporaneous notes are both required for it to count. 

3. Why then, does he later accept another RN‚Äôs notes that favored Heard when Depp‚Äôs witness, similar to Heard (a witness), testified that the notes where incorrect/incomplete even though the RN also didn‚Äôt testify to clear up the discrepancy? 

The other issue is that Nicols didn‚Äôt do any critical analysis of HER claims. But this comment is already long and that discussion is a thesis paper in and of itself.",2021-05-28T04:44:39Z,8

These are folks who are successful at what they do.  We're told that success brings happiness.  That success is some kind of state of grace should make us immune to ""being sad"" (as Phil noted).  But that's not how it works.  Having celebs say ""hey - I deal with this crap too"" isn't just humanizing... it says that even someone who has a pretty good life can deal with these things.

She clearly lied about someone to the police for racial reasons. That kind of conduct is not acceptable and it's perfectly normal for a company to not want to employ her.

875,UgyDoBf21TE73jf4Qu94AaABAg,Nando Ginkaku,"@Nick Worrell yeah. You already have your vaccines which thankfully you are alive thanks to those vaccine, so you should be grateful you didn't die the same way people in the past have died from those diseases the vaccines have saved you from. Plain and simple. here's the other question. Do you really think it's worth it for the government to literally get people sick with a chronic disease or even kill them? Do you think that's monetarily feasible?. In what way does it make any sense to off people or get people sick? Literally does not make any sense. Imagine this, say they do have some miracle killer Vax that offs people. Who will fill positions that are needed or are already have a shortage in that workfield? Who would work the vegetable and fruit fields? No one wants that low of a job. Who will work poultry and meat packaging centers? Who will take care of the sick and injured? Who will teach kids and adults across the planet? So many positions left vacant or suffer further shortage of staff. What then. Make people go to school to fill in certain positions? My dude, there's already so many states as is that have many people living off welfare. Also, if you don't believe in data, then what's the point in talking with you really. Because simply put. 300,000+ deaths from covid alone in the US in 2020 is not good. Had we not taken measures the way we did. We could have easily hit 1million. Check the CDC stats for yourself. But again, most likely you don't believe in data or as some people say, ""I don't believe in numbers. They're just a lie told to people to get them to do their taxes"". Which idk how that makes sense, but hey. A lot of antivaxers and covid deniers say. But yeah anyway. It's already predictable what you're on say. Also, for some reason youtube double posts somehow so idk why. Anyway, the fact that you even saw a second post by me that I didn't know happened. Makes me thin you're on here wasting your time being angry about a vaccine. Well. Let me tell you another tidbit of info. If you don't like this. Run for congress or a government position. The beauty between government and privately owned companies is that in a government, you can vote out and replace people. Stuff is regulated to ensure the utmost best possible solution or services for a person. Though they may not be perfect, but that's why many revisions can be done until it is the best way possible. While with a private company, no regulations, forced slave labor, you can't vote out whoever you don't like. I could go on, but I'd like to give you the benefit that you understand that the government is not out to kill you or give you some chronic illness. But wait, they have, but that's why they label substances that can harm you because that's the government's way of protecting its people and hoping it's citizens have the common sense to not OD. Unlike in other countries where they don't have an FDA or other regulatory and safety groups within their government to help iron out the creases in potential life threatening substances.  But yeah, the moment you start to doubt your own government. You doubt your shadow. In the end, heck you may be lucky and be immune to covid or it will be gone, but realistically. It is here to stay much like any other disease that has come before it if we're not careful. Also, what are you doing here? Philly D is not a right wing news reporter. Just here to waste your time trying to spread misinformation? Good luck sir or madam",2021-05-27T22:11:28Z,0

887,UgzeBwXPkrKcYBJTG4J4AaABAg,P Robidoux,"@Rowen Kylee Please don‚Äôt give up.  I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôre a minor or an adult.  If you‚Äôre a minor in the US, your local/regional school district can provide diagnostic academic & behavioral testing.  If you attend private schooling, you can still use these resources, as your parents have paid taxes that support these programs.

As an adult, you will have to advocate for yourself.  If you attend college, seek out testing resources and get referrals to professionals that can further diagnose and write prescriptions, as meds effect people differently.  Strive to avoid chaos and drama.  No recreational (or self-medicating) drugs or alcohol.  A healthy diet and good sleep patterns help ‚Äòreset‚Äô your mind each night, too.",2021-06-10T17:17:57Z,0

You literally have to have legal rights protecting you as a child in order for adults to comply, it's sad really. I remember in high school a student yelled at me in front of everyone saying ""why does she get these rights and we don't?! what makes her different?!"" and she chased me out of the classroom screaming at me.
