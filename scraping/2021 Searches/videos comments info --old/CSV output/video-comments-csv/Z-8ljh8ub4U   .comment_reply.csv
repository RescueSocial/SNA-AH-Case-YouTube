1,UgysPvIr7qG6tSwdVjB4AaABAg,Charissa,"@LaraCroftEyes1 No it was not.  It was alleged by both Heard and Depp in a phone conversation that his team leaked the footage.  In which he said he will check on it.  Furthermore, TMZ was the only news that seemed to be skeptical of Heard all along, reported she shit on his bed (though it is the dogs), etc.  Which makes sense because they seem to follow a narrative.  

This is kind of Depps thing, his former legal team accidentally shared 70,000 text messages with the defendants in London (but not with those in the U.S.) At the preliminary hearing at the High Court.

99,UghFKQajS5AE5ngCoAEC,Julie Lea,"We can't base anything on media, but her actions, filing for divorce 2 days after his Mother dies, when she gets negative attention from Depp fans, a week later she claims abuse. None of her actions are consistent with that of an abused woman (shame, low self esteem, etc) on the contrary, she is the only one who is constantly in front of the press, Depp has been on another continent while she claims"" she fears for her life""....clearly she fears any possessions of value will be taken! 
 If Depp DID hit her, it was a 1 time thing after the death of his Mother, which she has completely negated by stating ""for the entirety of our relationship"". Unless Depp had some underlying mental disorder that completely changed his personality (over 10 people have stated he isn't capable of abuse, basically calling her a liar, & some even saying she is the abusive one) at age 57, which is so very unlikely, any mental disturbance would have presented much earlier, in the 80's & 90's when he was having a very hard time with fame & ""was self medicating b/c I felt uncomfortable in my own skin"". He was young, stressed, & on drugs, any mental disorder pertaining to abusing women would have presenting itself in some minor way, but 5 women he was engaged to, married to, or had children with all came forward with consistent accounts of ""he's not capable of these allegations"" ""this sounds nothing like the man I spent 14 wonderful years with.....these recent allegation are ridiculous""-Vanessa Paradis....she could have been protecting her children, but she & his 1st wife & all in between say the same thing....& that makes it credible. 
 Her actions are calculating & cruel, no empathy at all whatsoever. Everything she does is in front of the media, & she knows that's Depp's weakness, he's very private & moved to France not only to be with Vanessa, but b/c he doesn't think Hollywood, or even the States, is a good place to raise children. She is exploiting this to the max, because they (she) spent all of the money made during the marriage, it leaves only spousal support, & my feeling is that is the source of her anger. She otherwise appears happy, the opposite of a battered women, who would feel ashamed,  there is no hint of any symptoms of battered woman's syndrome. 
 He could have hit her & needs help, but based on her actions she is far more mentally unstable than he is, & he is the one who seems to have self esteem issues, etc, which people don't consider because he's a celebrity, but I'm sure all of this hurts him very much, especially because his mother just died. I think he is the abused one in the relationship based on her actions & his actions. He wants her deposition, he wants his name cleared, he wants it over with, her attorney's are lying to put off her giving her deposition (because she would be lying & that carries a criminal charge), she knew how much she weighed if she was not going to that fitting that same week! All of her actions are contradictory & shady. 
 I am a psychologist, I support women who have been abused ( & children, the most overlooked victim in this horrible crime that goes unreported, the legal system fails victims, & often police do as well). I also was in a very abusive marriage when I was young, I truly feared for my life & was nearly killed on multiple occasions. If Depp abused her & she is a victim, then everything I know & have learned in life & in psych is incorrect. I'm taking into consideration that they are celebrity's, but they are also just plain people. Depp has struggled with low self esteem for much of his life, his bond with his Mother, these things usually produce abusers or those who are violently against abusing women. They aren't described as ""gentle & loving"" by every prior relationship ""the only person I ever knew him to beat up on was himself, as we all do from time to time""-Sherrilyn Fenn....I do not believe all these women came forward & were consistent in describing him as being gentle, but he's really an abuser at heart. Statistically, it doesn't happen. In some alternate universe perhaps.
 Depp has everything to lose here (mainly, it's humiliating for him), she has nothing to lose......unless she really was abused, then it would cause embarrassment & pain at the VERY least to talk about it....she appears by every standard to ENJOY the attention & does everything to draw attention to herself. That is not how a woman battered for over 2 years would act. Also, she's been publicly verbally cruel to him. Contrary to what it would seem, a battered woman does not immediately stop loving her husband & turn cruel because he has abused her. More often they stay together much longer than 14 mo, & she continues to cover up the abuse to friends & family, this woman is parading in front of the press & the entire nation.",2016-07-04T01:32:12Z,1
100,UghFKQajS5AE5ngCoAEC,Julie Lea,"Women that are abused, as she claims ""for the entirety of the relationship"" display signs of battered woman's syndrome, one is not calling the police or pressing charges if they are called by the victim or someone else. However, she displays no signs of battered woman's syndrome, the main symptoms being shame, self blame, & low esteem.  I would speculate based strictly on her behavior that she is either Bi Polar (spending large sums of money, most of the money made during the marriage was spent, leaving her with spousal support as her only monetary option legally, she can only get what he made during the 14 mo they were married, since the large expenditures occurred during the marriage & he's always had money, I'm guessing it was she & not him who was the culprit there.) Bouts of depression with bouts of mania (the spending, the illusions of grandeur, she doesn't seem aware how bad she looks, & seems to think she has something iron clad to get money out of him, actually she does, he's notoriously shy & private & doesn't care much for money, so it would be worth it to him to pay her to go away, she knows this Or she's a psychopath who planned the whole thing & never loved him.
 Since you mentioned it. She filed for divorce 2 days after his beloved Mother died (displaying symptoms of both diseases, lack of empathy, planning to strike when the other person is most vulnerable is more consistent with being a psychopath, but her judgment makes me thing she's Bi Polar, or using cocaine (would account for the weight loss & apparent break with reality). I'm a psychologist, I digress.
 She filed for divorce 2 days after his Mother died, & people publicly basically said what a shitty thing to do. Then a week later she came out with seemingly unsupported allegations of abuse, apparently in response to the negative media attention (it could be random, but all the signs point the same way). 
 Bottom line is 5 females & 5 males have publicly stated that ""he is not capable of these allegations, & the allegations are ridiculous. 5 Females with whom he was either engaged to, was married to, or the Mother of his children ""this sounds nothing like the man I spent 14 wonderful years with"" & ""these allegations recently brought against him are ridiculous""..you can make a case individually on why these people would make public statements, the Mother of children might want to protect her children, the men may be taking up for their friend, but why did his 1st wife speak out? & 3 women he was engaged to? They all said basically the same thing, he isn't capable of these allegations, & basically calling her a liar, some of the men like Benicio Del Toro, said that SHE was not mentally stable. His friend who was there the night the phone allegedly got thrown said that ""Johnny said Amber was filing for divorce, & alluded that she might try something like this"".if she let him know, she's sloppy & a sociopath, a psychopath would be very careful in planning. My guess is that she is Bi Polar with substance abuse, which go hand in hand statistically. 
 He did not BECOME another man at age 57, unless there was an underlying mental disorder brought out by the stress of the death of his Mother, but this would have presented earlier in life in the 80's & 90's he struggled with fame (which was painful for him) & substance abuse. The chance he CHANGED at 57 is so unlikely, it's well established he has never been abusive in past relationships.
 His weakness is that he hates the press & fame, so much so that he moved to France, & famously made the statement he would like his children to visit the States, see what it's about, & GO HOME. He HATES Hollywood & thinks it's fake & shallow & not a good place to raise children. She KNOWS this & is exploiting it to the max, everything she does is calculated for the media, the weight loss wearing baggy jeans with a belt holding them up as if she can't afford new ones that fit, walking out of the courtroom with her hair pulled back on the side facing the media so they can photograph her bruises, etc. She's hoping he will PAY to make her go AWAY, that's why she didn't file a police report & avoided giving her deposition, she doesn't want to lie on the record, her attorney's are telling her she has a great case. 
 I support battered women, I counsel them, & I was in a very abusive marriage when I was young, I know firsthand this young women was not abused ""for the entirety of the relationship"" or ever ""feared for her life""...unless she is SO mentally unstable that her diseases overlap, which is beyond my capability since I'm basing this only on her actions & the statements I deem credible due to the number of them & their consistency. 
 My concern is that is she is lying, if any abuse occurred it was the 1 night, which she has negated by lying about everything else. Women who are TRULY abused do not have the resources Ms Heard has, are TRULY in danger ( & the children are the often overlooked victims, in REAL life). But this is high profile & although I'm sure Depp is hurting, this is hurting all the women who are really in abusive relationships, & deserve some kind of monetary compensation in a divorce & who aren't claiming abuse in order to  get it. Battered women rarely leave after 14 mo, statistically, abusive marriages last years. Many times the woman is threatened if she tries to leave. I had to leave the state without telling my husband while he was at work, because he would have tried to kill me had I tried to discuss any such thing with him. It's also notable that his Father was abusive towards his Mother when he was very young, & this scarred him permanently. This is referred to as the ""cycle of abuse"". 
 Sorry for the length, I believe Heard is unstable at best, & is the abusive one in the relationship. What she has done publicly so far has been emotionally abusive & deliberate, so it's hard to see her as a victim (in private) when she's clearly the perpetrator in public.",2016-07-04T00:56:49Z,4
101,UghFKQajS5AE5ngCoAEC,shair00,"One more quick note. Years ago I lived next door to a man who beat his wife, and not only could you hear the fights a block away, she had bruises, fat lip, black eye and missing hair. There was no doubt at all that she was a victim. In Arizona, if a husband or wife calls the police, all a man has to do is touch his wife, or wife touch a husband, there does not even have to be any violence at all. Someone goes to jail and the state takes over.",2016-06-29T01:52:29Z,0

That is a bad place to be if you saw your rich famous employer do something illegal and you had to decide to report the truth or not.
