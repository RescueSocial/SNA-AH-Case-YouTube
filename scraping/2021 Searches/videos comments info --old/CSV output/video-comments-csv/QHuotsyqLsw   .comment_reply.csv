26,UgyNFGWjMhl9fn6jEhF4AaABAg,Laura Biegel,"@Khloe Cohen she's a real piece of work, isn't she? And now she is holding up pre-trial procedures because she won't hand over her so called ""evidence"" she was abused. Probably because she knows she's making it up. He has so much and she doesn't even have a medical reports or dr bills to support her broken ribs, nose, popped out eye and tooth or split lip. Johnny's lawyers have also now requested info from her sister about any gifts or money she received from AH in regards to her testimony. Can't even keep their stories straight.

I love Johnny Depp but thinking that one person is completely innocent while the other is the sole reason for the problems is extremely naive. Relationships don‚Äôt work like that buddy, and no matter how you spin it, they both made mistakes that lead them to where they are at the moment. Johnny already had so many problems with substance abuse and alcoholism, and the only thing Heard did was make it worse, yeah. She is a liar, and I don‚Äôt believe for a second that he abused her the way she says he did, but no relationship is a one sided issue, and that‚Äôs just rule of life. Even in my own toxic relationships, I was never innocent. That‚Äôs just how it is man.",2020-07-25T05:11:25Z,0

Many victims of domestic abuse stay in their relationships, they forgive and forgive or they are threaten, some of them even die. You don't know why he stayed and none of us are in a position to judge him because we didn't walk in his shoes and simply because we weren't there.
You are talking from your assumptions of what happened, not facts or evidence, which are quite clear that somebody is lying here and it's not Johnny.",2020-07-25T04:49:24Z,5
