The character was necessary to counter the two, as Jack would call them ""goody goodies"", of Will and Elizabeth.  He was also a good counter-point to the vicious villains in Barbosa and Davy Jones.  What turned a lot of people off about the fourth one was that Jack was originally supposed to be the not-so-good good guy, yet when placed next to Blackbeard and his daughter, Jack looked heroic!  Which kind of created the need for the preacher character in the movie.  But without Johnny's improvising and innovations, the character might not have been so much fun!  Depp made the character his own, and that MADE the movies!!!",TheKillakan87,0,2021-01-21T15:36:21Z

Just because Johnny may have had and possibly still have drug and alcohol problems, does not make him guilty of domestic abuse. 
If he was driven to abuse because of his drug and alcohol problems, at least some of his previous partners, who all spent time with him while he was taking all the same substances, would have come forward to complain about his behaviour. 
In fact none of them accused him of domestic abuse, quite the opposite.
They all defended him and said he was never violent no matter what narcotics or alcohol he was taking.
The tapes where Turd admits to physically attacking Johnny, while she accuses him of ""running away like a coward"" and that no one would believe he was the victim because he was a man, are out there for anyone to listen to.

From day 1 she's secretly gathering ""Evidence"" for a future case in trying to get hold of his $650 million dollar fortune. 
She records and stages everything with malice intentions. 
After the actor loses his most of his wealth by unfortunate events, the true nature of the younger female actor is revealed.
In which she will try to take everything for her financial benefit using schemes and pretending to be a philanthropist. 

It would be a nice movie to see. (whether he ultimately loses or wins the future case) Hoping he win's of course.
How one woman can control the news, men, women, and even judges, in the palm of her hand and make them all turn against the actor.

Youtubers on this bubble went very anti-SJW and anti-PC, but over the years many went down the anti-left rabbit hole. An example would be Mr H Reviews, although a movie review channel, at one point his videos were >50% political. He recovered though, isn't trying to police the far left anymore. Your channel is just still becoming increasingly focused on this so narrowly it sounds like sensationalism. Yes you need clickbait to get views, but when the whole video really lives up to the title and thumbnail it's not clickbait anymore. This one is a good example: Johnny Depp won something, but the subject itself does not really warrant so many hours of the viewers attention over the several months and years. There's a bigger picture outside of this couple's quarrel or Brie Larson. 2. So not only you're going down this far-left social media rabbit hole, which is becoming too narrow, but you're also clickbaiting the hell out of every story. ""Massive win"", ""Brutal loss"", ""Streaming failing"", ""Belle Delphine COMPLETELY OBLITERATES cancel culture"" etc, but when you see it the stories aren't actually big profile at all, feels like wasting time on small fry.",Renato Marques,0,2021-01-20T21:14:25Z

370,Ugwo1u_rs0vfx-UbXmF4AaABAg,"Original Female Lead Stories: ✓
Co-Opting Male Lead Properties and Pink Washing them: ✖

Good movies are good movies, male or female lead.  We loved Ripley.  We loved Buffy.  Orphan Black was cool.  La Femme Nikita was solid.  The original Wonder Woman was decent.  Shows with more female-centric narratives, like Orange is the New Black and GLOW are also enjoyable, albeit with lesser appeal to a substantial proportion of hetero males.  But that's ok.  Not every film is meant for every one.  The cynicism of the Star Wars sequels was that the producers thought they could build a larger female fanbase by simply offering up an omnipotent female lead, an emo-heartthrob, some passing lip service to POC...without having to tell a compelling story or caring about the established canon of the universe.  Rather than make something of their own, Kennedy and Disney just took the franchise and mangled the story elements, going all-in on a bluff.  The core element in all of the current pink-washing, franchise maiming abominations is the same: they think too little of their audience.  They have no confidence in their ability to make quality female-centric narratives that attract an audience.  They put their politics above the necessities of myth and logos and subvert pre-established quality franchises to save themselves the risk of standing on their own two feet.   For this reason, they fail and should continue fail, at least until they stop undervaluing female-centric narratives and their audience - no more Bruce Wayne in a dress, please and thank you.
