Ringo Star even said when he thanks all his fans you will be getting the response 10 years later as thats how long it takes to go through them all. You need a reality check. Also ""duped""? Please.

First, I would not take it seriously ..  
I have family who gives me a hard time in this way and honestly Ellen may just feel part of the family and find humor in it. 
If she was being serious .. I still would not be offended. It‚Äôs a business. 
I‚Äôm sure celebrities don‚Äôt enjoy unending attention and perhaps she wanted them to know how to avoid it if they needed ‚Äî so they would also feel comfortable returning to the show one day.",2021-04-28T17:13:38Z,0
