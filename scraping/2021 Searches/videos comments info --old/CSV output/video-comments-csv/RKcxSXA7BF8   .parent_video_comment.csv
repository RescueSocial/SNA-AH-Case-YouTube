7,UgzGXnrJYk2Q-Oavpr14AaABAg,"Wow strikingly beautiful ! I must say make-up enhances women beauty a great deal and often the difference without is kinda shocking for me to be honest but this time Im quite pleasantly surprised, very pretty face and cute smile :-) I guess what I'm trying to say is that yes the make-up is intense but it still looks like you and not just painted face into a different person. Impressed.
Seeing the beautification progress is also very cool :D
Oh and nice video, well done :P",feflechi,0,2021-01-13T22:15:09Z
