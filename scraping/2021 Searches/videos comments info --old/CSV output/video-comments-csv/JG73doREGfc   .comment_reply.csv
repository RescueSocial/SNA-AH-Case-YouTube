The other one is when they were in Atlantis and they secretly met with Vulko on the ocean floor. Mera had created an air pocket within the sunken ship.

So it makes sense that aquaman has never been to atlantis.",2019-02-12T06:54:05Z,2
311,UgwLDkfBXeueL8iXN_R4AaABAg,MisterWhat,"1) Arthur and Mera`s first meeting is in this scene. She doesn`t mention her name and only refers to him as ""Atlanna`s first born"". It`s pretty straightforward that Mera knew about him before they actually met, as the 2018 movie equally indicates but wasn`t formally presented to him until this event. 

2) The meeting in the 2018 solo movie happens after the Steppenwolf incident, as there is a reference to it from Mera, to convince Arthur to help her again. 

3) This may be Snyder`s take on ""Atlantis"" (a bunch of old ruins) but even with that sort of aesthetic choice and despite the title in this video, it is clearly no city (of Atlantis). It`s an outpost. Therefore, different directors accounted, there is no plothole regarding Arthur having been to/inside the capital before. 

4) The whole bubble thing and eye color are just aesthetic differences from the directors and can easily fit it, regardless. Arthur`s standard eyes are blue like his mother but yellow when he communicates with sea life and the bubble scene can be explained as Mera not being sure how much Arthur was aware of his own abilities underwater having lived most of his life above the surface, so she played it safe. 

5) The main inconsistency between the two offerings is regarding to what Arthur knew about his mother. In JL he believes she left him and didn`t cared for him whereas in Aquaman, and mostly because his father is part of the story, knows why she left and holds little to no grudges towards her. The other inconsistency would be regarding as to when/where he got the previous trident and armor but that would be simply extrapolated as having been handled by Vulko.",2019-01-05T21:29:14Z,1

The big thing is, Cyborg's dad is dead in one version and alive in another. If we ever get a Cyborg movie or see him in The Flash, I think the matter of if his father is dead or alive will ultimately determine the canonicity of the Snyder Cut. But tonally, Aquaman, Wonder Woman, and Wonder Woman 1984 are Snyder-related, whereas the theatrical Suicide Squad, Birds of Prey, and Shazam are Whedon-related, not only for their comedy or lighter tones, but also because of their musical theme choices and stylistic visuals.",2020-09-08T01:20:37Z,0

373,UgwCPB91FDoQtqEZFp14AaABAg,bluerisk,"@ashley jules tolentino After the talk with Batman he was not convinced to join the League. In the movies it appears that he is directly heading to this place. But why, and how does he know the location?

In the Aquaman movie we learned that he was not entirely isolated from his people, but that he had a tutor he trusted: Vulko.  And maybe he consulted him after the talk with Batman, and Vulko, as later Mera herself, recruited him for the causes, and he knew were the Motherbox was hidden, and that it was urgent to get there after the Amazons has lost their fight. Unlike the humans, they still understood the message they Amazons had sent out and thus guards were already present under the command of Mera herself.

I can easily accept such an explanation, and does not need a Vulko scene were he explains (for the audience a second time then) about the origins of the boxes, the war, and how they were nearly forgotten, a scene when the Amazons warn Atlantis about Steppenwolf arrival, a scene  in which Mera and and an elite troop were dispatched to this site, maybe even topped with some discussions if the Amazon can be trusted, or if Steppenwolf is nothing more than a fairy tale monster, and whose problem he is after all etc. pp., maybe even a scene that they had to venture through a deep vault of a library to find this place for it has been long forgotten even by them.

Maybe Mera even volunteered to the surprise of all  for this mission because Vulko had convinced her how important it is to stop Steppenwolf, and that he will send  Aquaman to help them.
This would also explain why she wasn't surprised by his presence.

That she overcome her dislike for him and was pleading for his help would match perfectly: first she lashed out based on her emotions, but then collected herself and  remembered Vulko's instructions.

375,UgwCPB91FDoQtqEZFp14AaABAg,Courtney Villa,"@bluerisk Not the Amazons. The Amazons have been training and preparing for Steppenwolf and other foreign forces who tries to invade their land. They said that in the first Wonder Woman film. If you rewatch the scene, there are alot of Amazons guarding that place. They should've alerted Hippolyta as soon as the Motherboxes started waking up and she should've pre-positioned an army outside of the building they were holding their Motherbox in. Notice also the Geography and that the place where they kept the Motherbox is away from their actual living place. They have considered all the possibilities here except the fact that Steppenwolf has flying troops and that he can just use a boom tube in! This is umm only what they're preparing for for the last hundreds of years or whatever and they still failed. 

As for the Atlanteans, you would think it would be harder to locate their Motherbox. It would also be expected that they would be better equipped to keep their Motherbox safe as they are an advanced group of people and are very very intelligent! Not only was it poorly guarded, it was closer to the surface than I had imagined! Out of all the deepest and darkest places in the vast oceans, they picked a spot closer to the surface? It looks as if they entrusted Atlanteans to guard the Motherbox instead of Xebellians which would've been more apt as they are the more powerful breed. They have hydrokinesis among other abilites! 

Overall, I expected Steppenwolf to acquire the human's Motherbox first as it probably would've been the easiet. I was wrong. I was disappointed to see how weak the Amazons and the Atlanteans were shown here.",2021-01-24T18:49:50Z,0
376,UgwCPB91FDoQtqEZFp14AaABAg,bluerisk,"@Courtney Villa I guess after thousands of years one tends to let down the guard.
Maybe they also didn't mind to maintain save upgrade this facility.

Remember Katrina and New Orleans? 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_levee_failures_in_Greater_New_Orleans

It ranges from poor design to simply neglect:

The primary mechanisms of failure at the 17th Street Canal, London Avenue Canal and Industrial Canal (east side north) were improper design of the canal floodwalls.[9] The failure mechanism for the Industrial Canal (east side south and west side) was overtopping of levees and floodwalls by the storm surge. The primary mechanism of failure for levees protecting eastern New Orleans was the existence of sand in 10% of places instead of thick Louisiana clay. The primary mechanism of failure for the levees protecting St. Bernard Parish was overtopping due to negligent maintenance[10] of the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet, a navigation channel, built and maintained by the Corps of Engineers.


And this in case of a populated city, not a nearly forgotten place.

I guess they had a minimum guard for the last 1000 years and considered even these efforts in costs and resources as wasted on this place. I also  guess  that they had some stress call from the Amazons (humanity had forgotten everything about the boxes), but their hostile relation and the huge span of time that has passed led them only send a small guard under the lead of Meera. And she might have part of this  for protocol reasons only.


Question: why do you think that it absolutely normal that even after thousands of years one would maintain a maximum security protocol including the enormous cost? Is that really how we - humanity - run things?",2021-01-24T17:49:02Z,0

524,Ugz0vUcZgZGqUoMZDzJ4AaABAg,ItzSilentStorm,"i cant relate to literally anything you are saying. It made perfect sense to me. You are creating way more questions than are needed.  I didn't get that Arthur was ""missing"" from this.  Just that he is not currently the king but as the true heir to the throne, Mera believes it his responsibility to follow in his mother's footsteps and do waht she would do. She is not talking specifically about his duty to the throne, but his duty to the world. Is it so hard to believe that he maybe has ""some"" sense of responcibility? We already that he helps out people when he can. He was already confronted by Bruce to help fight. Seeing Steppenwolf up close in person attacking them and stealing the motherbox made him realize ""okay maybe I DO need to do something about this""",2018-02-23T04:24:09Z,4
525,Ugz0vUcZgZGqUoMZDzJ4AaABAg,NewGenerationOath X,"ItzSilentStorm why exactly? so Arthur has been missing from Atlantis for how long exactly? (We don‚Äôt know)... Atlanna has been gone or dead for how long? (Also we don‚Äôt know) Where is Orm? (We don‚Äôt know) so for X amount of years, no one to our knowledge has searched for Arthur. He returns to check on the box (assuming he‚Äôs been there before by the dialogue... still hard to tell) and randomly Mera decides to talk about his heritage and duty to the throne after Steppenwolf steals the fucking box... kinda late and moot at that point. They tried to set the scene to motivate Arthur to go help the League. But the way it‚Äôs written is poor because to our knowledge he has no allegiance to Atlantis. Maybe the surface. It was just a poorly executed scene with little context to let the audience know WTF is going on. Once again.. should have been saved for the solo film. Period.",2018-02-23T04:13:52Z,1
