96,Ugw4r_DWS4yyDgbRQcp4AaABAg,DbJ,Well her sister and friends all back amber so it’s hard to say. Seems like they were both toxic people. It doesn’t mean Johnny wasn’t emotionally abusive he sent a text to his friend that was gross about Amber. So many women are victims of domestic violence I can’t speak on this situation.,2021-03-10T01:00:06Z,1
