It's a shame that so many just follow the narrative, because racism.

Less than 10% of people who are killed by the police are unarmed and many are killed when they're stopped by the police during traffic. I don't get why no one asks _why_ they're killed. I doubt that any cop just stops someone and kills him. I think it's pretty likely that the behaviour of the people who were killed is also a reason. Why don't they see that behaving respectfully in a calm manner and not resisting arrest greatly reduces the chance of getting hurt or killed?

And obviously only white men can be racist...
Don't they see how racist blm is? And how idiotic their demands are?

And against what are they rioting? Few people in western countries are racist on purpose and those who behave in a racist way usually want to fight their unconcious racism as well. So for what exactly are the riots? They can just talk and most would listen. If they'd try and no one listens I'd get it that this might cause some unrest, but this simply isn't the case. Apart from that I think it's pretty likely that the riots also helped to spread the coronavirus.

It's insane that so many people don't even question the narrative.

42,UgzOxzvEXTRzuQPBKpl4AaABAg,Dex Luther,"@Mimi B Most people (including the companies that have dropped JD) seem to be acting as if SHE won the UK trial. The reports on it all seem to be referring to it as ""JD's trial against AH in the UK,"" which I see as being REALLY misleading and flat out wrong. 

Basically the trial was to prove she lied (and she was caught in many lies) AND that The Sun KNEW they were lies at the time, which is really hard to prove without them admitting to it somewhere.

Honestly, even though The Sun won the case, they should probably publish a second article explaining how they were lied to and the first article is bullshit. A correction should be posted on the original article too, but corrections never get as much tracktion, which is why I think a new article is important. Also have a link to the new article in the correction on the original one. I think that's the least they could do for their own Journalistic integrity and responsibility.",2021-04-25T00:05:28Z,0
43,UgzOxzvEXTRzuQPBKpl4AaABAg,Mimi B,"Correct, and they already have started to prove that. It is in the appeal decision that the UK courts finally acknowledge that she did abused Johnny unprovoked and that he did not retaliate. They also acknowledged that she ""mislead"" the courts on several occasions. Sadly, they accepted that The Sun was not at fault for believing her lies. It was a loophole to get The Sun off the hook, but not Amber. Even though she wants people to believe she really accomplished something in the UK, she most certainly did not. She has won nothing.
