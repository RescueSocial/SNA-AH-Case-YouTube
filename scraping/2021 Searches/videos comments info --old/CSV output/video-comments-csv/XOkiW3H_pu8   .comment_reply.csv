0,UgzpkJ4zhU_6Vh4_D6d4AaABAg,Louise,True. The problem is depp was fired because of her accusations  which weren't even proven. Hollywood is very sexist. Men are treated as if they are guilty with no evidence but people like amber heard lie and there are no consequences. You say we don't know the truth. We know amber admits to throwing things and says she hit him. That isn't the victim story that she told.,2020-03-05T18:55:28Z,0
