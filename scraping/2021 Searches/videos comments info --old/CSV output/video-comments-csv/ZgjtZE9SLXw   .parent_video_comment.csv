2,UgzJwHEFxgwNnGV0SEN4AaABAg,"These petitions against Amber are actually bolstering her case, guys, she craves attention, being singled out, feeling victimized.
Negative publicity is still publicity.
I tell you, going ""radio silent"" on her will hurt her ego more.
Let her and her enablers make what they want of this, but a celebrity's biggest nightmare is being washed out, forgotten, not worth the fuss.

And yeah, she can keep her Aquaman 2 only so Hollywood could finally see what a toxic investment she is.",ema,0,2020-11-14T22:49:58Z

18,Ugzh1GgtH1egVkOSect4AaABAg,Johnny is an artist and I would prefer to see him in quality independents.  Yes the money might not be so good but sometimes quality rather than quantity is the way to go.  I get a bit fed up with the big two WB and Disney taking over so much.  Funnily enough many of us do not have those two top of our admiration spectrum.  I think it is about time these two companies get taken down a peg or two.  I personally think Johnny is better than the film here.  I also thought it in the Pirates films.  It was Johnny himself who elevated the role and the film.  He does not get enough recognition for what he actually does.  Yes alot of money and loving fans but not critical recognition.,L Mac,1,2020-11-09T09:50:31Z

20,Ugygcv-0dc5tTkwLjvp4AaABAg,"Its not suprising, people werent bothered about signing when they thot Johnny had the case in the bag and so thought they didnt have to but after the blatent disregard of the evidence and major corruption of the law the people seen that the only way Justice for Johnny was if people spoke out and made their voices heard. 

It REALLY shows how many people were on Johnnys side and just how many agree that the decision against him was egregious to say the least.

Lets hope it gets to a million. That will give Warner bros reason to worry when they see its not just thousands but MILLIONS they will be loosing in the box office for siding with the wrong side.",BIG Daddio John Bamford,1,2020-11-09T07:44:09Z
