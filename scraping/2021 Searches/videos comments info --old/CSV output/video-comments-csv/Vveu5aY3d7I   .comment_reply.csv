0,UgwiquBmMtOoAeRyDCN4AaABAg,Eric Horchuck,"@A S ¬†They are only on the ""anti-American bandwagon"" because WE decided when Trump was in office to basically tell them to fend for yourself.  I'm sure that broke the love affair.  The fact that the sheepeople believe all the crazy Republican...  craziness would tend to make them think twice about us too.  I wish Americans were as smart as Denmark.  FOX news went there and tried their BS and failed miserably (Search ""FOX News Denmark Big Mistake).  I respect your opinion of liking Supes' ""American Way"" saying but not because people are scared American is falling away from it's ideals.  It's real ideals of freedom, inclusion, respect & upward mobility for all.",2021-09-29T03:06:11Z,0
1,UgwiquBmMtOoAeRyDCN4AaABAg,A S,Nah I like the addition of ‚Äúthe American way‚Äù. Especially now seeing as so many cringey people are jumping on the anti-America bandwagon.,2021-09-28T22:46:53Z,2
2,Ugxz6JnjPqcknUGbnhl4AaABAg,Eric Horchuck,"The ""American Way"" is complete anti-communist propaganda.  I love what America has given me but a global figure like Superman shouldn't say he's helping because it's the American Way.  Honestly, it's not.  If he was getting likes on YouTube and signing sponsor deals then he could say ""hey  it's the American way"", LOL.  As an American, I LOVE the change.  It definitely reflects the original saying more (which was just ""for truth and justice) instead of spewing anti-communist propaganda.  It's not the 1950s anymore.",2021-09-20T19:53:45Z,1
