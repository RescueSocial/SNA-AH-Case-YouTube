0,UgzYVmle387wcnyVNNp4AaABAg,Rock Candy,i think one thing that would be important in the court case is proving the metadata was doctored by an expert,2021-07-30T08:13:36Z,0

3,UgxKf-CTivmM3c3n-HV4AaABAg,Jules Carlysle,"OH! and another thing...LOL...Les, you are talking about AH not being shaken up: I notice many of her behaviours are directly opposite to my experiences and how I reacted to my ex...goading? challenging? instigating? WHOA! I couldn't look up for fear of how he would react...and my abuse pales in comparison to her tales. It's been exactly one year since I left, and I'm feeling pretty great...but my cleaning lady tapped the sink basket on the side of the garbage can last week and I startled -- scaring her -- I had to be peeled off of the ceiling and was rendered useless for 24hrs. It's visceral, involuntary and requires time...She is so BAD at this. How is she getting away with it? I'll stop now...I'm really on a tear!",2021-07-27T05:44:29Z,1

7,UgzYgIvk2HOzvOG3nZ94AaABAg,Rock Candy,@JSSTyger not going to happen...lol..ok he didn't want the dogs to get out but could he have invited the police inside instead of shutting the door in their faces?  can someone explain no wine on the walls and then Isaac sees wine running down the walls??  anyway it's no worries  - i'm so happy for Johnny for this footage that was hidden and now we know why.,2021-07-27T00:13:41Z,0
8,UgzYgIvk2HOzvOG3nZ94AaABAg,JSSTyger,@Rock Candy Please try to look at things from an alternate viewpoint (ie Josh keeping the door partly closed so the dogs don't get out).,2021-07-26T23:39:12Z,0
9,UgzYgIvk2HOzvOG3nZ94AaABAg,Rock Candy,I could also mention Amber is a grandiose liar.  She lied in interviews and on tv saying she had donated to children's hospital (and ACLU) for years she received clout from those lies.  She donated NOTHING.  It takes a certain type of person to lie about donating money to sick and terminally ill children and their doctors and families.  And she smiled to herself on tv as she said it - because she duped the public.  She is that type of person - the type of person who would frame somebody for money and revenge.,2021-07-26T23:08:44Z,0
10,UgzYgIvk2HOzvOG3nZ94AaABAg,Rock Candy,"@JSSTyger i think it vindicates Johnny. the footage clearly shows the entire outside hallway with no wine stains and no damage to door - plus we see that Josh tries not to let the officers in the penthouse.  then we see everyone on the couch (chatting) and the dogs running around.  Amber is not introducing herself or explaining what happened and no obvious bruises for identifcation.  There are at least two wine bottles sitting undisturbed and delicate glass table and bar intact, the flowers are on the kitchen counter, no broken candlabras,  no garbage bags with evidence of cleaning, everything sitting on the counter in perfect order.  Also there are no pictures of damage in PH3 of fruit, cutlery on floor and whatnot.  You can't clean like that and style items in such short time after traumatic event not to mention Amber was on the phone with her publicist and her lawyer (i think).  plus the photos they took have changed metadata and don't really match their descriptions of incident.     If you take Isaac's testimony he said the wine was *running down* the wall by penthouse 1.  That's not shown in the police bodycam - and had to have been set up just before he came up the elevator and just after police had left..it's clear Amber and co. were framing johnny - the reason is that Amber wanted to get the locks changed and she needed the police to show up to get a restraining order - but she didn't need them or want them to go inside penthouse or interview her.  The second set of police caught them by surprise and offguard. She wanted leverage in the divorce she didn't realize she would be going to court at that time and wasn't as careful with her ""evidence"" as she should have been.",2021-07-26T22:56:23Z,0
11,UgzYgIvk2HOzvOG3nZ94AaABAg,JSSTyger,@Rock Candy the officers with no cams saw nothing.  Then they took the pics and coulda cleaned up.  Then the two officers with cams showed up.  Its too bad the first set of officers didnt have body cams because the evidence is weak.,2021-07-26T22:25:33Z,0
12,UgzyOYu7EeiChwIuqpV4AaABAg,Rock Candy,unless he's giving a description of the wine running down the wall and not the action of the wine actually dripping .  That's something Isaac would need to clear up but i think it's actually still running down and dripping on the carpet given it had to have happened just before he got there.,2021-07-24T16:31:56Z,1
13,UgxAFyybyAuHY0WEXlV4AaABAg,linzi94,It‚Äôs the same as why there are no photos of the total carnage from Australia....,2021-08-04T22:48:06Z,1
14,UgxAFyybyAuHY0WEXlV4AaABAg,Rock Candy,by some people's accounts they cleaned up all the damage sooo quickly ...while on the phone with publicist and before the first set of police arrived they just plain forgot to take pictures. They must have been cleaning so fast and focused...lol.  (This from an individual that leaves sh1t on a bed for a surprise for the housekeepers- and not even a warning to them about it),2021-07-27T10:15:38Z,0
15,UgxAFyybyAuHY0WEXlV4AaABAg,Rock Candy,"@Sue Here's some damage with fruit and cutlery, flowers and glass bottles broken on the floor...but let me take a picture of tiny pieces of glass on the landing...ADDED: and then another weird thing is these tiny pieces of glass are not in the correct spot, let's move them for more effect...what effect?? add some water it's more dramatic??  No the fruit, utensils, candelabra, broken vases would have had more effect and made more sense.  They're completely lost and floundering here with those pics - and to top it off false metadata.",2021-07-27T09:47:26Z,0

18,UgzXuYq_F8rnktvlUZF4AaABAg,Rock Candy,if they changed the metadata they might have taken the pictures at a later time...not sure if that time is retrievable.,2021-07-26T18:54:29Z,0

20,UgzQnX__qWWHklyTXk54AaABAg,Rock Candy,thank you i was looking for confirmation of this time !!- it was confusing because Isaac had said 9:30.  why is the wine running down - unless just poured... haha i just imagine the stress of Josh quickly trying to stage a crime scene and immediately interrupted.,2021-07-24T15:55:55Z,2

25,Ugxx-iPQfmRKdsnHjah4AaABAg,Rock Candy,"from my understanding they were not living together since the sh1t in bed incident the month before.  he made arrangements to go to the penthouse to tell her he wanted a divorce and pick up some things.  because he was nervous about her volatility he brought his security team with him.  i don't know that Amber said he was drunk (maybe she did) - more that he was enraged and that's supposedly why there was so much ""damage"" in the penthouses, hallway etc. EDIT: Josh Drew said he was drunk",2021-07-24T15:46:53Z,2
