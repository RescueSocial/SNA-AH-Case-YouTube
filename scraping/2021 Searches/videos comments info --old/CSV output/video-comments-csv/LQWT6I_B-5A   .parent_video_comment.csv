Usually you may only withdraw for 2 reasons: a conflict of interest (there are specific rules on this) OR your client makes it next to impossible to execute your duty.

If only a portion of a witness's testimony will be false, the lawyer may call the witness to testify but may not elicit or otherwise permit the witness to present the testimony that the lawyer knows is false. 

Rule 3.3(a)(4) (Candor to Tribunal):  A lawyer shall not knowingly offer evidence that the lawyer knows to be false, except as provided in paragraph (b). A lawyer may refuse to offer evidence, other than the testimony of a defendant in a criminal matter, that the lawyer reasonably believes is false.  

Rule 3.3(a)(4) carves out a significant and important exception under Rule 3.3(b) for a defendant‚Äôs testimony in a criminal case, even when defendant‚Äôs counsel has actual knowledge that the testimony is false:  When the witness who intends to give evidence that the lawyer knows to be false is the lawyer‚Äôs client and is the accused in a criminal case, the lawyer shall first make a good-faith effort to dissuade the client from presenting the false evidence; if the lawyer is unable to dissuade the client, the lawyer shall seek leave of the tribunal to withdraw.   If the lawyer is unable to dissuade the client or to withdraw without seriously harming the client, the lawyer may put the client on the stand to testify in a narrative fashion, but the lawyer shall not examine the client in such manner as to elicit testimony which the lawyer knows to be false, and shall not argue the probative value of the client‚Äôs testimony in closing argument.

Basically the lawyer can't defend AH because she knows that AH is lying and that AH's witnesses are lying and as such the lawyer stands to lose her license (and her means of supporting herself in the future).",Bev's Fry Bread Wisdom,4,2020-06-15T19:38:27Z

She sits there telling these horrific abuse stories, one I found particularly disturbing to listen to was the one where she said Johnny dragged her by her hair,  to, what sounds like, every room in the place and actully not only rips her hair from her head but also a piece of her scalp. Anyone who went through that or any of these other terrifying experiences, I believe, would be crying, shaking just completely emotional about talking about them, reliving them. She sits there smirking, rolling her eyes and casually eating even laughing at times. It's unbelievable and that's exactly what her entire case is, unbelievable because personally I don't believe her for a second. I wonder when her and her friends that lied for her, came up with these things. I can see them all come together to come up with these stories that are so strange that they believe people will have to believe them. She relied on her ""skills"" as an actress to pull this off. That's another one of her downfalls, she is a horrible actress. How somebody could do that to another human being, one they say they loved, is beyond me. I can't comprehend how you could live with yourself after destroying a good man's life.",Bex Anne,11,2020-06-15T16:30:15Z
173,UgzGAw5HQynoPF7RabR4AaABAg,John I hope this is true! This is karma and what you put out comes back like a bitch! There is so much truth on Johnnys side. Wondering if it is why AH  wants her testimony in the ‚ÄúSun‚Äù  protected from the media. Maybe she is going to have to admit under oath the actual truth. If that was made Public she will face a huge shit storm! From fans and the media. Then you have James Franco testimony for the Sun protected as well. Again he will be compelled to tell the truth. Then the attorney jumps ship?  DEFINITELY to save her reputation knowing her client is guilty of DV and Lying. If true could be definitely why she would leave the case. I üíØ believe JD Is A VICTIM OF DV by AH. Agree on pushing it back. Sun is set for July would make sense why her lawyer is jumping ship if true. The evidence Johnny has is overwhelming and beyond true!!! Just a thought üí≠ü§î üòä,Jenn K,1,2020-06-15T16:28:19Z

175,UgwVRt2ho75Y4h4kGfl4AaABAg,"No. This is not good.

It means Depp has been in several abusive relationships. Heard is just as much an aduser as a victim of abuse. But so is Depp.

The lawyer has been able to recognize this, but Heard will just go find a schmuck lawyer who will be worse.

This is why lawyering up/divorce doesn't work. It's all about money and the legal system. There's always a victim. Except the lawyer.

It's sad. Sad that Depp keeps picking these broken women. It's sad that he's just as broken. It's sad that they both thought that two wrongs make a right.

Sad. I can only hope that ppl like this can learn to love themselves before trying to fill the void with what they think is 'love' from another.

If all lawyers are hated for representing some one, where will the justice system go? I don‚Äôt think her reputation should be affected.  Everyone needs representation, guilty or not.  Even if a lawyer doesn‚Äôt agree with a client on the personal level, their job is to defend them.   If the media had waited for the facts, then JD would have not been cancelled.

AH and IO must have to take a lot of mind altering meds to deal with the way this is going. I wonder how long IO's little rants on Twitter sustain them in their delusions?
