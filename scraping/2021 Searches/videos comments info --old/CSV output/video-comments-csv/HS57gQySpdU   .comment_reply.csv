1,Ugyjw8Sf7YrctxwYXfR4AaABAg,ken parvu,"@Ergo Smedley So what is your point? I stand by my comment period. 
 Furthermore from your comment it is clear you do not comprehend common english. For if you did then there would not be a comment filled with pointless words just to make yourself feel something other than what you do feel.
 Any discourse with you would be pointless and I base that upon your comment and more likely I am correct. Because it was not a comment but rather a rant. Now you know I know this and I know that your ego will not let you accept that and you will more likely comment back but it will be out of anger rather than thought. So again it would be pointless. So enjoy yourself and continue with your ways as it may suit you as I suspect it does.    Have a great day, if at all possible.",2021-08-21T09:09:27Z,0
2,Ugyjw8Sf7YrctxwYXfR4AaABAg,Ergo Smedley,Oh my god what a load of Incel BS the fact you admit to the idea that every story has two sides then you take his side without question after admitting you know nothing of the case. Or for that matter anything about him off screen. The whole thing is her fault? This anti Amber thing smacks of male ego bruising. How dare this mere female question one of us or dare to say she was mistreated when we know better. BECAUSE we weren't there and don't know a thing about it beyond the headlines!  But he is a cool dude and that is all we need to know! What rubbish the man admits to taking drugs and being a drunk. He admits to having blackout periods. While I do not buy all she says where there is smoke there is fire to be sure and boy is he smoking. Their is every reason in the world to believe he did something to her unpleasant and most likely doesn't even remember it. A little fair play and thought in this case is needed. Not just its her fault she is lying because we love Johnny and hate her.,2021-08-21T03:50:46Z,0
