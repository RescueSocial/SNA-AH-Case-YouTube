A force of talent on screen, Featherson brings that same level of passion and energy to her off-screen messages of empowerment, hard work, and self-discovery, and acceptance.

Though she notes that positivity does not come easily, especially as a Black actress, Featherson's positivity is infectious and is felt in every interaction with her. She attributes her confident outlook on life due to divine alignment with her purpose: Changing the world through her artistry and serving as a resource for women of color.

After Dear White People debuted in 2017, Variety described Featherson as ""pitch-perfect,"" and TV Guide said the actress ""is the comic force of the show."" In Volumes 2 and 3, Featherson continued to steal scenes and reviews. With her stunning cover of Erykah Badu's classic, ""Tyrone,"" she is also the only cast member featured on the soundtrack.

Recognizing a lack of mirrors for girls of color, Ashley co-created the groundbreaking web series Hello Cupid alongside Emmy-winner Lena Waithe. Vulture selected Hello Cupid as one of the best web series of 2014 and The Boston Globe went further, declaring the series, and Ashley, deserving of Emmys.

In 2019, Featherson again stood out and was hailed for her starring role in the Macro produced series, Leimert Park, at Sundance. She also starred in Amber Tamblyn's directorial debut, Paint It Black, the 2016 ABC pilot, Drew, and guest-starred in Fox's Glee.

Featherson received her BFA in musical theater from Howard University, and she currently resides in Los Angeles, CA.

The 2021 MLK Jr. Commemorative Lecture is cosponsored by Trinity University and the City of San Antonio MLK Jr. Commission.

This event is part of the Martin Luther King, Jr. Commission's Dream Week.

Lyrics:

[Intro: Charli XCX]
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1: Rihanna]
Take away your things and go
Can't take back what you said, oh no
I've heard it all before, at least a million times
I'm not one to forget, you know

[Pre-Chorus 1: Rihanna]
I don't believe, I don't believe it
You left in peace, left me in pieces
Too hard to breathe
I'm on my knees right now

[Chorus: Rihanna]
I'm so sick of that same old love, that shit it tears me up
I‚Äôm so sick of that same old love, my body's had enough
Oh-oh-oh, that same old love
Oh-oh-oh that same old love
I‚Äôm so sick of that same old love, feels like I've blown apart
I‚Äôm so sick of that same old love, the kind that breaks your heart
Oh-oh-oh, that same old love
Oh-oh-oh, that same old love

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
I'm not spending any time, wasting tonight on you
I know, I've heard it all
So don't you try and change your mind
So I won't be changing too, you know

[Pre-Chorus 2: Rihanna]
I don't believe, I don't believe it
You left in peace, left me in pieces
Too hard to breathe, I'm on my knees right now, oh

[Chorus: Rihanna]
I'm so sick of that same old love, that shit, it tears me up
I‚Äôm so sick of that same old love, my body's had enough
Oh-oh-oh, that same old love
Oh-oh-oh, that same old love
I‚Äôm so sick of that same old love, feels like I've blown apart
I‚Äôm so sick of that same old love, the kind that breaks your heart
Oh-oh-oh, that same old love
Oh-oh-oh, that same old love

[Bridge: Rihanna]
I'm so sick of that, so sick of that love (hey!)
I'm so sick of that, so sick of that love
I'm so sick of that, so sick of that love (hey!)
I'm so sick of that, so sick of that love

[Chorus: Rihanna]
I'm so sick of that same old love, that shit, it tears me up
I‚Äôm so sick of that same old love, my body's had enough
Oh-oh-oh, that same old love
Oh-oh-oh, that same old love
I‚Äôm so sick of that same old love, feels like I've blown apart
I‚Äôm so sick of that same old love, the kind that breaks your heart
Oh-oh-oh, that same old love
Oh-oh-oh, that same old love

After a highly-anticipated season finale, Nick and Vanessa bring the cast of Love is Blind back together for the first time to spill the tea and come clean on the season‚Äôs juiciest moments.  All of your burning questions will be answered in this can‚Äôt-miss episode.  Which couples are still together?  What was it REALLY like to watch this unfold all over again? Do they have any regrets?  Answers to those questions and more unexpected twists and revelations from the whole experiment explained from the couples who lived it!

More about the Series: Love is Blind follows the journey of singles who want to be loved for who they are, rather than what they look like. They take a less conventional approach to modern dating where they hope to meet the person they want to spend the rest of their lives with...without ever having seen them. With no distractions from the outside world, the singles talk to a stream of potential love interests and when a meaningful connection is made, they propose and then lay their eyes on their fianc√© for the first time. Engaged and back in the real world, as the couples plan their wedding day, they will quickly discover whether they can turn their emotional connection into a physical one before the fast-approaching ceremony. Hosted by Nick and Vanessa Lachey, this addictive series seeks to uncover whether looks or age do matter, or if love really is blind

Deep respect and gratitude for Sweet Honey, for songwriter Dr. Bernice Johnson Reagon, and for civil rights hero Ella Baker, who inspired the song. Though its words were originally written in the context of the civil rights movement of the 60s, and put into song form in the 80s, they feel just as potent and needed today. This song calls attention to many things - a deep need for racial and gender justice (and beyond); understanding and reconciliation of privilege; intersectionality, the elevation of the collective over individual ego, and the value of wisdom sharing between older and younger generations. But perhaps my greatest takeaway comes from its refrain - the idea that in the march towards a more just and loving world, there's always more work to do; deeper work to be done. That can feel like a heavy weight to bear as one person, but it seems so much more achievable if we come together and support each other as a community.

My dream in making this album was to provide some inspiration and encouragement for our journey towards collective healing. I feel so inspired by the experience of recording these songs, and even more so in sharing them with you. Thanks for your comments, conversations, listening, sharing, and for being a part of the process. Here's the lyrics to ""Ella's Song"" - links to learn more about Ella, Sweet Honey, and Dr. Reagon are below.

We who believe in freedom cannot rest
We who believe in freedom cannot rest until it comes

Until the killing of black men, black mothers‚Äô sons
Is as important as the killing of white men, white mothers‚Äô sons

We who believe in freedom cannot rest
We who believe in freedom cannot rest until it comes

The older I get the better I know that the secret of my going on
Is when the reins are in the hands of the young who dare to run against the storm

To me young people come first, they have the courage where we fail
And if I can but shed some light as they carry us through the gale

Struggling myself don‚Äôt mean a whole lot I come to realize
That teaching others to stand up and fights the only way my struggle survives  

I‚Äôm a woman who speaks in a voice and I must be heard   
At times I can be quite difficult, I‚Äôll bow to no man‚Äôs word

We who believe in freedom cannot rest
We who believe in freedom cannot rest until it comes

Not needing to clutch for power, not needing the light just to shine on me
I need to be just one in the number as we stand against tyranny

We who believe in freedom cannot rest
We who believe in freedom cannot rest until it comes
We who believe in freedom cannot rest
We who believe in freedom cannot rest until it comes

Lyrics:

Used to be that I believed in something
Used to be that I believed in love
It's been a long time since I've had that feeling
I could love someone, I could trust someone
I said I'd never let nobody near my heart again, darlin'
I said I'd never let nobody in

But if you asked me to
I just might change my mind
And let you in my life forever
If you asked me to
I just might give my heart
And stay here in your arms forever
If you asked me to
If you asked me to

Somehow ever since I've been around you
Can't go back to being on my own
Can't help feeling, darlin', since I've found you
That I've found my home, that I'm finally home
I said I'd never let nobody get too close to me, darlin'
I said I needed, needed to be free

But if you asked me to
I just might change my mind
And let you in my life forever
If you asked me to
I just might give my heart
And stay here in your arms forever
If you asked me to
If you

Asked me to, I will give my world to you, baby
I need you now (I need you now)
Asked me to, and I'll do anything (anything) for you, baby
For you, baby

(If you asked me to)
I'd let you in my life forever
(If you asked me to)
All you gotta do is ask me to
All you gotta do, all you gotta do
All you gotta do is ask me to
(If you asked me to)

I will give you my world

10 REAL ANGELS CAUGHT ON CAMERA &amp; SPOTTED IN REAL LIFE!
Do you believe in angels? No? Well, these footages just might change your mind, especially when the
footage is accompanied by a miracle, just like number one so stay tuned for that. Here are 10 angels
caught on camera.

Number 10. Angel on the Football Field
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQzuOIXqiSg
On November 7, 2009, Doug Luaders was set to coach a JCYA youth football game in Fenton, Missouri.
That very same day, a photo was taken on the field showing two smiling boys celebrating their win. But
the disposable camera also seemed to capture a white shadowy figure floating right alongside the
beaming boys.
When Doug saw the photo, he was completely blown away. You see, Doug‚Äôs 20-year-old son was
supposed to be his assistant coach that day. But on his way to the game, Kyle passed away in a horrible
car crash after his vehicle collided with a semi-truck. The mysterious photo became public. Doug, and
many others in their community and beyond, believe the white angelic figure was Kyle, who was on his
way to the very football field where the picture was taken.
I hate being cynical, and I‚Äôm happy that Doug found a certain level of solace on the photo, especially for
what happened to his son. But then again, is it just me or does the ‚Äúangel‚Äù look more like a blurred
extreme close up of a mosquito? Believe whatever you want to believe I guess.

Number 9. In-flight Angel
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bK_cpftcrI
Seven-year-old AAsher Lisles dreams of being a famous photographer. Every time he sees his mom
holding her phone, he immediately takes it and starts taking photos. He takes some great photos, mostly
of random things. But one photo he took while on a plane ride home from Washington may just make
his dreams come true.
AAsher, who was born with Down Syndrome hence the two uppercase A‚Äôs on his name which, according
to his mom, represents the extra chromosome, which is quite clever I must say, was with his mom on
the plane ride home from visiting his older brother. There was a lot of turbulence at the time, during
which AAsher asked for his mom‚Äôs phone and started taking pictures.
When Kerri, AAsher‚Äôs mom, got her phone back, she started going through the photos her son took,
even deleting some of them. But when she got to this particular photo, she was dumbfounded.
Honestly, it took me off guard as well so I‚Äôd rather you just look at it for yourself than describe it.
Kerri thinks it‚Äôs Asher‚Äôs guardian angel looking after him while in flight. But what do you think?
Comment down below.

Number 8. Angel in Ghana


Do you believe everything you see in the news? If your answer is yes, then this next news clip will
definitely make you believe in angels.
A Ghanaian News Channel reported on a strange sighting in Dansoman, Ghana. In a segment called ‚Äúan
encounter with the dead‚Äù, a man was telling a story of a very strange event that happened to him. He
said that he saw, and was able to film, a strange flying creature frolicking in the clouds above him. This
creature, which he believes to be an angel, can be seen flying in and out of the dark clouds, as if playing.
Again, of course, the footage is very grainy and the flying creature could be anything. It could even be a
hoax for all we know. But then again, if the story was good enough for Ghana‚Äôs national TV, then there
just might be something to this very strange sighting

Number 7. The Mosque Angel

Most people think that angels only exist in Christian religions. But the fact is, they appear in the stories
of many religions around the world. Angels play a major role in Islamic religions. According to their
religion Allah sends the angels to every Mosque to shower his blessings on the people. Islamic belief in
angels is so prevalent that any paranormal activity seen in mosques are almost always attributed to
angels of Allah. This clip is no exception.
Muslims offering prayers at a Mosque in Azerbaijan were surprised by what they described as an ‚ÄòAngel
Ghost‚Äô offering prayers. Some were convinced that it was an angel and others believed it to be a ghost.
They preferred the Angel approach as it appeared to be praying, and they believe that a ghost cannot
offer prayers but an angel can.
The video was shot using a phone, hence its grainy quality, making others think that the so-called angel
may be a trick of the light. But then again, if said video strengthens someone‚Äôs faith and its effect os
overall positive, it doesn‚Äôt really matter if it‚Äôs real or not, does it?",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2fhcIBQnpeM/default.jpg,120,90,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2fhcIBQnpeM/mqdefault.jpg,320,180,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2fhcIBQnpeM/hqdefault.jpg,480,360,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2fhcIBQnpeM/sddefault.jpg,640.0,480.0,Top 5 Best,24,none,10 REAL ANGELS CAUGHT ON CAMERA & SPOTTED IN REAL LIFE!,"10 REAL ANGELS CAUGHT ON CAMERA & SPOTTED IN REAL LIFE!

If you‚Äôre the curious type, you‚Äôre probably the type of person that approaches something without hesitation, and that includes unfamiliar animals. Well, no matter how curious you are, never come close to any of the animals on this list. Heed my advice, if you see any of these animals, you run away. Especially from number one, if you can run away that is. Stay tuned to find out what it is.
 
Number 10. The Goliath Birdeater
Goliath Birdeater spiders are the largest spiders in the world, both in weight and size. These heavyweights can weigh in at over 6 oz., and be up to 11 in. across with their legs spread. Like all tarantulas, they have a large abdomen and a smaller cephalothorax. This spider‚Äôs spinnerets are at the end of its abdomen, and its fangs are at the front of its cephalothorax. They have very large fangs, which can be up to 1.5 in. long. Each fang is equipped with venom, but it is mild and not dangerous to humans unless you are allergic.
Just knowing how big it is and that it packs venom should be enough to convince you not to mess with this thing. The thing is, it‚Äôs not its size nor venom that you should be worrying about. It‚Äôs the hairs. hey can rub and release the fine hairs from their abdomens. These urticating hairs irritate the mucous membranes of a predator, for example the nose, mouth, and eyes. Needless to say, if these little suckers get on your skin, you‚Äôre going to be itchy for days.
 
Number 9. The Giant African Land Snail
The giant African land snail, is the largest species of snail found on land and generally grow to around 20 cm in length. It is native to the forest areas of East Africa but has been introduced into Asia, the Caribbean and a number of islands in both the Pacific and the Indian oceans. Now, I know what you‚Äôre thinking; what could a snail possibly do to you that should be able you to turn tail and run? Well, I‚Äôm going to get into that in a bit.
In the areas of the world where it is found, the giant African land snail is generally seen as a pest as these snails will eat almost anything vegetarian that they can find and have proven to be quite destructive when around crops and wild flowers. However, it‚Äôs not how much they can eat that you should worry about. Giant African land snails are known to carry parasites that can transmit meningitis to humans. A scary though especially when coupled with the fact that they are kept as pets in some parts of the world.
 
Number 8. The Goliath Tigerfish
The Goliath tigerfish is the largest member of the tigerfish clan, known to grow as large as 5 feet and weigh over 110 pounds, and is native to the Congo River Basin, Lualaba River, Upemba, and Lake Tanganyika in Africa.
This large African predator is a freshwater fish with an olive colored back and a silvery underside. What‚Äôs striking about the Goliath tigerfish is its astounding size and weight, almost looking as if it grew on steroids, and it uses its razor-like teeth to tear its prey apart. The lifespan of this fish is unknown in the wild, but in captivity it can live as many as 10 to 15 years.
If you see it out in the wild while swimming, turn the other way and swim in the opposite direction, and pray that it won‚Äôt follow you. It is a very fierce predator, with a mouth full of 32 dagger-like teeth and a very muscular physique that enables it to hunt efficiently. It isn‚Äôt even afraid of crocodiles and actually eats the smaller ones. 



Despite their massive size, they are fast runners, faster than Usain Bolt himself. Grizzlies can reportedly
run 35 mph, and sustain speeds of up to 28 mph for two miles, faster than Usain Bolt‚Äôs 27.78 miles per
hour stride.



they‚Äôre often hungry, considered as apex predators, can run faster than you, what else is there to be
scared of? Well, they have claws as long as human fingers and the strength to chop op your head with
one stroke.

If you‚Äôre the curious type, you‚Äôre probably the type of person that approaches something without hesitation, and that includes unfamiliar animals. Well, no matter how curious you are, never come close to any of the animals on this list. Heed my advice, if you see any of these animals, you run away. Especially from number one, if you can run away that is. Stay tuned to find out what it is.
 
Number 10. The Goliath Birdeater
Goliath Birdeater spiders are the largest spiders in the world, both in weight and size. These heavyweights can weigh in at over 6 oz., and be up to 11 in. across with their legs spread. Like all tarantulas, they have a large abdomen and a smaller cephalothorax. This spider‚Äôs spinnerets are at the end of its abdomen, and its fangs are at the front of its cephalothorax. They have very large fangs, which can be up to 1.5 in. long. Each fang is equipped with venom, but it is mild and not dangerous to humans unless you are allergic.
Just knowing how big it is and that it packs venom should be enough to convince you not to mess with this thing. The thing is, it‚Äôs not its size nor venom that you should be worrying about. It‚Äôs the hairs. hey can rub and release the fine hairs from their abdomens. These urticating hairs irritate the mucous membranes of a predator, for example the nose, mouth, and eyes. Needless to say, if these little suckers get on your skin, you‚Äôre going to be itchy for days.
 
Number 9. The Giant African Land Snail
The giant African land snail, is the largest species of snail found on land and generally grow to around 20 cm in length. It is native to the forest areas of East Africa but has been introduced into Asia, the Caribbean and a number of islands in both the Pacific and the Indian oceans. Now, I know what you‚Äôre thinking; what could a snail possibly do to you that should be able you to turn tail and run? Well, I‚Äôm going to get into that in a bit.
In the areas of the world where it is found, the giant African land snail is generally seen as a pest as these snails will eat almost anything vegetarian that they can find and have proven to be quite destructive when around crops and wild flowers. However, it‚Äôs not how much they can eat that you should worry about. Giant African land snails are known to carry parasites that can transmit meningitis to humans. A scary though especially when coupled with the fact that they are kept as pets in some parts of the world.
 
Number 8. The Goliath Tigerfish
The Goliath tigerfish is the largest member of the tigerfish clan, known to grow as large as 5 feet and weigh over 110 pounds, and is native to the Congo River Basin, Lualaba River, Upemba, and Lake Tanganyika in Africa.

This event is part of the USHR Minority Empowerment Committee (MEC), which was formed in 2020 from growing awareness of the inequities and deep-rooted systemic effects of racism within society and the hemp industry in particular.

‚ÄúWe look ridiculous dressed up in excuses.‚Äù - @metalmotivation [0:30:22]

‚ÄúHowever big you think you're thinking, it‚Äôs not big enough and you can‚Äôt be afraid to engage in limitless thinking, you can‚Äôt. The more limited you are in your thinking, the more limited will be your results.‚Äù - @metalmotivation [0:31:32]

Ain't lookin' for enemies, but I ain't playin' nice (Mh-mhm)
The way you testin' me and look me in the eyes (Yeah)
Want some of my own candy, I love to see you try (Mhm)
Ain't nothin' real about the way you look tonight (Huhh, aight)
'Cause I know in the morning you'll be wakin' up all alone
Posin' all over your story with nothin' to hold but your phone
You got it bad all over your head
Are you obsessed? (Ohh)
Think that you cool, but you ain't got a crown
Be watchin' and learnin' 'cause I show you how
Lookin at me, like you want my man
WTF (Ayy, ayy)
WTF (Ayy, ayy)
WTF(Ayy, ayy)
WTF (Ayy, ayy)
Ain't lookin for drama, promise I'm not gon' compete (Ohh)
So keep on movin 'cause you got nothin' on me
Now, what you know about karma (Ayy), oh I heard she ain't so sweet (Ain't so sweet)
Get your self out of the club if you can't take the heat (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
'Cause I know in the morning you'll be wakin' up all alone
Posin' all over your story with nothin' to hold but your phone
You got it bad all over your head
Are you obsessed? (Ohh)
Think that you cool, but you ain't got a crown
Be watchin' and learnin' 'cause I show you how

 Quotes from this episode:

  

 ""A lot of times we get so fixated on our to-do lists that we just do things as they come up, and a lot of things that we're doing are busywork - they're small things that aren't really driving our business forward."" - Shawn

  

 ""Sometimes we don't know what we need to get done, or don't know what we've already agreed to do."" - Shawn

  

 ""When you just start working, you're not always working effectively."" - Shawn

  

 ""Being busy feels good, but it's not always effective."" - Shawn

  

 ""What do I need to do to make my business grow, and survive, and thrive?"" - Shawn",,PT48M36S,2d,hd,false,False,rectangular,processed,public,youtube,True,True,False,83,1,0,0,0,,,,,,,

There‚Äôs beautiful Barb that‚Äôs here tonight. Thank you, Barb, for taking those pictures of us together. As we go over to the answer sheet, the one picture is one of our CCO Club members, Barb, who goes to a lot of our live events that we have during the week. The other is the great ribbons that you get at the conferences when you go to a regional or a national. I kind of think those are like gold stars, they‚Äôre pretty fun. 
A: The other thing that I enjoy about the conferences is the education that we get. Mind you, there were a lot of different lectures that you could attend, but some that stood out for me that I went to was one by Leonta Williams, she goes by Lee. She did Coding Inpatient 101: The Transition from Outpatient to Inpatient Coding. She specifically talked about the transition from outpatient to inpatient coding. She did it on a pretty basic level so she went over the different things in ICD-10 and PCS that we needed to be aware of. I found it an excellent, excellent lecture. 

Physician Queries ‚Äì This is a big thing with inpatient and now it‚Äôs becoming more prominent with outpatient. So, Amber did an excellent job of giving us the rules, the steps that you could use to not lead your provider. I enjoyed that quite a bit. I‚Äôll take away the information that I got from that and share that in some of the things in the future for CCO.  
An additional one by Michael who is like a mainstay in all of the events, he did Risk Based Compliance Audits vs Forensic (Error) Audits - Understanding the Difference. So, risk audits versus forensic (finding errors). I really honestly didn‚Äôt realize that there was much of a difference between the two, but he was able to clarify that. That was a really, really good one. 
Then, Brenda Edwards who is a fantastic speaker as well, did, Is Your Physician Ready‚Ä¶ Coding, Communication, and Documentation. Again, this is really valuable for those coders that are in the trenches. This was just a snidbit; I don‚Äôt even know how many lectures were going on at one time. I know that there were probably 10 at a time that you go to choose from and they run you through pretty quickly. 
So, again, the education is really, really valuable and diverse that you get into both the national conferences and the regional. This was a regional conference for St. Louis. I think they just got done with one in Hawaii prior to that, now they‚Äôre getting ready to do one in Utah.

They've removed many of their playgrounds, spent $6 billion on making their restaurants more high-tech and sleeker-looking, and done everything under the sun to create a menu that appeals to fast casual-loving millennials.

One of the more nostalgic aspects of McDonald's that's faded away has been the burger chain's longstanding clown mascot - Ronald McDonald. The absence of Ronald McDonald is bound to split people into two groups. 

There are those who will view Ronald's firing from the McDonald's of today as yet another piece of their childhood gone forever. On the opposite side of the coin, are those with more of a ""good riddance"" attitude about it.

So why, after so many years of promoting Happy Meals, did the Golden Arches finally pull Ronald McDonald from its promotions?

Despite the friendly and fun good nature of Ronald McDonald, 2016 bought some bad press to clowns everywhere that not even the almighty machine of McDonald's wanted to try and fix. Perhaps you remember back in 2016 when there was a rash of really spooky clown sightings across the United States. 

Clowns were reportedly chasing motorists with knives, lurking around schools, and otherwise just being real creeps. This wasn't simply something that was causing a stir on internet bulletin boards or Twitter - major media outlets were reporting on rumors of terrorizing clowns.

The whole thing was widespread enough that McDonald's felt the need to officially distance themselves from the worrying news. Spokeswoman Terri Hickey said in a 2016 press statement, 

""McDonald's and franchisees in the local markets are mindful of the current climate around clown sightings in communities and as such are being thoughtful in respect to Ronald McDonald's participation in community events for the time being."" 

While the creepy clown craze might have been the straw that broke the camel's back, it was hardly the only reason McDonald's parted ways with their clown.

Ronald McDonald has been McDonald's main mascot since the 1960s, but his presence was wearing thin before those terrifying clown sightings of 2016. Various watchdog groups had been criticizing Ronald's marketing of unhealthy fast food to impressionable kids for years, drawing comparisons to the long-retired cigarette mascot Joe Camel. 

Long before the creepy clown incidents, former CEO Don Thompson attempted to defend Ronald as a mascot, saying in 2014, 

""You don't see Ronald McDonald in schools. You don't see him eating food."" 

Basically, the message seemed to be that Ronald doesn't eat McDonald's food - he just sells it. Many observers thought the defense didn't do much to help Ronald as a mascot, or McDonald's as a place to eat. 

That same year, the company redesigned the clown with a cooler, more sophisticated look, but whatever they were shooting for, the rollout was a flop.

McDonald's has been going through a makeover to make its restaurants more appealing to adults for years. The company started this makeover in 2012, and they're still in the process of updating its 5,000-plus locations. This means self-order kiosks, refreshed exteriors, and dining rooms that take inspiration from cafes and coffee shops. But the turn away from the kid-friendly burger joint design is a problem for Ronald, whose loudly-dressed cardboard cutouts don't really fit in with the new modernized aesthetic.

McDonald's could always bring Ronald McDonald back whenever it likes, but these days, if you look through the company's social media accounts you'll see that they're almost totally Ronald-free. 

This doesn't mean that Ronald McDonald has been 100 percent erased from the brand. You can still see Ronald McDonald representing the Golden Arches at least one day out of the year in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. 

McDonald's has been flying a giant Ronald McDonald balloon in the parade for years and it continued to do so at the parade in 2019. Ronald's parade appearance that year wasn't exactly smooth sailing, though. Poor Ronald suffered a gash in his leg after being blown into a tree branch. 

The deflation got so bad that NBC cut away to pre-recorded footage from an old parade to save Ronald the embarrassment. Watch the video to learn The Real Reason McDonald's Got Rid Of Ronald McDonald!

üé§ Lyrics: Illenium - Blood (ft. Foy Vance) 

Cause we‚Äôre blood

When you find your mind in a dark place
Hold on, it won‚Äôt be long before you see my face
I‚Äôm coming to the rescue, take your hand, comfort you
It‚Äôs the least that I can do

Cause we‚Äôre blood
We‚Äôre blood

I heard you told your friends in the school yard
You were getting it tough
Getting it hard
You know it nearly broke my heart

I'm coming to defend you
Live or die, I see it through
It‚Äôs the least that I can do

Dour narrates a tale of a woman‚Äôs power over her household and the way she keeps the strings of each and every one in her own hands likes a puppeteer.
Mrs. Ehtisham is a woman who has everything that she can wish for a successfully running business and two sons to further add to her strength. Despite being an influential and dominating figure, a dark past lingers behind her which she is not ready to reveal at any cost. One of her sons, Abaan is handicapped which has made him finicky and arrogant while Romaan is a straightforward, caring young man. In efforts to hide her past secrets, she can go to any length even if it means hurting someone.
On the other hand, Asma hails from a lower-middle-class family and in a strange encounter, she meets Romaan who is instantly drawn towards her. Romaan‚Äôs efforts to convince her mother becomes successful as she cares about Romaan‚Äôs feelings however she sets up a plan to make Asma‚Äôs life difficult.¬†
Will Asma bring the past of her mother in law to the surface and will she ever be able to stand up against her? Will the reality of Romaan‚Äôs family be exposed in front of everyone?

Lyrics:

Ring the alarm
I been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm
Won't you ring the alarm?
I been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm

She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
If I let you go
Getting the house off the coast
If I let you go
She gon' take everything I own
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damn, if I let you go
She gon' rock them VVS stones
If I let you go
Couped in the 'bach or the Rolls
If I let you go
She gon' profit everything I taught

We meet Dr Anna Joyce who is one of the researchers of the study to discuss the study and what this might mean for future research.

GABA (gamma-amino butyric acid) is a neurotransmitter which helps to balance out hyperreactivity in the brain and has been implicated in the control of conditions such as anxiety and sleep disorders. GABAergic neurons are thought to have a crucial role in emotional processing, sensory discrimination and this may impact motor skills.

Features of Autism tend to be over-excitability of the senses (visual, tactile and auditory) which can affect sensorimotor skills (balance, dexterity, stress, sleep and emotional processing. Since GABA is the main neurotransmitter for reducing over-excitability, it stands to reason to figure out how GABA is involved in ASC (Autism Spectrum Condition).

It turns out that people with Autism have much lower GABA levels in their brains than typical brains. This is due to structural and functional differences in the parts of the brain which produce GABA as well as a likelihood that the conversion process of Glutamate to GABA is impaired in people with ASC. Therefore, the sensory overloading in people with Autism is likely to be related to this reduced GABA and supplementing with GABA may be useful.

We supplied Coventry University with a selection of teas and tisanes with varying GABA and L-Theanine levels to use in a study with children with Autism and they have had very encouraging results.

Statistically, participants who drank Amber GABA Oolong tea daily had an overall improvement in manual dexterity, balance, reduction in stress, less sensory excitability and a reduced level on the Autism Spectrum Scale. This is compared with a placebo tisane that actually had some GABA content and therefore may actually have even better results compared with drinking no tea or tisanes at all.

This is a small feasibility study so it is far from conclusive but certainly warrants larger studies. A sensible conclusion for anyone with Autism or who have children with Autism is that it is worth trying to supplement with a few cups of GABA tea every day - it cannot be harmful so give it a try!

ABOUT AMBER GABA OOLONG
Normal Oolong tea contains around 10-30mg of GABA per 100g. For a tea to qualify as GABA tea it must contain at 150mg of GABA per 100g. Our Amber GABA has been tested to have over 200mg. The farmers achieve this by alternating the leaves between air and a vacuum environment during the oxidation phase. This is done over a matter of hours and naturally increases the GABA levels in the tea leaves.

Shia LeBeouf has been in the spotlight since he was a kid. At just 10 years old, he started doing stand up comedy, as he saw it to be an escape from the hostile environment he grew up in. He was an up and coming movie star, who had been in the spotlight long enough that everyone got familiar with the name and face. And then, everything seemed to go down hill fairly quickly.

Lyrics

When I'm underneath the bright lights
When I'm tryna have a good time
'Cause I'm good now you ain't mine
Now, now, now, now, don't call me up
When you're looking at my photos
Getting hot, losing control
You want me more now I let go
Now, now, now, now

I'm over you and I don't need your lies no more
'Cause the truth is, without you, boy, I'm stronger
And I know you said that I changed with my cold heart
But it was your game that left scars
Ooh, I'm over you

Don't call me up
I'm going out tonight
Feeling good now you're outta my life
Don't wanna talk about us
Gotta leave it behind
One drink and you're outta my mind
Now, now take it up
Baby, I'm on a high
You're alone, going out of your mind
When I'm here up in the club
And I don't wanna talk
So don't call me up

'Cause I'm here looking fine, babe
And I got eyes looking my way
And everybody's on my vibe, babe
Now, now, now, now, don't call me up
My friends said you were a bad man
I should have listened to them back then
And now you're tryna hit me up again
Now, now, now, now

I'm over you and I don't need your lies no more
'Cause the truth is, without you, boy, I'm stronger
And I know you said that I changed with my cold heart
But it was your game that left scars
Ooh, I'm over you

Don't call me up
I'm going out tonight
Feeling good now you're outta my life
Don't wanna talk about us
Gotta leave it behind
One drink and you're outta my mind
Now, now take it up
Baby, I'm on a high
You're alone, going out of your mind
When I'm here up in the club
And I don't wanna talk
So don't call me up

Don't call me up
So don't call me up
Don't call me up

I'm over you and I don't need your lies no more
'Cause the truth is, without you, boy, I'm stronger
And I know you said that I changed with my cold heart
But it was your game that left scars
Ooh, I'm over you

Don't call me up

[Intro: Lennon Stella]
Your heart for takeaway, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Your heart for takeaway, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Your heart for takeaway, yeah, yeah
Your heart for takeaway, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Lennon Stella & Andrew Taggart]
Hey, hey, hey
Where do you think you're going?
It's so late, late, late
What's wrong?
I said, ""I can't stay, do I have to give a reason?""
It's just me, me, me
It's what I want

[Pre-Chorus: Lennon Stella & Andrew Taggart]
So how did we get here?
Three weeks now, we've been so caught up
Better if we do this on our own

[Chorus: Lennon Stella & Andrew Taggart]
Before I love you (na, na, na)
I'm gonna leave you (na, na, na)
Before I'm someone you leave behind
I'll break your heart so you don't break mine
Before I love you (na, na, na)
I'm gonna leave you (na, na, na)
Even if I'm not here to stay
I still want your heart

[Post-Chorus: Lennon Stella]
Your heart for takeaway, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Your heart for takeaway, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Your heart for takeaway, yeah, yeah
Your heart for takeaway, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Your heart for takeaway
(Your heart for takeaway, yeah, yeah)
Your heart for takeaway, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Lennon Stella & Andrew Taggart]
Fate, fate, fate
Is that what came between us?
Or did we do this on our own?

[Pre-Chorus: Lennon Stella & Andrew Taggart]
So how did we get here?
I'm asking myself why I'm so caught up
Better if we do this on our own

[Chorus: Lennon Stella & Andrew Taggart]
Before I love you (na, na, na)
I'm gonna leave you (na, na, na)
Before I'm someone you leave behind
I'll break your heart so you don't break mine
Before I love you (na, na, na)
I'm gonna leave you (na, na, na)
Even if I'm not here to stay
I still want your heart

[Post-Chorus: Lennon Stella]

Your heart for takeaway, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Your heart for takeaway, yeah, yeah
Your heart for takeaway, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Your heart for takeaway
(Your heart for takeaway, yeah, yeah)
Your heart for takeaway, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Outro: Andrew Taggart & Lennon Stella]
Before I love you (na, na, na)
I'm gonna leave you (na, na, na)
Before I'm someone you leave behind
I'll break your heart so you don't break mine
Before I love you (na, na, na)
I'm gonna leave you (na, na, na)

Over my career in the Sports business I've often been intrigued by the mental aspect of athletic success. I've read books and studied on the correlation between sports & psychology and identified the direct link between the greatest coaches in history and their attentiveness to the mental/emotional well being of their athletes. One of the greatest to ever coach; Phil Jackson, has NBA Championships as a coach and 2 as a player and has focused heavily on the mental side of the game. He has coached 2 of the greatest of all time, and orchestrated 3 ""Three-Peats!"" 

My intrigue into the mental aspect of athletics led me to visit with David McCullar, Founder of Inception, ""The First Mental Heath Gym"" and take a tour of his amazing facility! In Episode 3 of ""Beyond The Ball"" I learned David's vision, his mission, and most importantly HIS ""WHY?!?""

‚ô™ Love the way you lie lyrics 

On the first page of our story
The future seemed so bright
Then this thing turned out so evil
I don't know why I'm still surprised
Even angels have their wicked schemes
And you take that to new extremes
But you'll always be my hero
Even though you've lost your mind
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Now there's gravel in our voices
Glasses shattered from the fight
In this tug of war you always win
Even when I'm right
'Cause you feel me fables from your head
With violent words and empty threats
And it's sick that all these battles
Are what keeps me satisfied
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
So maybe I'm a masochist
I try to run but I don't wanna ever leave
Till the walls are going up
In smoke with all our memories
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

We had so much fun #Trying all of these #Edible #Slime recipes! There are several different kinds. I have never made edible slime before and this was my first time! We made one slime out of Gummy Bears, one out of Sour Patch Kids, and one out of Starburst candies! Each one was completely different and it was fun to see the differences. Which were your favorite?

We made one slime out of Gummy Bears, one out of Sour Patch Kids, and one out of Starburst candies! Each one was completely different and it was fun to see the differences. Which were your favorite?

You can pick up a brand new Levante for anywhere between 87 and 200 thousand dollars. I borrowed this 2017 Levante S from Walser Audi of Wichita to review it, and decide if it fits into the new Turo rental fleet. After driving it, I'm less sure than I was just thinking about it.

Her husband, Richard Crafts, came up with several stories to explain her sudden disappearance before deciding that he didn't know where she was. It didn't take long for Richard to become the main suspect and even be convicted for her murder, but Helle Crafts' body has never been recovered, resulting in the first murder conviction without a body in Connecticut history. Savannah takes you through the mountain of evidence that surrounded this historic case, as well as the timeline of Helle's final moments as theorized by police and prosecutors.

The OK Diner say that they provide an authentic diner experience from the rock and roll to the stacked burgers, griddle favourites, bottomless coffee plus wings and dogs (that‚Äôs chicken wings and hot dogs to you). All served up in a classic diner setting with a smile. 

The BIG Question is, can the UK replicate an American Diner right here in England?

Amber Heard is a Taurus, as am I. We are born days apart (different years) yet we are fundamentally different.. why? It's because Amber Heard is born under the Cusp of Power, which is the cusp of Aries and Taurus. Many infamous dictators and evil people in history have been born under this same sign. I myself am close to being born under this same sign, but luckily, I am not. If you are interested in finding out more about this, keep watching and stay tuned for more.

Lyrics
We still believe, we still believe
We still believe, we still believe
It's coming home, it's coming home
It's coming, Football's coming home
It's coming home, it's coming home
It's coming, Football's coming home again
Tears for heroes dressed in grey
No plans for final day
Stay in bed, drift away
It could have been all
Songs in the street
It was nearly complete
It was nearly so sweet
And now I'm singing
Three lions on a shirt
Jules remains still gleaming
No more years of hurt
No more need for dreaming
Talk about football coming home
And then one night in Rome
We were strong, we had grown
And now I see Ince ready for war
Gazza good as before
Shearer certain to score
And Psycho screaming
Three lions on a shirt
Jules remains still gleaming
No more years of hurt
No more need for dreaming
We can dance Nobby's dance
We could dance it in France
It's coming home, it's coming home
It's coming, Football's coming home",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oyoy2_7FegI/default.jpg,120,90,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oyoy2_7FegI/mqdefault.jpg,320,180,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oyoy2_7FegI/hqdefault.jpg,480,360,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oyoy2_7FegI/sddefault.jpg,640.0,480.0,LightningSeedsVEVO,10,none,The Lightning Seeds - Three Lions '98 (Official Video),"Lightning Seeds - Three Lions '98 (Official Video) Listen on Spotify http://smarturl.it/TLFS_Spot

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ooit stond Danny (Scott Adkins) aan het hoofd van de gevreesde Green Street Elite, een hooliganbende uit de East End. Wanneer zijn familie bedreigd wordt, vertrekt de legendarische vechtersbaas in zelfgekozen ballingschap. Tot hij verneemt dat zijn jongere broer door aanhangers van Millwall vermoord is. Zinnend op wraak, keert Danny naar Londen terug. Daar blijken de spelregels echter ingrijpend veranderd. De straatgevechten van weleer zijn vervangen door illegale kooigevechten, met reglementen, een ref en een competitie. Hardcore gevechten, geen hersenloos geram. Helaas hebben jaren van bier hijsen en kebabs vreten hun tol ge√´ist bij de Green Street Elite. Terwijl Danny zijn team klaarstoomt voor de ultieme confrontatie met Millwall, vraagt zijn beste vriend Victor hem bovendien om een gunst. Als politieagent die het ondergrondse vechtcircuit onderzoekt, wil hij dat Danny zijn ogen en oren openhoudt... De derde Green Street-film is andermaal een bikkelharde, rauwe actiefilm geworden, met spetterend in beeld gebrachte gevechten en een denderende soundtrack.

Thinking of working for a nonprofit or social enterprise organization? I asked nonprofit Executive Directors and hiring managers what job interview questions they ask job candidates for nonprofit work. They shared their favorite questions that, answered well, can help you get a nonprofit job with a great organization. 

I have hired my fair share of employees for the 501c3 nonprofit I started many years ago. At this point, I have a pretty good sense of who will be a good fit for the job. If you‚Äôre starting a nonprofit organization yourself, you might want to keep these things in mind for when it is time for you to hire your own team. 

I hope this helps!

When they‚Äôre hittin this deep don‚Äôt play, don‚Äôt play

Don‚Äôt play games, don‚Äôt play games with my heart
Ohh eeeee

When they‚Äôre hittin this deep don‚Äôt play, don‚Äôt play

KSI:
All that time on your own with me
We had fun on the 360
I helped you get that UAV
Still could never get you that AC
Sneaking in school just to get by you
I‚Äôm obsessed with the scent on you
Coco Chanel on your neck with your body in check 
Loving all the time with you 
But now you‚Äôve just gone missing
And you‚Äôre airing all my wishes
You‚Äôre online but you still won‚Äôt listen
All my time is you dismissing 
This is in no way a 2 way street 
I‚Äôm playing sad and it‚Äôs on repeat
Got me here hoping you see my snap
Cos I‚Äôm not ready for us to wrap
Nowoooooo

Don‚Äôt play games, don‚Äôt play games with my heart
Ohh eeeee
Now the feels hit me differently 
When they‚Äôre hittin this deep don‚Äôt play, don‚Äôt play

Don‚Äôt play games, don‚Äôt play games with my heart
Ohh eeeee
Now the feels hit me differently 
When they‚Äôre hittin this deep don‚Äôt play, don‚Äôt play

Anne-Marie:

But now you‚Äôve just gone missing
And you‚Äôre airing all my wishes
You‚Äôre online but you still won‚Äôt listen

Sparks | TEDxAsheville,"Will‚Äôs talk, ‚ÄúThe Power of Self-Awareness,‚Äù illustrates the transformative potential of giving and receiving feedback.  In his talk, he recounts his first class during his doctoral program at George Washington University when his professor gave him an ‚ÄúA‚Äù on his final paper, but an ‚ÄúF‚Äù in life.  During their exchange, Professor Jerry B. Harvey introduced Will to his ‚ÄúShadow‚Äù and helped him see that the dysfunction in his failed marriage had been largely brought by himself, not his ex-wife. Confronted with this reality, Will discusses the implication of understanding how our Shadow often brings about the very thing we are trying to avoid.  He closes his talk with the broader implications of this exchange, and the moral responsibility we have to give and receive honest and candid feedback with those in our lives. William L. Sparks is the Dennis Thompson Chair & Professor of Leadership at the McColl School of Business at Queens University of Charlotte, where he also serves as the Director of the Office of Leadership Initiatives.  His research is focused on self-actualization and leadership.  His assessment, the ‚ÄúActualized Leader Profile,‚Äù is based on Carl Jung‚Äôs concept of the ‚ÄúShadow‚Äù and has been translated into eight languages.  He is the co-author with Peter C. Browning of the book ‚ÄúThe Director‚Äôs Manual: A Framework for Board Governance‚Äù (Wiley, 2016) and is the author of the forthcoming book ‚ÄúActualized Leadership: Meeting Your Shadow & Maximizing Your Potential‚Äù (SHRM Publishing, 2018).

In this episode, Robert and I discuss Quinton's Isotonic and Hypertonic solutions. Quinton is made from sea plasma harvested from vortex plankton blooms, that quickly restore the body's biological terrain. With 78 minerals that are necessary for proper genetic expression, Quinton Isotonic is nearly identical to the concentration of minerals and trace elements found in human blood plasma.

About:
International water scientist Robert Slovak is regarded as one of the world‚Äôs foremost water experts.
After retiring from the corporate world, Robert left for Brazil to bring advanced water technology. While working in the rainforest, he contracted a gastrointestinal illness due to unsanitary eating conditions in the small village. It was then Robert was taken to see a biologist for treatment. The scientist recommended Quinton Marine Plasma to eliminate the affliction. Robert left the Brazilian biologist the following morning convinced he had uncovered one of the greatest medicines of history, an imported marine solution from Spain.

Episode Takeaways:

[08:30] How did Robert get started with Quinton, molecular hydrogen and Water and Wellness?..

 [15:45] The formation of earth (Robert has slides you may want to watch on youtube)...

 [22:15] Our body‚Äôs fluids vs the ocean‚Ä¶ Is the similarity the key to homeostasis?...

 [25:20] The experiment that changed everything‚Ä¶

 [28:20] What impact does drinking Quinton have on your extracellular matrix?..

 [32:05] How can Quinton be administered?..

 [38:30] Where does Quinton come from and how is it made?..

 [48:20] Are athletes better off using Quinton or a typical electrolyte solution? What is the best way to use it as an athlete?..

 [56:00] What is everything that is in Quinton?..

 [59:00] Quinton hypertonic solution vs isotonic solution‚Ä¶ Which is better? When should each be used?..

 [62:44] Is Quinton the fabric of life? Does it have the ability to restore our bodies at a cellular level?..

LYRICS

Already Gone
by MattyBRaps

You just wanna rescue me
But I'm already gone
Could of had the best of me
But I chose to be strong
Now you're blowning up my phone
But I won't turn it on
You keep calling out my name
But I'm already gone

It's a cold world
That we live in
Growing up and discovering you got fake friends
When you've been real
And you stayed true
But you realize what they care about and it ain't you
When you feelin' like you just lost
That one person you knew
But there's nothing that you can do (nah)
Real love it takes two
They life isn't a movie
'nother episode
So you keep it all to yourself
But your hearts about to expload

You just wanna rescue me
But I'm already gone
Could of had the best of me
But I chose to be strong
Now you're blowning up my phone
But I won't turn it on
You keep calling out my name
But I'm already gone

You feel sickness
When you witness 
Someone close betray
All that trust that you once built up
And you watch it crumble away
You replay every word
All the lies that you were fed
How they pushed you and they pulled you
And they messed around with your head
See all that love you felt was real
So you're wondering what went wrong
And you start to question what's real love
And what's been a lie all along
2nd guessin what you've been told
When you feel lost and alone
Cause that person that you would run to 
Just ain't that person no more

You just wanna rescue me
But I'm already gone
Could of had the best of me
But I chose to be strong
Now you're blowning up my phone
But I won't turn it on
You keep calling out my name
But I'm already gone

A real friend wouldn't hurt ya
A true friend won't desert ya
And if it's meant to be
They can disagree 
But in the end they still your person
A true friend could never lie (no lie)
Stay standing up for you
Cause in the end 
If it's not pretend, then
That's what real friends do

LYRICS

Already Gone
by MattyBRaps

You just wanna rescue me
But I'm already gone
Could of had the best of me
But I chose to be strong
Now you're blowning up my phone
But I won't turn it on
You keep calling out my name
But I'm already gone

It's a cold world
That we live in
Growing up and discovering you got fake friends
When you've been real
And you stayed true
But you realize what they care about and it ain't you
When you feelin' like you just lost
That one person you knew
But there's nothing that you can do (nah)
Real love it takes two
They life isn't a movie
'nother episode
So you keep it all to yourself
But your hearts about to expload

You just wanna rescue me
But I'm already gone
Could of had the best of me
But I chose to be strong
Now you're blowning up my phone
But I won't turn it on
You keep calling out my name
But I'm already gone

You feel sickness
When you witness 
Someone close betray
All that trust that you once built up
And you watch it crumble away
You replay every word
All the lies that you were fed
How they pushed you and they pulled you
And they messed around with your head
See all that love you felt was real
So you're wondering what went wrong
And you start to question what's real love
And what's been a lie all along
2nd guessin what you've been told
When you feel lost and alone
Cause that person that you would run to 
Just ain't that person no more

You just wanna rescue me
But I'm already gone
Could of had the best of me
But I chose to be strong
Now you're blowning up my phone
But I won't turn it on
You keep calling out my name
But I'm already gone

A real friend wouldn't hurt ya
A true friend won't desert ya
And if it's meant to be
They can disagree 
But in the end they still your person
A true friend could never lie (no lie)
Stay standing up for you
Cause in the end 
If it's not pretend, then
That's what real friends do 

You just wanna rescue me
But I'm already gone
Could of had the best of me
But I chose to be strong
Now you're blowning up my phone
But I won't turn it on
You keep calling out my name
But I'm already gone",en,PT3M4S,2d,hd,false,True,rectangular,processed,public,youtube,True,True,False,73328562,529177,33861,0,,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/S9kBNRS_GAo/maxresdefault.jpg,1280.0,720.0,"['Already Gone', 'MattyBRaps', 'MattyB', 'Matty B', 'Olivia Haschak', 'Haschak Sisters', 'Haschak', 'Gone', 'school', 'friends', 'best friends', 'story', 'betrayal', 'friendship', 'fake friends', 'high school', 'middle school', 'mean girls', 'Sing', 'Singer', 'Singing', 'New Music', 'Music', 'Pop', 'Rap', 'Pop Music', 'Top 40', 'Classic', 'Best', 'prank', 'skit', 'Hip Hop', 'lyrics', 'lyric video', 'mattyb lyrics', 'rapper', 'rapping', 'best', 'cute', 'teen', 'teens', 'kid', 'kids', 'original song', 'favorite', 'boy', 'girl', 'music video', 'top', 'artist', 'video', 'boys', 'girls', 'suspended', 'atlanta', 'drama', 'acting']",,,

After Vy Qwaint created I TRAP SPY NINJAS for PROJECT ZORGO and Do 4 Challenges on Friends to Open Safe and be a Top Hacker, Daniel uploaded NEW SPY NINJA IS... We Compete in Fun Challenges to Find Next Friend to Replace Hacker Vy Qwaint to the Exposing Project Zorgo YouTube channel, I uploaded SPY NINJA DAX DEFEATED in HACKER BATTLE ROYALE (Hide & Seek Challenge with PZ9 for Vy Qwaint Phone) to the Chad Wild Clay channel. We recruited a new spy ninja to our team to replace Vy after she failed the lie detector test and left the safe house to join the hacker group Project Zorgo. We can't believe she betrayed us like that. Dax was the new team member after he completed the fruit ninja and crawling through tiny secret hidden tunnel battles. PZ9 hacked our television and announced that he still have Vy's iPhone X with lots of secrets on it still! We have to take back the phone! We tricked him into coming to the safe house and played hide and seek for 24 hours, like an escape room challenge. Unfortunately, PZ9 ran out of the house and we chased him down, hoping to stop him before Project Zorgo showed up! We tried to keep Dax safe by letting him watch the security cameras back home but he did not listen to us. We ended up getting trapped in the basement headquarters but to our surprise Vy ended up saving us! She rescued us! Or did she? It still remains a mystery if my best friend and wife can be trusted. We had a chase back to our house where she finally told the truth. We played some trust challenges to see if we can welcome her back after she took $10,000 from us.

How many times have you heard that you should stand shoulder width apart? Why does the width of your shoulders matter in golf?

Answer? It doesn't!

Where are your legs attached to your body? Hopefully you said your hips and not your shoulders!

Every golfer's build is different and that requires that they have a stance width predicated off their build as this bonus video will show you.

https://rotaryswing.com/golf-instruction-videos/full-swing-advanced/setup/stance-too-wide?ad_id=cq-yt-stance

Here's a video on how wide your stance should be: https://rotaryswing.com/golf-instruction-videos/full-swing-basics/setup/determining-proper-stance-width

If you struggle with swinging over the top, struggling with your weight shift, struggling to get the ball to come down on line and struggle to produce power in your golf swing, listen up 'cause it could be something as simple as just understanding how to set up to the ball correctly just with your stance width, that could make a huge improvement in all four of those things.

Most golfers that I see these days stand with a pretty wide stance. Now part of the problem is that nobody has been able to give you a really concrete answer of how wide you should stand. Until rotary swing came and and said, ""Listen we have a definitive answer, you should stand two inches outside of neutral joint alignment."" Now why do we say that? Well I've talked about that in the videos in detail. You can click the link in the description to see the whole thing, but the short ... the gist of it is, your legs, in case you weren't aware of this, are attached to your pelvis.

Now most golfers are taught that they should stand shoulder width apart, but I always ask them, ""Where are your legs attached?"" Well, they're not attached to your shoulders. Your shoulders have nothing to do with stance width. The reason being is that some people have very broad shoulders and narrow hips. Some people have broad hips and narrow shoulders and everything in between. 

Your stance width is predicated on your pelvis width and it has more to do with sequencing your golf swing and understanding how to shift your weight than anything else. See the trick to the golf swing is the whole thing that fires the down swing sequence is weight shift. You've heard millions of times golfers say, ""You swing from the ground up."" But what does that really mean?

Well the trick is every tour pro on the planet shifts his weight back to the left in the down swing to initiate the transition. If you don't shift your weight, you have nothing else to move the golf club other than your arms, hands and shoulders. Now if you're one of these golfers who swings over the top like this, your hips typically don't move much at all. You're just hacking at the ball with no power whatsoever, 'cause you're just relying on your little muscles to try and swing the golf club.

Pros, we work on using our body, our trunk, our legs to produce power and that all starts with weight shift. Now the problem with a really wide stance is that sure, I can shift my weight, but what's gonna tend to happen? Well my head's gotta move all over the place. Golf's hard enough without a moving target. So we want to keep that head fixed. It can move a little bit. We give you about an inch and a half, two inches max of movement. But we really like for that head to stay quite centered and by shifting my weight with my head not moving, I can't load up on the right side. I'm just gonna tend to kinda sit here and spin in the middle.

Weight shift is critical in the down swing because this lateral movement of your pelvis which all pros do, your lateral movement of your pelvis tilts your spine away from the target. We call this secondary axis tilt. So if I have a proper stance with and I shift my weight, my hands and the club drop straight down on plane. Now if you're the guy doing this, this is a huge difference of where your hands look like they just moved vertically because I'm not trying to move my hands at this point, I'm just shifting laterally to get my weight back to the left and then I can bring the club down from there. 

If my stance is too wide, I either won't shift my weight or I'll shift and have so much secondary axis tilt, that the club's gonna come in way from the inside. Stance width is critical for understanding how to start the down swing. If you don't set up to the golf ball with the right stance width, you're never ever going to be able to have a proper transition. So, today' video, bonus video is all about understanding exactly how wide your stance should be for every club in the bag, and how to find your stance width based on the width of your pelvis.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SsWQxgGoTn8/default.jpg,120,90,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SsWQxgGoTn8/mqdefault.jpg,320,180,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SsWQxgGoTn8/hqdefault.jpg,480,360,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SsWQxgGoTn8/sddefault.jpg,640.0,480.0,RotarySwing.com Golf Instruction,17,none,Your Golf Stance Width is Ruining Your Golf Swing,"Transform your Golf Swing today!

A debate is heating up on the US territory of Guam about its political future. The Pacific island‚Äôs attorney general has filed an appeal to a federal court ruling that struck down a planned referendum on its political status. The ruling revolves around Arnold Davis, a long-time resident of the island who sued the Guam Elections Commission for not allowing him to vote because he is white. According to the law in Guam, only native residents are allowed to vote in the non-binding referendum.  

Now, that question will go before the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in the United States.  The island‚Äôs official status is as a non-self-governing territory. Guam has no official representation in the federal government, and its people are not full citizens of the country. If the referendum hadn‚Äôt been delayed, native Chamorro people and their descendants would have been voting on three options for the future of Guam: statehood, free association, or independence from the US.

Independence advocates want total political autonomy from the US. They want a greater say over decisions that the military makes on the island. They object to unilateral land seizures like the recent decision to convert a culturally important area into a firing range.  Michael Bevacqua, Assistant Professor of Chamorro Studies at the University of Guam, calls it a ‚Äúonce in a lifetime vote, and it is tied to righting a historical wrong. A decolonisation plebiscite is not supposed to be open to everyone, it‚Äôs supposed to be reserved for those who have been denied the right to determine their own destiny.‚Äù

Supporters of statehood say that Guam needs the United States in order to live the life they are accustomed to.  There would be too much uncertainty over the economy, the standard of living, and perhaps most worrying of all, the island of 161,700 people would no longer receive around $1.5 billion in federal aid and government programs.

Guam has a long history of colonization, beginning with centuries of Spanish rule, occupation by Japan in World War II for a three-year period, and has been ‚Äúowned‚Äù by the US since 1899.  The US military now occupies about 28 percent of Guam‚Äôs land. Its air and naval bases are among the most critical in the world, allowing access to the Straits of Taiwan and the South China Sea. Guam was the major launching pad for both the Vietnam and Korean wars. Recently, the military announced a massive expansion on the island.  It intends to move around 4,000 troops plus their families from the Japanese island of Okinawa to Guam, after mass demonstrations against the US presence there.

The military is an important part of the economy and culture in Guam. One in eight people living on the island are veterans, and residents serve at a rate that's three times higher than anywhere else in the United States. During the US wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, four of the Army‚Äôs top recruiters were from Guam, and enlistment on the island doubled while it was falling almost everywhere else in the nation, according to a PBS documentary.

While the plebiscite itself does not have any legal impact on the status of Guam, it would send an important message to the mainland on what direction the people of Guam wish to go, and clarify the future role of the military on the island.  

The Stream discusses Guam‚Äôs options and how its choices could affect its relationship with the military.

Icebreaker:

-What do you love about pledge drive?
-Does anything make you nervous when you prepare for another pledge drive?
-Do you have any routines you do or recommend for people getting ready to go on air and pitch?
-Have you heard pledge pitches from people that have made you cringe? What about the pitches made you cringe?
-Can you remember a pitch which seemed to resonate with the audience, and what about it do you think worked?
-What advice can you give to volunteers who are anxious about asking for financial donations because they believe their audience does not have much to give? 
-How do you work with people who have had a lot of experience doing a pledge drive? Do you have any challenges getting your experienced hosts to practice pitching or try new ideas?

After winning a minimum of 12 games every year since 2012, the Denver Broncos & Peyton Manning were always close to a Lombardi Trophy but never could quite grasp it. After a crazy season, fueled by their defense, the Broncos found themselves in a defensive cage match with the Carolina Panthers. The Panthers looked formidable, led by dual threat and league MVP quarterback Cam Newton. But Broncos linebacker Von Miller put on a performance for the ages and help Denver secure their third Super Bowl victory in franchise history.

Raaf,"‚ÄúWhat is the practical application of your research?‚Äù This is a question frequently asked of particle physicists. In this talk, Fermilab scientist Dr. Jennifer Raaf presents a few practical medical applications that have been enabled by fundamental scientific research undertaken by Fermilab employees. In particular, this talk will focus on a novel ventilator called the Mechanical Ventilator Milano that was developed for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Fermilab employees, volunteering their time and working together with an international team of physicists, engineers, and medical doctors, were involved with many aspects of this device, from hardware design and testing to software development and approval by the US Food and Drug Administration for emergency use of this device during the pandemic.

Dr. Jennifer Raaf is a senior scientist and head of the DUNE Department in the Neutrino Division at Fermilab. Her research focuses on neutrino physics and searches for rare decays that are enabled by the very large size detectors and low-background environments that are required for neutrino experiments. She specializes in detector instrumentation, with a particular interest in liquid and gaseous argon time projection chambers.

In this talk, Fermilab scientist Dr. Jennifer Raaf presents a few practical medical applications that have been enabled by fundamental scientific research undertaken by Fermilab employees. In particular, this talk will focus on a novel ventilator called the Mechanical Ventilator Milano that was developed for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Fermilab employees, volunteering their time and working together with an international team of physicists, engineers, and medical doctors, were involved with many aspects of this device, from hardware design and testing to software development and approval by the US Food and Drug Administration for emergency use of this device during the pandemic.

Dr. Jennifer Raaf is a senior scientist and head of the DUNE Department in the Neutrino Division at Fermilab. Her research focuses on neutrino physics and searches for rare decays that are enabled by the very large size detectors and low-background environments that are required for neutrino experiments. She specializes in detector instrumentation, with a particular interest in liquid and gaseous argon time projection chambers.

Pizza for breakfast, pizza for lunch, pizza for dinner, and it's taking a serious toll on his health. Josh's uncle, David, is desperate for someone to help. Can the experts help to break this dangerous addiction?
Freaky Eaters documents the intense struggles of those with a dangerous compulsion towards a particular food. With the help of two experts, the Freaky Eater confronts the painful truth behind their food obsession and fights to reclaim control of their diet and combat the destructive side effects their behaviour is having on their health. Patients include a girl who drinks more than 30 cans of cola a day, a 29-year-old mother who only eats French fries and a diabetic who has a life-threatening addiction to cheeseburger. Can they overcome their dependencies and learn how to manage their diets?

Five? 10? Imagine 50. By 2022, that will be the average in Canadian households. What will life look like? How will working, commuting, and other activities change in just a few short years? 

More importantly, are you ready?

In ‚ÄúRelentless Adaptation: 3 Steps to Thrive in 2017 and Beyond‚Äù, TV host and tech entrepreneur Amber Mac takes the audience on a journey, imagining how the rapid rate at which technology changes will affect us ‚Äî and how we need to maneuver in this fast-paced economy. From Artificial Intelligence to Social Media, Virtual Reality to the Internet of Things, the digital space is ever-evolving ‚Äî  and laying waste to those who can‚Äôt keep up. 

But there‚Äôs nothing to fear; Canada is an epicenter for technological research and development, so the future is bright ‚Äî  if we can keep pace with the rate of change. Adaptability, Amber argues, is the heart of survival. So how can businesses, professionals, and people avoid being a Blockbuster or a Kodak?  Amber walks through insightful and provocative anecdotes to teach us how to fight ‚ÄúDigital Darwinism‚Äù by channeling our frustration and discomfort to rethink our missions and adapt to the future ‚Äî  before it‚Äôs too late. 

Filmed at The Breakout Project, Kingston, ON in May 2017.

For all your music needs ‚ñ∫‚ñ∫ http://bit.ly/ClevverMusic 

The Beyonce method strikes again! Drake just dropped a surprise album out of nowhere and it is chuck full of new material.  
The album is titled -  If You‚Äôre Reading This It‚Äôs Too Late -  and like Beyonce‚Äôs self-titled album, there was little to no promotional activity before the surprise release aside from an ambiguous 14 minute  teaser video titled ‚ÄúJungle‚Äù in which Drake ponders about his life. 
The teaser prompted people to speculate that new music was coming but I don‚Äôt think anyone was expecting a surprise like this. 
In the Jungle teaser, lots of flashback footage is shown of Drake in his younger years back in his hometown of Toronto as well as in his LA acting days. It shows some of the struggles he endured growing up as well as in the midst of his fame and  gets rather introspective when Drake is heard saying QUOTE - ""trying to balance my own sanity...I'm f--king drinking more, I'm smoking more. We're out here staying up so late it's early...I'm not losing it, though. I'm just venting. I'm just more worried about myself. I just gotta come home.""
Now many of you Drake fans may remember that he did announce a new album titled Views From the 6 back in August but its unclear whether or not that could be a project he  is still working on or If Your Reading This Its Too Late is what Views From the 6 evolved into. Whichever way, we got new music. That‚Äôs really the biggest takeaway.
On a juicier note, many are pointing out the fact that Drake is not putting up any filters with these new rhymes including a dig that he throws at Tyga when he raps a line saying QUOTE ‚Äì ‚ÄúYour content so aggressive lately, what‚Äôs irking you? Sh-t is getting so personal in your verses, too/ I want to prove that I‚Äôm number one over all these n‚Äîas/ Being number two is just being the first to lose.‚Äù This of course is in response to the constant riff that has been going on between these two for quite some time now. 
You can hear and sip all the tea Drake is dishing on this album now on itunes. 
So what do you guys think of the album so far and do you think pulling a Beyonce was the right move for this album?

A man who helped pull three children from a sinking minivan said he tried to stop the mother from driving the vehicle in the into rough surf on a Florida beach, but she suddenly veered away and plowed into the water.

Stacy Robinson, a sophomore at Seminole State College in Sanford, Fla., said he and his girlfriend were sitting in their car at the beach in Daytona Beach, Fla., when they saw a woman, who police have identified as Ebony Wilkerson, 32, from Cross, S.C., driving a minivan partly in the rough surf.

""[My girlfriend] said what I thought was a joke and [I] was like, 'No, this is real', because after that her son came out the window, probably about waist high, screaming for help,"" Robinson said.

Lyrics

Please help me God, I feel so alone
I'm just a kid, I can't take it on my own
I've cried so many tears, yeah, writing this song
Trying to fit in. Where do I belong?
I wake up every day, don't wanna leave my home
My mamma's askin' me why I'm always alone
Too scared to say, too scared to holler
I'm walking to school with sweat around my collar
I'm just a kid, I don't want no stress
My nerves are bad, my life's a mess
The names you call me, they hurt real bad
I want to tell my Mom
She's havin' trouble with my Dad
I feel so trapped, there's nowhere to turn
Come to school
Don't wanna fight I wanna learn
So please mister Bully
Tell me what I've done
You know I have no Dad
I'm livin' with my Mom

'Cause I'm hopeful, yes, I am
Hopeful for today
Take this music and use it
Let it take you away
And be hopeful, hopeful
And He'll make a way
I know it ain't easy but that's okay
Just be hopeful

Why do you trip at the colour of my skin
And whether I'm fat or whether I'm thin
You call me loser, you call me a fool
I ain't got a choice, I gotta go to school
I wish I had an angel to stick by my side
I'm shaking with fear, I'm so scared inside
Doesn't really matter if I ain't got the looks
Why do you always hurt me and destroy my books?

'Cause I'm hopeful, yes, I am
Hopeful for today
Take this music and use it
Let it take you away
And be hopeful, hopeful
And He'll make a way
I know it ain't easy but that's okay
Just be hopeful

I give you all my money every single day
I didn't ask to be born but now I have to pay
I ain't got no food, you take all I have
When I give it to you, you search through my bags
I wrote this song for you to see
We could've been friends, yeah you and me
Mister bully, take a moment please
Every single day you bring me to my knees

'Cause I'm hopeful, yes, I am
Hopeful for today
Take this music and use it
Let it take you away
And be hopeful, hopeful
And He'll make a way
I know it ain't easy but that's okay

'Cause I'm hopeful, yes I am
Hopeful for today (Hopeful for today)
Take this music and use it (Bars and Melody!)
Let it take you away (Take you away)
And be hopeful, hopeful (Yeah)
And he'll make a wayI know it ain't easy but that's okay

I also clarify that metabolism isn't just about burning energy, it‚Äôs about converting energy from different sources into fuels for building and repairing our tissues such as muscle, brain, and tendons and mobilizing energy from body fat storage. I discuss the role of iodine, selenium, and salt for thyroid health, and how specific exercise protocols, amino acids and temperature can dramatically shift levels of growth hormone release in waking and in sleep. I also describe the current landscape of prescription compounds, peptides and other factors for changing levels of thyroid and growth hormone, and some of their risks. Throughout the episode, mechanism and tools grounded in specific mechanisms are discussed. Thank you for your interest in science!

How can you survive when the temperature outside gets up to 100¬∞F and you have no air conditioner at home? We have searched for simple and super effective ways to escape the sweltering heat that won‚Äôt cost you anything but will work their magic. 
The lowest temperature of the day is usually between 4 a.m. and 7 a.m., so open your windows in the morning and after 8 p.m. To prevent the sun‚Äôs heat from entering your house, it‚Äôs important to use the right curtains. In the past, before air conditioners existed, people used to wet their floors. The room temperature would drop immediately, and it would be comfortable enough to fall asleep. A great way to cool down your bed is to put your sheets and pillowcases in the fridge. Before you go to sleep, make your bed with them.

TIMESTAMPS
Close the windows in the morning.
How to choose the right curtains.
Throw away the carpets, rugs, and sofa pillows.
How to cool down a room with a wet towel and wet floor.
Use ceiling fans.
How to make a homemade air conditioner. 
Change your bed linen.
How to choose the perfect sleepwear.
Shut off the lights when not in use.
Know your cooling spots.
How to stay hydrated.
How to adjust the AC settings

SUMMARY
-Shut the windows when the temperature outside is higher than 75¬∞F, and open them when the temperature drops below that.
-Go for linen fabrics with light neutral colors. This type of cloth is made from eco-friendly materials. Moreover, it‚Äôs hypoallergenic and mold resistant.
-If you don‚Äôt want that heat to stay inside your home, it‚Äôs better to get rid of things that collect dust: carpets, rugs, and sofa pillows. This will make the air cleaner and cooler.
-When airing your room, wet a towel, and hang it in front of an open window. It will help to cool down your home quickly.
-Ceiling fans are cheap, maximizing space and cooling down a room pretty well. If you have this type of fan, make sure that the switch is set to summer mode.
-Freeze a few bottles or other containers with water, and place them in front of a fan. Cool air will be blown all over the room.
-If your bed linen is made of satin or synthetics, it‚Äôs better to replace it with cotton or silk sheets. Cotton sheets absorb sweat well and cool down the skin. Another way to cool down your bed is to put your sheets and pillowcases in the fridge.
-Wear pajamas made of cotton as they breathe better. Or sleep without clothes on.
-Opt for compact fluorescents and LEDs over incandescent light bulbs. It‚Äôs better to stick with LED lighting because it has a longer lifespan. 
-Grab an ice pack or cold compress. If you don‚Äôt have these, wet a bandana, or wrap an ice cube in a cloth. Place it over the pulse points of your elbows, wrists, groin, neck, and ankles. 
-According to the American Heart Association, dehydration is a serious condition that can lead to problems ranging from swollen feet or headaches to life-threatening illnesses like heat stroke.
-Many air conditioners have a function for temperature retention or night mode. In this mode, an air conditioner turns on and off, maintaining a steady temperature in the room.

--

A mother and son trek across an endless desert. Wearing special suits to dissipate heat and recycle moisture, the travelers aren‚Äôt worried about dying of thirst. Their fears are much greater. Soon, the sound of the desert is drowned out by a hissing: a mound of sand 400 meters long bursts from the desert floor and races towards them. This is the world of ‚ÄúDune.‚Äù Dan Kwartler dives into the epic story.

Politics and accountability anchor Libby Casey interviews thirty-six colleagues about their work, including political reporters assigned to cover the campaign, the Washington Post‚Äôs director of polling, and The Washington Post Fact Checker. They talk about the challenges facing President-elect Joe Biden to unite and run the country, questions surrounding the future of both the Democratic and Republican parties, and the need for Vice President-elect Kamala Harris to show Americans what she offers to the electorate. 

The Washington Post journalists also focus on President Donald Trump and his continued role defining the Republican Party, even after he leaves office on January 20th, 2021. The journalists share their goals going forward, including closely covering Hispanic and Asian voter registration, and why the ‚Äúyouthquake‚Äù predicted by Bernie Sanders didn‚Äôt turn out at the polls. They also discuss their concerns about misinformation and the country‚Äôs divisions. The team digs into polling and discusses how it should be used in political coverage. Libby Casey also asks how the reporters did their jobs amid the coronavirus pandemic, which restricted travel and meeting with voters. 

Featuring: Dan Balz, Philip Rucker, Eugene Scott, Arelis Hern√°ndez, Amber Phillips, Cleve Wootson, David Weigel, Jacqueline Alemany, JM Rieger, Michael Scherer, Robert Costa, Tom Hamburger, Martine Powers, Lenny Bronner, Emma Brown, Scott Clement, Rhonda Colvin, Matt Viser, Karen Tumulty, David Fahrenthold, Glenn Kessler, Michelle Ye Hee Lee, Jose Del Real, Joyce Koh, Chelsea Janes, Vanessa Williams, Amy Gardner, Aaron Blake, Caroline Kitchener, Jeremy Bowers, Colby Itkowitz, Philip Bump, James Hohmann, Annie Linskey, Ashley Parker, and Amy Wang.

His research uses ethnography, interviews, historical case studies, and literary analysis (and whatever other tools are lying around) to understand users and their worlds. Alex started his career studying people, technologies, and the worlds they make.

lyrics:
I do not pretend to know everything I'm talking bout
but i know I'm sick like you get if you eat coffee grounds
illest in the mid west, but my rap is underground
don't know what you heard but some people like to talk about
What I'm doing how i do it what i use to get around
if you didn't get it then i don't know how you'll get it now
cash money stardom, that is not what I'm about
but if you wanna rap battle i will chase you out of town
get up on my level man its easy jesus put me there
I'm not flashy cause my light shines bright so people stop and stare
they say that I'm different thats okay cause i got time to spare
talking to em seeing how they're doing cause i got to care
God has changed my heart my life my soul and my eternity
got a heart for hip hop rap is how he burdened me
being something that I'm not has always been absurd to me
look inside yourself, God is asking ""have you heard of me?""
you probably don't know this, even if you're a close friend to me
but for a long time i struggled with identity
who was what i was doing, and who was i supposed to be
collar flat or popped don't matter it was choking me
do i run with this crowd or hang with this posse
do i let these dudes lift me up what if they drop me
i always liked hip hop, rappin and rhymin
thought i went hard in the paint like blake griffin drivin
but I'm a light skinned white kid, aint no place for me
the rap game chain gang man it aint my place to be
but growing up i wore shirts that were 2 sizes to big
and my jeans sagged bad i was the silliest kid
from a small town in the mid west
whodda known that i been blessed
with this rap gift thats in my chest
i take the grace and leave the rest
I'm not saying ill be the best
i aint got time to be distressed
I take the first 10 out of my checks
give it back to the one who gave me breath
my witness is my lifestyle i wear the cross with pride
a caddy or toyota it don't matter what you ride
got that smart phone with that bible app its always on my side
so no matter where I'm at i got the word of jesus christ
word of God and it can't flop
it aint a crutch so stand up
house built on that same rock
he's faithful whether i am or not
reach flame on my tank top
spreading the word i can't stop
demons try to jack me up i need that belt of truth or my pants drop
I'm naked and exposed
no swiss on my wrist and my necks cold
play the cards you're dealt
better get a poker face cause i can't fold
hell is hot so i stay froze
when i get to heaven got bank rolls
can't hang with those fake bros
cause all your works can't save souls
He is the rock on which i stand
call me a jesus freak which i am
that soul healing music is still my jam
i been rocking these Beats before Will.I.Am
I'm tanked up swagged out
fist pump like paqiao
yeah i may be crazy

per boundingintocomics - A new set of documents presented by Johnny Depp and his legal team allege that Amber Heard lied about donating the entirety of her $7 million divorce settlement to charity, choosing to pocket most of the money instead. According to documents obtained by the Daily Mail, Heard has only verifiably donated just $100,000 to the Children‚Äôs Hospital Los Angeles, one of two charitable organizations, alongside the American Civil Liberties Union, that the Aquaman star had vowed to donate her settlement to.

The innovation engine: A look inside EMC‚Äôs Emerging Technologies Division | #emcworld

by Amber Johnson | May 4, 2016

Within every company lives the driving edge of its future product line. For EMC, this division is called the Emerging Technologies Division (ETD). Sam Grocott, SVP of marketing and product management at EMC‚Äôs ETD, explained that his division is mostly comprised of 1.0 or 2.0 products, with the exception of the Isilon Business Unit, which is on its 8th generation.

Grocott explained that ETD exists within EMC to orchestrate the opportunity for two things: innovation and growth. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what we are judged on; it‚Äôs what we are measured against,‚Äù he said. Grocott sat down with John Furrier (@furrier) and Dave Vellante (@dvellante), cohosts of theCUBE, from SiliconANGLE Media team, during EMC World 2016 in Las Vegas.

Grocott mentioned EMC‚Äôs DSSD products, ScaleIO, Elastic Cloud Storage (ECS), ViPR, and the new VCE VxRack System 1000 with Neutrino Nodes (announced May 3) as part of ETD‚Äôs enterprise product repertoire. He also called ETD‚Äôs product line ‚Äúa family of four products‚Äù: ViPR Controller, ECS software-defined object storage system, ScaleIO software-defined block storage system, and IsilonSD Edge.

Making ViPR simpler

When asked about ViPR‚Äôs initial release, Grocott stated, ‚ÄúWe confused the market,‚Äù but ‚Äúwe heard the feedback from customers. ‚Ä¶ We tried to glom too much into the ViPR system, so what we decided to do was make it simpler.‚Äù ETD focused ViPR on the ‚Äúcontroller aspect‚Äù and open-sourced the core IP in Project CoprHD (copperhead).

EMC announced on May 2 it would release ViPR 3.0, which will feature all of Copperhead‚Äôs ‚Äúup to 50 different arrays of storage,‚Äù according to Grocott. Thus, ETD has worked toward ‚Äúa truly heterogeneous environment.‚Äù Grocott remarked that ‚Äúsimplification, automation, ease of use‚Äù is ‚Äúabsolutely what ViPR is focused on.‚Äù",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_QkuPTo2gEE/default.jpg,120,90,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_QkuPTo2gEE/mqdefault.jpg,320,180,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_QkuPTo2gEE/hqdefault.jpg,480,360,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_QkuPTo2gEE/sddefault.jpg,640.0,480.0,SiliconANGLE theCUBE,28,none,"Sam Grocott, EMC | EMC World 2016","Enhanced video at http://vinja.tv/qNDpZxW5
