Whereas, the once-famous actress is having a difficult time coping and contacting many of the Hollywood stars including one of her close friends Jason Momoa. Yes, mate it is what it is...

The Aquaman star, Jason eventually opened up on his relationship with Amber Heard and what he feels about her. Well, we all know how fun and interesting the kind of a guy Jason Momoa is. Jason is everyone's favourite (laughing)

Adding on a valuable tip for you, try to stay calm and patient around him, Jason really can't see anyone sitting calm, he's a real attention seeker. If the word ""attention seeker"" is given to someone ever in the future, I would request the officials to kindly give it to Jason Momoa. , 

Well as I already mentioned, Jason would never attempt any prank that can harm a person in any way. We must just agree that we adore and love him a lot. And on the other hand, Jason never forgets to charm ladies, with his hot looks and of course beautiful smile. Who called him Jason Momoa and not Jason the charmer? (laughing)
Speaking about Jason Momoa's and Amber Heard's bond, they really get along well together, but as you all know things never stay the same. Jason's and Amber's friendship bond was affected after Jason decided to play a master prank on Amber Heard.

Once while shooting for Aquaman, the charming yet playful Star  Jason Momoa, played a sick prank on Amber heard. Well, what he did was truly sad and tragic. It's like you have made a sandhill and out of nowhere a random person comes and destroys your sandhill. Did you feel that pain now?

Well, Jason didn't ruin Amber Heard's Sandhill (laughs jokingly) but did something the same that left Amber Heard sad all day long. Let me break this down for you, The Game of Thrones star, intentionally in the name of prank, tore the last ten pages of Amber Heard books that she regularly used to read in between shots and takes... Like, yes!!!

Shockingly Jason did that, I don't know why that doesn't sound like a Big deal to him, but it is...And guess what? Amber's a bookworm (oops Jason, you shouldn't have done that) But what's done is done (laughing nervously) We feel you, Amber!!

Amber Heard shared all the incident, where Jason went to keep her attention on set, she confessed, "" I love Jason we had so much fun together but he is allergic to being ignored and I'm a bookworm who loves to read the books, he adopted this method of ripping out the pages of my book so I would pay attention to him"". Poor Amber...

Whereas, the crew staff was helpful to Amber Heard, due to Jason's book ripping pranks the crew on the set of Aquaman designed a book bag out of green screen material so that Amber could carry her books on set with her and read between takes.

""I would feel so bad if someone was going out of  their way to throw her book to her but they could tell I was going crazy so the wardrobe built me a book bag"" Amber stated in the interview with Good Morning America...""

Delving into the history, Amber Heard's personal life problem which is no more limited to her speaks a lot about her behaviour and the kind of a person she is. As we all know that Amber Heard and Johnny Depp are hooked into the legal drama, things seem to slip out of Dear Amber's hand. 

Talking about the legal drama, the case eventually took a u-turn resulting in a case favouring Johnny Depp. The recent leaked audio call and bodycam footage revealed the true colours of Aquaman star Amber Heard. Accepting the fact that Johnny Depp was never the abuser it was Amber Heard who physically abused Johnny Depp celebrity news clevver news entertainment news information overload inform overload johnny depp appeal amber heard aquaman 2 informoverload amber heard petition

However, the Warner brothers never reacted to the demand of fans, asking to kick out Amber Heard from the Aquaman 2, while they had already kicked Johnny out of 'the pirates of Caribbean series. 

Johnny Depp fans tweeted in his favour and asked that Heard should be fired from Aquaman 2. While one of Johnny's fans tweeted writing "" I don't understand why Warner brothers fired Johnny Depp but not Amber Heard, they both have evidence of being abused by each other, and abusive women are rarely held to the same standard as abusive men"".

I'm passionate about this as she is taking the attention away and making it more difficult for real domestic violence victims to speak out, especially when all she is teaching them is to drop the claim and demand money. 

This is really to provide Amber Heard supporters with the facts and court documents, as they do not seem to be well known to her fans.

Amber Heard domestic violence arrest unearthed: Actress 'struck girlfriend in argument'

Amber Heard was once arrested for domestic violence against her then-girlfriend, it has emerged.

The actress is currently involved in drama surrounding ex-husband Johnny Depp, who she alleges was abusive towards her during their 18 month marriage.

In images obtained by TMZ, Amber was seen with a bruised eye, which she claims was the result of Depp throwing an iPhone at her face.

The 30-year-old was granted a restraining order against Johnny following the allegations.

However, in a bizarre twist, it has now been revealed that Amber herself was once booked for a domestic violence charge.

TMZ have unearthed documents which state that Amber was arrested and booked for misdemeanour domestic violence after a fight with then-girlfriend Tasya van Ree.

According to the documents, the couple were at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport on September 14, 2009 when they began to argue.

In today's video, we are going to be discussing Johnny Depp and amber heard's situation in regards to Johnny Depp's reaction to amber heard's court case. 

If you‚Äôve been following the Johnny Depp and Amber Heard domestic abuse allegations since the story first broke in U.K. News Group Newspaper publication, The Sun, you undoubtedly already know that the situation seems to grow more contentious by the week. Most recently, after Pirates of the Caribbean actor Depp lost his right to appeal his libel case loss in London, Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) bodycam footage surfaced that seemingly indicated Heard might not have been entirely truthful in some of her domestic violence claims. The footage, which was from a 2016 incident in Mr. Depp and Ms. Heard‚Äôs downtown Los Angeles penthouse apartment, showed that the residence was not, in fact, in disarray, as the Aquaman actress had claimed.

As for Heard, she is currently set to reprise her role as Mera in Warner Bros. Aquaman 2. Depp was fired by Warner Bros. and has been replaced by Mads Mikkelsen as Gellert Grindelwald in the Fantastic Beasts franchise.

Did Amber really stoop so low that she stole another woman's survivor story and used it as her own.

Read More Stories Here: www.haveitalldaily.com 

Description:

If you have followed the famous Johnny Depp Amber Heard and The Sun UK ‚Äúwife beater‚Äù case, one thing is for sure, there was physical altercation from both sides while the couple was in a relationship. 
What is attack and what is defense was subjective and the only person who had a say on this was the London high court judge, but what happened after that? 

One of the most unethical workplace, yes you guessed it right, Hollywood, that has continued for years with people like Harvey Weinstein, Kevin Spacey, people with past drug dealing history, a place for casting couch and misogyny has decided to play the moral police. 
Johnny Depp is losing projects after project and on the other side Amber Heard is using this opportunity to mint money. 

One more interesting fact is that the fan following of Johnny is increasing every day and yes we don‚Äôt mean fans who appreciated his acting, that has already been huge, but these are the fans who really feel Johnny is getting an unfair treatment. On the other side Amber Heard is getting equal amount of hate. 

But it seems, she knows this is an opportunity and she is busy making the most of it, she is giving lectures on domestic violence, may be because she survived it and wants to change the world to be a better place, yeah only after charging $ 33000. 

Here is the quote from the source article: 

Out of everything you might think Amber Heard has lost, it is undoubtedly not work. The actor holds her ground in all her projects regardless of the massive hatred she is subjected to by the online users. While she still stands strong and continues to get on board for more movies, the latest reports tell us that she has unlocked one more money-minting avenue in her life. Heard has been roped by an agency to give talks on domestic violence and her remuneration for a single session is huge for just talking.

Now you might be wondering if there was a physical altercation from both sides, why is Amber Heard even being heard on domestic violence and paid hefty sums. Well it will take us back to where we started, attack and defense. 

On the other hand, same day you read about Johnny Depp being blocked from the project he made iconic. 

According to The Daily Mail UK, The entertainment conglomerate had distanced itself from the 57-year-old actor even before his 'wife beater' libel trial in the UK. 
Also the report says Disney 'balked' at executive producer Jerry Bruckheimer's idea of bringing back Depp for a cameo in the female-centric spin-off of the franchise, rumored to be led by Margot Robbie.

Now we don‚Äôt know what is true and what they are making up, but everything happening together and the contrast we see on how the two are dealt with makes me wonder if the new normal is court passing a judgment and big firms deciding how to punish and reward people.

Description:

If you have followed the famous Johnny Depp Amber Heard and The Sun UK ‚Äúwife beater‚Äù case, one thing is for sure, there was physical altercation from both sides while the couple was in a relationship. 
What is attack and what is defense was subjective and the only person who had a say on this was the London high court judge, but what happened after that? 

One of the most unethical workplace, yes you guessed it right, Hollywood, that has continued for years with people like Harvey Weinstein, Kevin Spacey, people with past drug dealing history, a place for casting couch and misogyny has decided to play the moral police. 
Johnny Depp is losing projects after project and on the other side Amber Heard is using this opportunity to mint money. 

One more interesting fact is that the fan following of Johnny is increasing every day and yes we don‚Äôt mean fans who appreciated his acting, that has already been huge, but these are the fans who really feel Johnny is getting an unfair treatment. On the other side Amber Heard is getting equal amount of hate. 

But it seems, she knows this is an opportunity and she is busy making the most of it, she is giving lectures on domestic violence, may be because she survived it and wants to change the world to be a better place, yeah only after charging $ 33000. 

Here is the quote from the source article: 

Out of everything you might think Amber Heard has lost, it is undoubtedly not work. The actor holds her ground in all her projects regardless of the massive hatred she is subjected to by the online users. While she still stands strong and continues to get on board for more movies, the latest reports tell us that she has unlocked one more money-minting avenue in her life. Heard has been roped by an agency to give talks on domestic violence and her remuneration for a single session is huge for just talking.

Now you might be wondering if there was a physical altercation from both sides, why is Amber Heard even being heard on domestic violence and paid hefty sums. Well it will take us back to where we started, attack and defense. 

On the other hand, same day you read about Johnny Depp being blocked from the project he made iconic. 

According to The Daily Mail UK, The entertainment conglomerate had distanced itself from the 57-year-old actor even before his 'wife beater' libel trial in the UK. 
Also the report says Disney 'balked' at executive producer Jerry Bruckheimer's idea of bringing back Depp for a cameo in the female-centric spin-off of the franchise, rumored to be led by Margot Robbie.

Now we don‚Äôt know what is true and what they are making up, but everything happening together and the contrast we see on how the two are dealt with makes me wonder if the new normal is court passing a judgment and big firms deciding how to punish and reward people. 

Specially Hollywood that has made money over years portraying that the character has done something wrong in front of the law, works through it, make changes, hustles and come out as a better and more successful person.  

What do you think? Has Hollywood lost the hope it has been selling for years.

The divorce of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp is now final, and one thing‚Äôs for sure: Heard didn‚Äôt get any money out of it.

She settled the divorce out of court for $7 million, all of which she has now donated to charitable causes. She‚Äôs splitting the sum between the American Civil Liberties Union‚Äôs efforts to battle violence against women and the Children‚Äôs Hospital of Los Angeles, where she‚Äôs volunteered for the past 10 years.

And in a joint statement, both Heard and Depp affirmed that ‚Äúneither party has made false accusations for financial gain.‚Äù

In other words: Heard is not a gold digger, and she did not accuse Depp of cutting off part of his finger and then using the stump to finger paint the words ‚ÄúEasy Amber‚Äù on a mirror because she thought that would be a cool quick way to make some cash.

It‚Äôs a shame Heard felt the need to be so emphatic about the fact that she isn‚Äôt lying about her domestic violence claims, but it‚Äôs not surprising. Ever since she first filed for a restraining order against Depp in May, Heard has done everything we say domestic abuse survivors should do. She went to the police. She provided copious documentation. She went above and beyond to prove she wasn‚Äôt in it for the money.
People still insisted she was lying.

After months of fighting, Amber Heard and Johnny Depp suddenly settled their divorce this week, with Heard donating all of the settlement money to charity.

Their relationship was a tabloid magazine‚Äôs dream: Hollywood A-lister falls in love with up-and-coming ingenue on set. Later, as allegations of abuse emerged, coverage of their relationship took a noticeably darker turn, with lurid reports ‚Äî and later video and photos ‚Äî of violent outbursts and alleged physical abuse.


Here‚Äôs a look back at Johnny and Amber‚Äôs tempestuous relationship.

Depp and Heard met on the set of ‚ÄúThe Rum Diary‚Äù with Depp playing a journalist obsessed with Heard‚Äôs character ‚Äî a woman engaged to another man.

Amber Heard says she has become a mom and did it ``on my own terms,'' as a single parent.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†
In an Instagram post, the actor said she welcomed daughter Oonagh Paige Heard on April 8. A photo of Heard with the baby nestled against her accompanied Thursday's (01JULY2021) announcement.
 ``I now appreciate how radical it is for us as women to think about one of the most fundamental parts of our destinies in this way,'' Heard said in the post. ``I hope we arrive at a point in which it's normalized to not want a ring in order to have a crib.''
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†
She wrote that ``a part of me wants to uphold that my private life is none of anyone's business,'' but added the nature of her job ``compels me to take control of this'' by revealing the birth.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†
``She's the beginning of the rest of my life,'' Heard said.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†
The actor has faced a tumultuous period of her life, with her 2015 to 2017 marriage to Johnny Depp involving a spate of legal actions. 
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†
Last year, Depp lost a libel case against a British newspaper that accused him of domestic violence, with a judge ruling the allegations were ``substantially correct.'' In March, a British court refused Depp permission to appeal the ruling that he assaulted Heard, saying his attempt to overturn the decision had ``no real prospect of success.''
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†
Depp also is suing Heard for $50 million in Virginia over a Washington Post op-ed essay that she wrote about domestic violence. The trial in that case was recently delayed until April 2022.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

Amber Heard has experienced her share of hardships in 2016, and while she finalizes her divorce from Johnny Depp, it seems she‚Äôs doing her best to heal‚Ä¶ And help others in the process. 

Amber wrote an open letter in Porter magazine, addressing domestic abuse. Although the actress has since dropped charges, she has accused Depp of physically and verbally abusing her throughout their relationship. 

Amber writes, ‚ÄúYou are not alone. You may have suffered alone behind closed doors, but you are not alone‚Ä¶ You need to know that. I want to remind you of your strength, a strength that has been multiplied by the number of women who stand silently behind you ‚Äì a truth hat allowed me to break down the doors I once found myself behind.‚Äù 

Amber has reportedly signed a divorce agreement that bounds her by confidentiality, but her fans can certainly read between the lines. 

She says she once ‚Äúresented the label of ‚Äòvictim,‚Äô‚Äù but is now hoping that she can help other women seek help and be safe if they need it.

Delves into Julian Assange, Jennifer Robinson, progressives and the alt-right, artificial intelligence, Russia voting interference, #ElonMusk, United Nations, and Aquaman 2 with humanitarian and women‚Äôs rights activist Amber Heard caught in a crossfire masked by domestic violence and hate online.

Summarizes how Amber Heard won in the NGN case showing 12 brutal assaults against her and fearing for her life, yet online bots bury her to snuff out her voice.

.... Why would 2 years ago, an alleged romantic partner of ex-staff of Depp send a photo of missing Anthony Fox - going to testify against Johnny Depp - state Amber was kicked multiple times, that they are threatened with death, & do so under a locked account?
 
Why would Reporters - including Rachel Abrams of the New York Times attacked by faceless-bot like Adam Waldman account - never write a story? Rachel Abrams was involved with Cambridge Analytica reporting according to TheGeekBuzz.com

Why do social platforms ignore stopping threats against #AmberHeard, her witnesses, & supporters, as if 'fake jack sparrow' of 2019 at Facebook AI/ML training was self-fulfilling prophecy?
Why does AnonymousWordwide.com never post edited audio of #RoseMcGowan, who said agents were used to stop reporters from reporting on Weinstein and Twitter locked her account in 2017? ""Bots are agents.""

According to People magazine the images were taken after an incident in December 2015 
New shocking images of abuse Amber Heard allegedly suffered at the hands of Johnny Depp have emerged.

The 30-year-old actress can be seen with multiple bruises on her face and cut lip, in pictures allegedly taken after an incident last December, according to People magazine.

The argument was referenced in court documents filed last Friday accusing Johnny Depp of domestic abuse, Amber stated ""there was one severe incident in December 2015 when I truly feared for my life.""
Johnny Depp denies all of the allegations.

It follows the actress' statement on Tuesday, which stated she had suffered abuse from her husband throughout their 15 month marriage: ""Amber has suffered through years of physical and psychological abuse at the hands of Johnny.
In domestic violence cases, it is not unusual for the perpetrator's playbook to include miscasting the victim as the villain.

Unfortunately that's the world we live in when the abuser can claim to be the victim and the victim is dragged through the dirt because of their gender.

We Support Amber Heard and Melissa Benoist. They are Not Bulletproof! They are crime victims of domestic abuse. Our petition was shortly edited and emailed to DC/Warner Brothers before Melissa came out about domestic abuse! SIGN THE PETITION to SUPPORT AMBER HEARD in Aquaman 2: https://www.change.org/p/amber-heard-supporters-we-support-amber-heard-in-aquaman-2

The Geek Buzz shows that Melissa, Supergirl of the CW/WB, defended herself against abuse, and we are happy she has support: https://www.thegeekbuzz.com/news/supergirl-star-melissa-benoist-survivor-domestic-violence/

Amber Heard was one of the first or only people to state she was domestically abused as the larger victim. Amber dealt with the mobs against her, and likely because of that, Melissa is able to come forward even if there were two-way fights. 
 
We stand with Melissa and We stand with Amber... They're NOT bulletproof. 

""With these pajamas and hair, it must mean I'm 'bulletproof'"" - Amber Heard in IG video: https://twitter.com/AmberHeardIT/status/1203988651820101632?s=20
While looking tired, she's getting up from her bed, similar to her experiences... She's not actually bulletproof and frequently people will put in metaphors and hidden messages on their social media, because they're unable to be public today. 

This photo with a pillow is interesting, since it escalated in the fights to her waking up to a bloody pillow which was seen by IO Tillett: https://www.instagram.com/p/B6EHDuthyjF

Will you be the change?

""Life is not always what it seems."" - Melissa Benoist...

We also refer to Amber's charity & activism. It's olympic about how many nonprofits Amber is involved with and many who did not have public support.

There's also an article that maybe Mera of Aquaman will get a Spin-Off movie. We hope that is true....  https://www.thegeekbuzz.com/news/amber-heard-reportedly-getting-her-own-mera-spinoff-movie/

To prevent domestic abuse - GET INVOLVED! Believe early, let them escape early. 
We were told to not screenshot a partner of ex-JD staff's tweets and messages, but we DID. We were also told to not create a petition, but we DID.  They supported Amber and said she was kicked, hit, and crying. They were on NDAs and stopped interfering: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Gy4Pw8yoPVsY3T2VZs_ZQp_9_-FMYwIE and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2qFCFd-5C8

Jane Doe said in those screenshots: ""celebrities hiding bruises while going to events is common..."" ""Sad, but true.""

If you don't support victims now, then the agenda to silence them will continue. 
Duty To Rescue and Duty to Care...

We also got the database fixed for the article on Amber's friend calling 911 for her after seeing her injuries and that she woke up to a bloody pillow before on a previous day. (Unhealthy database error): https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2016/06/113149/domestic-violence-911-call-famous-friend

On May 23, 2016, Heard filed for divorce from Depp and also obtained a temporary restraining order against the Oscar-nominated actor. She alleged that Depp had physically abused her during their relationship, and said it was usually while under the influence of drugs or alcohol.

She alleged that at the time of filing for divorce, an incident had recently taken place in which Depp threw his phone at her, leaving her with a bruised face. However, a police spokesman told People that an investigation into the domestic incident radio call found that no crime had taken place.

Depp denied these accusations and through his representatives said Heard was ""attempting to secure a premature financial resolution by alleging abuse.""

A $7 million settlement was reached out of court on August 16, 2016
Heard testified under oath at a deposition, but a settlement was eventually reached after she withdrew her request for a domestic violence restraining order. She also rescinded her spousal support request of $50,000 a month.

Depp and Heard also released a joint statement, saying: ""Our relationship was intensely passionate and at times volatile, but always bound by love. Neither party has made false accusations for financial gain.""

It continued: ""There was never any intent of physical or emotional harm.""

Heard received $7 million from the divorce but donated it to charity, according to People.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

A brand new picture has emerged with Johnny Depp with a black eye after their were reports of alleged punch from Amber.

The Blast has actually acquired the outrageous photos which reveal the star with a substantial swelling under his left eye ‚Äî-- photo proof supposedly being utilized in his libel suit against her.

It‚Äôs likewise reported that in his continuous libel suit with The Sun, the 55-year-old declared the actress punched him two times in the face on April 21, 2016.

Allegedly, when Depp returned to the house ‚Äî-- after he was apparently late for Heard‚Äôs 30th birthday supper ‚Äî-- it was reported that Amber was upset and started slamming him. While he read in bed, Heard supposedly ended up being ""violent and aggressive, punching him two times in the face.‚Äù

He stated the next day, a staff member of his took the snap in concern.

During the couple‚Äôs court case, Depp‚Äôs guard, Starling Jenkins, affirmed that he did not witness the declared April 21, 2016 attack. Obviously, his shift ended at 11:00 p.m., when Depp had actually not yet returned to the house. According to The Blast, ‚Äúhe declared he returned the next day to take Heard and her friends to Coachella,‚Äù ‚Äù and stated:

‚ÄúWhen I entered the residence, Amber explained to me that she had thrown Johnny‚Äôs cell phone ‚Äî and the wallet containing it ‚Äî off the balcony the night before.‚Äù

When Depp made an abuse accusation against Heard in 2015, one of her lawyers informed People that the ‚Äúallegations are absolutely incorrect.‚Äù

Johnny Depp submitted a $50 million defamation suit against ex-wfe, Amber Heard.

Last year, the Pirates of the Caribbean thespian took legal action against the U.K. tabloid for their April 2018 story, headlined ‚ÄúHow can J.K. Rowling be ‚Äògenuinely happy‚Äô casting wife-beater Johnny Depp in the new Fantastic Beasts film?‚Äù which relied on a supposed May 21, 2016 quarrel where Heard blamed Depp of tossing a phone at her face, and after that punching her. (This allegation was denied by Depp)

Earlier this month,Johnny submitted a $50 million libel lawsuit against Amber and her abuse accusations.

The lawsuit referred to a short article that Heard penned for The Washington Post in December 2018, in which she described herself as ‚Äúa public figure representing domestic abuse.‚Äù The actress likewise claimed that she was threatened with death and also lost job offers after stepping forward with her story.

She wrote:

‚ÄúFriends and advisers told me I would never again work as an actress ‚Äî that I would be blacklisted. A movie I was attached to recast my role. I had just shot a two-year campaign as the face of a global fashion brand, and the company dropped me. Questions arose as to whether I would be able to keep my role of Mera in the movies Justice League and Aquaman. I had the rare vantage point of seeing, in real time, how institutions protect men accused of abuse.‚Äù

Although Depp was not mentioned in the op-ed, he assert the whole story ‚Äúdepends on the central premise that Ms. Heard was a domestic abuse victim and that Mr. Depp perpetrated domestic violence against her.‚Äù

He likewise stated that Heard‚Äôs abuse accusations were ‚Äúconclusively refuted by 2 different responding law enforcement officers, a list of neutral third-party witnesses, and 87 freshly acquired monitoring camera videos.‚Äù

All of the brand-new reporting has actually led to ‚ÄúJohnny Depp‚Äù being a leading trending name on Twitter on Tuesday, with lots of users tweeting regret over a rush to cancel and condemn him:

As the libel trial between Mr Depp and the Sun newspaper publisher entered its third week, Ms Heard told the court it was like being married to two people as Mr Depp transitioned from a man she loved into a 'monster' over the course of their two-year marriage. 

Ms Heard claimed she was the victim of physical and verbal abuse and was subject to controlling and intimidating behaviour by Mr Depp. 

When questioned on her drug and alcohol use, Ms Heard insisted it was not excessive and she never used cocaine while with Depp, which his lawyers rubbished as a lie. 

Mr Depp has denied all allegations of assault, claiming instead that he was the victim of domestic abuse during his relationship with Ms Heard. 

The court also heard Mr Depp accused Ms Heard of having multiple affairs with other actors, including Leonardo DiCaprio whom he called a ‚Äúpumpkinhead‚Äù.

(AP Photo/Joel Ryan, File) 
Actress Amber Heard asked a judge Thursday to dismiss a $50 million defamation lawsuit her ex-husband Johnny Depp filed over an op-ed about domestic violence she wrote in The Washington Post. 
In the motion filed in the Circuit Court of Fairfax, Virginia, Heard reiterates her allegations that Depp abused her before and during their marriage and includes exhibits such as photos of her with bruises on her face and scars on her arms, images of damage she says Depp did to their home, screenshots of text messages describing the incidents at the time, and excerpts of her divorce deposition describing domestic abuse. 
PROSECUTORS DECLINE TO CHARGE MICHAEL AVENATTI ON ABUSE CLAIM: REPORT 
""Johnny Depp physically and verbally abused Amber Heard,"" her attorney Eric George said in a statement. ""Since their divorce, Mr. Depp has continued to publically harass Ms. Heard, and attempted to gaslight the world by denying his abuse. It is long past time for Mr. Depp's despicable conduct to end."" 
Depp's lawsuit, filed last month, called the ongoing allegations of domestic abuse ""categorically and demonstrably false."" 
""They were part of an elaborate hoax to generate positive publicity for Ms. Heard and advance her career,"" the lawsuit states, claiming that ""she is the perpetrator."" 
Depp's attorney, Adam Waldman, said he was reviewing the new filing. He said previously that he and Depp looked forward to providing evidence that would clear Depp's name. 
The Post piece by Heard, published in December, does not mention Depp by name or describe any incidents, but it discusses the societal plight of those who speak up about domestic abuse. 
""I spoke up against sexual violence ‚Äî and faced our culture's wrath,"" the 32-year-old actress wrote, adding that she felt as though she was ""on trial in the court of public opinion."" 
But Depp's lawsuit says it was clear Heard was talking about him, and that it worsened the damage the allegations had already done to his career. 
The lawsuit states Depp, 55, has suffered financial losses because of the accusations, including being dropped from his role as Capt. Jack Sparrow in the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" films. 
Heard's lawyers also argued that the lawsuit should be moved to Los Angeles because that's where the relevant events took place. 
Heard first accused Depp of domestic violence in May 2016, the year after they were married. They were divorced in 2017.

1. Johny wanted quick dissolution of his marriage because of Amber‚Äôs lies about his personal life. On May 26, 2015, his representative stated:

""Given the brevity of this #marriage and the most recent and tragic loss of his mother, #johnny will not respond to any of the salacious false stories, gossip, misinformation, and lies about his personal life. Hopefully, the dissolution of this short marriage will be resolved quickly.""

2.Amber alleged Depp of domestic violence and the court granted her restraining order against Johny.  On May 26, 2015, Amber was seen with bruised face coming out of the court. 
The sources told the news channels it was not the first time Johny had hit his wife. It was only the latest incident. 

3.Venessa Patridge pens a note denying Amber‚Äôs domestic violence allegations against Johny and comes to his defense. 

""I believe with all my heart that these recent allegations being made are outrageous,"" claiming, ""In all the years I have known Johnny, he has never been physically abusive with me and this looks nothing like the man I lived with for 14 wonderful years."" Likewise, Lily took to Instagram and shared a childhood photo of her and her dad, along with a note that read, ""My dad is the sweetest, most loving person I know, he's been nothing but a wonderful father to my little brother and I, and everyone who knows him would say the same.""

4.Comedian Doug Stanhope claimed that Amber is blackmailing Depp. 

""Amber was now going to leave him, threatening to lie about him publicly in any and every possible duplicitous way if he didn't agree to her terms,"" he said. ""Blackmail is what I would imagine other people might put it, including the manner in which he is now being vilified.""

5.Amber's lawyer slams Doug Stanphone‚Äôs blackmail accusations.

""[The] allegations against Ms. Heard are absolutely and unequivocally false,"" adding that the claim she's blackmailing Johnny ""has no basis in reality and is nothing but the typical celebrity muckraking for profit.""

6.At the request of Amber‚Äôs attorney Police are called to Amber and Johnny's home. But both of them were not present.

Officer Tony Im of the Los Angeles Police Department told the media that the officers simply stood by to ""ensure that only the items listed in the court order were being removed.""

7.Amber withdraws her petition for spousal support back from the court.

Amber, who previously wanted $50,000 per month from the Johny Depp, says the request is being ""used against me to distract and divert the public away from the very serious real issue of domestic violence.""

8.Johnny Depp requests the court and media to leave the matter out of the public eye. He files a request to keep divorce details private.

His attorney, Laura Wasser, argued that although Amber has the right to have knowledge about his finances, the media does not. ""Johnny is merely trying to protect the documents and information Amber seeks from unwarranted disclosure to the media and other individuals not involved in the case,"" her statement in the official documents.

9.Amber Heard accuses John Depp of stalling their divorce.

""[Depp] and his counsel's demand for the execution of these two non-disclosure agreements which impose undue financial hardships and burdens on [Heard] are nothing but blatant threats by [Depp] and are illustrative of his continued attempts to thwart real progress in this case,"" they read.

10. #johnnydepp and #amberheard  settle their divorce.

""Our relationship was intensely passionate and at times volatile, but always bound by love,"" the two said in a joint statement to TMZ on Aug. 16. ""Neither party has made false accusations for financial gains. There was never any intent of physical or emotional harm.""


Amber donates her $7 million divorce settlement to charity.

Johnny refuses to finalize the divorce and donate the settlement.

""Pirates of the Caribbean"" sued Amber Heard for libel when he accused him of domestic violence, and asked beauty ""Aquaman"" to compensate $ 50 million.

Johnny Depp and Amber Heard's 2016 divorce is still interested in public opinion. Their relationship continues to be strained when Pirates of the Caribbean have filed a lawsuit against their ex-wife for libel, claiming up to $ 50 million.

Depp made his debut in the horror film A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984), before rising to prominence as a teen idol on the television series 21 Jump Street (1987‚Äì1990). In the 1990s, Depp acted mostly in independent films, often playing eccentric characters. These included What's Eating Gilbert Grape (1993), Benny and Joon (1993), Dead Man (1995), Donnie Brasco (1997) and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998). Depp also began collaborating with director Tim Burton, starring in Edward Scissorhands (1990), Ed Wood (1994) and Sleepy Hollow (1999).

In the 2000s, Depp became one of the most commercially successful film stars by playing Captain Jack Sparrow in the swashbuckler film series Pirates of the Caribbean (2003‚Äìpresent). He received critical praise for Finding Neverland (2004), and continued his commercially successful collaboration with Tim Burton with the films Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005), Corpse Bride (2005), Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007), and Alice in Wonderland (2010). In 2012, Depp was one of the world's biggest film stars,[1][2] and was listed by the Guinness World Records as the world's highest-paid actor, with earnings of US$75 million.[3] During the 2010s, Depp began producing films through his company, Infinitum Nihil, and formed the rock supergroup Hollywood Vampires with Alice Cooper and Joe Perry.

Depp was married to actress Amber Heard from 2015 to 2017. Their divorce drew media attention as she alleged that he had been abusive throughout their relationship. Depp sued Heard for defamation in 2019 after she wrote an op-ed discussing being a public victim of domestic violence. He also sued the publishers of The Sun in a related libel suit in England. In 2020, the High Court of Justice of England and Wales ruled that Depp had lost his libel case and that the majority of Heard's allegations had been proven to a civil standard, although in 2021, a Virginia judge ruled that Depp may sue Heard, who was not a defendant in the libel case.

Depp made his debut in the horror film A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984), before rising to prominence as a teen idol on the television series 21 Jump Street (1987‚Äì1990). In the 1990s, Depp acted mostly in independent films, often playing eccentric characters. These included What's Eating Gilbert Grape (1993), Benny and Joon (1993), Dead Man (1995), Donnie Brasco (1997) and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998). Depp also began collaborating with director Tim Burton, starring in Edward Scissorhands (1990), Ed Wood (1994) and Sleepy Hollow (1999).

In the 2000s, Depp became one of the most commercially successful film stars by playing Captain Jack Sparrow in the swashbuckler film series Pirates of the Caribbean (2003‚Äìpresent). He received critical praise for Finding Neverland (2004), and continued his commercially successful collaboration with Tim Burton with the films Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005), Corpse Bride (2005), Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007), and Alice in Wonderland (2010). In 2012, Depp was one of the world's biggest film stars,[1][2] and was listed by the Guinness World Records as the world's highest-paid actor, with earnings of US$75 million.[3] During the 2010s, Depp began producing films through his company, Infinitum Nihil, and formed the rock supergroup Hollywood Vampires with Alice Cooper and Joe Perry.

Depp was married to actress Amber Heard from 2015 to 2017. Their divorce drew media attention as she alleged that he had been abusive throughout their relationship. Depp sued Heard for defamation in 2019 after she wrote an op-ed discussing being a public victim of domestic violence. He also sued the publishers of The Sun in a related libel suit in England. In 2020, the High Court of Justice of England and Wales ruled that Depp had lost his libel case and that the majority of Heard's allegations had been proven to a civil standard, although in 2021, a Virginia judge ruled that Depp may sue Heard, who was not a defendant in the libel case.

We show this & SUPPORT #AmberHeard. We also want to show it so that people see that you should leave domestic abuse. It can keep escalating. Don't be a bystander!

She is blamed for 'starting' the fights and not allowed to complain, be human, to feel, or to react (4:22, 9:27, 18:43, 7:16, 18:24, 24:57, 19:12). She avoided talking to him at least once because of fear of him exploding (7:21). She NEVER wanted any physical altercations (0:19). 

We want people to see how people, especially women, can be trained that they 'start' fights by saying something wrong, or arguing, or yelling or screaming, and then the physical reaction from their partners becomes 'rationalized' (0:34, 8:39, 15:02, 23:56). They are blamed.

'Splitting' involves not working on their marriage (8:22, 22:14). It can mean even from her talking in a low tone (9:40). She thought multiple times of splitting/leaving, but did not (0:00, 8:22, 7:01). She refers to good times such as 3 months in Australia, where she was allowed to argue without it becoming a physical fight, and wondering what has changed (5:22, 19:39). 

Amber Heard says she's the one who tries to end the fights and make the peace (8:39, 10:50, 27:35), saying that JD doesn't provide an Olive Branch (6:42, 18:31). She feels there is no consistency, safety, security, trust in the relationship (6:57, 10:16, 11:14, 11:26, 11:53, 13:57, 14:19, 20:57). They cannot communicate (16:52). He does not return home when he says he will (17:30, 27:01). She has tried to work on the marriage (20:11, 21:45, 23:39) and wishes it was better (23:22). He doesn't keep promises (23:56).

Johnny Depp said he knew the arguments and fights would not stop after marrying her (20:59).

See how it escalated to fear of being killed after being nearly suffocated with a pillow and waking up to her blood in Audio 2 of Amber's Side: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WX27126jVLQ

Thinking about leaving matches her dismissal with detailed descriptions: https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5835867-Amber-Heard-Motion-to-Dismiss.html

The physical & repeated abuse can also create anger, oppression, and Amber Heard says the situation with kicking repeatedly does make a person angry (2:06) to yell and scream in historical context.

It makes people feel ashamed & to hide their abuse out of fear of what people will think or say or not shown empathy, or retaliated against. There are very few Leaders Against Domestic Abuse. 

She's also been highly harassed online and with a smear campaign that is highly funded with targeting. She's received death threats and all positive praise of her is interrupted.

YouTubers such as ""True Crime"" claimed to post the' full audio,' but 3 parts seen in a tabloid about crime scene, killing, & kicked was cut out along with a loud ""TRANSLATION"" appearing. McPherson is believed to own a YouTube channel that appeared after JD lost 1 role, but BEFORE Amber's Op-Ed in the Washington Post.

-- Amber Heard has a long-term leadership, humanitarian, positive background with credibility --

She was the first American actress to be named Human Rights Champion to the United Nations Human Rights Office. She's an ambassador for the ACLU, donor to Women's Rights Groups, protector of refugees, and does charity. She has spent years helping children.

- Supporter of Born This Way Foundation, GLAAD, Habitat for Humanity, The Trevor Project, RiseNowUS, Sam's USA, Cyber Civil Rights Initiative, SHIELD Act, Center for Inquiry, World Identity Network, and Human Rights Campaign.

- Spoken at global events like the UN Social Good Summit, Global Citizen Festival, One Young World Conference, L'Oreal Women of Worth, and Emery Awards Gala.

She's Mera in the movie Aquaman.

As you hopefully have seen, we've been covering the case between Amber Heard and Johnny Depp for...well...a very long time.

And that brings us to now, because sources are saying that Amber Heard might be in serious trouble based on the results of evidence presented by LAPD and Johnny Depp recently.

I am so happy hearing and seeing more people speaking out about their abusers. I am one person who take this topic very strongly and it hurt deeply when people don't or can't speak out.

______________________________________________
Amber Heard has condemned the media for ‚Äúignoring‚Äù allegations against the rock star Marilyn Manson, who has been accused by a number of women of abuse. 

In today's video we are going to discuss about Amber Heard calls out media for ‚Äòignoring‚Äô Marilyn Manson abuse allegations. 

On Monday (1 February), actor Evan Rachel Wood accused Manson of grooming and abusing her ‚Äúfor years‚Äù while they were in a relationship. Several other women also came forward with allegations against Manson.At least 10 women, including actor Evan Rachel Wood, have spoken out against Manson since Monday, making allegations that include sexual assault, psychological abuse, physical violence and anti-Semitism. Manson has denied the accusations, calling them ‚Äúhorrible distortions of reality.‚Äù 

On Thursday (4 February), Heard, who has been embroiled in a high-profile divorce battle with Johnny Depp, tweeted her support of Wood, while suggesting that the media had long turned a blind eye to Manson‚Äôs behaviour.Sharing an article from The New Yorker suggesting there is a ‚Äúblind spot‚Äù when it comes to allegations made against public figures, Heard wrote: ‚Äú...and yet, no one sees the trend here? Everyone wants to tag a bathroom wall, no one wants to understand the writing. Evan & I aren‚Äôt the 1st to raise our hands. Are you done ignoring it?‚Äù 

After a Twitter user replied to Heard‚Äôs message with the single word ‚Äúfraud‚Äù, Heard responded: ‚ÄúWell I know a couple of over-indulged white male celebrities (who happen to be world famous) AND single, who are def in the market for some low rate ass-missing [sic], shall I intro you??‚Äù 

Earlier this week (2 February), Heard‚Äôs ex-husband Depp was permitted an oral hearing in his attempts to appeal a ruling by the British High Court over a newspaper column that described him as a ‚Äúwife beater‚Äù. The hearing will be held in March.Heard has long accused the Pirates of the Caribbean star of domestic violence, something he has denied. After suing The Sun publisher News Group Newspapers and its executive editor Dan Wootton for referring to him as a ‚Äúwife beater‚Äù in a column, Depp lost the case in December. A British judge declared that the claim was ‚Äúsubstantially true.""

In court filings, Heard alleged Depp, one of Manson‚Äôs close friends, was verbally and physically abusive to her. In 2016, People magazine published photos that showed Heard with a ‚Äúbruised eye and cut lip‚Äù stemming from an alleged domestic violence incident involving Depp in December 2015. Heard said she ‚Äútruly feared for her life‚Äù during that incident. In November, a British judge ruled against Depp in his libel lawsuit against a British newspaper that called him a ‚Äúwife beater.‚Äù Heard testified in the case, alleging Depp repeatedly assaulted her, including head-butting her, hitting her and tearing out clumps of her hair. 

A petition to remove Heard from the Aquaman franchise, spearheaded by Depp‚Äôs fans, has so far received millions of signatures.Heard condemned the campaign, while arguing that it will have no effect on her status within the superhero franchise. ‚ÄúPaid rumours and paid campaigns on social media don‚Äôt dictate [casting decisions] because they have no basis in reality,‚Äù Heard said in November.

Amber Heard has condemned the media for ‚Äúignoring‚Äù allegations against the rock star Marilyn Manson, who has been accused by a number of women of abuse. 

In today's video we are going to discuss about Amber Heard calls out media for ‚Äòignoring‚Äô Marilyn Manson abuse allegations. 

On Monday (1 February), actor Evan Rachel Wood accused Manson of grooming and abusing her ‚Äúfor years‚Äù while they were in a relationship. Several other women also came forward with allegations against Manson.At least 10 women, including actor Evan Rachel Wood, have spoken out against Manson since Monday, making allegations that include sexual assault, psychological abuse, physical violence and anti-Semitism. Manson has denied the accusations, calling them ‚Äúhorrible distortions of reality.‚Äù 

On Thursday (4 February), Heard, who has been embroiled in a high-profile divorce battle with Johnny Depp, tweeted her support of Wood, while suggesting that the media had long turned a blind eye to Manson‚Äôs behaviour.Sharing an article from The New Yorker suggesting there is a ‚Äúblind spot‚Äù when it comes to allegations made against public figures, Heard wrote: ‚Äú...and yet, no one sees the trend here? Everyone wants to tag a bathroom wall, no one wants to understand the writing. Evan & I aren‚Äôt the 1st to raise our hands. Are you done ignoring it?‚Äù 

After a Twitter user replied to Heard‚Äôs message with the single word ‚Äúfraud‚Äù, Heard responded: ‚ÄúWell I know a couple of over-indulged white male celebrities (who happen to be world famous) AND single, who are def in the market for some low rate ass-missing [sic], shall I intro you??‚Äù 

Earlier this week (2 February), Heard‚Äôs ex-husband Depp was permitted an oral hearing in his attempts to appeal a ruling by the British High Court over a newspaper column that described him as a ‚Äúwife beater‚Äù. The hearing will be held in March.Heard has long accused the Pirates of the Caribbean star of domestic violence, something he has denied. After suing The Sun publisher News Group Newspapers and its executive editor Dan Wootton for referring to him as a ‚Äúwife beater‚Äù in a column, Depp lost the case in December. A British judge declared that the claim was ‚Äúsubstantially true.""

In court filings, Heard alleged Depp, one of Manson‚Äôs close friends, was verbally and physically abusive to her. In 2016, People magazine published photos that showed Heard with a ‚Äúbruised eye and cut lip‚Äù stemming from an alleged domestic violence incident involving Depp in December 2015. Heard said she ‚Äútruly feared for her life‚Äù during that incident. In November, a British judge ruled against Depp in his libel lawsuit against a British newspaper that called him a ‚Äúwife beater.‚Äù Heard testified in the case, alleging Depp repeatedly assaulted her, including head-butting her, hitting her and tearing out clumps of her hair. 

A petition to remove Heard from the Aquaman franchise, spearheaded by Depp‚Äôs fans, has so far received millions of signatures.Heard condemned the campaign, while arguing that it will have no effect on her status within the superhero franchise. ‚ÄúPaid rumours and paid campaigns on social media don‚Äôt dictate [casting decisions] because they have no basis in reality,‚Äù Heard said in November. 

So that's all for today's video. What's your opinion on Marilyn Manson Abuse Allegations? Sound off know your thoughts in the comments section below.If you have not signed in to my channel yet please do this.See you within the next video.

Amber Heard‚Äôs close friend Amanda De Cadenet says that she has changed her mind about amber heard and will not be coming to her defense. She says that after she heard the audio tapes of amber heard and johnny depp fighting,  she says she feels misled. This is a huge blow to amber heard because Amanda De Cadenet is a well known metoo activist, as well as a womens right activist, and she was supposed to testify against johnny depp.

The evidence she has presented, almost 300 pages of pictures, videos and text messages is overwhelming. You can read the full document here: https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5835867-Amber-Heard-Motion-to-Dismiss.html

No matter how much Depp's acolytes try to twist the facts and make him see like the victim, there's a lot of evidence she endured a long period of time as a victim of domestic abuse, verbal, emotional and physical, before she decided to defend herself and ""not be doormat.""

She claimed that he threw a phone at her and she shows a picture of the a bruise on her face. Cenk Uygur, John Iadarola, Ben Mankiewicz, and Jimmy Dore, hosts of The Young Turks, break it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below.

‚ÄúAmber Heard has filed for a restraining order against Johnny Depp, her husband of just over a year, accusing him of repeated assaults. Heard filed for divorce early this week and, TMZ reports, arrived in court on Friday with facial bruises and abrasions that Depp had allegedly inflicted.

A source told People that this was ‚Äúonly the latest incident‚Äù in a pattern of Depp‚Äôs abuse.

Heard says that Depp hit her face with his iPhone on Saturday. From TMZ:

Amber claims during the alleged attack, Johnny shattered various objects in the apartment. She says she was on the phone with a friend during the fight, and when Johnny grabbed her phone she screamed to her friend, ‚ÄúCall the cops!‚Äù The friend called 911 and cops came to the residence. Amber says when cops arrived Johnny had already fled, so they took a report.

We're told cops told Amber they would find Johnny and arrest him if she gave a statement about the alleged violence, but she refused. Officers told her if she changed her mind she could call them.‚Äù

New AUDIO Released!,"***updateüôåüèª thank you all for the views! I so appreciate the support! Please like and subscribe! Also, share with friends! 

Hi guys, I wanted to make a video on this topic domestic violence. Domestic violence Is horrible no matter who you are and it‚Äôs never OK!! I‚Äôm going to link the audio below as well as other links related... what‚Äôre your thoughts? It‚Äôs all pretty disgusting and disturbing!! 

In my opinion,  the audio link below Johnny seems to be stuttering and can‚Äôt get a word in edgewise.  Amber just keeps repeating the same thing over and over again without anything new. It doesn‚Äôt seem to make sense. He keeps saying ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù and she is silent.  

Trigger warning: very disturbing to me.

 Amber Heard Could Be Facing Jail Time! 
Amber Heard could be jailed for three years in domestic abuse case against Johnny Depp
Amber Heard could serve up to three years in prison in domestic violence and defamation case against ex-husband Johnny Depp.
The Aquaman starlet can be jailed if found guilty for manipulating and faking evidence in the said lawsuit.
Things started to get ugly between the former couple when Amber accused Johnny of hitting her, as a result of which, she sustained bruises and injuries allegedly.
Amber, however, might be guilty of manipulating the evidence she submitted to court regarding this charge, after her stylist Samantha McMillen denied the claims, stating that she saw the actress on those days and see any bruises.
‚ÄúThroughout the day of December 16, 2015, I could see clearly that Amber Heard did not have any visible marks, bruises, cuts, or injuries to her face or any other part of her bod,‚Äù Samantha said.
If found responsible of tampering with the evidence, Amber could be sentenced for three years.
According to US law firm Wallin & Klarich, the California Penal Code Section 141 PC states that it is illegal to alter, modify, plant, place, conceal, manufacture or move any physical matter with the intention of causing someone to be charged with a crime.

If you‚Äôre interested in watching the full interview, here is the link for that:

I highly recommend following Colonel Kurtz on her channel! She‚Äôs got some great content, and puts a lot of heart and effort into her work.

People need to know that Amber Heard is a dangerous individual, and Paula is the second person recently to come out with uncomfortable stories regarding Amber. There was another woman and model who recently came forward with allegations of sexual assault by Amber Heard. It‚Äôs said she did a podcast that will be posted soon, after she gets a police report established, so please keep an eye out for that as well.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

Amber Heard Faces Prison After This‚Ä¶
https://youtu.be/s8XEA4tEMMI

The saga of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp‚Äôs messy divorce continues. But this
time things went really harsh for Amber Heard. According to the latest reports,
Amber Heard is at risk of facing jail time because now she is under
investigation by the LAPD for perjury concerning the 2016 incident in which
Depp allegedly hit his then-wife in the face. For now, Amber Heard is trying to
get the case dismissed officially.
I‚Äôm going to break it down for you, but before we start, hit that subscribe button
and make sure you stay till the end to know if the game is over for Amber
Heard.
After Johnny Deepp's defeat in the British High Court last year, his legal team
has plans to appeal. But this is more difficult than it seems because Amber
Heard‚Äôs legal team has tried to get the U.S.-based lawsuit dismissed, arguing
that the findings in the U.K. libel suit should be adopted. As for Johnny Depp‚Äôs
lawyer? He‚Äôs calling it a ‚Äúhail Mary.‚Äù
Apparently, Amber Heard's legal team doesn't want to give up without a fight
and they've filed a motion to stay discovery on the defamation claims and also a
memorandum in support of her motion for leave. Her team believes that due to
the libel case results, which found in favor of The Sun after that outlet called
Johnny Depp a ‚Äúwife beater,‚Äù that the judgment rendered should be applicable
in the US as well. The motion reads:
With the finality of the Judgment, rendered after Mr. Depp presented his best
evidence and arguments on the exact same factual issues assessed here, Mr.
Depp should be precluded from seeking yet another bite of the apple, where he
has fully adjudicated his dispute and lost. Because of the UK Judgment, the
entire world may now say, forever, that Mr. Depp is a ‚Äòwife beater‚Äô and has
committed at least 12 acts of domestic violence against Amber Heard, causing
her to be in fear for her life. In short, the UK Judgement, now final, permits this
court to end the litigation.
According to Johnny Depp‚Äôs lawyer, Benjamin Chew, however, this is not the
first time Amber Heard‚Äôs legal team has tried to get the $50 million defamation.

When James Wan dropped the official title of Aquaman 2, it was quickly overshadowed by further calls for star Amber Heard to be fired by those who were still unhappy with her domestic violence allegations against her ex-husband Johnny. Depp. With an online petition of more than 1.85 million signatures demanding that Heard be removed from the sequel, you'd think Warner Bros. Justice League. But if there is a new whisper in the industry to believe, not only does Warner Bros. not care, but they are about to do something that will further enrage Heard's foes.

In May of 2016, actress Amber Heard  accused her husband Johnny Depp of hitting her with a phone and assaulting her. She posted pictures of injuries to her face and filed for divorce.
However, a leaked audio about their abuse and divorce  chronicle made some QUESTIONS AND SHOCKING REVELATIONS.And the most significant question is that whether Amber Heard is a Pathological Liar.Johnny Depp is holding on these facts and wants to prove to the court that amber is a Pathological Liar.JOHNNY DEPP WANTS TO PROVE THAT AMBER SUBMITTED A FAKE HAIR TO COURT.In Amber‚Äôs court filing,  part of her statement wrote.  ‚ÄúHoping to avoid the violence, I tried to calm Johnny down.‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd then I went upstairs to try to remove myself from the situation.‚Äù
‚ÄúJohnny followed me, hit me in the back of my head.‚Äù  ‚ÄúGrabbed me by my hair again.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúGot in front of me on the steps, and then dragged me by my hair up the last few steps.‚Äù 
Depp tells a much different version of the same story in his declaration, with the building manager Kevin Murphy confirming some of the claims.  Murphy  testified that, ‚ÄúHeard‚Äôs face was utterly uninjured and unmarked.‚Äù ‚ÄúShe appeared to be makeup free, as they spoke face to face.‚Äù
‚ÄúShe is  in good light the day after she alleged the brutal attack.‚Äù He also stated that Heard showed him the clump of hair on the floor but not the place that hair was pulled from. Then, upon viewing the hair image submitted to the court versus the one he saw, and photographed, Murphy said that he believed they were different clumps of hair. JOHNNY WANTS TO PROVE THAT HE DIDN‚ÄôT CUT OFF HIS OWN FINGER AS AMBER CLAIMS. According to Amber's version of the event. Johnny, who was drunk and high on ecstasy, smashed several bottles and windows.  He also slammed a plastic phone against the wall unit.  She claims a piece of one of the items cut off a portion of the middle finger on his right hand. Amber's version goes on ... she's a painter and had dark blue paint in the room.  She claims Johnny dipped what remained of his forefinger in the paint. And then he used the gnarly digit to write various words on a mirror.  It includes ""Billy Bob"" and ""Easy Amber.""
Amber had done a movie with Billy Bob Thornton and she claims Johnny accused the 2 of sleeping together. It is something she strongly denied. She added that he accused her of infidelity with other men as well. Amber's people say Johnny didn't get medical help for nearly 24 hours. The doctors could not reattach the fingertip. She said they used a flap from his hand to sew on a new tip.
However, this is Johnny Depp‚Äôs  story. He said  that he nearly lost his life to MRSA after she threw a bottle of vodka at him and severed his finger.  Depp claims he severed his finger back in 2015 not because he was partying with friends.  He also claims he had to undergo multiple surgeries as a result of this attack. ‚ÄúWhile I was in Australia filming a movie approximately one month after I married Ms. Heard.‚Äù ‚ÄúOn a day where my then-lawyer tried to discuss with Ms. Heard the need that she sign a post-nuptial agreement with me.‚Äù  ‚ÄúShe went berserk and began throwing bottles at me.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe projectile‚Äôs impact shattered the bone in my finger and entirely severed the tip of my finger.‚Äù
A photo submitted with the filing show's just how severe the injury was.  Depp is clearly missing a large chunk of his finger.  ‚ÄúI had to have 3 surgeries to reconstruct my finger and contracted MRSA three times.‚Äù  ‚ÄúI feared that I would lose my finger, my arm, and my life,‚Äù states Depp in his declaration. JOHNNY WANTS TO PROVE THAT HE DIDN‚ÄôT HIT HER SO BAD THAT THE BED BROKE.
Heard had claimed on December 15, 2015  that her ex-husband beat her up so badly that the actor was so violent that he ""broke the bed in the process.""  However, after the incident, multiple witnesses said that they saw Amber in good light the day after the alleged brutal attack. JOHNNY WANTS TO PROVE THAT  SHE LIED BY CALLING A LESBIAN POLICE OFFICER A ‚ÄúHOMOPHOBIC‚Äù. Amber Heard's ex-girlfriend Tasya van Ree has claimed the officers who arrested her for domestic violence appeared to be ""homophobic"". But that doesn't seem to be the case. The star's former lover said the incident in 2009 was ""misinterpreted and over-sensationalized by two individuals in a powerful position.‚Äù However, there were reports that arresting officer Beverly Leonard is actually gay woman.
She has proudly posted pictures with her partner on Facebook a few years ago. As well as appearing at Pride weekend in the past.

""There have been several incidents of domestic violence,"" said Ms Heard
Amber Heard, Johnny Depp are ending their marriage of 14 months
The duo met on the sets of the movie The Rum Diary
Amber Heard, who has filed for divorce from actor Johnny Depp and accused him of domestic violence, has released fresh photos which allegedly depict past incidents of abuse by the Hollywood superstar, reported People magazine. 

The 30-year-old actress sports a cut lip and seemingly bruised eye in the new photos. The injuries were allegedly inflicted by Depp, 52, in December 2015. 

Ms Heard has got a restraining order against the actor and claimed that besides the latest incident of violence on April 21, the actor was violent to him in the past as well. 

In documents filed on May 27 to seek a temporary restraining order against Ms Depp, Ms Heard had alleged that during the ""entirety"" of their four-year relationship, ""Mr Depp has been verbally and physically abusive to me."" 

She described a December event that possibly correlates with the alleged timeline of these new photos. 

""There also have been several prior incidents of domestic violence with Johnny, in particular there was one severe incident in December 2015 when I truly feared that my life was in danger,"" she had said in her court declaration. 

Mr Depp's divorce attorney Laura Wasser claims that Ms Heard, who filed for divorce from mr Depp on May 23, just 14 months of marriage, is ""attempting to secure a premature financial resolution by alleging abuse."" 

The actor's daughter Lily-Rose, his first wife Lori Ann Allison and his ex-partner Vanessa Paradis had dismissed Ms Heard's allegations of domestic violence. 

An LAPD spokesperson said the officers responded to a 911 call but determined there was ""no evidence of any crime"" at the scene. 

In a statement on Tuesday, Ms Heard's lawyers said that she declined to make a statement to police at the time to ""protect her privacy and Johnny's career,"" but plans to make one and ""hopes to give the LAPD the opportunity to conduct an accurate and complete investigation.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pUwQXoBHY8c/default.jpg,120,90,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pUwQXoBHY8c/mqdefault.jpg,320,180,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pUwQXoBHY8c/hqdefault.jpg,480,360,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pUwQXoBHY8c/sddefault.jpg,640.0,480.0,,,,DigestHollywood,"['Amber Heard', 'Johnny Depp', 'Amber Heard Johnny Depp split', 'new photos', 'Hollywood actor', 'super hero']",24,none,Amber Heard Reveals New Photos of Alleged Abuse by Johnny Depp,"""There have been several incidents of domestic violence,"" said Ms Heard

Heard first gained mainstream recognition for supporting roles in the action film Never Back Down (2008) and the stoner comedy Pineapple Express (2008). In the following ten years, she acted mostly in independent films and small-budget productions, such as The Joneses (2009), The Rum Diary (2011), The Danish Girl (2015) and One More Time (2015). She's also known for her roles in horror and thriller films such as All the Boys Love Mandy Lane (2006), John Carpenter's The Ward (2010), Drive Angry (2011), and Machete Kills (2013).

Heard had her first major studio role in the DC Extended Universe superhero film Justice League (2017), in which she played Atlantean queen Mera. She reprised that role opposite Jason Momoa in Aquaman (2018). The same year, Heard was named a global spokesperson for the cosmetics giant L'Or√©al Paris.

Heard was married to actor Johnny Depp from 2015 to 2017. Their divorce drew significant media attention as she alleged that he had been abusive during most of their relationship. After Heard publicly discussed being the victim of domestic violence in 2018, Depp sued her for defamation, alleging that she had been the abusive party. Depp also sued the publishers of The Sun in a related libel suit, with Heard as a key witness for the defendants. In November 2020, the High Court of Justice of England and Wales ruled that Depp had lost his case and that the majority of Heard's allegations had been proven to a civil standard.

In addition to acting, Heard engages in activism for causes such as LGBTQ rights and domestic and sexual violence awareness.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/quNsHnHoPLg/default.jpg,120,90,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/quNsHnHoPLg/mqdefault.jpg,320,180,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/quNsHnHoPLg/hqdefault.jpg,480,360,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/quNsHnHoPLg/sddefault.jpg,640.0,480.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/quNsHnHoPLg/maxresdefault.jpg,1280.0,720.0,Mutlu,"['making slime', 'slime with', 'relaxing', 'relaxing slime', 'relaxing video', 'relax', 'slime video', 'tanya st', 'rahatlatƒ±cƒ± slime', 'rahatlatƒ±cƒ±', 'satisfying video', 'satisfying', 'soap carving', 'mixing', 'make up slime', 'relaxing video for sleep', 'relaxing video for cats', 'erotic', 'celebrity', 'celebrity tv', 'celebrity funny moments', 'Aquaman', 'Gully', ""Zack Snyder's Justice League"", 'The Stand', 'The Playboy Club', 'amber heard wikipeadia', 'amber heard mera costume', 'amber heard elon musk', 'amber heard sexuality']",22,none,"Amber Heard Relaxing Video Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow, Always","Amber Laura Heard (born April 22, 1986) is an American actress.

The Blast, Deadline and People reported Depp filed the suit against Heard over an opinion column she published, but didn't say when or where or in what court the suit was filed. 

Depp's lawyer, Adam Waldman of Washington D.C., did not respond to emails from USA TODAY. But he and Depp, 55, have long vigorously denied allegations Depp ever abused Heard, asserting that she faked the abuse claims in 2016 and that Depp was the real victim in their dispute.

""First she abused him physically, then she abused his reputation,"" Waldman told USA TODAY in December. 

Heard's lawyer, Eric George of Los Angeles, told USA TODAY he had not yet seen the lawsuit, only the media reports about it. But he issued a statement condemning it as ""frivolous"" and vowed it would not stop Heard from speaking out further about domestic violence. 

‚ÄúThis frivolous action is just the latest of Johnny Depp‚Äôs repeated efforts to silence Amber Heard,"" George said in a statement emailed to USA TODAY. ""She will not be silenced.

""Mr. Depp‚Äôs actions prove he is unable to accept the truth of his ongoing abusive behavior.  But while he appears hell-bent on achieving self destruction, we will prevail in defeating this groundless lawsuit and ending the continued vile harassment of my client by Mr. Depp and his legal team.‚Äù

In December, Heard, 32, who had accused Depp of beating her before their 2016 divorce was finalized, wrote an opinion column in the Washington Post lamenting the consequences she paid for speaking out about the need to curb domestic violence.
Two years ago, she wrote, ""I became a public figure representing domestic abuse, and I felt the full force of our culture‚Äôs wrath for women who speak out.""

She never mentioned the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" star by name but it was clear who and what she was talking about, according to Depp's lawsuit. Her column ""depends on the central premise that Ms. Heard was a domestic abuse victim and that Mr. Depp perpetrated domestic violence against her.‚Äù

These are ‚Äúfalse"" allegations, Depp's lawsuit argues, ‚Äúpart of an elaborate hoax to generate positive publicity‚Äù for Heard to advance her career. ‚ÄúMs. Heard is not a victim of domestic abuse; she is a perpetrator,‚Äù the suit says.

The Depp-Heard divorce, after less than two years of marriage, was one of Hollywood's most toxic in 2016, an ugly affair featuring allegations of physical abuse, restraining orders, media-mobbed court hearings, leaked texts and cellphone pictures of facial bruises, plus dueling lawyers and publicists.

Heard claimed the Los Angeles police went to their downtown loft the night of an alleged beating and documented the abuse. But the cops instead told reporters they found no evidence of a crime when they arrived.

After a summer of sniping, Heard withdrew her allegations that Depp abused her and the two settled their divorce out of court in August 2016. They issued a joint statement to the media.
""Our relationship was intensely passionate and at times volatile, but always bound by love,"" the statement said. ""Neither party has made false accusations for financial gain. There was never any intent of physical or emotional harm. Amber wishes the best for Johnny in the future.""

Heard eventually donated her share of the divorce settlement, about $7 million, to a charity focused on fighting domestic abuse of women. In addition to her thriving acting career (""Aquaman""), she is now an ambassador on women‚Äôs rights for the American Civil Liberties Union.

Depp has been enmeshed in several lawsuits in recent years, including one against his former managers and another against his former attorneys. He's also pursuing a libel case against The Sun tabloid in London, where libel suits are easier for plaintiffs to win, for calling him a ""wife-beater"" based on Heard's allegations.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sEU-yHqKVNM/default.jpg,120,90,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sEU-yHqKVNM/mqdefault.jpg,320,180,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sEU-yHqKVNM/hqdefault.jpg,480,360,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sEU-yHqKVNM/sddefault.jpg,640.0,480.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sEU-yHqKVNM/maxresdefault.jpg,1280.0,720.0,Serious Life,"['johnny depp', 'amber heard', 'entertainment news']",22,none,Johnny Depp sues Amber Heard for defamation seeking $50 million!,"The toxic divorce back-and-forth between Hollywood stars Johnny Depp and Amber Heard continues with the latest legal front shifting to Depp's reported lawsuit against his ex, seeking $50 million for allegedly defaming him with ""hoax"" allegations of domestic abuse.

Fans of Johnny Depp should rejoice: the actor is one step closer to winning his high-profile defamation case against ex-wife Amber Heard, and he is now determined to prove that Amber lied when she accused him of domestic violence in her infamous 2018 Washington Post op-ed.

However, we've heard that Johnny is concerned that Hollywood has already blacklisted him and that his career will never recover. 

So, what's the latest on Johnny and Amber's legal squabble? Will Johnny be able to prove his innocence at long last? Will Hollywood welcome him back if he does?

She said her partner was there to see the marriage in 2014/2015 up to a 2017 NDA.
- Jane Doe says Amber Heard was kicked, hit, and was crying after fights with Depp. She said her partner and other staff checked on her. The full 140 or so screenshots are at: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Gy4Pw8yoPVsY3T2VZs_ZQp_9_-FMYwIE?usp=sharing

To prevent domestic abuse - GET INVOLVED! Believe early, let them escape early. We created a petition to SUPPORT AMBER HEARD: https://www.change.org/p/amber-heard-supporters-we-support-amber-heard-in-aquaman-2

""Mo*ster"" as staff called Depp was used also by this Jane Doe and said 7 people were watching these tweets. They were even called to stop talking to us and to not support either side. She mentioned Amber was kicked in the UK, island, and other places.

Divided, she said she knew Depp and his staff, but not Amber Heard.

- The Jane Doe mentioned emails that she couldn't share now after the March 29 & April 1 screenshots, script writers, inability of Amber to audition, the Jane Doe going to Oscar/Emmy parties, celebrities hiding bruises while going to events as common, and more...

Amber Heard is a CRIME VICTIM which should also be a protected class.

- Slideshow of the tweets and messages with music.

Background: 
I did not know anything about Heard or Depp prior to Depp's March 2019 lawsuit for defamation. I started to learn and defend Amber in this situation, then this Jane Doe was looking on Twitter, and she decided to support Amber Heard.

She did not want screenshots, however, if someone is going to talk about domestic abuse and know it occurred, then I think it should be said and exposed. Los Angeles is very behind and unsafe about equal rights, women's rights, worker's rights (e.g. pay, networking, NDAs), and more. It can cause a chain reaction.

This slideshow shows Jane Doe clearly knew more than any AH fan did. Jane Doe said there was fighting from both sides, but they clearly saw Depp as the oppressor, Amber as the victim/survivor, and people are taking situations out of context. Several people lost jobs when he threatened Trump.

Make your own decision from these tweets and messages, but I think Amber Heard is the victim here. Also, a person can fall down or get hit, and have no bruises, especially if with young skin. They can take time to show up. To make a victim REQUIRE bruises is going too far. Coercive Control goes beyond this to emotional, financial, and legal. It shouldn't have to get physical.

*Also, limo drivers may have negative stories on many stars on the screen. One, e.g., I recently heard from one of their relatives in Sedona that Depp is mean...

The ""Jane Doe"" repeatedly changed their usernames on Twitter, but it's the same person.

Duty to Rescue and Duty to Care:
(Honestly, when I got these messages in April, I didn't really sleep and I got up early and screenshotted them before they temporarily deactivated their account (they would deactivate, lock, and change usernames). I am a defender because I believe in ‚ÄúDuty to Rescue‚Äù law which makes me feel liable if I see something wrong or unethical. I didn't/do not want to be socially responsible if it was not shown, and I didn't believe investigating because of harmful imposter PIs taking it out of context and threatening humanitarian work and lives).

If someone is in a harmful relationship, they should leave that relationship. The best way is to walk away. ""Better off without you anyway."" To really prevent, though: People have to do something with Duty to Rescue and Duty to Care. Women are often told that they should forget their violence, that it's not believed, and it's not stopped early. See something, DO something. We have over 90,000 views of ""Men Help Woman Being Beaten by Husband in Parking Lot"": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyD0aouGM2Q

We also got the database fixed for the article on Amber's friend calling 911 for her. It was not showing up: http://refinery29.com/en-us/2016/06/113149/domestic-violence-911-call-famous-friend.

Stop NDAs hiding discrimination, crime, and abuse:
Harvey Weinstein used NDAs and networking to silence his victims. Depp put his staff and Amber Heard onto NDAs. NDAs should be about intellectual property, not relationships. It's silencing victims and creates victim blaming. A 2017 law nearly came into effect to stop NDAs. 
I am glad the ACLU and Times Up are helping Amber Heard.

I Stand with Melissa Benoist (Supergirl - CW/WB):
Not long after editing and adding DC/WB to emails for the petition, Melissa Benoist came out about domestic abuse. We cannot prove the timing, but also ""I Stand with Melissa."" We Stand with you, Amber. https://www.change.org/p/amber-heard-supporters-we-support-amber-heard-in-aquaman-2

She was like ‚ÄúBitch is savage af‚Äù, to which I agreed and intended to make a post about. I mean, what kind of bitch files for divorce less than a week after their husband‚Äôs mom dies?

A bitch who isn‚Äôt a bitch, but apparently a victim of domestic violence, that‚Äôs who. Today, Amber Heard emerged from a courtroom with a beaten up face as a judge granted her request for a restraining order against Johnny Depp after she filed domestic abuse charges against him. As of right now, it seems like not only is Johnny Depp a fading Hollywood heart throb who might genuinely believe he has become Jack Sparrow what with the gold teeth and puffy shirts and all, but he might also be a real piece of shit who beats on his sexy young wife who really should have just stayed with her sexy girlfriend, because the world was a happier place for everyone when Amber Heard was a lesbian. 
In her court filings, she claimed that last Saturday Depp hit her with a cell phone, pulled her hair and screamed at her. She also alleged that he was abusive throughout their entire 15-month marriage which is why she bailed. All of us who judged Amber as a mega, gold-digging bitch with a heart made of ice for dumping Johnny a couple of days after his mom died sure look like assholes now, hey? In her court filing, Amber says that Johnny was verbally and physically aggressive towards her during their entire message, but I guess him going all Naomi Campbell on her by chucking a cell phone at her face was the last straw. She went and filed the police report after that and they took pics of her cell phone beaten face. Here‚Äôs the thing about a lot of these major hunks from the 90s: sometimes they turn out to really fucking suck. I mean, Amber and I are the same age, born in 1986, and she probably grew up thinking he was really talented and hot like so many people in the 80s and 90s did,. Then she grows up, he proposes, and she scores her childhood crush. Too bad he turns out to be a dog smuggling, anti-oral hygiene, pirate wannabe who throws cell phones at her fucking face like he‚Äôs Latoya fucking Jackson. And look at Katie Holmes! She grew up in the 80s and 90s probably thinking Tom Cruise was the shit and figured she was mega #blessed when they started dating. But instead of fulfilling her pubescent fantasies with the dude from ‚ÄúRisky Business‚Äù, she got sucked into the cult of Scientology for several years and had to make that god awful ‚ÄúMad Money‚Äù movie with Queen Latifah! If it weren‚Äôt for Brad Pitt, I‚Äôd assume all the major heart throbs of my youth were weird pieces of shit.

Even though the title of this blog was technically click bait that I stole from my friend Simone‚Äôs sister-in-law (or cousin-in-law, I forget), I do hope Amber will go back to dating hot ladies rather than abusive douche bag has-beens. I think she‚Äôd be much better off with a Ruby Rose rather than a Mel Gibson.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/udYEVK3w2CM/default.jpg,120,90,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/udYEVK3w2CM/mqdefault.jpg,320,180,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/udYEVK3w2CM/hqdefault.jpg,480,360,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/udYEVK3w2CM/sddefault.jpg,640.0,480.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/udYEVK3w2CM/maxresdefault.jpg,1280.0,720.0,Ashfaq Rana,"['Johnny', 'Depp', 'Vanessa', 'Paradis', 'Amber Heard', 'money', 'abuse', 'allegations', 'breaks', 'silence', 'assaulting', 'the', 'pirates', 'of', 'carribean', 'hollywood', 'gossip', 'divorce', 'bisexuality', 'pained', 'blackmailing', 'fun vids channel', 'politics', 'hero', 'heroin', 'news', 'latest', 'lesbian', 'homo', 'ban']",25,none,Amber Heard Should Have Stayed THE SAME | Johnny Depp,"The other day, my friend Simone posted a link on my Facebook wall about how Amber Heard filed for divorce from Johnny Depp mere days after his mother died.

8 Times Talented Actors Were Rotten People!

The media tends to shed an ethereal light on many actors, however not all talented stars are actually good people. These stories will make you look at some of Hollywood‚Äôs Heroes quite differently...

1. Christian Bale
The Batman star was arrested for assault in July 2008, against... his own mother and sister! Bale became violent after his wife fell out with his mother and is known for his aggressive tantrums on film sets.

2. Reese Witherspoon
The Wild actress and husband were pulled over for drunk driving when Reese asked meekly; ‚ÄúDo you know my name? You are going to be on national news.‚Äù She was arrested for disorderly conduct and obstruction of a police officer.

3. Sean Connery 
His first wife Diane Cilento recently described an incident in which Connery beat her unconscious. She revealed that the domestic assault ended their marriage.
                                               
4. Emma Roberts
Julia Robert‚Äôs niece took things too far and was arrested for domestic assault after bloodying her boyfriend and American Horror Story beau, Evan Peters.  
                       
5. Johnny Depp
Whilst attending an Iggy Pop concert a fan got too close to Depp who called his security squad. Allegedly they ripped off the female‚Äôs pants and pinned her to the ground, while Johnny turned a blind eye.

6. Mark Wahlberg
The Entourage creator had been in trouble for violently racist assaults over 20 times before he turned 16! At 15 Wahlberg threw rocks and shouted racial epithets at African-American children, beat one Vietnamese man so badly he thought he had blinded him and was sentenced to two years in jail. ‚ÄúI did a lot of things that I regret and I have certainly paid for my mistakes.‚Äù Do you forgive him?
                                       
7. Mel Gibson
The Passion of the Christ director ruined his reputation after a sexist, ridiculously racist and very violent phone call to ex-girlfriend, Oksana Grigorieva. It wasn‚Äôt the first time Gibson had been caught in a drunkenly racist rant.
                                                               
8. Michael Fassbender
The X-Men star horrifically abused his ex-girlfriend on multiple occasions. She claimed he threw her over a chair, broke her nose, dragged her alongside her car, twisting her left ankle and blowing out her left kneecap. She asked for $20,000 to cover her medical expenses however, the charges were mysteriously dropped. Maybe she was paid off by Fassbender‚Äôs team‚Ä¶

Melcher was featured on Entertainment Tonight, where he discusses Amber Heard's request for a restraining order against Johnny Depp. 

A legal showdown for Johnny Depp and Amber Heard. Their divorce is nasty. She has several charges of abuse against him. Still Amber arrived with her first face-off with Johnny's lawyer. Johnny's ex Amber Heard arrived for her deposition at 11:30am, an hour and a half late and the paps-well they were ready to pounce. Depp, however, faces some serious claims. Amber says she is the victim of domestic abuse and Johnny gave her this black eye in May. 

""It's basically going to be a he said, she said-his word against hers,"" says Christopher C. Melcher, a top family law attorney, who has represented stars like Katie Holmes during her divorce from Tom Cruise. 
He doesn't represent either party in this case, but says Amber has a tough road ahead. ""To approve a permanent restraining order, she has to establish that Johnny hit her, stalked her, harassed her-things like that.""

Amber filed for divorce in May, just a month earlier this was their last appearance together, a PSA. 
Johnny and Amber recorded this awkward apology, apparently a part of a settlement for allegedly smuggling their dogs into Australia.  ""Declare everything when you enter Australia, "" Johnny Depp replied in his PSA. 

""The parties were married for 15 months. I would imagine a divorce case in this situation would take longer than the marriage itself,"" states celebrity divorce attorney Christopher C. Melcher.

AMBER HEARD | HOT COMPILATION (EXTRAS - 17 MINUTES)

Amber Laura Heard (born April 22, 1986) is an American film and television actress. After a series of small roles in film and television, Heard had her first starring role in the horror film All the Boys Love Mandy Lane (2006). She first gained mainstream recognition for supporting roles in the action film Never Back Down (2008) and the comedy Pineapple Express (2008). In the following years, she appeared in films such as The Joneses (2009), The Ward (2010), The Rum Diary (2011), Drive Angry (2011), Machete Kills (2013) and Magic Mike XXL (2015).

In 2017, Heard joined the DC Extended Universe to play Atlantean queen Mera in superhero films Justice League (2017), Aquaman (2018), and Zack Snyder's Justice League (2021). In addition to acting, Heard has been a global spokesperson for the cosmetics giant L'Or√©al Paris since 2018. She also engages in human rights activism.

Heard was married to actor Johnny Depp from 2015 to 2017. Their divorce drew significant media attention as she alleged that he had been abusive through most of their relationship. He then sued her for defamation in 2019 after Heard wrote an op-ed discussing being a public victim of domestic violence. He also sued the publishers of The Sun in a related libel suit in England. In 2020, the High Court of Justice of England and Wales ruled that Depp had lost his libel case and that the majority of Heard's allegations had been proven to a civil standard.

People still didn‚Äôt believe her,"Amber Heard did what abuse victims are ‚Äúsupposed‚Äù to do. People still didn‚Äôt believe her, by Constance Grady.

Like our Video: https://youtu.be/VolhRSrJIKk
The divorce of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp is now final, and one thing‚Äôs for sure: Heard didn‚Äôt get any money out of it.

She settled the divorce out of court for $7 million, all of which she has now donated to charitable causes. She‚Äôs splitting the sum between the American Civil Liberties Union‚Äôs efforts to battle violence against women and the Children‚Äôs Hospital of Los Angeles, where she‚Äôs volunteered for the past 10 years.

And in a joint statement, both Heard and Depp affirmed that ‚Äúneither party has made false accusations for financial gain.‚Äù

In other words: Heard is not a gold digger, and she did not accuse Depp of cutting off part of his finger and then using the stump to finger paint the words ‚ÄúEasy Amber‚Äù on a mirror because she thought that would be a cool quick way to make some cash.

It‚Äôs a shame Heard felt the need to be so emphatic about the fact that she isn‚Äôt lying about her domestic violence claims, but it‚Äôs not surprising. Ever since she first filed for a restraining order against Depp in May, Heard has done everything we say domestic abuse survivors should do. She went to the police. She provided copious documentation. She went above and beyond to prove she wasn‚Äôt in it for the money.

People still insisted she was lying.
The history of Heard‚Äôs domestic violence allegations spans at least two years

On May 21, Heard says she asked a friend to call the police after Depp hit her with an iPhone and struck her. When they arrived, Hear told them she and Depp had only been arguing ‚Äî which she now says was an attempt to protect Depp‚Äôs career. (It‚Äôs extremely common for victims of domestic abuse to feel the need to protect their abusers.)

SIGN TO SUPPORT HER: https://www.change.org/p/amber-heard-supporters-we-support-amber-heard-in-aquaman-2

Previous interpretations only show JD's side, but half of the 30 minute audio strongly supports Amber. We've ordered it with importance and explanations of her side of the story.
#StopDomesticViolence

HER SIDE:
- She feared for her life and that JD would 'accidentally' kill her.
- She believes JD is an abuser. She refers to abuse & violence in December, May, and April. 
- IO Tillett called 911 because of escalating violence and she feared physical harm and needed to protect herself.
- Bodyguards told her off record that she would be killed, and one is recorded on a phone witnessing violence.

I was afraid Depp was going to kill me, says Heard
Actor Johnny Depp ""threatened to kill"" ex-wife Amber Heard ""many times"", the US actress has claimed.

She described a ""three-day hostage situation"" during which she claimed Mr Depp was on a ""drug and alcohol binge"".

Mr Depp, 57, is suing the publisher of the Sun over an article that referred to him as a ""wife beater"" - but the newspaper maintains it was accurate.

He denies 14 allegations of domestic violence on which News Group Newspapers is relying for its defence.

Ms Heard took to the witness stand at London's High Court on the 10th day of the case, and her written witness statement was also submitted to the court.

In it, she accused Mr Depp of verbal and physical abuse including screaming, swearing, issuing threats, punching, slapping, kicking, head-butting and choking her, as well as ""extremely controlling and intimidating behaviour"".

""Some incidents were so severe that I was afraid he was going to kill me, either intentionally, or just by losing control and going too far,"" she said.

Under cross-examination, Ms Heard later said that although there were times when she ""lost her cool"" with Mr Depp, it was only in self-defence.
'The monster'

Ms Heard, 34, claimed Mr Depp had a ""unique ability to use his charisma to convey a certain impression of reality"" and ""he is very good at manipulating people"".

""He would blame all his actions on a self-created third party instead of himself, which he often called 'the monster'.

In it, she accused Mr Depp of verbal and physical abuse including screaming, swearing, issuing threats, punching, slapping, kicking, head-butting and choking her, as well as ""extremely controlling and intimidating behaviour"".

""Some incidents were so severe that I was afraid he was going to kill me, either intentionally, or just by losing control and going too far,"" she said.

Under cross-examination, Ms Heard later said that although there were times when she ""lost her cool"" with Mr Depp, it was only in self-defence.
'The monster'

Ms Heard, 34, claimed Mr Depp had a ""unique ability to use his charisma to convey a certain impression of reality"" and ""he is very good at manipulating people"".

""He would blame all his actions on a self-created third party instead of himself, which he often called 'the monster'.

Spector and co-counsel Joseph P. Koenig, just released a statement defending her and her actions throughout the past week in her allegations of domestic violence against Johnny Depp.

‚ÄúAs the result of Amber‚Äôs decision to decline giving an initial statement to the LAPD, her silence has been used against her by Johnny‚Äôs team. Amber did not provide a statement to the LAPD in an attempt to protect her privacy and Johnny‚Äôs career. Johnny‚Äôs team has forced Amber to give a statement to the LAPD to set the record straight as to the true facts, as she cannot continue to leave herself open to the vicious false and malicious allegations that have infected the media. Amber has suffered through years of physical and psychological abuse at the hands of Johnny,‚Äù the statement, provided to Just Jared, began.

‚ÄúIn domestic violence cases, it is not unusual for the perpetrator‚Äôs playbook to include miscasting the victim as the villain,‚Äù the statement continued. ‚ÄúIn reality, Amber acted no differently than many victims of domestic violence, who think first of the harm that might come to the abuser, rather than the abuse they have already suffered. Amber can no longer endure the relentless attacks and outright lies launched against her character in the Court of Public Opinion since the tragic events of May 21st. With her statement Amber hopes to give the LAPD the opportunity to conduct an accurate and complete investigation into the events of that evening and before. If that occurs, and the truth is revealed, there is no doubt that Amber‚Äôs claims will be substantiated beyond any doubt, and hopefully Johnny will get the help that he so desperately needs.‚Äù

Click inside to read the remainder of the statement from Amber Heard‚Äôs legal team‚Ä¶

From the beginning it has been Amber‚Äôs desire to keep this matter as private as possible, even though LAPD officers responded to a 911 call made by a third-party. The LAPD officers viewed not only the disarray that Johnny had caused in the apartment but also the physical injuries to Amber‚Äôs face. We filed the Petition for Dissolution of Marriage at the very end of the day on Monday May 23rd and we did not serve Johnny with the Petition at the premiere of Alice Through the Looking Glass that evening. We sent a letter to Johnny‚Äôs counsel team the next morning making it clear we wanted to keep this matter out of the media. We then held off requesting a domestic violence restraining order as we knew that Johnny was out of the country.

We took the high road. Unfortunately, Johnny‚Äôs team immediately went to the press and began viciously attacking Amber‚Äôs character. Amber is simply a victim of domestic violence, and none of her actions are motivated by money. Amber is a brave and financially independent woman who is showing the courage of her convictions by doing the right thing against Johnny‚Äôs relentless army of lawyers and surrogates.

Amber Heard has a new gig, but it isn‚Äôt your standard Hollywood casting role and might not be something she ever intended to speak about publicly. But her recent high profile and rather disturbing run through the media because of publicized marital issues have landed Heard a public speaking job.

Hollywood TV is your source for daily celebrity news and gossip!
Amber Heard was reportedly arrested for domestic violence in 2009 after a fight with her girlfriend. Heard and Tasya van Ree got into an argument at the Seattle-Tacoma International airport and Heard allegedly hit her then girlfriend in the arm. According to TMZ she was charged with misdemeanor domestic violence but the prosecutor declined to move forward with the case because the couple were residents of California. 

Amber Rose and Wiz Khalifa have reached a settlement in their divorce. According to court documents Amber will get a cool million as outlined in the prenup she signed. The rapper will also pay her $14,800 a month in child support for their 3-year-old son Sebastian. The couple share legal and physical custody of their son. 

The Playboy mansion has been sold. Hugh Hefner's neighbor bought the legendary home. The mansion was purchased by Playboy Enterprises in 1971 for just over a million dollars. The sale comes with the condition that Hefner will be able to remain in the home as long as he lives. The home was listed for $200 million but no purchase price has been released.
