Do you think she should deserve second chance. These celebrities caught her lying. Find out more about watching the video.


Famous film and television actress Amber Heard is being called out for lying on numerous occasions by various celebrities. One such celebrity is her ex-husband and Golden Globe winner Johnny Depp. ‚ÄúThe Pirates of the Caribbean‚Äù actor who sees himself drawn towards controversies and legal battles had once filed a 50 million defamation case against ex-wife Amber Heard at the time of their divorce. According to sources, the defamation case has witnessed some recent happenings wherein Depp and his team has issued a legal notice to Amber Heard‚Äôs ex-boyfriend and one of the richest space enthusiasts in the world, Elon Musk.
1- One of these well-wishers is Vanessa Paradis, the former partner of Johnny Depp who was the first celebrity to openly support Depp and expressed her doubts regarding Amber‚Äôs allegations in May 2020 wherein she accused Johnny of being extremely violent. She even supported Depp‚Äôs defamation case against Heard by issuing a statement. In that statement, she claimed that she has known Johnny for 25 years and has never faced a problem with him. She also stated that Johnny has always been a reverent and caring partner to her and a doting father to their two children. Vanessa also went on to call Amber‚Äôs allegations against Depp to be completely false and baseless.
2- Winona Ryder too, another former partner of Johnny Depp came forward to publish a declaration in support of him in the matter. Ryder clarified that Amber has been unreasonable with her allegations and the Johnny that she has known for so many years, is not even one percent close to what Amber falsely described him as. Winona has always considered him as his closest friend, more like family and thus, she knows him better than anyone else. This would make her the perfect person to testify in favor of Johnny since she knows that he is innocent and far from being violent or abusive.

Johnny Depp fans have not wasted a single minute to come out in support of their favourite star as soon as this controversy came into limelight. His fans tweeted that they cannot wait for Depp to get justice and strict action to be taken against Amber. Not only the fans, even celebrities and colleagues have shown their support to Johnny Depp, implying that they know him personally and he has never had wrong intentions. During the two-year marriage of Depp and Heard, Depp was often shown in bad light by the media but his well-wishers knew better and never left his side.
3- Sharon Osbourne is a celebrity who is known to have no filters in her mouth and speaks her heart out without any hesitation and fear of judgement. In an interview in November 2020, Sharon suggested that according to her, Amber should have been scrutinized and blamed equally by the media for this entire situation as a marriage is supposed to be a two-way street. She believed that Amber should stop playing the victim card even though she was at fault in numerous situations. Sharon also drew a comparison between the relationship of Johnny and Amber and her relationship with her husband Ozzy Osbourne.

So, will Johnny be able to prove that Amber has been lying all this while or is it ultimately both of them who are responsible for this chaos equally? Only time will tell.
That‚Äôs all for today. I hope you liked the video. If you did make sure to hit that like button and subscribe to the channel so that you never miss any amazing video from us.

Here is the link to the deposition;
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sKyN0_D_ec
As in my last video called, ‚ÄúA Therapist‚Äôs Thoughts on Johnny and Amber‚Äôs Audio Argument,‚Äù this deposition gives us a front row seat to watch things we are often talking about on this channel; how to know when someone is lying, does someone with narcissistic behaviors know when they are lying, and what is the difference between lies and delusional thinking?  We‚Äôll see how in the beginning she is lying, and then she shifts into her delusional narratives.  Delusional narratives are more confusing than lies, as the person is quite convinced of the ‚Äòtruth‚Äô in their narrative.  Knowing the difference between the two is crucial for us to understand and notice in others, so we can protect ourselves from narcissistic traits and behavior!

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

Amber Heard has been CAUGHT collaborating with the ACLU. Heard is very clearly a liar, in my opinion and has done whatever she COULD to defame Johnny Depp. We all know Depp is probably cheering and jumping with joy, to know Heard could potentially loose this thing, especially with all of the evidence against. The Amber Heard Johnny Depp audio recordings should be the only thing needed for him to get justice, but I guess we will have to see!

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

The impeachment trial moves into the question period for both sides on Jan. 29, when senators submit questions in writing to Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. The chief justice will read questions out loud, alternating between the majority and minority for up to eight hours. 

Trump was impeached by the House of Representatives in December for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. Impeachment does not mean that the president has been removed from office. In the next phase, the Senate must hold a trial to make that determination. A Senate impeachment trial has happened only two other times in American history and once in the modern era. At the center of the Democrats‚Äô case is that Trump sought to withhold military assistance and an Oval Office meeting until Ukraine announced investigations into former vice president Joe Biden and his son.

More recently, the wrestler star challenged Ambers ex Elon Musk to a bare-knuckle fight in Johnny's honor after Musk jokingly said he would cage fight, Johnny Depp.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

The Hollywood star is suing News Group Newspapers, publisher of The Sun, and the paper‚Äôs executive editor, Dan Wootton, over an April 2018 article that called him a ‚Äúwife-beater.‚Äù

Depp is in the witness box at the High Court in London for a fifth day - two days longer than scheduled - in a case that has exposed a bitter rift between the estranged spouses.

Depp, 57, and Heard, 34, met on the set of the 2011 comedy ‚ÄúThe Rum Diary‚Äù and married in Los Angeles in February 2015. Heard, a model and actress, filed for divorce the following year, and the divorce was finalized in 2017.

Under cross-examination by The Sun‚Äôs lawyer, Sasha Wass, Depp depicted a tumultuous relationship with Heard during a period when he was trying to kick drugs and alcohol, and sometimes lapsing.

He called the relationship ‚Äúa crime scene waiting to happen.‚Äù But he denied hitting Heard and accused her of compiling a dossier of fake claims against him as an ‚Äúinsurance policy.‚Äù

In the early afternoon of March 24, 1998, two students from Westside Middle School, located approximately two miles west of Jonesboro (Craighead County), conducted an armed ambush on teachers and students, which resulted in five dead and ten others injured. The shooters, Andrew Golden and Mitchell Johnson, were arrested and prosecuted for the crime. The incident was one of two school shootings in Arkansas and one of several school shootings across the nation that adjusted school administrators‚Äô and law enforcement officers‚Äô concepts on school security and response plans to violent incidents at schools.

The students and teachers had returned from spring break the day before the shooting. Fifth period was just starting at 12:35 p.m. when a fire alarm caused the student body and faculty to evacuate the building. This alarm was triggered by eleven-year-old Andrew Golden, who, shortly after activating the alarm, joined thirteen-year-old Mitchell Johnson in a field adjacent to the school. This location had a clear view of the exit doors used during a fire drill. At 12:41 p.m., as eighty-seven students and nine teachers evacuated the building, Golden and Johnson began firing at the group with various weapons, including handguns and semi-automatic and bolt action rifles. In rapid succession, Golden and Johnson fired thirty rounds at the group.

Sixth-grade teacher Shannon Wright was killed, along with four students: Natalie Brooks (age eleven), Paige Ann Herring (age twelve), Stephanie Johnson (age twelve), and Brittheny Varner (age eleven). Nine students and another teacher, Lynette Thetford, were injured. Among the wounded students were Candice Porter (age eleven), who reportedly dated and broke up with Johnson, and Jennifer Jacobs (age twelve), who reportedly dated and broke up with Golden prior to the shooting. Although some speculated the suspects targeted specific students or teachers based upon past interactions, this theory was never proven and the victims‚Äô association to the suspects was eventually considered coincidental. After firing upon the crowd, both suspects fled through the woods and were apprehended by the police without further violence.

The police discovered that the boys were attempting to make their way back to a van parked almost half a mile away from the school. This van, taken from Johnson‚Äôs residence, contained food, extra clothing, and camping equipment to facilitate their escape. An investigation by the police determined that three handguns were taken from Golden‚Äôs residence and an additional four handguns and three rifles came from Golden‚Äôs grandfather‚Äôs residence. The Craighead County Sheriff‚Äôs Office assumed responsibility for the investigation of the incident and charged both suspects with five counts of capital murder and ten counts of first-degree battery.

By all accounts, the two suspects were not close friends. In fact, with Johnson attending the seventh grade and Golden attending the sixth grade, the students only shared bus rides to and from school. But both verbalized hostility toward others and threatened that something big was about to happen. Johnson lived with his mother and stepfather, and had a difficult relationship with his father. Fellow students reported that Johnson was bullish and bragged about being in a gang. Within the same school year as the shooting, Johnson was assigned in-school suspension three times and was criminally charged for molesting a two-year-old girl. In contrast to Johnson‚Äôs overt behavioral problems, Golden led a kind of ‚ÄúJekyll and Hyde‚Äù lifestyle. Golden was not a disciplinary problem at school and was regarded by many adults as a well-mannered and cheerful student. He was very close to his family and shared the family‚Äôs interest in firearms by competing and winning marksmanship awards. However, apparently unbeknownst to his family, Golden reportedly demonstrated violence by firing his BB gun at animals and other children.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7ydp_mSbsz8/default.jpg,120,90,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7ydp_mSbsz8/mqdefault.jpg,320,180,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7ydp_mSbsz8/hqdefault.jpg,480,360,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7ydp_mSbsz8/sddefault.jpg,640.0,480.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7ydp_mSbsz8/maxresdefault.jpg,1280.0,720.0,Across the Table,"['mass shotting', 'long', 'arkansas school shooting', 'students', 'depositions', 'middle school', 'shooters', 'westside ms', 'interrogations', 'children', 'middle school shooting', 'domestic terrorism', 'arkansas', 'shooting', 'interviews', 'violent acts', 'deposition', 'rampage', 'young', 'guns', 'violence', 'andrew golden', '1998', 'murder', 'interrogation', 'killed', 'westside middle', 'mitchell johnson', 'arkansas shooting', 'school shootings', 'across the table', 'dead arkansas', 'interview', 'shooting spree', 'full length', 'bombs', 'west side school shooting', 'van']",25,none,Andrew Golden Full Length Deposition - Arkansas School Shooter,"Full Length Deposition of Andrew Golden, Westside, Arkansas Middle School Shooting

There are few people who know celebrities and people in power as well as their assistants. They know everything about their schedules, who they are seeing, who they don't want to see and what they act like when the camera‚Äôs aren't rolling. Which is why, if you ever get famous or rich, you should make sure you treat your Assistant with a ton of kindness and respect.

We are all very much aware of the fact that cancel culture is one that is getting on everyone‚Äôs backs lately. Over the past couple of years, many celebrities have found themselves to be in the middle of some pretty interesting situations and one celebrity who has found themselves to be in quite a bit of trouble with cancel culture is in fact Drake Bell. It turns out the former Nickelodeon star pleaded guilty in regard to two different charges that are against him. During this virtual court appearance, things did not go all too well for the old childhood star and it seems that his ex-co star, Josh Peck, had quite a bit to say about it all. We'll break it down for you. Be sure to like the video and subscribe to the channel!

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

Now it turns out that Amber Heard may have not written the statement or OP ED in accusations against Johnny Depp. This could another case of defamation or fraud. Let's break it down in today's video.

He seems to have it all and has consistently put out top-notch performances for his adoring fans.

But despite all the adoration, the star of the Basketball Diaries and Titanic still seems to have ruffled a few feathers in Hollywood.

For instance, George Clooney spoke with Esquire magazine in 2013 about a basketball game in which DiCaprio and he played. Clooney recalled DiCaprio delivering a subtle threat before the game but was handily beaten on the court. Clooney even threw shade at the final score.

Elizabeth Holmes promised the world a medical revolution. At 19, she claimed to have invented a miniaturised machine that with a single drop of blood could map a person‚Äôs health quickly, reliably and cheaply. She boasted that her technology meant serious diseases like cancer would be prevented before they happened. And it was not only a ‚Äúwow‚Äù moment for patients. High-profile investors rushed to pour a fortune into Holmes‚Äô company, Theranos, and she became Silicon Valley‚Äôs first self-made female billionaire.

For forty years, 60 Minutes have been telling Australians the world‚Äôs greatest stories. Tales that changed history, our nation and our lives. Reporters Liz Hayes, Tom Steinfort, Tara Brown, Liam Bartlett and Sarah Abo look past the headlines because there is always a bigger picture. Sundays are for 60 Minutes.

Elizabeth Holmes promised the world a medical revolution. At 19, she claimed to have invented a miniaturised machine that with a single drop of blood could map a person‚Äôs health quickly, reliably and cheaply. She boasted that her technology meant serious diseases like cancer would be prevented before they happened. And it was not only a ‚Äúwow‚Äù moment for patients. High-profile investors rushed to pour a fortune into Holmes‚Äô company, Theranos, and she became Silicon Valley‚Äôs first self-made female billionaire. But as Tara Brown reports, her invention was an invention ‚Äì it simply didn‚Äôt work. Elizabeth Holmes is no visionary. She‚Äôs a cruel fraudster who has put people‚Äôs lives at risk, and because of that, now faces 20 years in jail.

‚ÄúPlaintiff John C. Depp, II shall ‚Ä¶appear for three successive days in counsel for Defendant‚Äôs offices in Virginia ‚Ä¶or at such other place in Northern Virginia designated by counsel for Defendant, from November 10-12, 2020, beginning at 10:00 a.m. each day,‚Äù declares an order yesterday from Fairfax County VA Circuit Court Chief Judge Bruce White 

No word yet from the Depp camp if the¬†Fantastic Beasts¬†star plans to fight this order, yet. However, if the Oscar nominee does show up, it looks like it will involve him having to skip out of some of the UK filming of the latest sequel in the WB franchise from J.K Rowling.

It was the coronavirus delayed start of shooting on the David Yates-directed¬†Fantastic Beasts 3¬†that was why Depp sought in August to have the commencement of the trial in the contentious
matter pushed back to mid-2021 and why he has been supposedly unable to sit with Heard‚Äôs lawyers previously. Though the actor has been conducting a mini-grand tour of European film festivals the last month or so, WB SVP for Corporate Legal Wayne M. Smith wrote in a September 8 letter that ‚Äúwe require Mr. Depp to be in the United Kingdom from September 17 through the anticipated end of production in mid-February, 2021.‚Äù

Citing the backlogs COVID-19 has caused in the courts, Judge White¬†on September 11¬†shoved the previously much delayed trial from its anticipated January 2021 start to May 3 next year. Under that timeline, Depp‚Äôs deposition desired dates would have taken place mere weeks before the trial began ‚Äì a state of affairs that Heard‚Äôs attorneys claim gave them little time.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bs7Fhc5UbUk/default.jpg,120,90,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bs7Fhc5UbUk/mqdefault.jpg,320,180,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bs7Fhc5UbUk/hqdefault.jpg,480,360,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bs7Fhc5UbUk/sddefault.jpg,640.0,480.0,,,,All In One „Äãworld Info,,24,none,Johnny Depp Ordered To Sit For Deposition In $50M Amber Heard Defamation Case,"After months of slipping out of having to actually sit down for the $50 million defamation lawsuit that he launched against¬†Amber Heard,¬†Johnny Depp¬†may have run out of moves.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

Elon Musk Set To Testify Against Amber Heard & Defend Johnny Depp

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5xAuPZaoI8

Divorce is never easy, and when it comes to celebrity divorce, public attention is added to the whole nightmare that follows the process. Of course, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard‚Äôs split is certainly no exception. Even though their legal battle has already lasted years, there's a little chance that new participants of the case, like Tesla CEO Elon Musk and actor James Franco, end up testifying in the court case against Amber Heard?
According to court documents obtained by Us Weekly, James Franco and Elon Musk were subpoenaed on October 26, 2021. They were ordered to ‚Äúproduce the books, record, electronically stored information and tangible things designated and described‚Äù ‚Äî including ‚Äúverbal conversations, telephone calls, letters, emails, memoranda and reports‚Äù ‚Äî by January 17, 2022. As we have already spoken in details about James Franco being dragged to the case in the previous video (if you haven‚Äôt seen it, you definitely should), in this episode we are going to reveal all the details about Elon Musk‚Äôs who once challenged Johnny Depp to a cage fight. 
Johnny Depp‚Äôs legal team is interested in speaking with Elon Mus kand James Franco because they may have a really important information that can help the case going. Here is an official Adam Waldman‚Äôs (JD‚Äôs lawyer) statement: ‚ÄúWe are interested in James Franco and Elon Musk as fact witnesses because we have evidence they are men who saw Amber Heard‚Äôs face in the days and nights between when she claimed Mr. Depp smashed her in the face on May 21 and when she went to court with painted on ‚Äòbruises‚Äô to obtain temporary restraining order on May 27‚Äù.
The Tesla billionaire Elon Musk has been involved in Johnny Depp and Amber Heard‚Äôs case once again and this time around his connection to Amber/Johnny drama is a little bit different than previously. In short, Elon Musk has been involved to the entire scandal because he dated Amber Heard after the former couple‚Äôs split. Elon was first dragged into the dispute last year when Johnny Depp issued subpoena against him. This was part from a separate legal battle between the former couple in the US. 
But what does Elon have to do with everything that happens on the first place? Well, Elon Musk and Amber Heard had a short-lived romance after her marriage to Johnny Depp collapsed in 2016. However, though JD repeatedly has alleged that Elon and Amber Heard were romantically involved while before their split. Elon Musk has always denied these claims and even joked last summer about settling things with Johnny Depp in a ‚Äúcage fight‚Äù when his name kept coming up at the ongoing UK libel trial. 
Moreover, when Amber and JD‚Äôs relationship began to fall apart, Amber was trying to get a restraining order against Johnny Depp and when she decided to this, she shared her thoughts about it with Elon Musk. After she revealed him her thoughts, he offered to pay and provide her with 24-hour security. Moreover, the High Court was told that Elon Musk became a regular late-night visitor to Amber Heard monthly. And allegedly, it all started way back in 2015. And you probably remember that ‚Äòtriangle‚Äô scandal, involving Elon Musk, Amber Heard and British supermodel Cara Delevingne.Well, so many views and opinions. Bit I want to know your thoughts about the entire situation! Do you think Elon Musk‚Äôs testimony will help Johnny Depp win the court case? Or the fact that Elon Musk will appear in court will make things only worse for the actor? Let me know your opinion in the comments section down below.

The 'Pirates of the Caribbean' actor is suing his ex-wife for libel and has claimed she doctored photos to make it look like he had assaulted her, and so a court has now agreed to his request for lawyers to examine her mobile use as he wants to prove his forgery claim.
His lawyer, Benjamin Chew, said: ""Ms Heard‚Äôs counsel has repeatedly used these phony photographs at deposition.‚Äù 
The lawyer also claimed Los Angeles police had ""disavowed the photographs‚Äù and ‚Äúdid not depict what they saw‚Äù.
He added: ""[Police] found no injury upon Ms. Heard and no disruption to the penthouses. 
‚ÄúMs. Heard and her friends then fabricated photos that she used to obtain an ex parte TRO [temporary restraining order] and a $7 million divorce settlement which Ms. Heard falsely testified in London she gave to the ACLU and, more scandalously, to the Children‚Äôs Hospital of Los Angeles; sick children with cancer.""
The lawyer had argued earlier images handed over had no metadata so their expert, Brian Neumeister, could not verify the details.
The lawyer said: ""Mr. Neumeister‚Äôs preliminary investigation shows that a number of the photographs have been run through a photo ‚Äî a photo editing application called Photo 3 that can easily manipulate images such as showing bruises where none actually existed.""
And he insisted in last year's libel trial with The Sun newspaper - who Johnny unsuccessfully sued after they branded him a ""wife beater"" - the publication's own expert concluded photos allegedly depicting the 'Danish Girl' star's 2015 injuries were ""manipulated three years later"".
He added: ‚ÄúAs such, any editing of the trial bundle versions would have been on or after Oct. 6 2018.
‚ÄúSo Ms. Heard or someone on her behalf doctored those photographs three years later. When that came up in her testimony in London, Ms. Heard falsely denied it. In short, Your Honour, without forensic imaging Mr. Neumeister cannot properly assess or verify Ms. Heard‚Äôs data.""
An expert will now be able to look at the phone to examine if the photos had been fabricated, but the judge denied a request from the 'Aquaman' actress' team to have Johnny hand over his phone and laptop, saying they had asked for ""too broad"" a search.
Amber's lawyers have hit back and accused the 58-year-old star of failing to support the ""authenticity"" of his own evidence.
Her attorney said: ‚ÄúAmber Heard remains willing and able to support the authenticity of her evidence, and her IT forensics expert has cooperated in this effort.
""In sharp contrast, Mr Depp has been unable to produce even the audio tapes from which he leaked a partial out-of-context portion, much less any support for the authenticity of any of his evidence.‚Äù
The lawsuit relates to a December 2019 op-ed Amber penned for the Washington Post, in which the 35-year-old star wrote she had ‚Äúbecome a public figure representing domestic abuse"", though she didn't mention her ex-husband by name.
The suit claims the 'Black Mass' star has suffered financial losses as a result of the accusations.

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

The DC Extended Universe is quickly ramping up a massive, new slate of projects that are set to release over the next couple of years starting off with Wonder Woman 1984, which hopes to debut in theaters before the end of 2020. Amongst other exciting sequels and debut franchises will be the much anticipated Aquaman 2 continuing on from 2018's Aquaman, which became the highest-grossing DCEU movie to date and the first to cross $1 billion at the global box office.

Information regarding this sequel is scarce at the moment due to its release being over two years away, although James Wan is confirmed to return as the director. The film's starring actor Jason Momoa will additionally be taking on writing duties with David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick as he suits up for his fourth appearance as the King of Atlantis, and he will serve as an executive producer on the film as well.

More news has arrived on another star from the first movie to confirm her return for the sequel, even though it comes alongside some major controversy.

In a new interview with Entertainment Weekly, DC Extended Universe star Amber Heard confirmed that she will return as Mera for the upcoming untitled Aquaman sequel. Heard also revealed that the film is hoping to start on production sometime next year, and she said

""I'm super excited about the amount of fan love and the amount of fan appreciation that Aquaman has acquired and that it has garnered so much excitement for Aquaman and Mera that it means we'll be coming back. I'm so excited to film that.""

This news arrives following reports that Heard was included as a part of the reshoots for the Snyder Cut of Justice League. It also comes in the midst of an ongoing legal battle with her ex-husband Johnny Depp, which has led to petitions for her removal from the movie and has been signed by over 1 million people this far.

Even though actor's off-screen lives usually don't factor too much into studio decisions on casting, as is usually the case with fan petitions, this is an extremely interesting case considering the circumstances of Amber Heard's legal situation at the moment. The UK courts recently ruled in her favor against Johnny Depp, even considering the mountain of evidence that she may have been the one in the wrong, and the cries from fans to see her replaced as Mera in the DCEU have been overwhelming.

Nevertheless, Heard seems excited and grateful to be a part of the upcoming Aquaman sequel, which is currently in its earliest stages of development. She joins Jason Momoa and Patrick Wilson as the only confirmed cast members to return for the sequel, which is set to expand mightily on the world beneath the ocean waves. The central plot of Aquaman 2 will explore the far reaches of the other Seven Kingdoms of Atlantis, and it will be exciting to find out more details as they come.

The untitled Aquaman sequel is hopeful to begin production in 2021 as it prepares for worldwide release on December 16, 2022.

It also comes in the midst of an ongoing legal battle with her ex-husband Johnny Depp, which has led to petitions for her removal from the movie and has been signed by over 1 million people this far.

Even though actor's off-screen lives usually don't factor too much into studio decisions on casting, as is usually the case with fan petitions, this is an extremely interesting case considering the circumstances of Amber Heard's legal situation at the moment. The UK courts recently ruled in her favor against Johnny Depp, even considering the mountain of evidence that she may have been the one in the wrong, and the cries from fans to see her replaced as Mera in the DCEU have been overwhelming.

Nevertheless, Heard seems excited and grateful to be a part of the upcoming Aquaman sequel, which is currently in its earliest stages of development. She joins Jason Momoa and Patrick Wilson as the only confirmed cast members to return for the sequel, which is set to expand mightily on the world beneath the ocean waves. The central plot of Aquaman 2 will explore the far reaches of the other Seven Kingdoms of Atlantis, and it will be exciting to find out more details as they come.

The untitled Aquaman sequel is hopeful to begin production in 2021 as it prepares for worldwide release on December 16, 2022.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

Today Sheriff Royce Toney was supposed to speak out about the divorce suit where his name appears in‚Äîduring a scheduled deposition.

But Sheriff Toney stood up the divorce attorney for the other side by not showing up to the deposition‚Äînow attorney Laurie Burkett slapped Sheriff Toney with a rule of contempt and other penalties, according to court documents obtained by NBC 10.

Back in early December, businessman Larry Culp alleged that his wife, Laurie, and Sheriff Royce Toney had a secret sexual affair that lasted two years, according to a divorce petition.

On Jan. 21, Royce Toney was scheduled for a deposition at attorney Laurie Burkett's law office in Monroe, but he was a no-show.

Additionally, an attorney asked Sheriff Toney to bring bills, photos, and videotapes, which would support allegations that the affair happened in a variety of places, including the sheriff's personal office, the Rifle Range, and the sheriff's office's training facility.

Royce Toney's attorney, Brian Crawford, told NBC 10 that the sheriff didn't appear at the deposition because a judge hasn't ruled on previous motions and protective orders related to the case.

On January 7, the date both sides were scheduled to a hearing to determine whether the deposition would occur in the first place. But the sheriff's attorney says it had to be postponed because Laurie Burkett was sick.

Crawford says Sheriff Toney would comply with a subpoena, as long as a judge determines there is a legal basis for the sheriff to testify.

In the rule of contempt attorney Laurie Burkett filed today, it states, ""It is clear that Royce Toney believes he can do whatever he wants in defiance of the court's orders.""

Burkett is asking that Sheriff Toney be found in contempt, and to reimburse Larry Culp for attorney's fees, and costs for violating the subpoena.

Burkett is also asking that Royce Toney appear in court in front of a judge Feb. 15, to show why he shouldn't be found in contempt for disobeying a court order.

Ouachita Parish Sheriff's Deputy Scott Smith is also ordered to appear in Burkett's office to testify Jan. 28 next week.

When it comes to actors, there are all sorts of reasons that they wouldn't want to work with one another. But easily one of the biggest of the lot is that they know something about them that they find disturbing or unsettling or just in general clashes with who they are as a person. So to hear that someone doesn't want to work with someone is more about context than the clash itself. When it comes to James Franco though, there are some are coming out and saying they won't work with him because of the accusations he's been accused of, and more. We'll break it down for you.

According to the Cuyahoga County Prosecutor‚Äôs Office, the teen was 15 years old at the time of the alleged Dec. 2017 incident. She filed a report with her local police department in Canada in Oct. 2018. This report regarded an incident that allegedly happened the year before at a nightclub in Cleveland, Ohio.

‚ÄúCanadian authorities contacted the Cleveland Division of Police who conducted a subsequent investigation,‚Äù said prosecutor‚Äôs office spokesman Tyler Sinclair in an email to Law&Crime. ‚ÄúThat investigation revealed that the victim, who had established a relationship with Bell several years prior, attended his concert in December 2017. While there, Bell violated his duty of care and, in doing so, created a risk of harm to the victim. The investigation also revealed that months leading up to the concert, Bell sent the victim inappropriate social media messages.‚Äù

In addition to being an actor, Bell is a musician.

Bell pleaded not guilty at his arraignment on Thursday. The defendant is charged with attempted endangering children (a felony), and disseminating matter harmful to juveniles (a misdemeanor).

Bell‚Äôs attorney Ian Friedman indicated that all facts will be revealed in court, but he has no additional comment, said a statement from law firm Friedman & Nemecek.

Ex-girlfriend Melissa Lingafelt said last year that Bell was verbally and physically abusive.

He denied wrongdoing.

‚ÄúAs our relationship ended ‚Äî more than a decade ago ‚Äî we, unfortunately, both called each other terrible names, as often happens when couples are breaking up,‚Äù Bell said in a statement to People. ‚ÄúBut that is it.‚Äù

Les Mis√©rables (/le…™ Àåm…™z…ôÀàr…ëÀêb…ôl, -bl…ô/, French: [le mize Åabl(…ô)]) is a French historical novel by Victor Hugo, first published in 1862, that is considered one of the greatest novels of the 19th century.

In the English-speaking world, the novel is usually referred to by its original French title. However, several alternatives have been used, including The Miserables, The Wretched, The Miserable Ones, The Poor Ones, The Wretched Poor, The Victims and The Dispossessed. Beginning in 1815 and culminating in the 1832 June Rebellion in Paris, the novel follows the lives and interactions of several characters, particularly the struggles of ex-convict Jean Valjean and his experience of redemption.

Examining the nature of law and grace, the novel elaborates upon the history of France, the architecture and urban design of Paris, politics, moral philosophy, antimonarchism, justice, religion, and the types and nature of romantic and familial love. Les Mis√©rables has been popularized through numerous adaptations for film, television and the stage, including a musical.

Witness Preparation
Deposition Mistakes: Joe's demeanor is unprofessional. He rubs his face and appears to be annoyed. This type of nonverbal communication is usually a turnoff for jurors. 
He stretches then rubs the back of his neck, which signals to opposing counsel that he's tired, disengaged, and his guard is down (i.e., time to attack). It also looks unprofessional.
Joe looks at his own attorney while answering, which jurors often interpret as ""looking for the answer,"" or ""looking for cues."" 
Joe's answers in this clip are bad. He's asked whether the lawsuit was already pending at the time he distributed photographs (the topic at issue in the copyright case). He agrees by saying ""yeah."" Next, opposing counsel inserts the premise that Joe was aware Big Cat Rescue didn't authorize the use of the photographs, to which Joe agrees. Joe then tries to outwit the attorney and somehow dodge liability by saying ""yeah, except I didn't make these."" But then the attorney gets Joe to admit that he participated in the demonstration and handed out the photos. Joe then denies handing out the photos because he was ""the one in the bunny suit."" The whole sequence is messy, contains contradictory testimony, and would likely annoy a jury.

Johnny Depp‚Äòs libel case against The Sun went into trial last week and the latest development involves an entry out of Amber Heard‚Äôs personal diary which details one of their violent fights.

The two sides have presented a lot of evidence and arguments to support their claims, and none have been anything short of controversial to this point. At first, the attorneys for NGN, representing the publication, asked the Pirates of the Caribbean star about two instances where he allegedly slapped his former wife and jokingly threatened to throw her dog out the window. Depp, meanwhile, discussed Heard‚Äôs 30th birthday, when she defecated in his bed the morning after. And let‚Äôs not get started on the actor claiming his wife cheated on him with James Franco or the defendants bringing up Depp and Bettany‚Äôs private text messages to prove that he was abusive towards the Aquaman actress.

If you don't get the significance - this video was made in 2013. PROOF that for 6 years several Anne Arundel County police officers would lie to the Morris family and the public about why there are missing pieces of the surveillance footage of the death scene of Kathy Morris. But why? Please share this and stay tuned for more!

A mother becomes private investigator and civil rights advocate following the mishandling of her daughters death investigation. The night Katherine dies her car was under the auspices of four surveillance camera's in a busy well traveled mall parking lot on a Saturday night, from approx 6 p.m. on May 5, 2012 to about 8 a.m. May 6, 2012 . From the night of May 5, 2012 the family is only given the footage from the camera that is the farthest away from the car. The mother views the footage she is given and finds that it appears to have been tampered with. When questioned in 2012 the police will claim the missing footage is because the footage would not play because of system incompatibilities.  Then for five additional years (from 2013 to 2018) they will tell the family and the public (including the FBI) that cameras were motion sensitive so there was no footage because there was no movement in the parking lot where Katherine's body is found.  Then in October of 2018 the Chief of Police Timothy Altomare states the missing video was deleted but offers no further explanation.  Where does the truth start and where does it end?  This video has been edited for time and is the deposition of Chief Gary Lyle a 27 year veteran of the Anne Arundel County Police Department with a background in special investigations. He is being deposed under oath by the mother of the victim, Marguerite Morris who is becoming a well known advocate calling for greater police accountability and transparency.  The full length unedited version is available on youtube.  So what happened out there and when will someone on the police force speak up?  Do all ares concerning black lives matter?  Recently the Chief of Police Altomare is caught on camera during a public hearing appearing to wink and smile at the States Attorney as the Rev. Marguerite Morris comes forward to ask a question as if her efforts are an inside joke.  Whats that about?  During this same public hearing Chief Altomare says any officer found to be untruthful will be without a job.  Really?  Do black lives really matter in Anne Arundel County Maryland? No call for accountability - there will be no change.  I know I am not alone.  Got a story email forkathyssake@gmail.com  Want to help?

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

The name Johnny Depp is one of the most recognizable in the world. The 56 years old actor may be hot property in Hollywood now, but he hasn‚Äôt always been so highly regarded. Many years of offbeat film choices earned him a reputation as an outsider and it wasn‚Äôt until Pirates of the Caribbean came along that he really became a superstar. As a performer, Johnny Depp is unafraid to go the extra mile. He‚Äôs always been willing to take on the characters that nobody else would dare. It‚Äôs a quality that has earned him the respect of his peers and, even today, he remains a towering presence on screen.

http://www.coloradosupremecourt.com/pdj/Decisions/Abrams,%20Conditional%20Admission%20of%20Misconduct,%2020PDJ004,%2004-30-20.pdf

People v. Robert E. Abrams. 20PDJ004. April 30, 2020.

The Presiding Disciplinary Judge approved the parties‚Äô amended conditional admission of misconduct and suspended Robert E. Abrams (attorney registration number 37950) for one year, 90 days to be served and nine months to be stayed upon the successful completion of a two-year period of probation. The suspension took effect May 14, 2020.

Abrams committed several discrete types of misconduct in connection with his corporate representation and defense in litigation of three individuals and a corporate entity. Abrams‚Äôs continued representation of his clients, the defendants, after he was personally named as a co-defendant in the same action created a conflict of interest. He did not secure informed written consent from his clients authorizing him to continue with the representation despite the conflict.

In the same case, Abrams filed written discovery responses that violated a trial court order specifically prohibiting the parties from using ad hominem attacks, sarcastic or bombastic rhetoric, or any language that did not conform to the norms of civil discourse. Further, Abrams repeatedly disrupted his own deposition and prematurely ended the session after less than thirty minutes; the court-appointed special master then had to review the transcript, issue an order sanctioning Abrams, and personally preside over Abrams‚Äôs second deposition.

During lunch break on the second day of trial, Abrams went to opposing counsel‚Äôs office building with no legitimate reason for being in the building at that time. He rode the elevator with opposing counsel and his client (the plaintiff in the case), over objections from opposing counsel and a security guard. Abrams was disruptive to and confrontational with people in opposing counsel‚Äôs office. Based on this conduct, the trial court entered a restraining order against Abrams, listing opposing counsel as the protected party.

Finally, Abrams recklessly and falsely submitted to the court an affidavit that contained inaccurate information.

Through this conduct, Abrams violated Colo. RPC 1.7(a)(2) (a lawyer shall not represent a client if the representation will be materially limited by the lawyer‚Äôs responsibilities to another client or by the lawyer‚Äôs personal interests); Colo. RPC 3.4(c) (a lawyer shall not knowingly disobey an obligation under the rules of a tribunal); Colo. RPC 8.4(c) (providing that it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to engage in conduct involving dishonesty,
fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation); and Colo. RPC 8.4(d) (providing that it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to engage in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice).

Until he began crying, Rittenhouse had been recounting his steps leading up to the moments he opened fire. Rittenhouse also described his prior encounters with Joseph Rosenbaum, the first man he shot, saying that Rosenbaum had been screaming threats at Rittenhouse and others on the streets that night.

Legal experts have said the case effectively boils down to whether jurors believe his self-defense claims, which makes his testimony crucial. Jurors will weigh whether they agree Rittenhouse believed he feared for his safety or life, and his testimony provides them a key window into what he says went through his mind each time he pulled the trigger.

This may go down as one of the funniest depositions in history. In a deposition that Lil Wayne gave related to a lawsuit he filed against Quincy Jones III over his 2009 documentary The Carter, Lil Wayne gives hilarious non-answers to the attorney.

TMZ reports that Johnny Depp‚Äôs lawyer plan to ‚Äúgrill‚Äù heard on her claims of physical abuse against her estranged husband with inquiries in reference to statements from police and witnesses who allege that she showed no signs of injury and that the condition of her Los Angeles loft did not indicate that there had been a physical fight.

Both parties would have to sign off to allow Depp to be physically present at the deposition given the active restraining order that has been placed against him. Sources tell TMZ that Heard‚Äôs lawyer ‚Äúwill not object‚Äù to Depp being at the table.

Depp will have to attend his own deposition next week and, according to TMZ‚Äôs sources, settlement discussions are ongoing.

Paul Barresi, a former porn star and then became a private investigator, has worked for Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Eddie Murphy, and once was even hired to investigate an alleged homosexual relationship, Tom Cruise never experienced. 

He has revealed to the Daily Mail to have been contacted by the lawyers of Amber Heard, last summer, to find persons who had undergone physical abuse, or verbal by Johnny Depp, so that they can use as witnesses in legal case involving the two former couple.

Barresi went to fairly intensive lengths to uncover data on Depp, tracing again his enterprise dealings to when he co-owned fashionable a nightclub referred to as The Viper Room within the 1990s. 

But after chatting with over 100 people who labored with the actor over the previous 30 or so years, he discovered that not even one in every of them had something unhealthy to say. 

In truth, in maybe probably the most amusing part of the authorized standoff, Barresi claims that everybody he spoke to had fantastic issues to say about Depp, whereas a lot of them had overwhelmingly detrimental issues to say about Heard.
Barresi said to DailyMail.

 ‚ÄúI was in the USA, France, Italy, England, were in any place where Johnny Depp stayed, everywhere he set foot and I have not been able to find one person that will complain because of him, or a single woman who would admit to being abused by the actor. 

No one has spoken evil of him, he is like an angel. 
They spoke only of his generosity and his big heart‚Äù.

‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt discover one occasion, or not less than an admitted one, the place he was bodily abusive to a lady, smacked or crushed round, he‚Äôs like an angel. 

Not one who mentioned a deprecating factor.
I interviewed dozens of individuals, who knew him going way back to three a long time in the past, and no person had one unhealthy factor to say about him. 

In truth, they couldn‚Äôt say sufficient about his ever flowing outpouring of generosity and tender coronary heart.

Barresi has added, however, that, while speaking in a respectful manner, he doubts that many of the persons contacted may be regarded as the friends of Johnny Depp.

‚ÄúI wanted to emphasize that, in speaking with the people who know Depp from time to time, there emerges the picture of a man, generous even to a fault. 

He has covered legal expenses, medical expenses, and even paid rentals to friends. 

The irony is that they seem to be faithful until the excess towards him, but I am not convinced that they are really his friends.‚Äù


A spokesperson for Heard has denied that Barresi has had any dealings together with her or her authorized workforce since being let go someday final 12 months and claims that his account is inaccurate.




Nevertheless, it hasn‚Äôt stopped Barresi from sharing among the testimonies he claims to have obtained throughout his investigation.

Jane Galli, head of the makeup division on Metropolis Of Lies had nothing however reward for Depp. 

She had labored with him previously on Public Enemy and Pirates. She mentioned: ‚ÄòHe‚Äôs an actual sweetie.‚Äô

Metropolis of Lies director Brad Furman said Johnny was a real skilled and fantastic human being in each sense of the phrase.

Assistant director Paul Silver also said that though Johnny was not at all times on time, held up the shoot typically, he was an expert and at all times delivered.

Depp just lately gained a considerable win in his $50 million defamation lawsuit in opposition to Heard when Fairfax, Virginia County Chief Decide Bruce White denied her request for a dismissal. 

The loss for Heard provides to the allegations piling in opposition to her in current months, although it‚Äôs had no impact on Warner Brothers casting her in Aquaman 2 or L‚ÄôOreal conserving her on as their spokesperson.

JonBenet Ramsey was an American child beauty queen who died mysteriously at the age of six in her family's home in Boulder, Colorado. A lengthy handwritten ransom note was found in the home. Patricia Ramsey was an American beauty pageant winner who won the Miss West Virginia Pageant at age 20 in 1977. She was best known as the mother of JonBen√©t Ramsey. Burke Ramsay, who spoke about his six-year-old sister's unsolved case for the first time after 20 years of silence on the Dr Phil show was slammed by viewers for his ""alarming"" body language when interviewed about this cold case true crime. And now there is an abc20/20 episode asking ""Who Killed JonBenet Ramsey"".

The Behavior Panel is a group made up of the world's top body language and behavior experts, Mark Bowden, Scott Rouse, Greg Hartley, and Chase Hughes. Together they analyze the body language and behavior displayed in videos in the public interest. The Behavior Panel is a non-partisan group, looking to educate and entertain the public with their interest and expertise in nonverbal communication, body language, deception detection, interrogation, and resistance to interrogation.

By looking at the gestures, facial expressions, micro-expressions, and context around what people say, this group of nonverbal behavior experts reveals the possible truth and deceptions.

This behavior profiler group takes on the task of investigating the behavior behind the crime news that often forces us to think and feel the way we do. The Behavior Panel is a task force made up of four of the best body language and behavior profiler experts in the world.

JonBenet Ramsey was an American child beauty queen who died mysteriously at the age of six in her family's home in Boulder, Colorado. A lengthy handwritten ransom note was found in the home. Patricia Ramsey was an American beauty pageant winner who won the Miss West Virginia Pageant at age 20 in 1977. She was best known as the mother of JonBen√©t Ramsey. Burke Ramsay, who spoke about his six-year-old sister's unsolved case for the first time after 20 years of silence on the Dr Phil show was slammed by viewers for his ""alarming"" body language when interviewed about this cold case true crime. And now there is an abc20/20 episode asking ""Who Killed JonBenet Ramsey"".

The Behavior Panel is a group made up of the world's top body language and behavior experts, Mark Bowden, Scott Rouse, Greg Hartley, and Chase Hughes. Together they analyze the body language and behavior displayed in videos in the public interest. The Behavior Panel is a non-partisan group, looking to educate and entertain the public with their interest and expertise in nonverbal communication, body language, deception detection, interrogation, and resistance to interrogation.

By looking at the gestures, facial expressions, micro-expressions, and context around what people say, this group of nonverbal behavior experts reveals the possible truth and deceptions.

This behavior profiler group takes on the task of investigating the behavior behind the crime news that often forces us to think and feel the way we do. The Behavior Panel is a task force made up of four of the best body language and behavior profiler experts in the world.

So please feel free to comment with your thoughts (good or bad) and let us know what other questions you wish we‚Äôd asked. That‚Äôs the main reason we post these depositions to YouTube.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

Divorces are not only hard for the people involved, but are also messy, time consuming, and are pretty darn expensive. Especially if the divorcees are both huge people, there will be tons of dollars involved. But of all the messy divorces in the history of the entertainment industry, there will surely always be a couple that would dominate the list. From the scandalous split of Real Housewives of Beverly Hills cast Erika Jayne and her lawyer husband Tom Gerardi, to the heartbreaking separations of all time couple favorite Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, down to big industry names like Yolanda Hadid and David Foster, celebrity divorces are usually messy. And more often than not, they take up headlines for weeks. However, if there are two big names dominating the world of the ugliest divorces in Hollywood today, there might be no one else that may top off Johnny Depp and Amber Heard‚Äôs divorce, which consequences are still being faced in an ongoing lawsuit up to this day. So of all these chaotic celebrity divorces, where do you think Amber Heard and Johnny Depp‚Äôs situation fall down? Is their situation really topsy turvy enough to top the worst couples who got divorced? Let‚Äôs find the answer to that in this video. But before anything else, make sure first to hit that subscribe button and smash that notification bell for more updates on Johnny Depp and Amber Heard‚Äôs lawsuit case, and some other divorces that are dominating the internet today. Now, let‚Äôs dig in!

First, to be able to determine if Johnny and Amber‚Äôs messy marriage and divorce really does qualify to top this roster of the ugliest Hollywood divorces, let‚Äôs go back to the very beginning. Johnny Depp has been in the height of his career in the industry for many, many years now. This helped Johnny begin his acting career, landing more minor roles and then major ones. He also played a few roles with Helena Bonham Carter in many Tim Burton films such as Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Alice in Wonderland and Alice Through the Looking Glass, Corpse Bride, Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, and Dark Shadows. One of the most widely-known appearances of Johnny Depp that perhaps brought him the largest commercial and critical success was the Disney media franchise ‚ÄúPirates of the Caribbean‚Äù series, where he landed and reprised his lead role for all five movies that ran from 2003 to 2017.

Amber Heard, on the other hand, started her acting career in 2003, first by appearing in two music videos, and then later on landing small supporting roles in three various television series. This then later on elevated her to more film and television roles, both supporting and lead actress. Her latest film that hit commercial success was the 2018 DC movie ‚ÄúAquaman‚Äù, where she co-starred alongside Jason Momoa as Mera, the Atlantean Queen. Johnny and Amber first ignited a spark between them when they starred together in the 2011 comedy-drama film, The Rum Diary. The on-screen love story between the two has quickly travelled to real life.

In 2021, the 50 million dollar lawsuit has progressed in court, and there has been evidence that are springing out here and there that are helpful to the case of the former couple, including the recorded phone call where Despite all the evidence, since the lawsuit has not yet reached its final stage, Johnny is still currently enduring the blow of this predicament to his career, as it was also announced by Disney that Depp was relieved of his role as Jack Sparrow, one of his most famous roles in history.

As Amber Heard‚Äôs new movie, Aquaman 2, is about to be released by next year under the same production company that fired Johnny, the whole world of the internet is outraged. Because of this, the former couple‚Äôs divorce that happened in 2016 and has been finalized in 2017 still remains to be a hot topic during these days. Every now and then, new information and updates are surfacing about the couple, new evidences circulate as well, so it‚Äôs a little impossible for them not to hit the headlines all the time. In fact, Amber Heard even dropped some huge news just a couple of months ago.

That‚Äôs all for today, we hope you enjoyed that video, and if you agree that Johnny and Amber‚Äôs divorce counts as the worst, hit that like and subscribe button and smash that notification bell for more videos like this.

So today I reacted to the press conference Amber Heard held outside UK High Court today during Johnny Depp's team presenting his final closing arguments. Not only was it disrespectful, but it was a calculated PR move made with the interest of self preservation and done as a ""hail mary."" The fact it was immediately uploaded to the Sun's youtube channel is very telling.

A man who stalked and secretly shot nude videos of sportscaster and TV host Erin Andrews says the plan was to sell the recordings because he needed the money.
A recorded deposition of Michael David Barrett was played Monday for jurors during Andrews' civil trial in Nashville, Tennessee. She is suing Barrett and a hotel owner and operator for $75 million (USD).
Barrett said he posted the recordings online after celebrity gossip website TMZ refused to buy it. The only reason he picked Andrews was because she was popular and he saw that she was trending on Yahoo, he said.
Barrett spent 2 1/2 years in federal prison after he admitted to renting hotel rooms next to the Andrews three times and shooting nude videos of her in Nashville and Columbus, Ohio, and posting them on the Internet.
Andrews has sued Barrett and the owner and manager of the Marriott at Vanderbilt. The Nashville hotel is a franchise.
The hotel companies say Barrett is solely to blame and he alone should be held responsible.

The doc ""Crime Scene"" set out to shed light on the mystery of Lam's untimely passing, but in doing so, pushed many people to question the story even further. One aspect of suspicion is the behavior of the hotel manager, Amy Price. During the documentary, her nonverbal communication strikes many as very odd. Due to popular request, I have decided to look into the case myself and offer my opinion as to why everyone is so suspicious of the manager of the infamous Cecil Hotel.

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

Johnny Depp said Tuesday that his ex-wife Amber Heard had made ‚Äúsick‚Äù claims of abuse and falsely branded him a monster, as the actor testified in a U.K. libel case that hinges on who was the aggressor in the celebrity couple‚Äôs violent, toxic relationship 
¬†¬†
Depp is suing British tabloid The Sun over an April 2018 story headlined ‚ÄúPotty - How can JK Rowling be ‚Äògenuinely happy‚Äô casting wife beater Johnny Depp in the new Fantastic Beasts film?‚Äù
¬†¬†
The ‚ÄúPirates of the Caribbean‚Äù star strongly denies Heard's claims that he assaulted her during their tempestuous marriage, and sued The Sun's publisher, News Group Newspapers, and its executive editor, Dan Wootton.
¬†¬†
‚ÄúThese sick claims are totally untrue,‚Äù Depp said in a written witness statement, adding that Heard's allegations hurt his career and had ‚Äúbeen a constant issue in my casting.‚Äù
¬†¬†
A three-week trial over his libel claims opened Tuesday. The trial is one of the first to be held in person since Britain began to lift its coronavirus lockdown.
¬†¬†
Depp entered the witness box of the wood-paneled courtroom wearing a dark suit and tie, and began by taking the court oath and giving his full name: John Christopher Depp II.
¬†¬†
He told the court that Heard had ‚Äúsaid to the world that she was in fear of her life from me, and I had been this horrible monster, if you will. Which was not the case.‚Äù
¬†¬†
Depp, 57, and Heard, 34, met on the set of the 2011 comedy ‚ÄúThe Rum Diary‚Äù and married in Los Angeles in February 2015. They divorced in 2017, and now bitterly accuse one another of abuse.
¬†¬†
Depp and Heard arrived by separate entrances at the neo-Gothic court building. Both wore face coverings over their noses and mouths as they arrived. Proceedings have been spread over several courtrooms to allow for social distancing.
¬†¬†
While Heard isn't on trial, the case is also a showdown between the former spouses, who accuse each other of being controlling, violent and untruthful. It is set to put the two performers‚Äô complex private lives under a microscope.
¬†¬†
The Sun's defense relies on Heard's allegations of 14 incidents of violence by Depp between 2013 and 2016, in locations including Los Angeles, Australia, Japan, the Bahamas and a chartered jet. He denies them all and says Heard, an actress and model, attacked him with items including a drink can and a cigarette. He also claims that on one occasion Heard or one of her friends defecated on his bed.
¬†¬†
In written witness statements, Depp said that in Australia in 2015 Heard severed the tip of his finger by hurling a vodka bottle at him. A photo of the bloody digit was included with his witness statement.
¬†¬†
Depp claimed that on another occasion, Heard repeatedly punched him in the face on a private jet, forcing him to spend the flight locked in the plane‚Äôs bathroom.
¬†¬†
‚ÄúRage-filled violent incidents on planes were common with Amber,‚Äù he said in the written statement.
¬†¬†
Describing one incident in which Heard claims he hit her, Depp said the opposite was true.
¬†¬†
‚ÄúAs things tended to do, (it) escalated and got physical, ending with a bit of assault. Ms. Heard struck me,‚Äù he said.
¬†¬†
He painted himself as a peacemaker who tried to remove himself from conflicts ""before things got out of hand.‚Äù
¬†¬†
In a written statement, Depp alleged that Heard was ‚Äúa calculating, diagnosed borderline personality; she is sociopathic; she is a narcissist; and she is completely emotionally dishonest."" 
¬†¬†
¬†¬†
Heard alleges that Depp was prone to drink- and drug-fueled violent rages.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

Now it turns out that Amber Heard may have not written the statement or OP ED in accusations against Johnny Depp. This could another case of defamation or fraud. Let's break it down in today's video.

Subscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Screenrant

Family Guy is one of those shows that has never been afraid to push some buttons and get a reaction from it‚Äôs viewers and critics alike. And that‚Äôs why we love it! They will say just about anything about anyone, and make no apologies. But sometimes, certain scenes just prove too much for the network to handle, and there are a ton of jokes that never make it to air. Whether it‚Äôs Peter with an offensive tattoo, a super graphic hallucination of Peter‚Äôs behind turning into a fly and trying to eat Quagmire, Peter being present at the Roe V Wade Supreme Court case, or Cleveland and Peter doing ten rounds of chemotherapy together for no apparent reason. There was also the scene that had Meg being shot in the head at the dinner table, a joke about an Asian in-law, Peter finding out if Jillian is Jewish, Dr Hartmann eating Lois‚Äô tumour, Peter commenting on the race of Brian‚Äôs girlfriend, a Leper colony doing the hokey-pokey, or Quagmire making a very weird comment about when his daughter will turn 21. It doesn‚Äôt stop there, as with a scene with Jesus trying to pick up a girl, a political joke about how iPads are made, a cutaway during the already controversial Stroke episode, a scene with a missionary that might have offended some, a bit where Joe runs over a squirrel, and of course, about a million jokes about Mort that were never made it to air. All those and more remind us just why Family Guy is still one of the edgiest shows out there!

For as long as one can remember, celebrities have not always had it the easiest when it came to making several attempts to stay out of the spotlight. Not only do people strive to expose celebrities for their past wrongdoings, but they also try to warn others about their past in order to update them on what they can possibly expect from a certain individual. Sometimes these individuals who come forward to express concerns about certain celebrities also happen to be a celebrity themselves, which makes the situation even more known to others. When the 35 year old actor and singer, Drake Bell, pleaded guilty to several different charges, one which included child endangerment, fans were left in shock. However there were some celebs who had already come forward to express some concern in regard to Drake Bell and his behavior before this whole situation went down.

Psychopathy is a neuropsychiatric disorder marked by deficient emotional responses, lack of empathy, and poor behavioral controls, commonly resulting in persistent antisocial deviance and criminal behavior. Accumulating research suggests that psychopathy follows a developmental trajectory with strong genetic influences, and which precipitates deleterious effects on widespread functional networks, particularly within paralimbic regions of the brain. While traditional therapeutic interventions commonly administered in prisons and forensic institutions have been notoriously ineffective at combating these outcomes, alternative strategies informed by an understanding of these specific neuropsychological obstacles to healthy development, and which target younger individuals with nascent symptoms of psychopathy are more promising. 

This video features interviews with Chris Watts, Erin Caffey, Robert Durst, Darlie Routier, Richard Ramirez, Colonel Russel Williams and many more. This video is to help with mental health awareness.

Transcription

-----

Amber Heard arrived at a scheduled deposition at 10:00 on Saturday in Los Angeles, as part of an ongoing and increasingly messy divorce with Johnny Depp.

Amber, aged 30, has accused Johnny Depp of domestic violence, and filed for divorce from the actor on May 25, two days later, she filed a domestic violence restraining order against Depp.

The actress flew into Los Angeles on Friday night after telling the judge that she couldn‚Äôt make the deposition scheduled for earlier that day due to an ‚Äúemergency‚Äù that prevented her from catching her flight on time.

A week ago she showed up for a deposition, but according to TMZ, refused to enter the conference room where lawyers and videographer were present.

The actress allegedly cried and screamed, and refused to submit to questioning.

Amber Heard arrived at a scheduled deposition at 10:00 on Saturday in Los Angeles, as part of an ongoing and increasingly messy divorce with Johnny Depp.

Amber, aged 30, has accused Johnny Depp of domestic violence, and filed for divorce from the actor on May 25, two days later, she filed a domestic violence restraining order against Depp.

The actress flew into Los Angeles on Friday night after telling the judge that she couldn‚Äôt make the deposition scheduled for earlier that day due to an ‚Äúemergency‚Äù that prevented her from catching her flight on time.

A week ago she showed up for a deposition, but according to TMZ, refused to enter the conference room where lawyers and videographer were present.

The actress allegedly cried and screamed, and refused to submit to questioning.

He had been involved in the decisionmaking about the Jeep ""recall"" that had to be done because the gas tanks were getting crushed in rear impact.  He was a high-ranking adviser to Chairman and CEO Sergio Marchionne, who made the ultimate decision regarding trailer hitches.

Jeep manufactured and sold millions of SUVs with gas tanks located in the extreme rear of the vehicle, behind the rear axle and right next to the plastic ""bumper.""  These gas tanks are exposed to rear impact, like the gas tanks on the 1970s-era Ford Pinto.  When these Jeeps get rear-ended, the plastic gas tanks can rupture, spraying gasoline on the roadway and on both vehicles.  If the gasoline catches fire and the people can't escape in time, the occupants the Jeep and the other vehicle can burn to death.

This has happened over and over again.

In 2013, the company that owns Jeep, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (""FCA""), finally agreed to recall at least some of these Jeeps with exposed gas tanks.  But FCA did not buy the Jeeps back or move the gas tank.  Instead, FCA offered free trailer hitches to some Jeep owners.  That did not fix the problem‚Äîand FCA knew that it wouldn't.  Just two years before, an FCA executive had testified under oath that ""the tow package does not protect the tank.""

The Jeeps with exposed gas tanks are the 2002-2007 Jeep Liberty, 1993-2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee, 1993-2001 Jeep Cherokee, and 1987-2007 Jeep Wrangler.  Millions of these Jeeps remain on the road.

FCA has refused to take any further action.  FCA claims that thesee Jeeps are ""absolutely safe.""  In our pending litigation against FCA over these Jeep fires, FCA denies any wrongdoing.  FCA refuses declines to accept any responsibility for the hundreds of Jeep fires.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

Loyd also shot Dixon's brother, Ronald Stewart, however Stewart survived, and along with other family members immediately identified Loyd as the person responsible. Based upon their testimony, Detective Brian Savelli of the Orange County Sheriff's Office obtained an arrest warrant charging Markeith Loyd with First Degree Murder. OCSO released Loyd's name and driver's license photograph to local media the day after the homicide, asking for assistance from the community.

On January 9, 2017, at approximately 7:15 am, a witness was shopping inside a Walmart store located at 3101 W. Princeton Street. While waiting to pay at register #2 , a black male wearing a black shirt with the word ""SECURITY"" on the front, stood behind her with his cart. The witness knew Markeith Loyd by name and face and was aware of his outstanding warrant, and  immediately recognized the customer behind her as Markeith Loyd.

As she paid, the witness spotted Orlando Police Sergeant Debra Clayton exiting the store. She had just purchased several small items from register #18 and was walking towards the north exit of the store adjacent to the produce section. The witness exited the store through the same door and approached Sergeant Clayton, informing her of Loyd's presence in the store.

Sergeant Clayton requested emergency radio traffic for an attempt to contact a possible homicide suspect. Eight seconds later, Officer Brandon Thornton, a member of her patrol squad, broke from his call and began traveling to her location. OPD Communications then established emergency radio traffic on the, ""Emergency North"" channel with responding units as well as Sergeant Clayton switching over to this channel. Units on the emergency channel began asking Sergeant Clayton for her exact location.

Fifty seconds into the call, Sergeant Clayton stated, ""I guess we're looking for a Markeith. He's walking out the door right now. I guess he was involved in shooting with a pregnant female. I am at the first entrance."" At one minute, fourteen seconds, she transmitted, ""Foot pursuit!"" followed by the sounds of three gunshots in the background. That was her last radio transmission. Dispatcher Patricia Monahan is heard asking, ""B20, you 10-4?"" But Sergeant Clayton was dead. And Loyd had managed to escape.

On January 17, 2017, members of the U.S. Marshals Fugitive Investigative Unit located Markeith Loyd in an abandoned house at 1157 Lescot Lane in Orlando's Carver Shores neighborhood. Loyd was observed dropping two handguns from the window of what was later determined to be the bedroom directly south of the entry door. Loyd then complied with commands and crawled on his stomach from the entry door to awaiting officers where he was placed under arrest. Loyd was wearing an American Body Armor (ABA) level IIIA bullet-resistant vest is at the time of his arrest, rated to stop all handgun ammunition commonly used by law enforcement. The firearms would remain on the ground where they had been dropped until a search warrant for the residence was executed later that evening. After being secured he was transported to the Orlando Police Headquarters for interrogation by Detectives Danny Garcia-Pagan and Pete Cadiz.

This is the interrogation of Markeith Loyd.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

The famous filed by Johnny Depp for a whopping 50 million against Amber along with the case, which Johnny was losing tremendously, is constantly making headlines with its new developments making their way onto the news from time to time. In complete honesty, the storyline of these events between the pair could quite easily be converted into a telenovela show provided a great director is ready to take up this venture. 

Yes, we are talking about the alleged charity donation that Amber Heard was going to make with the 7 million she scored from the divorce settlement. Amber had stated that she wasn‚Äôt comfortable keeping the money of her domestic abuser with her and chose to give it towards a better cause.

The trial of the highly destructive case was clearly not in favor of Johnny according to both him as well as his barrister Andrew Caldecott QC. But with fresh evidence on the table, things may actually look brighter for Johnny‚Äôs fate in the case. 

Johnny‚Äôs team is currently trying to get back at Amber using the information with regard to her not paying off money towards the charity which she claimed she would do. Amber had publicly announced that she would be donating the 7 million towards organizations that actually needed help with funding. She claimed to have given out the money to two different social causes and organizations. The two organizations that she stated she allegedly donated to were American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the Children's Hospital Los Angeles. She even stated that her donations to ACLU were done keeping in mind the hardships she had to bear with regard to her being a victim of domestic violence and wanted similar victims to benefit from these funds. So according to our unbiased calculation, each organization should‚Äôve received 3.5 million US dollars each. 

But did that actually happen?
Knowing the recent truth about Amber coming out, it is easy enough to guess that this was a lie too. Evidence to back this claim up came when Mr. Caldecott from the Children's Hospital Los Angeles communicated with Johnny‚Äôs business advisor in 2019 claiming that no payments were made by Amber Heard towards the hospital. 

At the when the evidence was brought out, it was found out that Amber had paid just a mere 100,000 dollars towards the Children's Hospital Los Angeles and 450,000 dollars to ACLU. She also stated that she made an anonymous donation of a grand total of 500,000 dollars to ACLU, but that could pretty much be another lie too. 

Now, what did Johnny‚Äôs team have to state?
Of course, they weren‚Äôt surprised. His team stated that this was all part of the manipulation bandwagon that she has been blinding everyone with for the past few years. Even though Amber has stated that she would be giving out the donations over a course of time, many do not believe this statement of hers either. Depp‚Äôs team also spoke up about how she chose to pull off a facade in front of the public to gain sympathy from whoever she could. Not only did she do this, but also was involved in putting Johnny down and bringing her standard up in the eyes of the public. I think it is safe enough to say that the words of a gold digger are quite hard to believe, especially if they claim it is for charity, Mr Caldeco, Guess it was just bad timing for Johnny Depp, especially with the famous Me Too movement blowing up during that time. 

They first had helped put her story out through their newspaper claiming Johnny to be a ‚ÄùWife Beater‚Äù. Now, Mr. Adam Wolanski, a representative of the NGN, has stated that even though this bit of evidence can prove Amber to be a gold digger, it does not necessarily support the fact that she wasn‚Äôt going to pay what she promised, as she probably planned to do it over a course of time and not at once for her own reasons. 

A certain incident was questioned by Depp‚Äôs time, that spoke volumes about how the jury wasn‚Äôt looking into the evidence as much as they should. On a trip to Australia, Amber claimed to have a life threat against her due to the fact that she was being held hostage for three days all due to Johnny Depp. The truth behind this incident actually happening wasn‚Äôt looked into and was blindly believed by the jury, bruises. amber heard aquaman 2 jason momoa clevver news informoverload

Johnny Depp‚Äôs career has faced some major blows due to his legal battle with Amber Heard. Over the past couple of months he has lost some very major roles in films. Some of the roles he has lost include the role of Grindelwald in the Fantastic Beasts franchise. This particularly happened when he lost his libel case causing Warner bros to ask him to resign.
Then, not too long after, Disney stated that they were likely to reboot the Pirates of the Caribbean movie and were not likely to ask Johnny Depp to return as Captain Jack Sparrow. These are two major roles in two major movie franchises that Johnny Depp was kicked out of in a short period of time. While all this is happening to Johnny Depp, Amber Heard seems to have escaped the consequences of her actions and people are not happy about that. Many celebrities and fans have called out the media for showing support to Amber despite the evidence that has been brought against her. So, what exactly are the people saying?

Video deposition taken of Homestead Police Officer Alejandro Murguido on October 11th, 2017.

Pay attention to the inverted cross he has pinned to his shirt. Was he trying to send a message?

We talk about two incidents. One Murguido claims happened on July 27th, 2012. This incident never happened. 

The second incident occurred on October 29th, 2012. We had a consensual conversation, then I left and he chased me down. A recording of the conversation is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUS5EzZpwEg

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

10 Times Johnny Depp Tried To Warn Us About AH

INTRO: Johnny Depp was able to maintain his standing in the industry, but his career took a huge turn because of something he describes to be a nightmare. Throughout the rigorous battle between Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, it has been seen that the ultimate goal of his ex-wife, Heard, is to destroy his career. He has been dropping hints against Heard yet it seems to have gone unnoticed. I‚Äôll fill you in on all the details, but first, don‚Äôt forget to like and subscribe.

Johnny Depp and Amber Heard got married in February of 2015, but unfortunately, this was a marriage that did not last long as the two finalized their divorce in 2017. In just 15 months of marriage, many had discovered in the end that there was something off between the two in their marriage since it culminated in a bitter, nasty divorce. 

It seemed that Johnny Depp could have been crying out for help when they made an appearance in their apology video that was released when Heard got into some pretty big trouble for smuggling their dogs to Australia. Shortly after the incident, there was something that many were very upset about. If you paid close attention to the apology video, you could see how uneasy the two looked together. Since then, many speculated that Depp was forced to appear by Amber‚Äôs side in her apology video. Depp seemed a bit off as he tried to hide the fact that they were both going through a rough patch. Speculations towards the couple arose, as something more seemed to have happened outside of the puppy smuggling incident that took place in Australia. 

Their marriage had fallen into a downward spiral after the unfortunate legal incident. Instead of a civil split, the divorce quickly sprawled out of control for both of them. Tensions, accusations, and even legal measures had taken place, ever widening the already great gap between the two. Amber Heard started accusing Depp of several different things, successfully obtaining a restraining order against Johnny Depp. Amber claimed that she was forced to live her life in fear. However, in 2016 an ‚ÄúI want to go home‚Äù statement from Johnny Depp was another warning sign from him when his and Heard‚Äôs divorce was in the works.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qMnZSbMNFxY/default.jpg,120,90,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qMnZSbMNFxY/mqdefault.jpg,320,180,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qMnZSbMNFxY/hqdefault.jpg,480,360,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qMnZSbMNFxY/sddefault.jpg,640.0,480.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qMnZSbMNFxY/maxresdefault.jpg,1280.0,720.0,Celebrity Zone,"['celebrity zone', 'celebrityzone', 'celebrity', 'amber heard', 'johnny depp', 'amber heard johnny depp', 'johnny depp amber heard', 'amber heard and johnny depp', 'amber heard aquaman', 'amber heard aquaman 2', 'amber heard fired', 'amber heard loses in court', 'johnny depp amber heard audio reaction', 'amber heard johnny depp fight video', 'amber heard interview', 'amber heard interviews', 'amber heard loses', 'amber heard elon musk', 'amber heard johnny depp court', 'amber heard in court']",22,none,10 Times Johnny Depp Tried To Warn Us About Amber Heard,"10 Times Johnny Depp Tried To Warn Us About Amber Heard

Amber Heard was born April 22, 1986 is an American actress and model. Born and raised in Texas, she made her film debut in a supporting secondary role in the sports drama Friday Night Lights (2004), followed by a series of other small roles in television and film. His first lead role was in the horror film All the Boys Love Mandy Lane (2006), but it was only released in the United States in 2013 due to distribution issues. Her second major role came in the short television series The CW Hidden Palms (2007).

Heard was in a relationship with photographer Tasya van Ree from 2008 to 2012. In 2009, Heard was arrested in Washington State for the crime of domestic violence, allegedly after grabbing van Ree and hitting his arm. Finally, no charges were laid against Heard. Police legally deleted the arrest files in 2011 after a request, but the King County District Court kept its own files. In 2016, van Ree defended Heard as the incident went public, stating that Heard had been ‚Äúunjustly‚Äù accused and that the incident had been ‚Äúmisinterpreted and overly sensationalist‚Äù.

A low-level employee isn't high-ranking enough to speak for the company, and the President or CEO might not know anything about your specific case, or might be unavailable.  To handle that issue, Rule 30(b)(6) requires that, upon request, the company must choose someone to answer questions on its behalf.  Under federal law, the citation is Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(b)6), and in Georgia it's O.C.G.A. ¬ß  9-11-30(b)(6).  This deposition is of such a person, often called a ""corporate representative"" or ""30(b)6) designee."" 

We handled a reckless driving & punitive damages case against Jimmy Johns in which a delivery person (a bicyclist) crashed into our client (a pedestrian), knocking him down and breaking his arm so severely that a plate and ten screws had to be inserted.  This video shows our deposition of Jimmy John's corporate representative.

We tried the case in the State Court of Fulton County in Atlanta, Georgia.  The jury returned a verdict of $167,000 for our client.  https://butlerfirm.com/two-successful-personal-injury-verdicts-in-three-business-days/

We‚Äôd love to hear what you think!  It helps our clients if people watch these depositions and leave comments, because that helps us to know what jurors will take away from the depositions, and what questions jurors will have after watching them.  So please feel free to comment with your thoughts (good or bad) and let us know what other questions you wish we‚Äôd asked.

P. 30(b)6), and in Georgia it's O.C.G.A. ¬ß  9-11-30(b)(6).  This deposition is of such a person, often called a ""corporate representative"" or ""30(b)6) designee."" 

We handled a reckless driving & punitive damages case against Jimmy Johns in which a delivery person (a bicyclist) crashed into our client (a pedestrian), knocking him down and breaking his arm so severely that a plate and ten screws had to be inserted.  This video shows our deposition of Jimmy John's corporate representative.

We tried the case in the State Court of Fulton County in Atlanta, Georgia.  The jury returned a verdict of $167,000 for our client.  https://butlerfirm.com/two-successful-personal-injury-verdicts-in-three-business-days/

We‚Äôd love to hear what you think!  It helps our clients if people watch these depositions and leave comments, because that helps us to know what jurors will take away from the depositions, and what questions jurors will have after watching them.  So please feel free to comment with your thoughts (good or bad) and let us know what other questions you wish we‚Äôd asked.  That‚Äôs why we post these depositions to YouTube.",,PT45M16S,2d,hd,false,False,rectangular,processed,public,youtube,True,False,False,12546,89,11,0,64,,,

Since Johnny Depp's attorneys provided video recordings of his ex-wife being abusive against her in his libel suit towards a British tabloid, Amber Heard's sister denied lying before a London judge. On Thursday night, his legal team got the video from a ""confidential"" source, just hours after Whitney Henriquez testified in court that she had never been targeted by Heard and was not afraid of her.

Depp, 57, is suing News Group Newspapers, the publisher of The Sun, and Dan Wootton, the newspaper's executive editor, for calling him a ""wife be*ter"" in an April 2018 post. Depp has testified in court that he was the one who was harassed by Heard and that she has a history of violence against him.

The American actor, producer and musician, Johnny Depp, lost a high-profile libel action against The Sun newspaper. As a result, Mr. Depp will now forever be associated with the term ‚Äòwife beater‚Äô¬†which is already having consequences for his career, and his former wife, Amber Heard, will have to continue to live with the impact of past domestic abuse. Today we are going to be talking about The CRAZY Relationship of Johnny Depp and Amber Heard. Hey everyone and welcome back to Celeb Mania! Make sure you stay until the end as you don‚Äôt want to miss the best and craziest part of the relationship between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard.

Heard met Depp while filming¬†The Rum Diary¬†in 2009, and they began living together the following year.¬†They were married in a private civil ceremony at their home in Los Angeles on February 3, 2015.¬†In April 2015, Heard and Depp breached Australia's¬†insecurity¬†laws when they failed to declare their two¬†Yorkshire terriers¬†to the¬†Australian Customs Service¬†when they flew by private jet into¬†Queensland, where he was working on¬†Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales.¬†Heard pleaded guilty to falsifying quarantine documents, stating that she had made a mistake due to sleep deprivation.¬†She was placed on a $1,000 one-month¬†good behavior bond¬†for producing a false document;¬†Heard and Depp also released a video in which they apologized for their behavior and urged people to adhere to the insecurity laws.¬†The Guardian¬†called the case the ""highest-profile criminal quarantine case"" in Australian history.

Depp was born on June 9, 1963,¬†in¬†Owensboro, Kentucky,¬†the youngest of four children of waitress Betty Sue Palmer (n√©e¬†Wells)¬†and civil engineer John Christopher Depp.¬†Depp moved frequently during his childhood, he and his siblings lived in more than 20 different places, eventually settling in¬†Miramar, Florida¬†in 1970.¬†Depp's parents divorced in 1978 when he was 15,¬†his mother married Robert Palmer, whom Depp has called ""an inspiration"". At the 2016 Grammys, Depp played a song in tribute to Palmer, stating, ""So the words of the song were this toast by my stepfather, who made his exit about 15 years ago, he was this really cool guy. He was a bit of a rounder; he spent about half his life in prison, in¬†Statesville, Illinois. With the gift of a guitar from his mother when he was 12, Depp began playing in various bands.¬†A year after his parents' divorce, he dropped out of¬†Miramar High School¬†to become a rock musician; he attempted to go back to school two weeks later, but the principal told him to follow his dream of being a musician,¬†he played with The Kids, a band that enjoyed modest local success, from 1980 to 1984. The Kids set out together for Los Angeles in pursuit of a record deal, changing their name to Six Gun Method, but the group split up before signing a record deal. Depp subsequently collaborated with the band¬†Rock City Angels. Depp married Lori Anne Allison,¬†the sister of his band's bassist and singer. 

Heard was born in¬†Austin, Texas, to Patricia Paige (n√©e¬†Parsons), an internet researcher (1956‚Äì2020), and David Clinton Heard (born 1950), who owned a small construction company.¬†She has a younger sister, Whitney.¬†The family lived outside Austin.¬†Heard's father broke horses in his free time, and she grew up riding horses, hunting, and fishing with him.¬†She also participated in beauty pageants, although as an adult she has said that she can no longer ""support the objectification"".¬†Heard, who was raised¬†Catholic, subsequently declared herself as an¬†atheist.¬†At the age of 17, she no longer felt comfortable in Texas¬†and dropped out of her Catholic high school to move to New York City.¬†She eventually earned a diploma through a home-study course.¬†In New York, she supported herself by modeling¬†but soon moved to Los Angeles to pursue acting. She made her film debut in a minor role in the sports drama¬†Friday Night Lights¬†(2004), followed by brief supporting roles in films such as¬†Drop Dead Sexy¬†(2005),¬†North Country¬†(2005),¬†Side FX¬†(2005),¬†Price to Pay¬†(2006),¬†You Are Here¬†(2006), and¬†Alpha Dog¬†(2006), and a guest-starring spot in an episode of the¬†police procedural¬†Criminal Minds. Heard received her first leading role in the unconventional¬†slasher film¬†All the Boys Love Mandy Lane,

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

Theodore Robert Bundy was born on November 24, 1946. While he claimed he had an overall happy and average childhood, many describe Bundy as having a difficult childhood. He spent his early years with his maternal grandparents, who raised him as their son. Bundy was said to have thought his mother was his sister, according to a prison psychologist who once interviewed Bundy, in the documentary ""The Ted Bundy Tapes."" He apparently didn't find out who his birth mother was until later in life. Along with this, a forensic psychologist and FBI and law enforcement consultant stated that Bundy exhibited signs of conduct disorder as a child.

This was further amplified as a young Bundy began to avidly view violent pornography. He stated in his final interview that he felt the need to take in more extreme content to give himself the same feeling until he finally realized what he had to do to take it to the next level.

While his first attack occurred early in 1974, his first killing occurred on or around February 1st of 1974 from that point on through the year 1978, according to his own confession, he killed, kidnapped, and assaulted more than 30 women in seven states, while escaping from prison twice. After his final arrest in 1979, Bundy insisted on acting as his own attorney and even cross-examined witnesses during his trial. However, he was found guilty of murder and was sentenced to death via electric chair.

Over the next ten years, legalities would play out. Bundy even was married during his imprisonment and had a child. However, he was later divorced and was executed by electric chair at 7:06 a.m. on January 24, 1989, at Florida State Prison in Starke, Florida.

Theodore Robert Bundy was born on November 24, 1946. While he claimed he had an overall happy and average childhood, many describe Bundy as having a difficult childhood. He spent his early years with his maternal grandparents, who raised him as their son. Bundy was said to have thought his mother was his sister, according to a prison psychologist who once interviewed Bundy, in the documentary ""The Ted Bundy Tapes."" He apparently didn't find out who his birth mother was until later in life. Along with this, a forensic psychologist and FBI and law enforcement consultant stated that Bundy exhibited signs of conduct disorder as a child.

This was further amplified as a young Bundy began to avidly view violent pornography. He stated in his final interview that he felt the need to take in more extreme content to give himself the same feeling until he finally realized what he had to do to take it to the next level.

While his first attack occurred early in 1974, his first killing occurred on or around February 1st of 1974 from that point on through the year 1978, according to his own confession, he killed, kidnapped, and assaulted more than 30 women in seven states, while escaping from prison twice. After his final arrest in 1979, Bundy insisted on acting as his own attorney and even cross-examined witnesses during his trial. However, he was found guilty of murder and was sentenced to death via electric chair.

Over the next ten years, legalities would play out. Bundy even was married during his imprisonment and had a child. However, he was later divorced and was executed by electric chair at 7:06 a.m. on January 24, 1989, at Florida State Prison in Starke, Florida.

Dr. Phil is an American talk show created by Oprah Winfrey and the host Phil McGraw. After McGraw's success with his segments on The Oprah Winfrey Show, Dr. Phil debuted on September 16, 2002. On both shows McGraw offers advice in the form of ""life strategies"" from his life experience as a clinical and forensic psychologist.[2]

The show is in syndication throughout the United States and a number of other countries. Its tenth season premiered on September 12, 2011. Occasional prime time specials have aired on CBS. The program has been nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award every year since 2004. Since September 2008, Dr. Phil has been broadcast in HDTV with a revamped look and a new theme written and performed by McGraw's son, Jordan.

The executive producers are Phil McGraw and showrunner Oprah Winfrey. It is a production of Peteski Productions and distributed by CBS Television Distribution. Harpo Productions co-produced the series until 2010, with Paramount Domestic Television and its successor, CBS Paramount Domestic Television, serving as secondary co-producers until 2007. It was originally distributed by King World Productions.

The program is recorded before a live studio audience in Stage 29 on the Paramount Pictures lot in Hollywood, California. It is recorded from August through to May with a break in December for the holiday season. Reruns of earlier episodes of the series began broadcasting on the Oprah Winfrey Network in January 2011.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

Trump‚Äôs team, including lawyers Pat Cipollone and Jay Sekulow, now has 24 hours to present their case. After Trump‚Äôs lawyers conclude their presentation, senators will have an opportunity to submit questions to both sides in writing. Following that, debate will turn to whether to call witnesses and subpoena documents.

Trump was impeached by the House of Representatives in December for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. Impeachment does not mean that the president has been removed from office. In the next phase, the Senate must hold a trial to make that determination. A Senate impeachment trial has happened only two other times in American history and once in the modern era. At the center of the Democrats‚Äô case is that Trump sought to withhold military assistance and an Oval Office meeting until Ukraine announced investigations into former vice president Joe Biden and his son.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

In Hollywood, scandals, break-ups, divorces, and gossip are nothing new. One such news that has taken away the thunder of the other news and buzz is the divorce and the legal battle of Johnny Depp and Amber Heard.

The legal battle between Amber Heard and Johnny Depp has been going on for years. It started in 2016, just a year after their marriage and since then, it hasn‚Äôt had closure. But do you know, what is one thing that seems repetitive throughout this? It is the passing of blames and tampering evidence. 

Recently, a subpoena emerged and it suggested that it was addressed to Amber Heard‚Äôs sister Whitney Henriquez. The fans conjectured that something which Whitney must have said would have been a lie and that Amber had urged her to do so. As a result, she was asked to appear before the court. Isn‚Äôt this tampering evidence? The case is unending because of these games that have been played by Amber Heard. 

Throughout the years of the legal battle between Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, there have been so many celebrities that pointed out the elephant in the room - the idea that Amber Heard could be the  and liar all these years. All while, the audience kept blaming Johnny Depp. 

Let us go about the celebrities who spoke up against Amber and what their opinions are. 

The first celebrity that we are going to talk about is Johnny Depp‚Äôs ex-partner - Vanessa Paradis.  Vanessa Paradis defends Johnny in court and raises serious questions doubting the allegations made against Johnny Depp by Amber Heard.

Les Mis√©rables (/le…™ Àåm…™z…ôÀàr…ëÀêb…ôl, -bl…ô/, French: [le mize Åabl(…ô)]) is a French historical novel by Victor Hugo, first published in 1862, that is considered one of the greatest novels of the 19th century.

In the English-speaking world, the novel is usually referred to by its original French title. However, several alternatives have been used, including The Miserables, The Wretched, The Miserable Ones, The Poor Ones, The Wretched Poor, The Victims and The Dispossessed. Beginning in 1815 and culminating in the 1832 June Rebellion in Paris, the novel follows the lives and interactions of several characters, particularly the struggles of ex-convict Jean Valjean and his experience of redemption.

Examining the nature of law and grace, the novel elaborates upon the history of France, the architecture and urban design of Paris, politics, moral philosophy, antimonarchism, justice, religion, and the types and nature of romantic and familial love. Les Mis√©rables has been popularized through numerous adaptations for film, television and the stage, including a musical.

Fans who are regularly updated on the situation between Johnny Depp as known as Jack sparrow and Aquaman actress Amber heard, her ex-wife attended the final hearing of the domestic abuse trial, where Amber got the lead. She thanked all her fans who supported her on social media. But this story isn‚Äôt ended yet, Johnny Depp considered this trial a total misjudged and called it an injustice. Depp‚Äôs Lawyers claimed a new trial according to them:

‚ÄúThe first trial‚Äôs judge ‚Äúfailed to properly assess her credibility by reference to documentary evidence, photographs, recordings or otherwise.‚Äù

What barrister David Sherborne, who is Depp‚Äôs lawyer, wants to bring to notice is Amber‚Äôs being untruthful in her pieces of evidence and statements. 
‚Äú‚Ä¶.without taking account of or even acknowledging that Ms. Heard had been untruthful in her evidence, without testing her account against the documentary evidence and the evidence of other witnesses, and without making any findings that he disbelieved those witnesses,‚Äù 

Now from here the new story of a new trial starts, previous trial ended in amber‚Äôs favor but what this new trial is going to bring? Whether Depp has cut off the nose to spite the face or Amber this time dig her own grave?
So, Depp, this time accused her of showing fake charity documents to court as she promised to give a 7 million dollar settlement donation. This time Depp‚Äôs lawyers emerged after doing all of their homework.
