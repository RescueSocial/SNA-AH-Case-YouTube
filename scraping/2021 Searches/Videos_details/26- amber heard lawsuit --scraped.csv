I don't know about you guys, but when I’m bored and all jacked up on Adderall, I tend to start rumors about celebrities by getting on TikTok and making viral videos. As niche and specific of an activity as this may be, it seems I’m not alone, as everyone’s favorite influencer, Ava Louise, who’s also known as the girl who tried to start the Coronavirus challenge, did the exact same thing. And now that her rumor blew way out of proportion and things are spiraling out of control, well she admitted that all of it was fake.

00:00 Hawkeye
The MCU keeps growing, not only on the big screen, but especially on Disney+. One of the next big hits in Marvel's series line-up will be ""Hawkeye"".

01:04 Hobbs and Shaw 2
Recently, actor Dwayne Johnson officially announced his exit from the upcoming two ""Fast and Furious"" movies 10 and 11. After several arguments with Vin Diesel and poor prospects for reconciliation, the 49-year-old decided to turn his back on the main series. Till the end, some still believed that it must be somehow possible to bring back Luke Hobbs...https://kinocheck.com/news/3mz9by

Hollywood legend Sylvester Stallone has been in the movie business for an incredible 52 years! In the last ten years, there has been at least one film with his contribution in theaters in almost every year.

It should not have escaped anyone's notice that the legal matter between Amber Heard and Johnny Depp is still being fought with no holds barred. After Johnny Depp has so far struggled against devastating financial losses and defamation on a grand scale, a new campaign against his ex-wife is now getting underway. In recent days and weeks, calls for Heard to be fired from the ""Aquaman"" sequel have been accumulating...https://kinocheck.com/news/h2bjtv

06:11 Scarlett Johansson vs Disney
The first Marvel movie from the fourth phase, ""Black Widow"", has barely been released, and already there is a lot of turmoil behind the scenes. The reason for this is the release policy of the streaming service Disney+, which is causing the actors massive financial losses. This is also the case for Scarlett Johansson, who has filed a lawsuit against her former employer, according to the Wall Street Journal. The accusation: breach of contract on the part of the movie giant...https://kinocheck.com/news/imzuta

In recent weeks, we have often reported on merchandise leaks and numerous other rumors regarding ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"". But one important marketing component is still missing from the most anticipated movie of 2021 - an actual trailer.

Sam Spril - Greetings John & Rob. With regards to Scarlett Johansson's Lawsuit seems like Disney has pushed back giving us a different side to this stating she has been paid $20 million and that discussion were had about the premier access deal with her contract, but if that was the case why would Scarlett Jo even bother with the lawsuit. Is it for more money or something else we are not aware of? Thoughts?

First Lady Melania Trump has had her fair share of awkward and uncomfortable moments as well, even if many of them also involve her husband slipping up. From all the signs that she was uncomfortable on inauguration day to the time she tried a little too hard to be like Michelle Obama, let’s take a look at some of the most awkward Melania Trump moments that were caught on camera.

Depp — who denies abusing Heard — is slated to star in “Fantastic Beasts 3,” the next installment of J.K.Rowling‘s Harry Potter movies. The script has been completed, although filming, which was due to start this summer, has been delayed to the fall of next year. 
“Executives at Warner Bros. are wondering how to deal with the backlash of the Depp matter on the Harry Potter franchise,” a source said. “High-level female execs at the studio are extremely worried about working with Depp and the message it sends to the public, especially after the recent sordid departure of CEO Kevin Tsujihara,” who last month announced he was leaving amid a casting couch scandal. 
ELON MUSK SUBPOENAED IN JOHNNY DEPP LAWSUIT AGAINST AMBER HEARD 
“This is yet another blow to the morale of female employees at the studio,” the source said. “If Warner Bros. continues to stick by Depp, it would reveal a lot about the values the company holds.” 
While reps at Warner Bros. didn’t respond to multiple requests for comment from The Post, insiders said executives are unsure how to proceed, since author J.K. Rowling came out strongly in support of Depp’s casting in a previous Potter flick in 2017 after his marriage to Heard crumbled.

“Many at Warner Bros. wish that Rowling hadn’t come out so strongly behind Depp, because having made her opinion so public boxes them into a corner,” a source said. 
Rowling broke her silence on the controversy surrounding Depp’s casting as the villain Grindelwald when she wrote on her website in December 2017, “When Johnny Depp was cast as Grindelwald, I thought he’d be wonderful in the role. However, around the time of filming his cameo in the first movie, stories had appeared in the press that deeply concerned me and everyone most closely involved in the franchise. 
JOHNNY DEPP SUES AMBER HEARD FOR $50 MILLION, SAYS SHE CHEATED ON HIM WITH ELON MUSK 
“Harry Potter fans had legitimate questions and concerns about our choice to continue with Johnny Depp in the role. As David Yates, long-time Potter director, has already said, we naturally considered the possibility of recasting. I understand why some have been confused and angry about why that didn’t happen.” 
Rowling added that while “the huge, mutually supportive community that has grown up around Harry Potter is one of the greatest joys of my life,” she found it “difficult, frustrating and at times painful” to remain silent on the Depp issue. 
Referring to Depp and Heard’s divorce agreement, she added, “However, the agreements that have been put in place to protect the privacy of two people, both of whom have expressed a desire to get on with their lives, must be respected.

Tati Westbrook is getting sued by her business partner for being shady and allegedly stealing from him. This lawsuit has unearthed tons of things about the bye sister scandal that we didn't know before. At this point it seems like the whole damn drama was just about vitamins after all.

Welcome toThe Gossipy. We make interesting videos about Hollywood in English. We give you a closer look in the lives of celebrities like Kanye West, Ed Sheeran, The Rock, Jay Z, Selena Gomez, Kylie Jenner, Kim Kardashian, Rihanna and 100s more.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

Amber Heard is now trying to get the defamation suit against her dismissed. In this video, we break down what is going on this time.

Sue Klebold is the mother of Dylan Klebold, one of the two shooters who committed the Columbine High School massacre, murdering 12 students and a teacher. She's spent years excavating every detail of her family life, trying to understand what she could have done to prevent her son's violence. In this difficult, jarring talk, Klebold explores the intersection between mental health and violence, advocating for parents and professionals to continue to examine the link between suicidal and homicidal thinking.

Elon Musk Set To Testify Against Amber Heard & Defend Johnny Depp

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5xAuPZaoI8

Divorce is never easy, and when it comes to celebrity divorce, public attention is added to the whole nightmare that follows the process. Of course, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard’s split is certainly no exception. Even though their legal battle has already lasted years, there's a little chance that new participants of the case, like Tesla CEO Elon Musk and actor James Franco, end up testifying in the court case against Amber Heard?
According to court documents obtained by Us Weekly, James Franco and Elon Musk were subpoenaed on October 26, 2021. They were ordered to “produce the books, record, electronically stored information and tangible things designated and described” — including “verbal conversations, telephone calls, letters, emails, memoranda and reports” — by January 17, 2022. As we have already spoken in details about James Franco being dragged to the case in the previous video (if you haven’t seen it, you definitely should), in this episode we are going to reveal all the details about Elon Musk’s who once challenged Johnny Depp to a cage fight. 
Johnny Depp’s legal team is interested in speaking with Elon Mus kand James Franco because they may have a really important information that can help the case going. Here is an official Adam Waldman’s (JD’s lawyer) statement: “We are interested in James Franco and Elon Musk as fact witnesses because we have evidence they are men who saw Amber Heard’s face in the days and nights between when she claimed Mr. Depp smashed her in the face on May 21 and when she went to court with painted on ‘bruises’ to obtain temporary restraining order on May 27”.
The Tesla billionaire Elon Musk has been involved in Johnny Depp and Amber Heard’s case once again and this time around his connection to Amber/Johnny drama is a little bit different than previously. In short, Elon Musk has been involved to the entire scandal because he dated Amber Heard after the former couple’s split. Elon was first dragged into the dispute last year when Johnny Depp issued subpoena against him. This was part from a separate legal battle between the former couple in the US. 
But what does Elon have to do with everything that happens on the first place? Well, Elon Musk and Amber Heard had a short-lived romance after her marriage to Johnny Depp collapsed in 2016. However, though JD repeatedly has alleged that Elon and Amber Heard were romantically involved while before their split. Elon Musk has always denied these claims and even joked last summer about settling things with Johnny Depp in a “cage fight” when his name kept coming up at the ongoing UK libel trial. 
Moreover, when Amber and JD’s relationship began to fall apart, Amber was trying to get a restraining order against Johnny Depp and when she decided to this, she shared her thoughts about it with Elon Musk. After she revealed him her thoughts, he offered to pay and provide her with 24-hour security. Moreover, the High Court was told that Elon Musk became a regular late-night visitor to Amber Heard monthly. And allegedly, it all started way back in 2015. And you probably remember that ‘triangle’ scandal, involving Elon Musk, Amber Heard and British supermodel Cara Delevingne.Well, so many views and opinions. Bit I want to know your thoughts about the entire situation! Do you think Elon Musk’s testimony will help Johnny Depp win the court case? Or the fact that Elon Musk will appear in court will make things only worse for the actor? Let me know your opinion in the comments section down below.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

Amber Heard is now trying to get the defamation suit against her dismissed. In this video, we break down what is going on this time.

From the infamous blackface controversy that Megyn Kelly stirred up on her NBC talk show to the reporter who carelessly did damage to classic cars while reporting on a car show, let’s take a look at some reporters who ruined their careers in a matter of seconds.

Apart from being a successful model slash entrepreneur, Blac Chyna also happens to be a singer, performer and a mother of two.The 33 year old Hollywood socialite recently dropped a new single and fans are really excited about it. Fans took to Twitter to say;

I’m loving Blac Chyna as a music artist! I’m getting my life!I don’t know why I’ve had Blac Chyna’s Hollywood song in my head lately. It’s catchy lol. 

However, we were quick to note that this new hit also seems to be hinting at her troubles in Hollywood and in the entertainment industry.Chyna’s newest single is all about the model’s glamorous world of Los Angeles and her possible new love interest. Here are some of the lyrics from her new song, Hollywood:

There’s a shy boy lives on my street. He called me movies star. Got me a bougie pair of dark sunglasses. Wear ‘em till the sun goes down on the car. Drivin’ to Hollywood. I wish I could stay. Drivin’ to Hollywood. Get out of the way.

Throughout the video, Chyna is seen driving around town with pink and colorful outfits and with a new man on her mind. While this music video doesn’t call out the Kardashians directly, Chyna does give out some hints throughout the music video.Chyna has also sprinkled in some inspirational messages in her song to let everyone know that she’s okay despite all the legal lawsuits surrounding her. Some of these messages include:

Never stop dreaming and live colorfully.

The music video also ends on a questionable note. By the end of the music video, we see Chyna park her car and walk away from the scene while someone opens the door to the passenger’s side of the car. And at the end, we get a “to be continued” message on screen.Could this be a sign that Chyna is planning on leaving Hollywood once the lawsuits are over? Or maybe it’s a sign that the mother of two still has a few surprises left for the Kardashian-Jenner clan.While we wait for the part two of Chyna’s video, let’s look at how the beef between Chyna and the Kardashians started.

According to Chyna’s personal attorney, the Kardashian family has been on a mission to destroy Chyna’s career. As you all know, Rob and Chyna created a spin off show from the KUWTK show. This new spin-off show focuses on Rob and Chyna’s lives. The show had a good following and lots of memorable moments for the two but was suddenly cancelled by Entertainment Tonight.Chyna went ahead to file a lawsuit against the production team and the network claiming that it was Kris Jenner who ultimately pulled the plug on the reality show.The second season of Rob and Chyna which did not air was especially important to Chyna since it showed the couple in a much better light. From working on their relationship together to taking care of their daughter, Dream, Chyna demanded the release of the footage for the public to see. 

Among Chyna’s allegations is a claim that Kris Jenner, Kim Kardashian, Khloe Kardashian and Kylie Jenner secretly defamed Chyna and illegally interfered with Chyna’s highly lucrative content with the E! Network/NBCUniversal. Their alleged illegal interference caused the cancellation of Rob & Chyna. Bunim/Murray must produce the unaired season 2 of Rob & Chyna and KUWTK footage to Chyna within 45 days. The judge also ruled that unaired footage from KUWTK filmed in March 2017 must also be handed over. The unaired KUWTK footage shows Chyna and Rob working on their relationship and co-parenting their daughter, Dream Kardashian.

Chyna seems to be winning the court cases against the Kardashian-Jenner clan since three judges are already siding with her.Her attorney continued to reveal that:

The evidence reportedly corroborated Chyna’s claim that Kris Jenner who is often called a momager, lied about an accusation that Chyna beat the s* out of Rob’s face, then used that alleged fabrication to get the show canceled.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

Filed in state court in Los Angeles, the lawsuit claims Disney broke a longstanding agreement with the actress to release Black Widow as a “wide theatrical release,” according to a court filing sent to Forbes via Johansson’s lawyer.

By offering the film to theater-goers and Disney+ users at the same time, the suit claims Disney “lure[d] the Picture’s audience away from movie theatres and towards its owned streaming service,” which harmed Johansson because her pay for starring in Black Widow is based partly on bonuses for strong box office sales.

This guitar looks a lot like the more common Ibanez Model 2370... This model 2363 was only available in 1974. The switches and knobs are arranged slightly differently than the more common Model 2370 guitars.

These cool Guitars, Made in Japan, were modeled after the cool Gibson ES 335 Model Guitars. This guitar is as close to the Gibson as they could get. They were only made in 1974 . It is hollow except for the block under the bridge. The varitone switch activates two tone sounds. Bassy and more bassy. I think they probably improved the tone caps in the later models. I does look cool though..doesn't it?

When we got the guitar, it was completely unplayable. The neck pocket had collapsed with the string tension over the year. Our Jeff the Tech has become quite the expert in rebuilding and reinforcing the malady and it plays amazingly now with awesome low playing action. See pics of the repair shown around the neck pocket in pics 8, 9 and 10. Other than that repair, this guitar is in beautiful shape. All original from stem to stern. I especially like the Star Tuners in Gold. All the knobs, tailpiece, Bridge, Tailpiece, strap buttons..you name it...all original and in great shape. Only superficial dings here and there. This guitar is in fabulous shape!

These guitars were designed to play 12 guage strings back in the day. I put a cool set of 10 gauge on it and love them. Great tone from the flats and you can put 9’s on it as you wish, but I bet you will like the 10’s better.

We didn't get it with an original case. We just got the shown Epiphone 335 Hard Shell Case in and it fits it perfectly.  Its as nice as the guitar. Beautiful Plush interior and even the accessory box are still with the case! Check those pics..

There is nothing that detracts from the big booming sound of this cool guitar...It has super super low action and it sounds HUGE....If you have never heard these Super 70's Humbucker Pickups...you are in for a treat...They sound great!!..

It looks good, sounds good, and plays good... it will all be pro-packed by yours truly...I do this alot and have not had one complaint.... It has a few nicks and scratches as seen in the pics but it is a solid 9 out of 10 Guitar.. But on a cool scale...its an 12 !!!!!!

The guitar is cool but vintage and used so its sold as is no returns. However, I have been hand picking my customers instruments for over 20 years now and they have all loved the guitars I found for them. This cool Ibanez is certainly not going to be an exception.

Thanks for checking out our cool guitar.

For those who thought that the legal dispute between Johnny Depp (Minamata – 35%, Waiting for the Barbarians – 51%) and Amber Heard (Aquaman – 73%, Justice League – 41%) had already ended, the reality is that They still have a long way to go, as their trial in Virginia, United States, will begin in July and the consequences could still be harsh for either side.
However, after The Sun defeated Depp in the lawsuit for the defamation lawsuit that the actor filed against the British media for calling him a ‘wife beater’, now the defense of the actress is trying to dismiss the lawsuit that the protagonist of Pirates of the Caribbean filed against her in Virginia alleging the verdict of the jury in the United Kingdom.
For Depp’s defense, this is just one last desperate move or ‘Hail Mary’ for the trial to no longer proceed (via CinemaBlend).

There is a lot going on right now with the movie Jackass Forever, and not exactly in the good way. Because there are two different people trying to file suit against the film for various reasons. One of them is PETA believe it or not. Who are furious at the fact that the movie goes and uses animals in ways that are harmful to them and are even forced to do damage to the guys in the film. But even more pressing is the matter of Bam Margera, who is suing them for a ""Wellness Agreement"" that he was forced to sign and that got him fired from the movie. But was that legal?

Johnny Depp “did not receive a fair trial” and the high court ruling that stated he assaulted his ex-wife Amber Heard and put her in fear for her life is “plainly wrong”, lawyers for the Hollywood star have told the court of appeal.

The 57-year-old sued the Sun over a column by its executive editor, Dan Wootton, which referred to “overwhelming evidence” that he had attacked Heard, 34, during their relationship and described him as a “wife beater”.
In the initial ruling, last month, Mr Justice Nicol dismissed Depp’s claim, saying the paper’s owner, News Group Newspapers, had proved what was in the article to be “substantially true”.
Dismissing Depp’s libel case, Nicol found that 12 of the 14 alleged incidents of domestic violence relied on by NGN did occur. The judge said Depp put Heard “in fear of her life” during what she described as a “three-day hostage situation” in Australia in March 2015.
Depp’s barrister, David Sherborne, has asked the appeal court to “set aside the judgment and order a new trial” if permission to appeal against Nicol’s judgment is given. In documents filed with the appeal court on Thursday, Depp’s lawyers claimed Nicol’s ruling was “manifestly unsafe”.
Depp’s legal team claim Nicol “failed to undertake any, or an adequate analysis, of Ms Heard’s shifting account, despite the importance of consistency as a consideration of a witness’s testimony”.
Sherborne, said Nicol “concluded that the appellant was guilty of serious physical assaults without taking account of or even acknowledging that Ms Heard had been untruthful in her evidence, without testing her account against the documentary evidence and the evidence of other witnesses, and without making any findings that he disbelieved those witnesses”.
The barrister also argued: “The conclusion which flows from an overall assessment of the judgment is that (Mr Justice Nicol) decided to find for the ‘victim’ but failed to provide the necessary analysis to explain or justify that conclusion.
“Also he excluded relevant evidence from his consideration, ignored or dismissed as irrelevant matters that substantially undermined Ms Heard, made findings unsupported by the evidence, and failed to assess whether her allegations could withstand proper scrutiny",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eGnfbtRqdjc/default.jpg,120,90,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eGnfbtRqdjc/mqdefault.jpg,320,180,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eGnfbtRqdjc/hqdefault.jpg,480,360,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eGnfbtRqdjc/sddefault.jpg,640.0,480.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eGnfbtRqdjc/maxresdefault.jpg,1280.0,720.0,Keira's world,,22,none,Johnny dep didn't get a fair lawsuit,"Johnny Depp 'did not get fair trial', lawyers tell appeal court

The Johnny Depp The Sun lawsuit may finally come to an end with new facts about the Johnny Depp defamation case moving forward. We have a new piece of celebrity news moving this The Johnny Depp vs The Sun case forward. We have plenty more on the Johnny Depp Amber Heard case coming up.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

Until he began crying, Rittenhouse had been recounting his steps leading up to the moments he opened fire. Rittenhouse also described his prior encounters with Joseph Rosenbaum, the first man he shot, saying that Rosenbaum had been screaming threats at Rittenhouse and others on the streets that night.

Legal experts have said the case effectively boils down to whether jurors believe his self-defense claims, which makes his testimony crucial. Jurors will weigh whether they agree Rittenhouse believed he feared for his safety or life, and his testimony provides them a key window into what he says went through his mind each time he pulled the trigger.

While this isn't the main lawsuit and this particular Lawsuit would've been hard to win in the first place. The bottom line here is that the MSM and Hollywood have done everything they can to unperson Johnny after this decision despite more than a little evidence to showing what kinda person Amber Heard was

Long and deep running repercussions for the Manosphere justice wasn't served here and if you think that this fact went unnoticed by anybody in the Manosphere you're deluding yourself

One of them is to not talk thrash about an employer or co-star just after you’ve worked with them. It’s just bad form, and it could potentially destroy your career. That’s just what happened to Katherine Heigl who trashed the comedy flick Knocked Up in which she played a lead role.

Heigl’s career was at an all-time high. She had just won an Emmy Award for her work on Grey’s Anatomy and had made a smooth transition into a feature film. But an ill-fated interview with Vanity Fair changed everything for Heigl, and her career has not seen the light of day since.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

Johnny Depp's former business managers countersued the actor on Tuesday (31 JAN. 2017) claiming his lavish lifestyle that cost more than $2 million a month to maintain caused his recent financial troubles and that the star ignored their repeated warnings.
The countersuit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court by The Management Group comes about two weeks after Depp sued the company alleging it grossly mismanaged his earnings.
The lawsuit said Depp paid more than $75 million to buy and maintain 14 homes, including a French chateau and a chain of islands in the Bahamas.
Depp also spent heavily to buy a 150-foot yacht, fly on private jets and cultivate collections of fine art and Hollywood memorabilia requiring 12 storage facilities to maintain, the lawsuit said.
Depp was repeatedly warned by the company that his spending was out of control but ignored his former advisors' advice to control his spending, the lawsuit said.
""Depp, and Depp alone, is fully responsible for any financial turmoil he finds himself in today,"" the lawsuit stated.
Depp sued The Management Group on Jan. 13 seeking more than $25 million he contends was mismanaged. His lawsuit also alleged the company failed to file Depp's taxes on time, costing him $5.7 million in penalties.
Tuesday's countersuit said Depp's tax returns were always filed on time, and taxes were paid when the star had money available to pay them.
The company handled his finances from 1999 until early 2016, an especially lucrative period in the actor's career.
During that time, Depp launched the blockbuster ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" franchise and other big-budget releases, including ""Alice in Wonderland"" and the 2005 film ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.""
Depp's attorneys did not immediately respond to email and phone messages seeking comment.
The countersuit seeks a judge's ruling that Depp is to blame for his financial troubles, and $560,000 in fees The Management Group said it is owed.
The money being sought comes on top of $4.2 million the firm announced on Jan. 13 that it was seeking from Depp for repayment of a loan it said it made to the actor.
Depp is not the first blockbuster star to take his former managers to court alleging mismanagement.
Nicolas Cage sued his former business manager seeking $20 million for alleged mismanagement in 2009 and the manager in a countersuit cited the actor's spending for his financial troubles. The case was resolved before trial.

Along with that, the artist was hit with another lawsuit that accused him of similar acts. Now, a third lawsuit was filed against Manson by “Jane Doe,” who says she dated the rock star in 2011.

The person alleges that while they were dating, Manson showed her a video depicting “abuse of a groupie after a 1996 concert” in Hollywood. The person in the video was allegedly threatened with a gun and “forced to drink urine.”

Sources that talked to TMZ claim the video wasn’t real but was supposed to be a short film. However, that film was never made public. In her lawsuit, the accuser also said the movie was locked away in a safe. Jane Doe claims the movie made her “afraid for her life” and that Manson allegedly raped her and threatened her life after she returned to his house to give him back a key.

Manson has yet to address the new allegations against him, with the last time the artist posted on social media being in February 2021.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

Was up, Beauties ! I hope ya'll are having a good week so far, so heads up...their are a lot of editing mistakes in this video. I can't get used to this professional app to save my life, (Premiere Pro) 🤣🤣 It is all a work in progress, and I am trying to learn every single day. However, most likely i will be purchasing a Mac book pro, on Friday which will be so much better for me and will give me the ability to make more quality videos FASTER so say a prayer for me, please🙏 ! 🤣 
So please just bare with me, as I am doing the best I can, and I do apologize in advance  for any mistakes that you see lol. 💚💚
So, in my opinion Without a Crystal ball just gets worse by the second what do ya'll think?

I hope ya'll enjoyed my video and I will see ya'll in a couple days on the next one. Remember to be kind to everyone, and be kind to yourself as well. Love ya'll !  ❤💓

The true cost of the coronavirus pandemic, the loss of life and the economic devastation, is incalculable. But what can be counted is the money governments around the world have already spent trying to combat it. So far it adds up to a staggering six and a half trillion dollars. In a class action launched in the United States, China is now being sued to get the money back. The lawsuit accuses Chinese authorities of negligence, lies and cover-ups. In the UK, there are similar calls for compensation to be paid. And as Tara Brown reports, even here in Australia there are demands the communist regime face a Nuremberg-style hearing to investigate its role in this human disaster.

The documentary features Orlando Martinez, Dan Myers and Scott Smith – three detectives who were involved in the initial investigation of Jackson's death.

On June 25, 2009, American singer Michael Jackson died of acute propofol and benzodiazepine intoxication at his home on North Carolwood Drive in the Holmby Hills. His personal physician, Conrad Murray, said he found Jackson in his room, not breathing and with a weak pulse, and administered CPR on Jackson to no avail.

On August 28, 2009, the Los Angeles County Coroner ruled that Jackson's death was a homicide. Shortly before his death, Jackson had reportedly been administered propofol and two anti-anxiety benzodiazepines, lorazepam, and midazolam, in his home. Law enforcement officials charged Murray with involuntary manslaughter on November 7, 2011, and served two years of his four-year prison sentence, early release per good behavior.

Description:

We all loved to play with Barbie dolls when we were kids, and we loved the diversity offered by Mattel. However, as grown-ups, we quickly realized that some of these toys were not the best role models for children. While some could have a bad influence and others were offensive, we were shocked to see a toy that was clearly dangerous. This is why we are showing you the 10 Most Inappropriate Barbie Dolls That Actually Exist. 

The Oreo Barbie was created after a partnership with Mattel and Oreo. Everyone loves those cookies, but the company didn’t know that it had a whole different meaning that was really offensive. That’s because “Oreo” is also a slang for black people who act white and forget their culture. And you shouldn’t take it as a compliment when someone tells you that you are black on the outside and white on the inside.

Tattoos are becoming more and more common nowadays. But parents didn’t think that they would find it on the dolls that their kids are playing with. These were only temporary tattoos but some grown-ups think that these toys encouraged children to get tattoos even though they were way too young. And those who weren’t shocked yet just couldn’t believe that a really inappropriate tattoo was part of the toy.

Stay tuned to hear more about the most inappropriate Barbie dolls that actually exist including the Teen Talk Barbie, the Barbie Video Girl, the Barbie Happy Family, the Barbie in a wheelchair, the Mexican Barbie, and more. Which doll do you think was the most inappropriate? Don’t be shy to answer in the comments section down below. We love to hear what you think.

While some could have a bad influence and others were offensive, we were shocked to see a toy that was clearly dangerous. This is why we are showing you the 10 Most Inappropriate Barbie Dolls That Actually Exist. 

The Oreo Barbie was created after a partnership with Mattel and Oreo. Everyone loves those cookies, but the company didn’t know that it had a whole different meaning that was really offensive. That’s because “Oreo” is also a slang for black people who act white and forget their culture. And you shouldn’t take it as a compliment when someone tells you that you are black on the outside and white on the inside.

Tattoos are becoming more and more common nowadays. But parents didn’t think that they would find it on the dolls that their kids are playing with. These were only temporary tattoos but some grown-ups think that these toys encouraged children to get tattoos even though they were way too young. And those who weren’t shocked yet just couldn’t believe that a really inappropriate tattoo was part of the toy.

Stay tuned to hear more about the most inappropriate Barbie dolls that actually exist including the Teen Talk Barbie, the Barbie Video Girl, the Barbie Happy Family, the Barbie in a wheelchair, the Mexican Barbie, and more. Which doll do you think was the most inappropriate? Don’t be shy to answer in the comments section down below. We love to hear what you think.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

But for a few tense days in 1989, the fate of the cheerleaders hung in the balance.

The year was 1989. In February, Jerry Jones becomes the new owner of the Dallas Cowboys. He fires Tom Landry and Director of the Cheerleaders Suzanne Mitchell resigns. Tensions are high. June brings rumors about Jones' plans for changes to the squad.

""We had no idea what he was about,"" said Ezelle. ""All we knew was that there was talk about us being in beer commercials and sponsorships, and that our uniform might get skimpier than it already was, and that we could fraternize with the players.

A British judge will rule next Monday on whether Johnny Depp was libelled by a tabloid newspaper that branded him a wife-beater — an accusation his lawyer called a ""reputation-destroying, career-ending"" false allegation.

Judge Andrew Nicol will deliver his verdict in writing on November 2, without a hearing at the High Court, where Depp and his ex-wife Amber Heard had a dramatic three-week legal showdown in July.

The case, with its accusations of drug abuse, emotional turmoil and drunken fights, cast a stark light on the private lives of the celebrity couple, who met on the set of 2011 comedy ""The Rum Diary"" and married in Los Angeles in 2015.  They separated the following year and divorced in 2017.

Media lawyer Mark Stephens told The Associated Press that both parties are going to lose in  this case as the reputations of both Depp and Heard are damaged.

""The lawyers were the winners in this case.  They walk away.  They'll be putting their kids through private education for years to come.  But actually, the reputations of both Johnny Depp and Amber Heard are tarnished irrevocably and I think that it's going to persist because whoever wins in this case, the way in which this case was presented, the issues that came up, particularly around gendered presentation of the case, I think that's going to be studied for years to come.  So when you go to look at the law books or your sociological books or any of those other gender studies books, they're going to be looking at Depp versus The Sun and Amber Heard to see how it is done or how it shouldn't be done.""

""Pirates of the Caribbean"" star Depp sued News Group Newspapers, publisher of The Sun, and the newspaper's executive editor, Dan Wootton, over an April 2018 article that accused him of assaulting Heard.

Over several days in the witness box, Depp, 57, branded the allegations a ""hoax"" and claimed Heard was the aggressor during their volatile relationship.

""He has never hit a woman in his entire life — period, full stop, nada,"" Depp's lawyer David Sherborne said in closing arguments.

Heard, 34, testified as the main witness for the defense, saying Depp turned violent under the influence of alcohol and drugs.  She alleged 14 separate incidents between 2013 and 2016 in which he hit, slapped and shoved her, pulled her hair and threw bottles at her ""like grenades.""

""I didn't want to do this, I did not want to expose this totality of what really happened to me,"" Heard said in court.  ""I didn't want to talk about everything that happened in our marriage and happened in our relationship.""

The Sun's lawyer, Sasha Wass, said in her summing up that there was no doubt Depp ""regularly and systematically abused his wife.""

But Depp's lawyers accused Heard of fabricating evidence, calling her an unreliable witness and ""a compulsive liar.""

Whichever way the judge rules, it's unlikely to be the end of the legal drama.  Depp is also suing Heard for $50 million in Virginia over a Washington Post story about domestic violence.  The trial is due to be held next year.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

Welcome toThe Gossipy. We make interesting videos about Hollywood in English. We give you a closer look in the lives of celebrities like Kanye West, Ed Sheeran, The Rock, Jay Z, Selena Gomez, Kylie Jenner, Kim Kardashian, Rihanna and 100s more.

It has already been quite a bit of time since there was new evidence found in regard to the legal battle between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard. Since the body cam footage was discovered, people all over were wondering just how Amber Heard was going to try and recover from the whole situation. 

Initially, once the body cam footage was shared everywhere Amber Heard did not seem to have much to say about it all, so could it be that even though the original court date got pushed back, that Amber Heard is trying to find another way out of it to save herself?

The lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, claims Disney sacrificed the movie’s box office potential in order to grow its streaming service Disney+.

Logo text
In a dramatic turn with implications for major Hollywood studios, Scarlett Johansson filed a lawsuit against The Walt Disney Co. on Thursday alleging that her contract was breached when Black Widow was released on Disney+.

Marvel’s Black Widow is among numerous event movies that have debuted simultaneously on streaming and in theaters because of the pandemic. Johansson’s complaint says Disney sacrificed the movie’s box office potential in order to grow its streaming service.

In a statement, a Disney spokesperson responded, “There is no merit whatsoever to this filing. The lawsuit is especially sad and distressing in its callous disregard for the horrific and prolonged global effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Disney has fully complied with Ms. Johansson’s contract and furthermore, the release of Black Widow on Disney+ with Premier Access has significantly enhanced her ability to earn additional compensation on top of the $20M she has received to date.”",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/q1IKSLj7jfQ/default.jpg,120,90,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/q1IKSLj7jfQ/mqdefault.jpg,320,180,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/q1IKSLj7jfQ/hqdefault.jpg,480,360,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/q1IKSLj7jfQ/sddefault.jpg,640.0,480.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/q1IKSLj7jfQ/maxresdefault.jpg,1280.0,720.0,Im Filmy Buff,"['Scarlett Johansson Files Lawsuit Against Disney Over ‘Black Widow’', 'Scarlett Johansson is angry 😡', 'Scarlett Johansson Black widow', 'Is Scarlett in jail?', 'Disney+', 'YouTube shorts', 'Shorts']",22,none,Scarlett Johansson SLAMS Marvel Studios with lawsuit over Black Widow fail😡🤬YoutubeShorts #Shorts,"Please watch: ""Why Do People Hate Amber Heard? | Terrible Moments Of Amber Heard""

Lyrics:
We've all seen a man at the liquor store beggin' for your change
The hair on his face is dirty, dread-locked, and full of mange
He asks a man for what he could spare, with shame in his eyes
""Get a job you fu**in'  slob,"" is all he replies
God forbid you ever had to walk a mile in his shoes
'Cause then you really might know what it's like to sing the blues
(Hook)
Then you really might know what it's like
Then you really might know what it's like
Then you really might know what it's like
Then you really might know what it's like
Mary got pregnant from a kid named Tom that said he was in love
He said, ""don't worry about a thing, baby doll I'm the man you've been dreaming of.""
But three months later he say he won't date her or return her calls
And she swear, ""goddamn, if I find that man I'm cuttin' off his balls""
And then she heads for the clinic and she gets some static walking through the door.
They call her a killer, and they call her a sinner and they call her a whore 
God forbid you ever had to walk a mile in her shoes
'Cause then you really might know what it's like to have to choose
(Hook)
I've seen a rich man beg I've seen a good man sin
I've seen a tough man cry
I've seen a loser win and a sad man grin
I heard an honest man lie
I've seen the good side of bad and the downside of up
And everything between
I licked the silver spoon drank from the golden cup
And smoked the finest green
I stroked the fattest dimes at least a couple of times
Before I broke their heart
You know where it ends, yo, it usually depends on where you start
I knew this kid named Max who used to get fat stacks out on the corner with drugs
He liked to hang out late he liked to get shit-faced and keep the pace with thugs
Until late one night there was a big gun fight and max lost his head
He pulled out his chrome .45, talked some shit, and wound up dead
Now his wife and his kids are caught in the midst of all of this pain
You know it comes that way at least that's what they say when you play the game
God forbid you ever had to wake up to hear the news
'Cause then you really might know what it's like to have to lose
Then you really might know what it's like
Then you really might know what it's like
Then you really might know what it's like
Then you really might know what it's like to have to lose

Johnny Deep has triumphed in this long legal battle we've known for a long time against his ex-wife, Amber Heard, after the British newspaper The Sun called Depp the 'wife beating', ""United for Johnny Depp reported..


In a Twitter thread, he noted that a New York judge granted Heard's request to find out if he donated the $ 7 million settled in his 2016 divorce to the American Civil Liberties Union and Children's Hospital of Los Angeles.

By the judge's decision, he must release documents confirming whether Amber Heard, who has become a controversy among the actors, has taken this action.

Depp's lawyer, Benjamin Chew, said in a statement that he was very pleased with the court's decision.

In a Twitter thread, he noted that a New York judge granted Heard's request to find out if he donated the $ 7 million settled in his 2016 divorce to the American Civil Liberties Union and Children's Hospital of Los Angeles.

By the judge's decision, he must release documents confirming whether Amber Heard, who has become a controversy among the actors, has taken this action.

Depp's lawyer, Benjamin Chew, said in a statement that he was very pleased with the court's decision.

In this video, we are going to talk about Johnny Depp and Amber Heard, who have been on each other’s throats ever since they split up and how Amber Heard might be facing jail time for one mistake she made in all this.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

Amber Heard Johnny Depp divorce ugliest ever?
She Said He Said: Watch our special Facebook Live version talking nasty celeb divorces and old rich dads 
Amber Heard‘s billionaire ex-boyfriend Elon Musk is now being dragged into Johnny Depp‘s $50 million defamation case against the actress. 
Depp’s legal team say they plan to drag Musk to court in Depp and Heard’s legal battle over her allegations of domestic violence, which he insists is a “hoax.” 
“We have now issued subpoenas to Amber Heard, her hoax assisting friends, Elon Musk and other witnesses to explain the avalanche of video, audio, photographic and testimonial evidence with which we intend to confront them,” Depp’s attorney told Page Six in a statement on Friday. 
But a source close to the situation countered, “As of now, Elon has not received anything.” 
Heard wrote an op-ed in the Washington Post about her experience as a victim of domestic violence, without mentioning Depp, who denies abusing her. 
But in March the “Fantastic Beasts” actor filed a $50 million defamation suit against her claiming it was insinuated in the piece that he was the perpetrator. Depp’s legal team claimed in the lawsuit that the domestic violence claims against the actor were a “hoax” to further Heard’s career. 
Depp’s lawsuit also accused Heard of having an affair with Tesla founder Musk while they were still married, which Musk has denied. 
Heard and Musk were first spotted together in July 2016 at a Miami Beach hotel around two months after the “Aquaman” star filed for divorce from Depp. 
At the time a source insisted, “She has been friends with Elon for four years.” 
In August 2016, it was revealed the Tesla co-founder had been trying to meet Heard for years. 
Musk, 47, and Heard, 32, were finally photographed together in Australia holding hands for the first time in April 2017. 
The couple split up a few months later in August but reunited in November and continued to rekindle their romance into 2018. Just one month later, they called it quits for good. 
In a new court filing, Heard said Depp would “become a totally different person, often delusional and violent” when he was using drugs. 
“We called that version of Johnny, ‘the Monster,'” Heard said. 
“The root of Johnny’s violence against Amber, and now his defamation lawsuit against Amber, is his fixation, his jealousy and obsessive control and his need to exert ownership over her body,” a source close to the ex-couple told Page Six. 
“It is clear from Amber’s declaration that Johnny thought she was f**king Billy Bob Thornton, James Franco. Johnny’s lawsuit accuses her of cheating with Elon Musk, so now Depp wants to drag Elon into court.” 
Heard has never been linked with Thornton nor Franco, and Musk insists their relationship didn’t start until after her split with Depp.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

 The actor decides to sue the British tabloid after columnist Dan Wootton called him a 'wife-beater' in one article.  Jun 7, 2018  AceShowbiz - Johnny Depp has launched a libel lawsuit against bosses at British tabloid The Sun.   The Pirates of the Caribbean star filed the paperwork against publishing company News Group Newspapers Limited and columnist Dan Wootton on Friday, June 01 over a headline reading ""How can J.K. Rowling be 'genuinely happy' casting wife-beater Johnny Depp in the new Fantastic Beasts film?"" which was published in April.  The headline referenced allegations Depp's ex-wife Amber Heard made against him towards the end of their marriage, when she accused him of being physically and verbally abusive towards her throughout their brief union. Following the allegations, which the actor vehemently denied, Depp was cast as Gellert Grindelwald in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them and the film's upcoming sequel, which marked Rowling's screenwriting debut.   And the author stood behind the decision to cast him.   ""The filmmakers and I are not only comfortable sticking with our original casting, but genuinely happy to have Johnny playing a major character in the movies,"" a statement read.   Depp is suing for $268,300 (£200,000) and $14,100 (£10,528) for legal fees. He is also seeking damages to be determined at a later date and an injunction barring editors at the paper from ""continuing to publish"" stories about the alleged abuse.

 The 'Pirates of the Caribbean' star went to war with The Management Group's (TMG) Joel and Robert Mandel last year, seeking $25 million in damages for fraud and negligence.  Jun 25, 2018   AceShowbiz - Johnny Depp has been refused the chance to delay his lawsuit against his ex-business managers.    The Pirates of the Caribbean star went to war with The Management Group's (TMG) Joel and Robert Mandel in January, 2017, seeking $25 million (£18.8 million) in damages for fraud and negligence, claiming they mishandled his finances and caused him to rack up more than $40 million (£30 million) in debt.         They responded with their own countersuit, insisting he was to blame for his own financial woes because his spending was out of control.    Jury proceedings in the case are due to begin on 15 August, but on Friday, June 22, Depp's lawyer Benjamin Chew petitioned a Los Angeles Superior Court judge to postpone it by 60 days, citing the ""close proximity"" of the date to the two parties' first mediation meeting, which has been set for 14 July.    Chew's argument was challenged by TMG's attorneys, and now Judge Teresa Beaudet has ruled the case will proceed as scheduled if a settlement cannot be reached beforehand, reports Deadline.com.    The news emerges days after Depp opened up about his dire financial situation in a candid interview with Rolling Stone magazine, revealing he fell into a deep depression in 2016 as his money issues worsened, all while fighting allegations of domestic abuse during his bitter divorce from his The Rum Diary co-star Amber Heard.    ""I was as low as I believe I could have gotten,"" the 55-year-old said. ""The next step was, 'You're going to arrive somewhere with your eyes open and you're going to leave there with your eyes closed.' I couldn't take the pain every day"".

Another court filing also shows Chase asked for, and received, a change in his bond conditions that allowed him to remove the interlock device in his car.

Chase’s attorney writes in the filing that Chase wants to become an Uber driver.

Chase became a familiar name in middle Tennessee in 2014 after he was charged with domestic violence and was then allowed by a judge to avoid a 12-hour cooling off period after his arrest.

After that charge was ultimately dropped, Chase then filed a civil lawsuit in Williamson County, suing nine people, including Chase’s ex-girlfriend who brought the criminal charge against him.

When asked what the DA’s office could have done different, Chase replied, “Any level of investigation at all, period. Which they didn’t do any.”

Chase claims after the criminal charge, his reputation was damaged. He suffered humiliation and millions of dollars in financial loss because he said the ex-girlfriend he is accused of attacking conspired with another former girlfriend and others to ruin him.

“She stalked, harassed, trespassed, assaulted me and made false allegations that had me falsely imprisoned,” Chase said.

“She denies that she assaulted him,” said Rob McGuire, who represents Chase’s ex-girlfriend. “She denies that she entered into this conspiracy to defame him or ruin him. The truth of the matter is she’s a domestic violence victim.”

In the deposition, attorney Brian Manookian, who represents some of the others being sued, grilled Chase about his past. He asked how someone’s reputation can be damaged if their reputation is already questionable.

“Just tell me, how many times do you think you’ve been charged with assault, regardless of who charged you?” Manookian asked. “And keep going down this list, including the DUIs.”

“Five,” Chase replied.

“Do gentlemen take molly, snort cocaine, hang out in strip clubs and date strippers?” Manookian asked.

“I’m not sure,” Chase said. “Sure some do.”

“You would be one of those types of gentlemen, wouldn’t you, Mr. Chase?” Manookian said.

“Apparently so,” Chase said.

In the deposition, Chase said he is currently unemployed.

Chase’s attorney spoke to Channel 4 Thursday. He said the deposition did not tell Chase’s whole story and he hopes to get justice through the suit.

Chase’s request to remove the interlock device was approved.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Cher (Alicia Silverstone) explains to her classmates and Ms. Stoeger (Julie Brown) why their school's physical education department is a disgrace.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
Jane Austen might never have imagined that her 1816 novel Emma could be turned into a fresh and satirical look at ultra-rich teenagers in a Beverly Hills high school. Cher (Alicia Silverstone) and Dionne (Stacey Dash), both named after ""great singers of the past that now do infomercials,"" are pampered upper-class girls who care less about getting good grades than wearing the right clothes and being as popular as possible. But Cher, who lives with her tough yet warm-hearted lawyer dad (Dan Hedaya) and hunky, sensitive stepbrother (Paul Rudd), also has an innate urge to help those less fortunate -- like the two introverted teachers she brings together (""negotiating"" herself improved grades in the process) and new friend Tai (Brittany Murphy), who starts out a geek and ends up a Cher prodigy. Cher also possesses her own sensitive side, and she is looking for the perfect boyfriend, whom she ends up finding where she least expected.

At a preliminary hearing on Thursday, The Sun’s lawyers argued the case should be dismissed because Depp had failed to disclose text messages showing that he tried to buy “MDMA and other narcotics” while he was in Australia with Heard in 2015.Former partners Winona Ryder, Vanessa Paradis show support for actorThe newspaper’s lawyer, Adam Wolanski, said withholding the texts was a breach of a previous court order requiring Depp to provide all documents from separate libel proceedings against Heard in the United States.“There is a real risk that the claimant has failed to provide proper disclosure to the defendants, and that the defendants cannot have a fair trial,” he said.Wolanski said the issue of drug-taking was relevant because “it is the defendants’ case that drugs and alcohol had an influence on the claimant’s behavior towards Ms. Heard.”But Depp’s lawyer, David Sherborn, said the libel case was about “whether the defendants can prove that the claimant committed serious domestic violence and put Ms. Heard in fear. It is not about whether Mr. Depp asks for drugs.”In a witness statement, Depp said he had been “open about my challenges with alcoholism and addiction throughout my life.“ He said drugs or alcohol never made him “undertake violence against anyone.”Depp, 57, and Heard, 34, met on the set of the 2011 comedy “The Rum Diary” and married in Los Angeles in February 2015. They divorced in 2017.Each accuses the other of being abusive, and Depp is also suing Heard for libel in the United States.Depp and Heard are both expected to give evidence in person at the London trial, which was postponed from March because of the coronavirus pandemic.Witnesses could include Depp’s ex-partners Vanessa Paradis and Winona Ryder, who have both submitted statements supporting the “Pirates of the Caribbean” star.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/te8udrHHFDQ/default.jpg,120,90,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/te8udrHHFDQ/mqdefault.jpg,320,180,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/te8udrHHFDQ/hqdefault.jpg,480,360,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/te8udrHHFDQ/sddefault.jpg,640.0,480.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/te8udrHHFDQ/maxresdefault.jpg,1280.0,720.0,Breaking News 360,"['trump today news', 'today in news', 'fox news today', 'fox news', 'breaking news today', 'breaking news', 'usa today', 'usa today news']",22,none,Lawyers for The Sun urge judge to throw out Johnny Depp lawsuit against tabloid,"LONDON — Lawyers for British tabloid The Sun urged a U.K. judge on Thursday to throw out Johnny Depp’s libel claim against the paper because the film star allegedly failed to disclose evidence relating to his drug use.Depp is suing the newspaper’s publisher, News Group Newspapers, and Executive Editor Dan Wootton over a 2018 article claiming the actor was violent and abusive to his ex-wife Amber Heard.The trial is due to open at the High Court in London on July 7.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

However, much of what went on behind the scenes is not widely known, including affairs in addition to the one Watts took part in with his coworker.

Johnny Depp is complaining that Hollywood is boycotting him, but a Virginia judge just handed the Minamata star a big win in his $50 million defamation lawsuit against Amber Heard.

Already pursuing $100 million counterclaim, the Aquaman star attempted a Hail Mary move in April to have Fairfax County Chief Judge Penney Azcarate dismiss the two-year old case based on her ex-husband losing a libel trial in the UK late last year against Rupert Murdoch’s The Sun tabloid’s designation of the Oscar nominee as a “wife beater.”

A wrongful death lawsuit has been filed over the drowning of Glee actor Naya Rivera, who died in July while boating with her four-year-old son on a lake in California. The suit was filed on Tuesday against Ventura County and managers of Lake Piru over her accidental death on 8 Julyat the lake north-west of Los Angeles.  It was filed on behalf of her son, Josey Hollis Dorsey, by Ryan Dorsey  Riveras ex-husband and the boys father and guardian  and also on behalf of her estate. Rivera, 33, had rented a pontoon boat on the lake.  Her son was found sleeping and alone on the drifting boat later that afternoon.  Riveras body was found floating in a 30ft-deep area of the lake five days later.  The Ventura County sheriffs office said Riveras body was most likely trapped in thick vegetation underwater for several days before floating to the top. An autopsy report said Rivera was a good swimmer and listed her death as an accident. But the lawsuit alleges negligence was involved.  It said the pontoon boat lacked a safely accessible ladder, radio, rope, anchor or other equipment to keep swimmers from being separated from the boat.  It also didnt have a life preserver or other flotation or lifesaving devices, according to the suit. The man who rented Rivera the boat has said she declined a life vest, but he put one aboard anyway. The suit also said there werent any signs in the area warning of the lakes strong currents, low visibility, high winds and other dangers even though at least 26 people have drowned there since the lake opened in 1959. While Naya and Josey were swimming, the boat started to be carried away  likely by the current and wind, which gusted up to 21mph (34km/h) that afternoon, according to the lawsuit. Inaccurate reports had said that Rivera boosted the boy back aboard the boat but he managed to get aboard by himself, according to the suit.

If you were going to make a list of places to NOT to move to in Michigan, you’d have a lot to choose from. Michigan. The land of wolverines. The region of lakes. The domain of all who hunt. Some might say Michigan is the prettiest state of all. It’s an outdoor paradise, and there’s really pretty farms everywhere. The people are super cool. Most of them. What’s not to like? 

A lot. Like just about every other state in our fine nation, Michigan has its good and its bad. It’s not all like this. Many of this state’s largest cities are more like this. 

For the next 12 minutes, we’re going to talk about the bad places in Michigan. Some I’ve been to and seen firsthand. Others were suggested by you. But all of the places we’re going to talk about rank terribly when you measure good things that Michiganders care about. 

There won’t be many surprises. 

Is your hood going to be talked about? Will there be any places in the UP on here? Stay tuned and see. So, put off that trip to Meijer for a little bit. We’re gonna hop in our pickup and visit the worst places to live in Michigan!

If you were going to make a list of places to NOT to move to in Michigan, you’d have a lot to choose from. Michigan. The land of wolverines. The region of lakes. The domain of all who hunt. Some might say Michigan is the prettiest state of all. It’s an outdoor paradise, and there’s really pretty farms everywhere. The people are super cool. Most of them. What’s not to like? 

A lot. Like just about every other state in our fine nation, Michigan has its good and its bad. It’s not all like this. Many of this state’s largest cities are more like this. 

For the next 12 minutes, we’re going to talk about the bad places in Michigan. Some I’ve been to and seen firsthand. Others were suggested by you. But all of the places we’re going to talk about rank terribly when you measure good things that Michiganders care about. 

There won’t be many surprises. 

Is your hood going to be talked about? Will there be any places in the UP on here? Stay tuned and see. So, put off that trip to Meijer for a little bit. We’re gonna hop in our pickup and visit the worst places to live in Michigan!

In the afternoon session of the first day of Josh Duggar's child pornography trial, the prosecution called their second witness.#JoshDuggar #trial #Prosecutioncalls #HomelandSecurity #investigator #juryhears #searchwarrant #interviewDuggar FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. (KNWA/KFTA) — In the afternoon session of the first day of Josh Duggar’s child pornography trial, the prosecution called their second witness.

Special Agent Gerald Faulkner is a member of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) as well as the Internet Crimes Against Children (ICAC) task force.

But before the afternoon testimony began, Judge Timothy L. Roberts made his second apology of the day to the jury, as they were told to return at 1:20 p.m. and were not called back to the courtroom until nearly 1:50 p.m.

“I do mean what I say,” he said to them, drawing chuckles for the second time that day and bringing a little much-needed levity to this otherwise incredibly serious case.

He went on to explain that issues arose regarding some exhibits to be presented in the afternoon, and that he felt the little bit of time spent then to handle matters would benefit all involved in the long run.

After that, Assistant United States Attorney Dustin Roberts called Special Agent Faulkner to the witness stand.

Special Agent Faulkner detailed his career with Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), which began in 2009. He explained that while their branch commonly handles immigration issues, they are also “the largest investigation arm of Homeland Security.”

He also serves on a special response team that deals with terrorist threats, active shooter events, and other high-priority cases for HSI. He has also been a member of the Internet Crimes Against Children (ICAC) task force since 2010.

When asked how many cases he has worked for them, Faulkner estimated “approximately 1,000 cases,” with several hundred of those related to online child pornography.

The prosecution went over some of the ground covered in Detective Amber Kalmer’s morning testimony, regarding the details of when the peer-to-peer sharing of illegal material was discovered.

Special Agent Faulkner detailed the process that occurs from that point, which includes flagging the IP address and confirming that the transfer in question contained material that violated federal or state statutes.

Then, he explained to the jury, all of that information feeds into drawing up a probable cause affidavit.

Following that, he stated the three specific details he looks for when investigating:

Any and all electronic devices capable of file sharing.

Any devices with child pornography present on them.

Determining whether someone was physically using a computer on the dates that crimes occurred.

Detective Kalmer, through the use of Bit Torrent software specifically for police use, determined that the peer-to-peer transfers in question occurred from May 14-15, 2019. The program is one that runs 24 hours a day, and she did not immediately discover that this has happened.

She contacted Special Agent Faulkner in June, and he officially accepted the case in July. Later that month, he stated that he had identified Ozarks Go as the internet service provider (ISP) of the flagged IP address.

He then served a summons for subscriber information such as the owner, dates of service, type of service, and physical address of the IP address in question. He noted that the response time for such a summons can vary from 3-4 days to 3-4 months.

When he hadn’t received a response by October, he inquired and discovered that Ozarks Go had attempted to contact him using an incorrect email address.

On October 31, 2019, Special Agent Faulkner and a team of agents planned to serve a search warrant at the physical location of the IP address. He explained in detail that the property in question had recently been split into two parcels, and that the physical address was incorrectly sending them to the wrong place.

The team of agents quickly discovered that the error was due to “outdated, old mapping records,” and this was confirmed when they arrived at a house with no internet service that Duggar had never lived at. Thus, the warrant was not served.

The HSI sent an undercover agent to Duggar’s place of business, Wholesale Motorcars, the following week. The HSI then requested and received a search warrant, which was served at the car lot on November 8, 2019.

A copy of the search and seizure warrant served was one of half a dozen documents the prosecution submitted as exhibits of evidence. Others included more documents and aerial shots of the vicinity of the car lot.

Special Agent Faulkner then walked the jury through the steps of serving the warrant.

Ron DeSantis’ approach to the COVID-19 pandemic, which is spiking again in Florida, the governor fired back.

""If you're coming after the rights of parents in Florida, I'm standing in your way,"" DeSantis defiantly responded on Wednesday. ""If you're trying to deny kids a proper in-person education, I'm going to stand in your way and stand up for the kids in Florida. If you're trying to restrict people and impose mandates and ruin their jobs and livelihood; if you are trying to lock people down, I am standing in your way. I am standing for the people of Florida.""

He finished by saying, ""Why don't you do your job, why don't you get this border secure? Until you do that, I don't want to hear a blip about COVID from you.""

Ron DeSantis’ approach to the COVID-19 pandemic, which is spiking again in Florida, the governor fired back.

""If you're coming after the rights of parents in Florida, I'm standing in your way,"" DeSantis defiantly responded on Wednesday. ""If you're trying to deny kids a proper in-person education, I'm going to stand in your way and stand up for the kids in Florida. If you're trying to restrict people and impose mandates and ruin their jobs and livelihood; if you are trying to lock people down, I am standing in your way. I am standing for the people of Florida.""

He finished by saying, ""Why don't you do your job, why don't you get this border secure? Until you do that, I don't want to hear a blip about COVID from you.""

Tekashi 6ix9ine is once again making headlines, this time for a lawsuit that saw an adult dancer end up in the hospital. Another lawsuit see’s Jason Campbell, formerly known as the Tik Tok Doc, being sued by a former colleague, with claims he made unwanted advancements. And I referred to Campbell as formerly known as Tik Tok Doc, because his account is now gone. But wait, there’s more. Dr. Seuss has been cancelled, and on his birthday, what a shame, but really, you gotta stick around to find out who’s to blame. Little rhyme there for ya.

We make interesting videos about Hollywood in English. We give you a closer look in the lives of celebrities like Kanye West, Ed Sheeran, The Rock, Jay Z, Selena Gomez, Kylie Jenner, Kim Kardashian, Rihanna and 100s more.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

Now it turns out that Amber Heard may have not written the statement or OP ED in accusations against Johnny Depp. This could another case of defamation or fraud. Let's break it down in today's video.

Hollywood Dazzle :- Subscribe here:-  https://goo.gl/cqEWXg
_________________________________________________________________About the Video :-
Depp and Heard finalized their divorce back in 2017, and yet the former couple is still embroiled in a messy legal battle.
Depp is suing his ex-wife for $50 million for defamation of character.
Normally, in high-profile cases like these, the case gets settled out of court.
But that won't be the case with Depp and Heard.
Depp claimed that Heard tried to cut his fingers off during a particularly violent altercation.
Heard described Depp as an alcoholic monster prone to fits of jealous rage over actors she had shared screentime with.
A date has been set for February 3, 2020, and a estimates the trial will last 12 days.

_________________________________________________________________About the Video :-
Depp and Heard finalized their divorce back in 2017, and yet the former couple is still embroiled in a messy legal battle.
Depp is suing his ex-wife for $50 million for defamation of character.
Normally, in high-profile cases like these, the case gets settled out of court.
But that won't be the case with Depp and Heard.
Depp claimed that Heard tried to cut his fingers off during a particularly violent altercation.
Heard described Depp as an alcoholic monster prone to fits of jealous rage over actors she had shared screentime with.
A date has been set for February 3, 2020, and a estimates the trial will last 12 days.

A lawyer for Johnny Depp told a British judge on Wednesday (26 February 2020) that the star's ex-wife Amber Heard lied when she accused him of domestic abuse.
  
Depp denies the abuse allegations, and attended the High Court in London for a preliminary hearing in his libel suit against British tabloid newspaper The Sun.
  
The Hollywood star is suing The Sun’s parent company, News Group Newspapers, and the newspaper’s executive editor, Dan Wootton, over a 2018 article alleging he had been abusive to Heard.
  
The “Pirates of the Caribbean” star sat behind his legal team in court as his lawyer David Sherborne said the case would feature “diametrically opposed” versions of events from Depp and Heard.
  
“One person, one side, is lying, and one is not,” he said. ""Obviously, we say that it is Ms. Heard (who is lying), Mr. Depp is 100% clear about that."" 
  
The lawyer said that Heard was not a victim but the “aggressor” in the couple’s relationship. Depp and Heard divorced in 2017.
  
The full hearing is due to start on March 23.
  
Depp is also suing Heard for libel in the United States.

OUTLAW SHIT Lyrics 

(STRUGGLE)
She said storms never last
So I'm looking out the window like
When's it gonna pass
I need some cash, I did the math
It keeps ending in subtraction
Is it fate or just the laws of attraction
I'll never know..
Posi-Traction..
Fast-lane cocaine dealer
Tryna' ease the pain
With these pain killers
I don't want my soul to be stained
To obtain my wealth
I couldn't learn from his mistakes
I had to make 'em myself
An I ain't never been scared
But reality is frightening
My 3 year old daughter's name
Came from my indictments
Like a VH1 story with a hard ending
Shit I'm serving a life sentence
An I still got a charge pending
Seems like everywhere I go now they watching
Hiding this pain in my eyes behind Versaces
I cant sleep I'm too busy chasing dreams 
An the feds sent a posse down like I an't never seen

(WAYLON JENNINGS) (chorus)
Don't you think this outlaw shit
Has gotten out of hand
What started out to be a joke
The law don't understand

(STRUGGLE)
I've always been crazy
But it helped me from going insane
I grew up thinking it's part of the game
Them outlaws always taught me
Bad guys were the feds
Don't get high on your supply
Your brain will look like eggs
In a skillet 
Yeah can you feel it
Forget it
80's baby, crack era
That's how I'm 'a get it
Fresh up out of jail
New plan, new man
But I can't seem to change who I am
I'm a hustler
I been running for so long from them boys
I can't go to sleep without the noise
Television's on, .40 by my head
Laying on the couch while my shorty's in the bed
If I stay awake till 5 I'll probably sell another ounce
Shoes tied tight just in case I gotta bounce
Hear they tires hit the gravel
How they know I'm back at it?
Little girl looking ""daddy why you in the attic?""
I'm hiding...

(WAYLON JENNINGS) (chorus)
Don't you think this outlaw shit
Has gotten out of hand
What started out to be a joke
The law don't understand

(YELAWOLF)
But it's a beautiful view
When you're looking down
From this high
Over snow capped mountains
Crimson dyed
Don't give my momma black roses
I got a gun but I'm not strong enough to hold it
Crimson dyed
A broken record for a token
Pay a silver dollar for another crime story
But when you're looking down
From this high
An I just made it to the clouds
An it'll be a while before I hit the ground
An taking freedom from me now
Would be like taking water from the Nile
Cause the river still flows
From a story that a dam couldn't hold

(WAYLON JENNINGS) (chorus)
Don't you think this outlaw shit
Has gotten out of hand
What started out to be a joke

OUTLAW SHIT Lyrics 

(STRUGGLE)
She said storms never last
So I'm looking out the window like
When's it gonna pass
I need some cash, I did the math
It keeps ending in subtraction
Is it fate or just the laws of attraction
I'll never know..
Posi-Traction..
Fast-lane cocaine dealer
Tryna' ease the pain
With these pain killers
I don't want my soul to be stained
To obtain my wealth
I couldn't learn from his mistakes
I had to make 'em myself
An I ain't never been scared
But reality is frightening
My 3 year old daughter's name
Came from my indictments
Like a VH1 story with a hard ending
Shit I'm serving a life sentence
An I still got a charge pending
Seems like everywhere I go now they watching
Hiding this pain in my eyes behind Versaces
I cant sleep I'm too busy chasing dreams 
An the feds sent a posse down like I an't never seen

(WAYLON JENNINGS) (chorus)
Don't you think this outlaw shit
Has gotten out of hand
What started out to be a joke
The law don't understand

(STRUGGLE)
I've always been crazy
But it helped me from going insane
I grew up thinking it's part of the game
Them outlaws always taught me
Bad guys were the feds
Don't get high on your supply
Your brain will look like eggs
In a skillet 
Yeah can you feel it
Forget it
80's baby, crack era
That's how I'm 'a get it
Fresh up out of jail
New plan, new man
But I can't seem to change who I am
I'm a hustler
I been running for so long from them boys
I can't go to sleep without the noise
Television's on, .40 by my head
Laying on the couch while my shorty's in the bed
If I stay awake till 5 I'll probably sell another ounce
Shoes tied tight just in case I gotta bounce
Hear they tires hit the gravel
How they know I'm back at it?
Little girl looking ""daddy why you in the attic?""
I'm hiding...

(WAYLON JENNINGS) (chorus)
Don't you think this outlaw shit
Has gotten out of hand
What started out to be a joke
The law don't understand

(YELAWOLF)
But it's a beautiful view
When you're looking down
From this high
Over snow capped mountains
Crimson dyed
Don't give my momma black roses
I got a gun but I'm not strong enough to hold it
Crimson dyed
A broken record for a token
Pay a silver dollar for another crime story
But when you're looking down
From this high
An I just made it to the clouds
An it'll be a while before I hit the ground
An taking freedom from me now
Would be like taking water from the Nile
Cause the river still flows
From a story that a dam couldn't hold

(WAYLON JENNINGS) (chorus)
Don't you think this outlaw shit
Has gotten out of hand
What started out to be a joke
The law don't understand",PT5M27S,2d,hd,false,True,rectangular,processed,public,youtube,True,True,False,55491284,385542,26897,0,7344,,en,,

We're told the video was shot months before the May 21 incident in which Amber claims Johnny struck her.
Amber asks Johnny if he drank a bottle of wine and tries to calm him down. She says she was sorry for something although she was not specific.   
Johnny isn't having it, and appears out of control. After throwing the glass and bottle, you see him swiping at Amber's phone ... trying to get it from her.
