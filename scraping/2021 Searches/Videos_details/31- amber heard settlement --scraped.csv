In October, Alabama's capital city removed the Confederate president's name from an avenue and renamed it after civil rights icon Fred D. Gray. Now the state attorney general says the city must pay a $25-thousand fine or face a lawsuit for violating a state law protecting Confederate monuments and other longstanding memorials.  Montgomery Mayor Steven Reed will join us to talk about this craziness.

Two trials we have our eye on:
A Chicago judge begins questioning prospective jurors for former ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett's trial today.   And Brooklyn Center, Minnesota, is preparing for tomorrow's start of the manslaughter trial of a former Minnesota police officer who fatally shot a Black man while yelling ""Taser"" during a traffic-stop-turned-arrest earlier this year.

A black man in New York who spent 39 years in jail for a rape he did not commit is now a free man after discovering serious flaws with his prosecution.

A star high school baseball player in New York transfers schools after a school assistant athletic director said the student got his speed - get this - from running from police.

Some sad news to report, designer Virgil Abloh, Flordia lawmaker Carrie Meek & the man who broke the color barrier in golf, Lee Elder, have died.  We'll have a special tribute to Lee tonight.

The Texan actress was born in Austin in 1986, and had her first starring role in 2006 as a desirable high-school girl invited to a party in horror film ""All the Boys Love Mandy Lane"".
In 2008 Heard landed roles in ""Never Back Down"" and comedy ""Pineapple Express"" and in male stripper tale ""Magic Mike XXL"" in 2015.
In 2011 she starred in ""The Rum Diary"" opposite future husband, actor Johnny Depp, 57.
They married in 2015, but had a tempestuous five-year relationship that ended in divorce in May 2016, following accusations of assault against Heard.
Depp, star of films including ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" and ""Edward Scissorhands,"" went to London's High Court last year to sue the Sun newspaper and one of its journalists over a tabloid article that stated he had been violent towards his ex-wife.
High Court Judge Andrew Nicol ruled last November that Depp had violently assaulted Heard, at times putting her in fear for her life. That decision came after three weeks of hearings where the court heard sensational claim and counter-claim from both parties about violent outbursts which each accused the other of committing.
In March this year, Depp's legal team applied for permission to appeal the High Court ruling upheld that he was a wife beater and to rely on further evidence. His lawyers said Heard's claim that she had donated her divorce settlement to charity was a ""calculated lie"".
Depp has also filed a $50 million defamation lawsuit against Heard in a Virginia court over an opinion piece she wrote in The Washington Post.
Heard is also known for playing Mera in DC Comics' 2018 superhero film ""Aquaman"", opposite ""Game of Thrones"" actor Jason Momoa in the title role of the half-human, half-Atlantean character.
She is set to reprise the 'queen of the sea' role in version 2 of ""Aquaman"", slated for 2022. The character also features in 2017 action adventure ""Justice League"".
Heard is also a human rights activist and #MeToo campaigner.
In October 2018 she told a United Nations audience in Geneva that Hollywood falls ""way behind"" when it comes to human rights and has a responsibility to change.

 Johnny Depp has won the option to sue Amber Heard in $50 million slander case after a Virginia judge tossed out the entertainer's request to excuse the suit. Depp, 58, is attempting to demonstrate his innocence in the wake of losing a criticism suit against The Sun after the paper marked him a 'undershirt' in the midst of claims of homegrown maltreatment. The Virginia case identifies with a 2018 Washington Post operation Ed¬†in which Heard, 35, expounded on enduring homegrown maltreatment - in spite of the fact that she didn't name her ex in the piece.¬† Depp's suit, recorded in Fairfax County,¬†Virginia, blames Heard for making a 'trick' record of being an aggressive behavior at home survivor for the 2018 article.¬† Heard had mentioned the slander suit against her, documented in March 2019, be tossed out, guaranteeing the decision in the UK case should swing any new cases in support of herself since the two of them identify with homegrown maltreatment claims against Depp.¬† But Judge Azcarate yesterday controlled the articulations made by The Sun and Heard were 'intrinsically unique'. The decision expressed: 'The Sun's advantages depended on whether the assertions the paper distributed were bogus. [Heard's] interests identify with whether the assertions she distributed were bogus.' The decision additionally noted Depp recorded the criticism suit against The Sun before Heard's commentary was distributed - and that she was not named for the situation against the British paper. In the December 2018 commentary, Heard wrote:¬†'I turned into an individual of note addressing homegrown maltreatment, and I felt the full power of our way of life's fierceness for ladies who talk out.'¬†¬† The UK's High Court governed against Depp following a hazardous three-week preliminary last July, discovering charges the entertainer was a 'undershirt' was 'generously true.'¬† The appointed authority decided that Depp attacked Heard on twelve events and put her in 'dread of her life' multiple times regularly while on drink and medications gorges, which he said transformed the entertainer into a 'beast', in quite possibly the most high-profile criticism conflicts of this century.¬†¬† Lawyers for The Pirates of the Caribbean star had requested two Court from Appeal judges to concede consent for him to challenge the decision, determined to have its discoveries toppled and a second preliminary ordered.¬† They guaranteed the adjudicator in Depp's underlying slander preliminary had not 'verifiably' considered every one of the claims of savagery against him and that they had 'new proof' Heard had 'lied' about giving her entire¬†$7million separate from settlement to good cause. They said that the foundation guarantee affected how her declaration was seen, however the Court of Appeal decided that it didn't affect the adjudicator and that he would have arrived at a similar resolution on Heard being the casualty of aggressive behavior at home. Depp lost his part in Disney film Fantastic Beasts following the High Court judgment, and the harm to his standing dangers him missing out on more jobs later on.

Actress Amber Heard, who recently went through a public and contentious divorce and legal dispute with ex-husband Johnny Depp, is now publicly responding to Depp's followers on social media who have been sending her derogatory comments amidst the former couple's continued legal battles.

For those unaware, Johnny's ex-girlfriends were named in a lawsuit against The Sun for branding him a ""wife-beater."" Johnny's effort to get the case retried in the UK was futile after the two raised their respective sides. In the United States, a slander case is already due to be heard this year. Depp sued Heard for slander in Virginia after she penned an op-ed for The Washington Post in 2018 in which she described herself as a domestic violence victim, though she never listed Depp by name. The actor is claiming damages in the amount of USD 50 million.

After the suit was held in Amber's favor, the Aqua man actress took to twitter to brand Johnny's lawyer ""short,"" and she's now sent tweets to fans who are against her. ‚ÄúI'd rather be short than an abusive gold digger,‚Äù one fan responded to the diss. ‚ÄúIt's nice to be objective about your goals,‚Äù Amber replied.

Much like their separation months earlier, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have had the benefit of a quickly finalized divorce, leaving each of them to go their separate ways. While staying in a loveless marriage is never a good prospect, divorce can sometimes be almost as bad, which Johnny is now realizing, as he faces the aftermath of his divorce. As it happened, the judge overseeing this particular divorce chose Friday the 13th as the fateful day of dissolving the Depp/Heard marriage, ending a bitter battle that has been played out in the media since their separation. Even as Depp attempts to rebuild his life, after finding himself single once again, the Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them actor is also facing another lawsuit, this one initiated by Depp, himself. As People reveals, Johnny didn‚Äôt get everything for which he was hoping in his divorce settlement from Amber Heard with the judge largely siding with Ms. Heard, but the actor is now free from all ties to his ex-wife. Friday, January 13, a day which most people view with a measure of superstition, was a busy day for Heard and Depp, as that was the day the judge declared the divorce proceedings finalized. For Amber, that means she will be receiving her $7 million settlement, funds which she has pledged to donate to charity. ‚ÄúIt is a great day. All Amber wanted was a divorce and now she has it. In the words of Gerald Ford, ‚ÄòOur long national nightmare is over,'‚Äù Ms. Heard‚Äôs attorney, Pierce O‚ÄôDonnell, said. Mr. Depp had requested a $100,000 sanction be imposed on Heard, alleging that Amber had deliberately tried to delay divorce proceedings, but the judge declined to impose the penalty. Alternatively, Ms. Heard has asserted a similar accusation, saying that Mr. Depp delayed taking action in making settlement payments, transferring ownership of a vehicle, and prevented her from retrieving her personal property.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

The 'Pirates of the Caribbean' actor is suing his ex-wife for libel and has claimed she doctored photos to make it look like he had assaulted her, and so a court has now agreed to his request for lawyers to examine her mobile use as he wants to prove his forgery claim.
His lawyer, Benjamin Chew, said: ""Ms Heard‚Äôs counsel has repeatedly used these phony photographs at deposition.‚Äù 
The lawyer also claimed Los Angeles police had ""disavowed the photographs‚Äù and ‚Äúdid not depict what they saw‚Äù.
He added: ""[Police] found no injury upon Ms. Heard and no disruption to the penthouses. 
‚ÄúMs. Heard and her friends then fabricated photos that she used to obtain an ex parte TRO [temporary restraining order] and a $7 million divorce settlement which Ms. Heard falsely testified in London she gave to the ACLU and, more scandalously, to the Children‚Äôs Hospital of Los Angeles; sick children with cancer.""
The lawyer had argued earlier images handed over had no metadata so their expert, Brian Neumeister, could not verify the details.
The lawyer said: ""Mr. Neumeister‚Äôs preliminary investigation shows that a number of the photographs have been run through a photo ‚Äî a photo editing application called Photo 3 that can easily manipulate images such as showing bruises where none actually existed.""
And he insisted in last year's libel trial with The Sun newspaper - who Johnny unsuccessfully sued after they branded him a ""wife beater"" - the publication's own expert concluded photos allegedly depicting the 'Danish Girl' star's 2015 injuries were ""manipulated three years later"".
He added: ‚ÄúAs such, any editing of the trial bundle versions would have been on or after Oct. 6 2018.
‚ÄúSo Ms. Heard or someone on her behalf doctored those photographs three years later. When that came up in her testimony in London, Ms. Heard falsely denied it. In short, Your Honour, without forensic imaging Mr. Neumeister cannot properly assess or verify Ms. Heard‚Äôs data.""
An expert will now be able to look at the phone to examine if the photos had been fabricated, but the judge denied a request from the 'Aquaman' actress' team to have Johnny hand over his phone and laptop, saying they had asked for ""too broad"" a search.
Amber's lawyers have hit back and accused the 58-year-old star of failing to support the ""authenticity"" of his own evidence.
Her attorney said: ‚ÄúAmber Heard remains willing and able to support the authenticity of her evidence, and her IT forensics expert has cooperated in this effort.
""In sharp contrast, Mr Depp has been unable to produce even the audio tapes from which he leaked a partial out-of-context portion, much less any support for the authenticity of any of his evidence.‚Äù
The lawsuit relates to a December 2019 op-ed Amber penned for the Washington Post, in which the 35-year-old star wrote she had ‚Äúbecome a public figure representing domestic abuse"", though she didn't mention her ex-husband by name.
The suit claims the 'Black Mass' star has suffered financial losses as a result of the accusations.

And he insisted in last year's libel trial with The Sun newspaper - who Johnny unsuccessfully sued after they branded him a ""wife beater"" - the publication's own expert concluded photos allegedly depicting the 'Danish Girl' star's 2015 injuries were ""manipulated three years later"".
He added: ‚ÄúAs such, any editing of the trial bundle versions would have been on or after Oct. 6 2018.
‚ÄúSo Ms. Heard or someone on her behalf doctored those photographs three years later. When that came up in her testimony in London, Ms. Heard falsely denied it. In short, Your Honour, without forensic imaging Mr. Neumeister cannot properly assess or verify Ms. Heard‚Äôs data.""
An expert will now be able to look at the phone to examine if the photos had been fabricated, but the judge denied a request from the 'Aquaman' actress' team to have Johnny hand over his phone and laptop, saying they had asked for ""too broad"" a search.
Amber's lawyers have hit back and accused the 58-year-old star of failing to support the ""authenticity"" of his own evidence.
Her attorney said: ‚ÄúAmber Heard remains willing and able to support the authenticity of her evidence, and her IT forensics expert has cooperated in this effort.
""In sharp contrast, Mr Depp has been unable to produce even the audio tapes from which he leaked a partial out-of-context portion, much less any support for the authenticity of any of his evidence.‚Äù
The lawsuit relates to a December 2019 op-ed Amber penned for the Washington Post, in which the 35-year-old star wrote she had ‚Äúbecome a public figure representing domestic abuse"", though she didn't mention her ex-husband by name.
The suit claims the 'Black Mass' star has suffered financial losses as a result of the accusations.

Jury selection is underway in the trial of former Minnesota police officer Kimberly Potter, who shot and killed Daunte Wright during a traffic stop earlier this year.  Today, some jurors have been chosen, and Potter's attorney said she will be testifying during the trial.  Journalist Georgia Fort is covering the trial. She'll join us with the latest.

Philadelphia prosecutors want the U.S. Supreme Court to review Bill Cosby's sexual assault case and restore his conviction.

He was freed after serving decades in prison for a crime he did not commit with absolutely no compensation for the state of Missouri.  Kevin Strickland is close to being a millionaire now after a fundraiser.

President Joe Biden signs four bills into law aimed at helping veterans. Thanks to Georgia Senator Raphael Warnock, one bill will study the race and ethnic disparities in compensation benefits administered by Veterans Affairs.

A study finds landlords are discriminating against applicants based on their names.

In our HBCU Connect segment today, we'll talk to the man who had a big part in Dillard University getting $5 million to create internships.

An anti-Critical Race Theory complaint targeting books about Martin Luther King Jr. and Ruby Bridges by a Tennessee group gets denied.

In our Marketplace segment sponsored by Verizon, we'll talk to one black entrepreneur who wanted to ensure other black women do not get sick from chemicals in feminine products - so she created her own.  

Barbados celebrates as it cuts colonial-era ties with Britain and Queen Elizabeth II.

Amber Heard has been in the news for all the wrong reasons for quite a while now. She definitely has been one of Hollywood‚Äôs most controversial actors. It has been quite a roller coaster ride when it comes to Amber Heard and her career and public opinion. Of course, more than for her acting roles or movies, she has been in the spotlight for her relationship and issues with Johnny Depp. The actor had accused Depp of being physically abusive after their breakup. 

But to everyone's surprise, things came to a halt in that direction pretty soon. After Depp had been dropped out of a number of projects, new facts and rumors came to play. In quite a dramatic, soap-opera style revelation, it was now said that Depp, not Amber Heard, was actually the victim of abuse. This obviously ruffled a lot of feathers; fans who had supported her were heartbroken and confused, and general public opinion turned against her. Even a lot of her co-workers began revealing a lot of previously buried stuff.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

A judge ended Johnny Depp and Amber Heard's marriage on Friday after months of bickering over the final terms of their breakup.
The judgment keeps in place many of the key terms the actors agreed to in August, when they announced a settlement in their divorce a day before a restraining order hearing that would have focused on Heard's allegations that Depp was physically abusive toward her.
Their agreement called for Depp to pay Heard $7 million, which she has pledged to a pair of charities. Attorneys for the actors have squabbled over whether Depp can make the payments directly to the charities and other details of the final judgment.
""We are all pleased to put this unpleasant chapter in Mr. Depp and his family's lives behind them,"" his attorney Laura Wasser wrote in a statement. ""Having his request for entry of the dissolution judgment granted today made it a particularly lucky Friday the 13th.""
The couple has no children together, but Heard will keep their dogs, Pistol and Boo, and a horse named Arrow.
The judgment splits up several other assets, including cars and property. Neither actor will receive spousal support, and a confidentiality provision calls for them to refrain from discussing their relationship in interviews or on social media.
The actors signed the judgment in December, which led Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Carl H. Moor to state at the outset of a hearing Friday, ""I'm scratching my head a little bit about why we're all here.""
He received assurances from lawyers that there was no dispute over the terms of the judgment, and Heard's lawyer Pierce O'Donnell said the actress wanted the case to end immediately.
""My client would be very happy to move on with her life,"" O'Donnell said.
The judgment ends a marriage that lasted less than two years. The pair met on the set of the 2011 film ""The Rum Diary"" and married in February 2015, but separated in May 2016.
Depp denied he physically abused Heard. Police officers who responded to their apartment in May after a fight between the couple said they found no evidence of a crime.
""Our relationship was intensely passionate and at times volatile, but always bound by love,"" the actors said in a joint statement released after Heard dismissed her restraining order petition. ""Neither party has made false accusations for financial gain. There was never any intent of physical or emotional harm.""

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

During her trip, she visited a number of informal settlements in the Beka‚Äôa Valley where SAMS has provided and continues to provide medical care, from primary health care care to psychosocial support services.
One of the informal settlements she visited was  Al-Omaria, the only camp specifically designated for widows and their children in the Beka‚Äôa Valley. There are 25 widows and their 60 children residing in this settlement. All the widows are registered with the UNHCR, and 80% receive a monthly stipend of $27 for living costs. Once a widow‚Äôs son reaches the age of 13, the widow is given the choice to either force her son to leave the settlement on his own, or have the whole family depart from the settlement.
As a result of the trauma and loss experienced, these widows are in dire need of psychosocial support to help them cope with their emotional fatigue. Amber has partnered with SAMS on a new CrowdRise campaign to support these women and children.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

Thompson. They married in February 2015, but Heard filed for divorce just over a year later, and obtained a temporary restraining order against Depp after accusing him of hitting her. She said at the time, according to The Associated Press, that she had¬†‚Äúendured excessive emotional, verbal and physical abuse‚Äù¬†in the relationship.

She withdrew those claims the day before a restraining order hearing was scheduled, and the divorce was finalized with a $7 million settlement. In a joint statement, the two declared: ‚ÄúNeither party has made false accusations for financial gain. There was never any intent of physical or emotional harm.‚Äù
But the allegations did not go away. The Sun article appeared in April 2018. A few months later, Heard published¬†an opinion piece in The Washington Post¬†titled, ‚ÄúI spoke up against sexual violence ‚Äî and faced our culture‚Äôs wrath. That has to change.‚Äù¬†Depp is suing Heard for defamation in the United States¬†over that article, which he says led to him being dropped from the ‚ÄúPirates of the Caribbean‚Äù movie franchise.

Later, Heard told the court¬†that Depp often put her in ‚Äúlife-threatening‚Äù situations. ‚ÄúI had been for years, for years, Johnny‚Äôs punching bag,‚Äù she¬†added on Tuesday. On Wednesday,¬†she detailed an episode¬†in Australia in which she said he threw bottles at her ‚Äúlike grenades or bombs.‚Äù
In pretrial documents, Heard¬†listed 14 times¬†when she said Depp assaulted her.
The first occurred in early 2013, Heard said in¬†a pretrial statement, when the couple was sitting on a couch talking about one of Depp‚Äôs tattoos. She said it had originally read ‚ÄúWinona,‚Äù in reference to Winona Ryder, his former partner, but that he had changed it to read ‚ÄúWino.‚Äù

Heard said she had laughed during the conversation, and in response Depp hit her three times. ‚ÄúIt felt like my eye popped out,‚Äù¬†she added of the third strike, saying it knocked her off balance and to the floor.
In later incidents, Heard claims, Depp grabbed her by the hair, choked her, head-butted her and repeatedly punched her, on top of emotional abuse and other controlling behavior.

She also said that his behavior was ‚Äúso confusing because when he was clean and sober, he was wonderful and that part of him I loved so much.‚Äù News Group Newspapers ‚Äî The Sun‚Äôs publisher ‚Äî claims Depp‚Äôs memory of the couple‚Äôs time together has been impaired by heavy drug and alcohol use. He has admitted use of both at times in the relationship, but said his tolerance for substances was high.

Depp denies the incidents. He told the court that whenever the couple had an argument he would retreat, sometimes hiding in bathrooms. ‚ÄúI would try to go to my own corner, as it were,‚Äù¬†he said when asked about one incident. ‚ÄúI thought it was important that we separate before things got out of hand.‚Äù Witnesses including a former estate manager for Depp and a former assistant to Heard have testified in his favor.

Depp has repeatedly portrayed Heard as an aggressor, provoking arguments. In the incident in Australia, Depp told the court, Heard threw a vodka bottle at him, severing the tip of one of his fingers.
Heard denies all claims that she was violent toward him, and said that Depp must have severed the fingertip himself, potentially in the process of ripping a phone off the wall and smashing it beside her face repeatedly.
At one point¬†Heard admitted she had thrown ‚Äúpots and pans‚Äù at Depp, but said it was ‚Äúonly to escape him.‚Äù She also acknowledged hitting him once but only to protect her sister, who she thought he was about to push down some stairs. ‚ÄúI will never forget it,‚Äù¬†she said of that moment. ‚ÄúIt was the first time after all these years that I actually struck him back.‚Äù

Kingdom Death: Monster is a fully cooperative tabletop hobby game experience. Set in a unique nightmarish world devoid of most natural resources, you control a settlement at the dawn of its existence. Fight monsters, craft weapons and gear, and develop your settlement to ensure your survival from generation to generation.

Campaign System
Embark alone or with up to 3 friends (5 with game variant) on a 5-30-lantern-year campaign, with each year consisting of a cycle of hunt, showdown, and settlement phases. The settlement phase is an intricate civilization building game in which you spend very limited resources to build buildings, research new technologies, train your warriors, and set up your strategy for survival. During the hunt, you'll encounter a series of stories in a ""choose your own adventure"" style journey through various events and encounters. Finally, when you meet the monster you're pursuing, you'll engage it in an a massive arena-style battle where only one party is going to survive. If your party lives, you'll be able to bring the spoils back home to use in expanding your settlement.

Monster AI System
Each of the 7 monsters included are controlled by their own pair of decks that scale to 3 levels of difficulty (except for the final encounter, which has only 1 level and it's HARD!). Every encounter, even with the same monster, is highly variable and no two showdowns will resolve the same way. Players will have to plan their gear and keep their minds sharp to prevail.

Gear System
In Kingdom Death: Monster, survivors will craft gear from resources earned from defeating monsters or found on their hunt. Each survivor has a 3x3 gear grid. Selection and arrangement of your gear cards is critical, as many provided bonuses and activate special rules when aligned correctly.

Story Event System
40+ Story Events plus over 100 hunt encounters will shape and guide your campaign. Story Events detail important evolutions in your civilization, introduce new monsters, and provide rich detail for your campaign. Some will trigger automatically as you progress through the campaign, but most will be entirely based on choices players make.

Story Events cover everything from setting up and fighting a monster to key events that happen within the overall story. Some are triggered directly from the timeline and others from choices you make in game.

Did Amber Heard just get booted for Aquaman 2? This would be great news to Johnny Depp and Aquaman fans around the world. The #FireAmberHeard movement is going strong. It seems the Aquaman 2 director, James Wan, does not even want Amber Heard in the movie. 

It seems like everyone is turning against Amber Heard. Including the actors in the movie such as Jason Momoa, Nicole Kidman, William Dafoe, etc. The Johnny Depp Amber Heard legal battle is still at the forefront of celebrity news. 

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

Now she is chilling and taking photos on set of the new Aquaman 2 movie. Set to hit theaters in 2022. This is enraging a lot of Johnny Depp supporters.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

Golden Heard petitioned for separation from Johnny Depp in May and their money related settlement was settled upon months back. However it turns out Depp has clearly neglected to pay Heard the rest of the $6.8 million owed by separation settlement the two gatherings settled upon. Listened, as far as it matters for her, isn't having any a greater amount of the deferral. Her legal advisors documented a court arrange on Wednesday to compel Depp to pay the adjust owed and kick up the pace on divvying up whatever remains of their advantages and property, as indicated by E! News and the Daily Mail, which initially reported the story. 

Heard's group documented a Request for Order with the Los Angeles Superior Court this week as an approach to accelerate the rest of the separation procedures. The group likewise asked for lawyer charges totaling up to $35,435, as per E! News. Heard reported not long ago that she would give the aggregate of her separation settlement to two philanthropies, the ACLU and Children's Hospital of Los Angeles. Depp then took after that up and made the underlying $200,000 installment of the settlement to the philanthropies rather than Heard, something she hammers him about in the court records. 

In the matter of why Depp has apparently slowed down on the settlement, it may need to do with Heard's late PSA on abusive behavior at home and her letter in Porter magazine about approaching as a survivor (not a casualty!) of ambush. Terms of the settlement incorporated a privacy understanding that deny Heard from castigating Depp out in the open. Despite the fact that Heard didn't name Depp in her PSA or open letter, Depp's group apparently accepts they're infringing upon the understanding, as indicated by the court reports Heard's legal advisors documented.

Fans who are regularly updated on the situation between Johnny Depp as known as Jack sparrow and Aquaman actress Amber heard, her ex-wife attended the final hearing of the domestic abuse trial, where Amber got the lead. She thanked all her fans who supported her on social media. But this story isn‚Äôt ended yet, Johnny Depp considered this trial a total misjudged and called it an injustice. Depp‚Äôs Lawyers claimed a new trial according to them:

‚ÄúThe first trial‚Äôs judge ‚Äúfailed to properly assess her credibility by reference to documentary evidence, photographs, recordings or otherwise.‚Äù

What barrister David Sherborne, who is Depp‚Äôs lawyer, wants to bring to notice is Amber‚Äôs being untruthful in her pieces of evidence and statements. 
‚Äú‚Ä¶.without taking account of or even acknowledging that Ms. Heard had been untruthful in her evidence, without testing her account against the documentary evidence and the evidence of other witnesses, and without making any findings that he disbelieved those witnesses,‚Äù 

Now from here the new story of a new trial starts, previous trial ended in amber‚Äôs favor but what this new trial is going to bring? Whether Depp has cut off the nose to spite the face or Amber this time dig her own grave?
So, Depp, this time accused her of showing fake charity documents to court as she promised to give a 7 million dollar settlement donation. This time Depp‚Äôs lawyers emerged after doing all of their homework.
