A Warner Bros. Pictures e o diretor James Wan apresentam Aquaman, uma aventura repleta de ação pelo vasto e deslumbrante mundo subaquático dos sete mares, estrelada por Jason Momoa no papel-título. O filme revela a origem de Arthur Curry, meio homem, meio atlante, que embarca em uma jornada para descobrir quem ele realmente é e se ele é digno de seu destino... ser rei.
O filme também é estrelado por Amber Heard (“Liga da Justiça”, “Magic Mike XXL”) como Mera, uma guerreira destemida e aliada de Aquaman ao longo de sua jornada; o indicado ao Oscar Willem Dafoe (“Platoon”, “Homem-Aranha 2”), como Vulko, conselheiro do trono de Atlântida; Patrick Wilson (dos filmes “Invocação do Mal”, “Watchmen - O Filme”) como Orm/Ocean Master, o atual Rei de Atlântida; Dolph Lundgren (dos filmes “Os Mercenários”) como Nereus, rei da tribo atlante Xebel; Yahya Abdul-Mateen II (da série da Netflix “The Get Down”) como o vingativo Black Manta; e a vencedora do Oscar Nicole Kidman (“As Horas”, “Lion - Uma Jornada Para Casa”) como a mãe de Arthur, Atlanna; além de Ludi Lin (“Power Rangers”) como o capitão Murk, do comando de Atlântida; e Temuera Morrison (“Star Wars: Episódio 2 - Ataque dos Clones”, “Lanterna Verde”) como o pai de Arthur, Tom Curry.
Wan dirige o filme a partir de um roteiro de David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick (“Invocação do Mal 2”) e Will Beall (“Caça aos Gângsteres”, da série de TV “Training Day”), com história de Geoff Johns & James Wan e Will Beall, baseado nos personagens da DC, com o Aquaman criado por Paul Norris e Mort Weisinger. O filme é produzido por Peter Safran e Rob Cowan, com produção executiva de Deborah Snyder, Zack Snyder, Jon Berg, Geoff Johns e Walter Hamada.
A equipe de Wan nos bastidores inclui colaboradores habituais como o diretor de fotografia indicado ao Oscar Don Burgess (“Invocação do Mal 2”, “Forrest Gump - O Contador de Histórias”), o editor Kirk Morri (dos filmes “Invocação do Mal”, “Velozes & Furiosos 7”, dos filmes “Sobrenatural”) e o desenhista de produção Bill Brzeski (“Velozes & Furiosos 7”). Juntam-se a eles a figurinista Kym Barrett (trilogia “Matrix”, “O Espetacular Homem-Aranha”) e o compositor Rupert Gregson-Williams (“Mulher-Maravilha”).

The person who created the petition did so to call people to action to take a stand against domestic violence.
The creator named Jeanne Larson, said, 
""As Amber Heard is a known and proven domestic abuser, Warner Brothers and DC Entertainment should and must remove Heard from their Aquaman 2 film project.”

Should Amber be punished like this?

After she and Johnny Depp filed for divorce in 2016, her life has been a whirlwind of protection and lavish praise from the media. That same media has demonized Johnny Depp time and time again, and are now absolutely silent when Depp is fighting back against defamation claims and allegations put forward by Heard. Here I take a look at the history of the two characters, explain the media backlash and cover-up, and give my opinion about what I think will happen to Amber Heard, AQUAMAN 2, and potentially Jail.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

From Warner Bros. Pictures and director James Wan comes an action-packed adventure that spans the vast, visually breathtaking underwater world of the seven seas, “Aquaman,” starring Jason Momoa in the title role.  The film reveals the origin story of half-human, half-Atlantean Arthur Curry and takes him on the journey of his lifetime—one that will not only force him to face who he really is, but to discover if he is worthy of who he was born to be…a king.

The film also stars Amber Heard (“Justice League,” “Magic Mike XXL”) as Mera, a fierce warrior and Aquaman’s ally throughout his journey; Oscar nominee Willem Dafoe (“Platoon,” “Spider-Man 2”) as Vulko, council to the Atlantean throne; Patrick Wilson (“The Conjuring” films, “Watchmen”) as Orm/Ocean Master, the present King of Atlantis; Dolph Lundgren (“The Expendables” films) as Nereus, King of the Atlantean tribe Xebel; Yahya Abdul-Mateen II (Netflix’s “The Get Down”) as the vengeful Black Manta; and Oscar winner Nicole Kidman (“The Hours,” “Lion”) as Arthur’s mom, Atlanna; as well as Ludi Lin (“Power Rangers”) as Captain Murk, Atlantean Commando; and Temuera Morrison (“Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones,” “Green Lantern”) as Arthur’s dad, Tom Curry.

Wan directs from a screenplay by David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick (“The Conjuring 2”) and Will Beall (“Gangster Squad,” TV’s “Training Day”), story by Geoff Johns & James Wan and Will Beall, based on characters from DC, Aquaman created by Paul Norris and Mort Weisinger.  The film is produced by Peter Safran and Rob Cowan, with Deborah Snyder, Zack Snyder, Jon Berg, Geoff Johns and Walter Hamada serving as executive producers.

Wan’s team behind the scenes includes such frequent collaborators as Oscar-nominated director of photography Don Burgess (“The Conjuring 2,” “Forrest Gump”), his five-time editor Kirk Morri (“The Conjuring” films, “Furious 7,” the “Insidious” films), and production designer Bill Brzeski (“Furious 7”).  They are joined by costume designer Kym Barrett (“The Matrix” trilogy, “The Amazing Spider-Man”) and composer Rupert Gregson-Williams (“Wonder Woman”).

Warner Bros. Pictures Presents a Safran Company Production, a James Wan Film, “Aquaman.”  The film is set to hit theaters on December 21, 2018, in 3D and 2D and IMAX, and will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros.

Yesterday was Amber Heard's birthday, and WB's official Aquaman twitter account congratulated her online, much to the dismay of many of her haters.

It's a sign of good faith, so does that mean she's staying in Aquaman 2 or not?

Hard to say, but we don't know that WB was ever going to get rid of her to begin with, despite the controversy surrounding her.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

However, Arthur learns that Atlantis is being ruled by his malicious half-brother Orm (Patrick Wilson), who seeks to unite the seven underwater kingdoms and wage war upon the surface. With aid from Nuidis Vulko (Willem Dafoe) and the gorgeous Mera (Amber Heard), Arthur must discover the full potential of his true destiny and become Aquaman in order to save Atlantis and the surface from Orm's evil plot.

'Justice League': first look at Amber Heard as Mera, Queen of Atlantis

Variety first reported in January that Heard the cast as the love interest of Momoa joined Aquaman. The film also stars J. K. Simmons as Commissioner Gordon, while Amy Adams, Jeremy Irons, and Jesse Eisenberg reprise their roles as Lois Lane, Alfred Pennyworth, and Lex Luthor, respectively. Earlier this month, he announced Snyder behind the scenes footage, October 7, coinciding with the last day of filming in the UK

In a recent interview with the variety, Gadot addressed sexuality Wonder Woman comics after writer Greg Rucka said that ""obviously"" had relationships with other women.

Gadot said his sexuality in the upcoming film ""Wonder Woman"" is ""something we have not explored.""

""In this movie, she does not experience any bisexual relations,"" he said. ""But it's not about that. She is a woman who loves people for what they are. She can be bisexual. She loves people by their hearts.""

Warner Bros. will release ""Justice League"" on 17 November 2017 with a sequel yet-to-be-titled expected to be released on June 14, 2019. ""Wonder Woman"" opens June 2.

Justice League - First look at Amber Heard as Mera:

It's all or nothing at this point to Warner Bros. and DC Comics universe with its cinematic superheroes. It's not as if his films have not been a financial success so far, but have taken a forthright criticism of the box office thanks to rampant interference study and a clear direction. Justice League, on the other hand, is trying to change all that. great movie team up Zack Snyder will offer all kinds of heroes, the brutal billionaires who are confused by the tsunami crushers owls titaNc depths.
And some secondary characters added to the mix as well. IGN revealed the first look at Aquaman's greatest ally, as Amber Heard donned the uniform of a royal armor for SmackDown.

And this is a concept art design by Ian Joyner io9 through.

Damn, that looks absolutely fantastic. Say what you like about Snyder, but production usually involves some absolutely fantastic costume design. In the DC Comics material source, Mera becomes Aquaman's wife and queen of Atlantis. She is also a formidable, able to match blows with Foes heavyweight thanks to its unique biology that allows him to survive the crushing pressure of the deep ocean fighter.

But it's his skill with Hydrokinesis really makes him dangerous. Mera can increase the density of water around, essentially, tightening and remodeling in various forms of effective combat which can crush enemies. It is basically a master water below. Anyway, that's a first look fantastic on Queen Atlante, although do not expect her to have too much of a role to play in the league of justice.

Mera Amber Heard will, however, be much more prominent in the film by James Wan Aquaman, which begins filming next year. As for the Justice League, which is currently still on track for a launch in November 2017. And hopefully not blow your load before then reveal with too much hype this time. There is nothing wrong with keeping a few of revealing the secret, ya dig?

Jeremy Irons (The Lion King), Alicia Vikander (Ex Machina), and Jim Broadbent (Moulin Rouge) bring to life this funny family adventure that’s a visual tour de force. Trapped in a village ruled by the meddling Kondor (Irons), Huppu the bird (Vikander) dreams of having the freedom to hatch her own egg. Suddenly, she, Kondor, and their friends are blasted to a distant land, and they must trust in a wise, eccentric bat to guide them on a strange, dazzling odyssey back to the tree they call home.",PT1M54S,2d,hd,false,True,rectangular,processed,public,youtube,True,True,False,5211,142,84,0,67,,en,

Did Amber Heard just get booted for Aquaman 2? This would be great news to Johnny Depp and Aquaman fans around the world. The #FireAmberHeard movement is going strong. It seems the Aquaman 2 director, James Wan, does not even want Amber Heard in the movie. 

It seems like everyone is turning against Amber Heard. Including the actors in the movie such as Jason Momoa, Nicole Kidman, William Dafoe, etc. The Johnny Depp Amber Heard legal battle is still at the forefront of celebrity news. 

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

Now she is chilling and taking photos on set of the new Aquaman 2 movie. Set to hit theaters in 2022. This is enraging a lot of Johnny Depp supporters.

From Warner Bros. Pictures and director James Wan comes an action-packed adventure that spans the vast, visually breathtaking underwater world of the seven seas, “Aquaman,” starring Jason Momoa in the title role. The film reveals the origin story of half-human, half-Atlantean Arthur Curry and takes him on the journey of his lifetime—one that will not only force him to face who he really is, but to discover if he is worthy of who he was born to be…a king.

The film also stars Amber Heard (“Justice League,” “Magic Mike XXL”) as Mera, a fierce warrior and Aquaman’s ally throughout his journey; Oscar nominee Willem Dafoe (“Platoon,” “Spider-Man 2”) as Vulko, council to the Atlantean throne; Patrick Wilson (“The Conjuring” films, “Watchmen”) as Orm/Ocean Master, the present King of Atlantis; Dolph Lundgren (“The Expendables” films) as Nereus, King of the Atlantean tribe Xebel; Yahya Abdul-Mateen II (Netflix’s “The Get Down”) as the vengeful Black Manta; and Oscar winner Nicole Kidman (“The Hours,” “Lion”) as Arthur’s mom, Atlanna; as well as Ludi Lin (“Power Rangers”) as Captain Murk, Atlantean Commando; and Temuera Morrison (“Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones,” “Green Lantern”) as Arthur’s dad, Tom Curry.

Wan directs from a screenplay by David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick (“The Conjuring 2”) and Will Beall (“Gangster Squad,” TV’s “Training Day”), story by Geoff Johns & James Wan and Will Beall, based on characters from DC, Aquaman created by Paul Norris and Mort Weisinger. The film is produced by Peter Safran and Rob Cowan, with Deborah Snyder, Zack Snyder, Jon Berg, Geoff Johns and Walter Hamada serving as executive producers.

Wan’s team behind the scenes includes such frequent collaborators as Oscar-nominated director of photography Don Burgess (“The Conjuring 2,” “Forrest Gump”), his five-time editor Kirk Morri (“The Conjuring” films, “Furious 7,” the “Insidious” films), and production designer Bill Brzeski (“Furious 7”). They are joined by costume designer Kym Barrett (“The Matrix” trilogy, “The Amazing Spider-Man”) and composer Rupert Gregson-Williams (“Wonder Woman”).

Warner Bros. Pictures Presents a Safran Company Production, a James Wan Film, “Aquaman.” The film is set to hit theaters on December 21, 2018, in 3D and 2D and IMAX, and will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros.

From Warner Bros. Pictures and director James Wan comes an action-packed adventure that spans the vast, visually breathtaking underwater world of the seven seas, “Aquaman,” starring Jason Momoa in the title role.  The film reveals the origin story of half-human, half-Atlantean Arthur Curry and takes him on the journey of his lifetime—one that will not only force him to face who he really is, but to discover if he is worthy of who he was born to be…a king.

The film also stars Amber Heard (“Justice League,” “Magic Mike XXL”) as Mera, a fierce warrior and Aquaman’s ally throughout his journey; Oscar nominee Willem Dafoe (“Platoon,” “Spider-Man 2”) as Vulko, council to the Atlantean throne; Patrick Wilson (“The Conjuring” films, “Watchmen”) as Orm/Ocean Master, the present King of Atlantis; Dolph Lundgren (“The Expendables” films) as Nereus, King of the Atlantean tribe Xebel; Yahya Abdul-Mateen II (upcoming “Baywatch,” Netflix’s “The Get Down”) as the vengeful Black Manta; and Oscar winner Nicole Kidman (“The Hours,” “Lion”) as Arthur’s mom, Atlanna; as well as Ludi Lin (“Power Rangers”) as Captain Murk, Atlantean Commando; and Temuera Morrison (“Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones,” “Green Lantern”) as Arthur’s dad, Tom Curry.

Wan directs from a screenplay by David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick (“The Conjuring 2”) and Will Beall (“Gangster Squad,” TV’s “Training Day”), story by Geoff Johns & James Wan and Will Beall, based on characters from DC, Aquaman created by Paul Norris and Mort Weisinger.  The film is produced by Peter Safran and Rob Cowan, with Deborah Snyder, Zack Snyder, Jon Berg, Geoff Johns and Walter Hamada serving as executive producers.

Wan’s team behind the scenes includes such frequent collaborators as Oscar-nominated director of photography Don Burgess (“The Conjuring 2,” “Forrest Gump”), his five-time editor Kirk Morri (“The Conjuring” films, “Furious 7,” the “Insidious” films), and production designer Bill Brzeski (“Furious 7”).  They are joined by costume designer Kym Barrett (“The Matrix” trilogy, “The Amazing Spider-Man”) and composer Rupert Gregson-Williams (“Wonder Woman”).

Esta disputa legal ha influido en sus carreras artísticas, tanto que, el actor Johnny Depp fue despedido por Warner Bros de la Saga Animales Fantásticos, tras perder su juicio contra el diario británico The Sun, en el que este medio lo tildó de “golpeador de esposas”, quedando su carrera a expensas del litigio con su ex pareja. 

La reacción de los fans de Johnny Depp, no se hizo esperar y reunieron, a través de la web Change.org, un millón de firmas solicitando a Warner que prohibiera que Amber trabajara en Aquaman 2 hasta que se resuelva la situación legal. Sin embargo, la propia actriz afirmó para Entertainment Weekly, que será La Guerrera Nera en la próxima película a estrenarse el próximo 21 de diciembre.

Para defenderse de sus críticos, Amber señaló sentirse muy emocionada por la cantidad de amor y aprecio de los fanáticos de Aquaman y subrayó que “los rumores pagados y las campañas pagas en las redes sociales no dictan las decisiones de casting porque no tienen base en la realidad. Sólo los fanáticos hicieron realidad Aquamán y Aquamán 2 y estoy emocionada de comenzar el próximo año"", confirmando de esta manera que sí trabajará en la segunda parte de Aquamán.

Este conflicto entre artistas es, uno de los dramas más intensos y polémicos que hemos tenido en los últimos tiempos y cada vez crece como una bola de nieve.

Al cinema dal 1 gennaio.

Da Warner Bros. Pictures e il regista James Wan arriva un’avventura visivamente mozzafiato nel mondo sottomarino dei sette mari, AQUAMAN, interpretato da Jason Momoa nel ruolo del protagonista. Il film rivela la storia delle origini del mezzo – umano, mezzo atlantideo Arthur Curry e lo accompagna nel viaggio della sua vita, che non solo lo costringerà ad affrontare chi è veramente, ma anche a scoprire se è degno di essere ciò per cui è nato… un re.

Il film vede la partecipazione di Amber Heard (Justice League, Magic Mike XXL) nei panni di Mera, una guerriera del fuoco e alleata di AQUAMAN per tutto il suo viaggio; Willem Dafoe (Plotone, Spider-Man 2) è Vulko, consigliere al trono di Atlantide; Patrick Wilson (The Conjuring, Watchmen) è Orm/Ocean Master, l’attuale Re di Atlantide; Dolph Lundgren (I Mercenari) come Nereus, re della tribù di Atlantide Xebel; Yahya Abdul-Mateen II (The Get Down su Netflix) nei panni del vendicativo Black Manta; e la vincitrice dell’Oscar Nicole Kidman (The Hours, Lion) come la mamma di Arthrur, Atlanna; così come Ludi Lin (Power Rangers) come Captain Murk, comandante di Atlantide; e Temuera Morrison (“Star Wars: Episodio II – L’Attacco Dei Cloni” “Lanterna Verde”) sarà il padre di Arthur, Tom Curry.

James Wan dirige da una sceneggiatura di David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick (The Conjuring 2) e Will Beall (Gangstar Squad, serie tv Training Day), da una storia di Geoff Johns, James Wan e Will Beal, basata sul personaggio DC Aquaman, creato da Paul Norris e Mort Weisnger.
Il film è prodotto da Peter Safran e Rob Cowan, con Deborah Snyder, Zack Snyder, Jon Berg, Geoff Johns e Walter Hamada come produttori esecutivi.

Il team di Wan include il direttore della fotografia candidato all’Oscar Don Burgess (The Conjuring 2, Forrest Gump), lo scenografo Bill Brzeski (Furious 7), la costumista Kym Barrett (trilogia di Matrix, The Amazing Spider-Man) e il compositore Rupert Gregson-Williams (Wonder Woman).

Did Amber Heard just get booted for Aquaman 2? This would be great news to Johnny Depp and Aquaman fans around the world. The #FireAmberHeard movement is going strong. It seems the Aquaman 2 director, James Wan, does not even want Amber Heard in the movie. 

It seems like everyone is turning against Amber Heard. The Johnny Depp Amber Heard legal battle is still at the forefront of celebrity news. 

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

And in Johnny Depp and Amber Heard’s case, the consequences of their tumultuous marriage still feels its blown up to this day, after it started in 2016. That’s a pretty long time. Yes, after almost five years of going back and forth in court, they are still in it. And during these five long years, the two have been supported by their own fans, friends, co-workers, and families. However, in terms of supporters, it is pretty obvious that Johnny Depp has a lot more advantages than his former wife. And in terms of celebrities with huge names in the industry, Johnny Depp seems to be also winning their hearts. Due to these ongoing court rulings and scandals involving these big names in the industry, the case is greatly affecting Johnny’s career, and one example was when he was asked to resign from his role as Grindelwald in the third installment of J.K Rowling’s Fantastic Beasts film trilogy that was supposed to be released in 2022.  Due to this, many other actors perceived this as “unfair” treatment of Depp, many stars stepped out to defend him. Many fans, friends, and co-stars defended him and what was shocking was even his previous lovers and wives stepped up to speak for him, even two of his former flames Vanessa Paradis whom he had two children with, and Winona Ryder, his love team and long time girlfriend in the 90s. Yet, as the issue continues to grow bigger and bigger, it involves more and more people as well, and more and more celebrities continue to arise and speak out on social media about the issue. So who are these brave celebs who are not buying Amber’s lies? Watch this video to find out. But before anything else, please make sure to hit that subscribe button first and ring that notification bell for more updates on the infamous Johnny Depp and Amber Heard upcoming trial. Now, let’s dig in!

As the trial is coming near, the issue that has somehow been buried deep in the internet has recently surfaced once again, and guess who’s been the subject of ridicule these past few weeks, or months, rather? You guessed that right, Amber Heard. Amber seemed to have been losing more and more of her supporters. Then there was evidence of her having affairs with an actor and a multi-billionaire, James Franco and Elon Musk. But what upset most people was the fact that Johnny Depp was forced to step down from his role as Grindelwald in the upcoming third franchise of the film trilogy “Fantastic Beasts”. But now that Johnny has been removed from his role, people’s fury shot directly at Amber Heard, as she was going back to reprise her role in the second franchise of the DC Extended Universe film Aquaman, despite the lawsuits she is currently facing. Some even started a petition to request Warner Bros. to fire Amber Heard, the same way they did to Johnny. 

1. Penelope Cruz
Penelope is a Spanish actress known for her beauty and her portrayal of sultry characters. She achieved early success in Spanish cinema and quickly established herself as an international star, co-starring with Johnny Depp in Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides and Blow. As his co-actor, Penelope supports Depp from the start.

2. Sia
Singer and songwriter Sia has also voiced her “public support” for Johnny Depp as the actor prepares for his defamation trial against ex-wife Amber Heard. The singer, unprompted, shared her support for Depp in a Twitter post which read: “Just showing my public support for Johnny Depp.”

3. Kevin McNally
Kevin Robert McNally is an English actor, who has worked in theatre and radio extensively, as well as in film and television. For Disney, he plays Joshamee Gibbs in the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, being one of the three actors to appear in all five films.

4. Sharon Osborne
Sharon Osborne was one of Johnny’s first supporters even from the start of the Johnny and Amber Heard issue. She was also one of the many celebrities who stood up against British news publisher.

5. Paul Bettany
Let's move on to Jonny's co-star from the 2010 movie The Tourist, Paul Bettany.

Johnny continues to earn more and more supporters. Apart from this, fans and other celebs who support the actor also continue to add up in number, especially as the release of Aquaman 2 draws near, bearing the face of Amber Heard in a lead role as Queen Mera, alongside famous faces like Jason Momoa and Nicole Kidman.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

Now she is chilling and taking photos on set of the new Aquaman 2 movie. Set to hit theaters in 2022. This is enraging a lot of Johnny Depp supporters.

Milton es un delincuente endurecido con una última oportunidad de redención.  Empeñado en frenar una sanguinaria secta que asesinó a su hija, tiene tres días para impedir que sacrifiquen a su pequeña nieta en noche de luna llena.  Deberá hacer uso de su furia para ir más allá de los límites humanos y salvar su último vínculo con la humanidad.  
A Milton se le une Piper, una joven camarera sensual y astuta. Ambos ahora se encuentran sobre la pista del carismático Jonah King y sus despiadados seguidores.  King tirará a cada uno de sus fieles bajo las ruedas del turbo negro modelo '71 para cumplir su misión y desatar el Infierno en la Tierra.
La sanguinaria secta es el menor de sus problemas. La policía está tras sus pasos, y también  un enigmático asesino conocido como ""El Contador.""  El Contador sabe lo que Milton está tratando de hacer y no le importa.  Con maliciosa e hipnotizante ferocidad, El Contador perseguirá a Milton despiadadamente a gran velocidad por las rutas no asfaltadas del sur de los Estados Unidos.
Milton y Piper deberán combatir el violento ataque de los discípulos de King, vengar el asesinato de su hija y salvar a su nieta antes de que se cumpla su última oportunidad de redención.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bpS58VS9YnY/default.jpg,120,90,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bpS58VS9YnY/mqdefault.jpg,320,180,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bpS58VS9YnY/hqdefault.jpg,480,360,,,,,,,Warner Bros.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

Aquaman is a 2018 American superhero film based on the DC Comics character of the same name. Distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, it is the sixth film in the DC Extended Universe (DCEU). The film was directed by James Wan, from a screenplay by David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick and Will Beall. It stars Jason Momoa as Arthur Curry / Aquaman, who sets out to lead the underwater kingdom of Atlantis and stop his half-brother, King Orm, from uniting the seven underwater kingdoms to destroy the surface world. Amber Heard, Willem Dafoe, Patrick Wilson, Dolph Lundgren, Ludi Lin, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Temuera Morrison and Nicole Kidman appear in supporting roles.
Development began in 2004 but did not gain traction until Man of Steel was released in 2013. In August 2014, Beall and Kurt Johnstad were hired to write competing scripts. Wan signed on as director in April 2015, and in July 2016, the film moved forward with Beall's screenplay. The main cast was confirmed through 2016 and early 2017. Principal photography began in Australia in May 2017, taking place at Village Roadshow Studios on the Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia, with additional production teams in Canada, Italy and Morocco. Filming concluded the following October. Several vendors provided visual effects, ranging from high-detail hair simulations to the creation of CGI animals and locations.

Amber Heard and Johnny Depp's divorce was major news a few months back. Following the lawsuit, Johnny Depp had to face a lot of trouble on the professional front and his fans were not at all happy about it. Depp had lost a libel case against The Sun over a headline that ascribed him as a ""wife-beater."" which further resulted in Warner Bros. asking him to resign from Fantastic Beasts 3. This was not taken well by his fans who then started a petition calling for the removal of Amber Heard from Warner Bros' Aquaman 2. Now, rumour has it that this might become true. Following the Johnny Depp Row, Petition to Remove Amber Heard From Aquaman 2 Crosses 1 Million Signatures!

While the petition or the libel might not be the reason for Amber's exit from the film, it has been learned that she indeed has been fired from the film. Reports suggest that Amber gained a little weight before the commencement of the shoot and the makers are not keen on continuing to work with her. Not just that, it is being said that Emilia Clarke who I known popularly for her role as Daenerys Targaryen from Game Of Thrones is all set to replace her. Amber essayed the character of Mera in the Jason Mamoa starrer.

A source told Australian site Sausage Roll, ""Amber Heard did not pass her physical examination. She’s put on some pounds and is in terrible shape. There is a clause in her contract which says she is required to be in good form ahead of shooting and she violated that."" It was also revealed that Amber's role was a very demanding one in terms of action and stunts and the production house terminated the contract after seeing how the actress was not in shape to take up the role. Popcorned Planet confirmed the same but no clarity on Emilia Clarke being a replacement for the actress has been given yet.

Talking about the petition, addressed to Courtney Simmons, SVP of Publicity & Communications for DC Warner Bros. and Paul McGuire, Corporate Communications of DC Entertainment - discusses how Amber is a domestic abuser and Warner Brothers should not glamorize her anymore. The petition has already crossed the 1 million signatures mark!

Amber Heard and Johnny Depp's divorce was major news a few months back. Following the lawsuit, Johnny Depp had to face a lot of trouble on the professional front and his fans were not at all happy about it. Depp had lost a libel case against The Sun over a headline that ascribed him as a ""wife-beater."" which further resulted in Warner Bros. asking him to resign from Fantastic Beasts 3. This was not taken well by his fans who then started a petition calling for the removal of Amber Heard from Warner Bros' Aquaman 2. Now, rumour has it that this might become true. Following the Johnny Depp Row, Petition to Remove Amber Heard From Aquaman 2 Crosses 1 Million Signatures!

While the petition or the libel might not be the reason for Amber's exit from the film, it has been learned that she indeed has been fired from the film. Reports suggest that Amber gained a little weight before the commencement of the shoot and the makers are not keen on continuing to work with her. Not just that, it is being said that Emilia Clarke who I known popularly for her role as Daenerys Targaryen from Game Of Thrones is all set to replace her. Amber essayed the character of Mera in the Jason Mamoa starrer.

A source told Australian site Sausage Roll, ""Amber Heard did not pass her physical examination. She’s put on some pounds and is in terrible shape. There is a clause in her contract which says she is required to be in good form ahead of shooting and she violated that."" It was also revealed that Amber's role was a very demanding one in terms of action and stunts and the production house terminated the contract after seeing how the actress was not in shape to take up the role. Popcorned Planet confirmed the same but no clarity on Emilia Clarke being a replacement for the actress has been given yet.

Talking about the petition, addressed to Courtney Simmons, SVP of Publicity & Communications for DC Warner Bros. and Paul McGuire, Corporate Communications of DC Entertainment - discusses how Amber is a domestic abuser and Warner Brothers should not glamorize her anymore. The petition has already crossed the 1 million signatures mark!

Following a report that he had allegedly abused Heard on multiple occasions, Depp filed a lawsuit against U.K. News Group Newspaper publication, The Sun, purporting that he was never the instigator of any domestic violence. He lost the lawsuit in November 2020, but an appeal is expected.
It is worth noting that two of Depp’s former parters, Winona Ryder and Vanessa Paradis, both supported the actor throughout the libel case.

Depp’s lawyer and the actor himself continue to claim there was never any spousal abuse, while Heard and her camp allege that she was held “hostage” in Australia during the filming of a Pirates of the Caribbean movie, among other things.

Depp — whose finger was cut off during an argument at one point in the tumultuous relationship — has been blacklisted by many of the movie studios who previously worked with him.

Walt Disney Studios has reportedly replaced him with Margot Robbie in the upcoming Pirates of the Caribbean 6 project. Meanwhile, Warner Bros.’ Harry Potter Fantastic Beasts franchise recast Gellert Grindelwald with Mads Mikkelsen (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story) after the libel trial ended.

Many of Johnny Depp’s fans believe that Heard should face the same industry backlash. A petition for her to be fired from Warner Bros.’ film adaptations of DC Comics’ Aquaman franchise has garnered wide support, with nearly two million signatures.

Now, as Yahoo! News shared, Heard has reportedly been let go from her role as Mera — but not for the reasons you probably think:
At this time, Warner Bros. has not confirmed Heard’s exit from the Aquaman 2 movie. Per IMDb, Heard also played Mera in Zack Snyder’s Justice League, which recently finished filming.

For Depp’s part, the actor’s best hope for a career revival is likely to be longtime friend and professional partner, Tim Burton. The director has cast Depp in numerous projects over the years. Burton is currently working on Beetlejuice 2 and an Addams Family TV adaptation — Depp’s name has been connected to both projects.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EpqVMFp-Zh4/default.jpg,120,90,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EpqVMFp-Zh4/mqdefault.jpg,320,180,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EpqVMFp-Zh4/hqdefault.jpg,480,360,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EpqVMFp-Zh4/sddefault.jpg,640.0,480.0,,,,999 Tv,"['amber heard', 'amber heard johnny depp', 'johnny depp amber heard', 'amber heard johnny depp', 'johnny depp', 'amber heard', 'breaking news']",25,none,Amber Heard Reportedly Fired From ‘Aquaman’ For Reasons Unrelated to Depp,"For the past year or so, Pirates of the Caribbean Captain Jack Sparrow actor, Johnny Depp, and his ex-wife, Amber Heard, have gotten more than their fair share of negative press.

While some celebrities prefer living a quiet life away from the public, others just have so many scandals following them. In this video, we are going to talk about Johnny Depp and Amber Heard, who have been on each other’s throats ever since they split up and how Amber Heard might be facing jail time for one mistake she made in all this.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

per boundingintocomics - Warner Bros. is not firing Amber Heard despite her bad publicity from the ongoing defamation suit against her. But they may have figured their way around things. Grace Randolph tweeted steps might be taken to reduce Heard’s part in Aquaman 2 if need be. The same holds true for Johnny Depp.

Right now is an incredibly validating time for victims of abuse. From TIME’s Person of The Year being the “Silence Breakers” to men like Matt Lauer, Charlie Rose, and Harvey Weinstein losing their jobs over sexual assault allegations, victims’ stories are finally being taken as seriously as they should be. That is, if the stories came out after this movement began. Amber Heard, 31, is still waiting to have her accusations against Johnny Depp, 54, be acknowledged by the film industry, and she just spoke out about how she feels that her alleged abuser currently has a major role in the works.

Johnny is set to play the title character in Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes Of Grindelwald, and J.K. Rowling, Warner Bros., and director David Yates defended their choice not to recast him in light of Amber’s accusations of emotional and physical abuse from 2016. After Warner Bros. went on record defending their choice, Amber posted her own reaction on Twitter. “For the record, this was our FULL joint statement.To pick&choose certain lines & quote them out of context, is not right.Women, stay strong,” the actress captioned an image of her and Johnny’s divorce statement. See her tweet below.

The response was a clear dig at Warner Bros. for using a part of her statement as a defense for continuing to work with a man who’s been accused of abuse. By saying “Women, stay strong,” Amber sent a powerful message about how even though victims’ stories are finally being heard, there are still plenty that aren’t.

The Warner Bros.’ statement that Amber responded to said that they were “aware of reports that surfaced” and “take seriously the complexity of the issues involved” before bringing up Johnny and Amber’s joint statement about the dissolution of their marriage. “This matter has been jointly addressed by both parties, in a statement in which they said ‘There was never any intent of physical or emotional harm.’ Based on the circumstances and the information available to us, we, along with the filmmakers, continue to support the decision to proceed with Johnny Depp in the role of Grindelwald in this and future films,” the statement said.

Amber Heard confirmed return as Mera in ‘Aquaman 2

Amber Heard is embroiled in a legal battle with ex Johnny Depp who sued her for libel. The pair finalized their divorce in 2017. Depp also sued The Sun for calling him “wife beater,” following Heard’s allegations that he was abusive and violent.

Despite the legal drama between the exes, Heard will return as Mera in the next Aquaman movie.

Amber Heard filed a petition asking the judge not to give in to Johnny Depp’s request to reschedule the trial because it clashed with his upcoming film Fantastic Beasts 3. Heard pointed out that the delay of the trial would affect her because she was also set to film Aquaman 2 in February, The Sun reported.

“The papers confirm for the first time that Ms Heard is still making Aquaman 2,” The Sun noted.

A petition seeking to have Amber Heard removed from Warner Bros.' Aquaman 2 recently surpassed 1.5 million signatures.

The Change.org petition was created several years ago, in the wake of Heard's messy divorce from Johnny Depp and reports that both actors were physically violent during their tumultuous relationship. The petition is addressed to Courtney Simmons, SVP of Publicity & Communications for DC Warner Bros. and Paul McGuire, Corporate Communications of DC Entertainment.

It read in part, ""In his $50 million lawsuit, Johnny Depp describes many incidents of domestic abuse that he suffered at the hands of his (then) wife Amber Heard, including one incident where she punched him twice in the face and another where she shattered his finger with a vodka bottle, and his finger had to be surgically reattached. He will bear the scar from that for the rest of his life.""

The author of the petition further explained that Heard ""was arrested in 2009 for abusing a former domestic partner, Tasya Van Ree"" and alleged that the actor has ""systematically crusaded to ruin Depp in Hollywood, repeating multiple accounts of fake incidents in which she had actually abused Johnny Depp, but lied and created false accounts of him being the abuser.""

It was reported back in 2019 that Depp had called on Warner Bros. to remove Heard from the first Aquaman film, in which she portrayed superheroine and warrior Mera. However, this didn't come to pass, and Heard recently confirmed she will reprise the role in the upcoming sequel. The petition started trending again -- and currently sits at 1.6 million signatures -- after Depp lost a libel case in early November against The Sun.

A petition seeking to have Amber Heard removed from Warner Bros.' Aquaman 2 recently surpassed 1.5 million signatures.

The Change.org petition was created several years ago, in the wake of Heard's messy divorce from Johnny Depp and reports that both actors were physically violent during their tumultuous relationship. The petition is addressed to Courtney Simmons, SVP of Publicity & Communications for DC Warner Bros. and Paul McGuire, Corporate Communications of DC Entertainment.

It read in part, ""In his $50 million lawsuit, Johnny Depp describes many incidents of domestic abuse that he suffered at the hands of his (then) wife Amber Heard, including one incident where she punched him twice in the face and another where she shattered his finger with a vodka bottle, and his finger had to be surgically reattached. He will bear the scar from that for the rest of his life.""

The author of the petition further explained that Heard ""was arrested in 2009 for abusing a former domestic partner, Tasya Van Ree"" and alleged that the actor has ""systematically crusaded to ruin Depp in Hollywood, repeating multiple accounts of fake incidents in which she had actually abused Johnny Depp, but lied and created false accounts of him being the abuser.""

It was reported back in 2019 that Depp had called on Warner Bros. to remove Heard from the first Aquaman film, in which she portrayed superheroine and warrior Mera. However, this didn't come to pass, and Heard recently confirmed she will reprise the role in the upcoming sequel. The petition started trending again -- and currently sits at 1.6 million signatures -- after Depp lost a libel case in early November against The Sun.

Following the ruling on the libel case, which was over a headline that referred to Depp as a ""wife beater,"" Warner Bros. asked the actor to resign from Fantastic Beasts 3. While Depp obliged, the nature of his contract means Warner Bros. still needs to pay the actor's $10 million salary, as he'd already filmed a scene.

‘Aquaman 2’ Producer Explains Why Fan Campaign to Fire Amber Heard Was Rejected
https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/aquaman-2-amber-heard-peter-safran-fan-pressure-1234990820/

Aquaman producer Peter Safran explained why online efforts to get Amber Heard removed from the superhero sequel were dismissed by the film’s creative team.
Heard plays aquatic warrior Mera in the franchise and has been the target of an intense lobbying campaign on social media largely driven by Johnny Depp supporters in the wake of the actors’ tumultuous divorce.

After the trial verdict, Warner Bros. released Depp from the upcoming Fantastic Beasts sequel, with actor Mads Mikkelsen taking over the role of Gellert Grindelwald. The Fantastic Beasts recasting seemed to help fuel Depp supporters who insisted that Heard likewise get ousted from the upcoming Aquaman sequel.

David Ayer Blasts ‘Suicide Squad’: “The Studio Cut Is Not My Movie”
https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/suicide-squad-david-ayer-warner-bros-1234990360/

Suicide Squad director David Ayer is taking his criticism of the released version of his comic book film to a new level.
With James Gunn’s upcoming reboot The Suicide Squad drawing early praise — and comparisons to Ayer’s disappointing 2016 effort — Ayer accused Warner Bros. of dramatically recutting his film from his original vision.

“I put my life into Suicide Squad,” David Ayer wrote in a lengthy tweet titled “My Turn.” “I made something amazing. My cut is intricate and emotional journey with some bad people who are shit on and discarded (a theme that resonates in my soul). The studio cut is not my movie. Read that again. And my cut is not the 10 week director’s cut — it’s a fully mature edit by Lee Smith standing on the incredible work by John Gilroy. It’s all Steven Price’s brilliant score, with not a single radio song in the whole thing. It has traditional character arcs, amazing performances, a solid third-act resolution. A handful of people have seen it.”

Did Amber Heard just get booted for Aquaman 2? This would be great news to Johnny Depp and Aquaman fans around the world. The #FireAmberHeard movement is going strong. It seems the Aquaman 2 director, James Wan, does not even want Amber Heard in the movie. 

It seems like everyone is turning against Amber Heard. Including the actors in the movie such as Jason Momoa, Nicole Kidman, William Dafoe, etc. The Johnny Depp Amber Heard legal battle is still at the forefront of celebrity news. 

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

Now she is chilling and taking photos on set of the new Aquaman 2 movie. Set to hit theaters in 2022. This is enraging a lot of Johnny Depp supporters.

Well in fact, for a moment, they should have been happy, because this second installment is one of the most awaited films of 2022. When the first movie aired in theaters in 2018, fans were mesmerized by its cinematic wonder, and were already craving for more. However, due to a conflict that the film has gotten itself into, it is now pretty much a movie that almost everybody wants to cancel. How did this happen, you ask? Well for all of you who are newbies in the Johnny Depp and Amber Heard whirlwind of a case, let me just tell you that Amber Heard was able to reprise her role in the upcoming DCEU film franchise despite being involved in an ongoing case with Johnny Depp and their messy aftermath of a marriage. Apart from this, Johnny Depp had also been fired by Warner Brothers, the same production Aquaman is under, and has also been taken out from one of his most famous and commercially successful movies of all time: the Pirates of the Caribbean series.  So now that it has been decided that Warner Brothers will indeed keep Amber Heard despite all the allegations she is currently facing and despite all the unpleasant comments she is currently receiving. Fans are now wondering how her costars will take this news, especially the face and front of the whole movie, Jason Momoa. Some say that Jason actually secretly dislikes working with Amber Heard in their upcoming movie. But is this true? Let’s find out in this video. But before that, make sure first to hit that subscribe button and smash that notification bell for more updates. Let’s dive in!

The first day of filming of the new movie installment Aquaman and The Lost Kingdom was expected to be big news to its vieweers, but rather, it turned out to be a big waste. What made it an even larger disappointment for Warner Brothers is that the first Aquaman movie turned out to be a major blockbuster success in 2018, reaching 1.184 billion dollars, with a production budget of only 160 to 200 million dollars. That’s a lot of profit! However, Amber Heard’s involvement in the film has caused fans to turn their backs on the most awaited franchise.

But amidst all these, what are Amber’s co-stars thinking about the issue? Does it affect their interaction knowing all about Amber’s situation? And especially now that Amber has announced her newborn baby, who was born out of surrogacy, what do her colleagues at her Aquaman movie filming think of it? Well, let’s hear some of Jason Momoa’s thoughts about it. Jason Momoa, of all people, is the one who will get a really bad experience out of this once this movie flops because of Amber Heard. 

Unfortunately, much to fans’ dismay, Jason Momoa is reportedly “okay” with working with Amber Heard. But, who knows, right? It might be easy to say “yeah, it’s cool. Working with Amber is just cool,” despite having a seething dislike building up within you because this precious celebrity Warner Bros seems to be protecting is a person who will bring your movie down. But it seems like Jason Momoa feels more than that. More than just being “cool”. In fact, he even stated that Amber’s personal problems should not be mixed with her work, which is a pretty weird thing to say to a celebrity because we all know pretty well that a wreck in one celebrity’s personal life is a wreck in her image too. So if Amber Heard’s personal life is the definition of “messy”, then it might reflect on their relationship on screen and on the movie they are both in as well. 

Aside from Jason himself, the Aquaman director seems to be backing Amber up as well. Despite Warner Brother’s rogue decision to keep Amber Heard, which might actually cause their new movie to flop, at least they are somehow trying to reduce Amber Heard’s exposure, perhaps to minimise the bad impact they may have to endure for the movie. But it is reported that Aquaman director James Wan is apparently doing all he can to protect Amber’s role in Aquaman 2 against the studio attempting to massively reduce Mera’s screen time. The actress herself is not pleased about this, obviously, and is said to be striving to land a bigger role. James Wan, along with Jason Momoa are in the frontrun, obviously, in defending Amber Heard from getting let go, which says a lot because they have big influence.

Emilia Clarke finally reveals why Amber Heard has not been fired from Aquaman 2. Emilia Clarke wanted to be Mera but Amber Heard got the role. Emilia Clarke reveals all in this video.

We will start to see how Amber Heard is going lose this court case. This clearly shows that Amber Heard is lying. You will hear what the judge had to say to Amber Heard. It is the newest piece of celebrity news.

While some celebrities prefer living a quiet life away from the public, others just have so many scandals following them. In this video, we are going to talk about Johnny Depp and Amber Heard, who have been on each other’s throats ever since they split up and how Amber Heard might be facing jail time for one mistake she made in all this.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

Warner Bros. has requested that Johnny Depp resign from the role of Grindelwald in the Fantastic Beasts franchise, which the actor has agreed upon.

Warner Bros. has requested that Johnny Depp resigns from his role as Grindelwald in the Fantastic Beasts film franchise. The actor has said that he respects and has agreed to the request.

Depp released a short statement on Instagram where he addressed these details. ""In light of recent events, I would like to make the following short statement,"" Depp wrote. ""Firstly, I'd like to thank everybody who has gifted me with their support and loyalty. I have been humbled and moved by your many messages of love and concern, particularly over the last few days. Secondly, I wish to let you know that I have been asked to resign by Warner Bros. from my role as Grindelwald in Fantastic Beasts and I have respected and agreed to that request. Finally, I wish to say this. The surreal judgment of the court in the U.K. will not change my fight to tell the truth and I confirm that I plan to appeal. My resolve remains strong and I intend to prove that the allegations against me are false. My life and career will not be defined by this moment in time. Thank you for reading.

Johnny Depp officially lost his libel trial against the Rupert Murdoch-owned British newspaper, The Sun, at the beginning of November. The Fantastic Beasts actor had filed the suit after the tabloid repeated claims by Depp's ex-wife, Aquaman star Amber Heard, that the Pirates of the Caribbean star was physically abusive towards her during their tumultuous, short-lived marriage.

Judge Andrew Nicol explained his decision: ""The claimant [Depp] has not succeeded in his action for libel. Although he has proved the necessary elements of his cause of action in libel, the defendants have shown that what they published in the meaning which I have held the words to bear was substantially true."" Nicol goes on further to note, ""I have reached these conclusions having examined in detail the 14 incidents on which the defendants rely as well as the overarching considerations which the claimant submitted I should take into account.""

In his ruling, Nicol actually collected all 14 allegations made by either Depp or The Sun (via Heard herself, whose claims the newspapers were relying on for their article) and determined whether he believed Heard, Depp or neither of them. Ultimately, after determining that Depp was mostly at fault in 12 of the 14 allegations, Nicol determined that The Sun had successfully argued that it was reasonable for the paper to refer to Depp as a ""wife-beater.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KL-ylsgMHsA/default.jpg,120,90,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KL-ylsgMHsA/mqdefault.jpg,320,180,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KL-ylsgMHsA/hqdefault.jpg,480,360,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KL-ylsgMHsA/sddefault.jpg,640.0,480.0,,,,Movies Life,"['#Johnny depp', '#Johnny depp case full details', '#amber heard', '#Johnny depp resign', '#Grinderworld', '#Fantastic beastes', '#Harry potter', 'Pirates of the carebian']",22,none,Johnny Depp 'Resigns' from Fantastic Beasts at Warner Bros.'

Gives Johnny Depp the Boot From Fantastic Beasts,"Johnny Depp is out from the Harry Potter spinoff Fantastic Beasts series, where he played Gellert Grindelwald. Depp revealed the news in an Instagram post on November 6, days after he lost a libel case against British tabloid The Sun. In a typewritten note posted to Instagram, he claimed Warner Bros. asked him to resign from the series, which is currently shooting its third movie and has plans for two more. He also claimed he would appeal his case, over the paper’s claims that he was a “wife beater” in coverage of his alleged abuse toward ex-wife Amber Heard. “The surreal judgment of the court in the U.K. will not change my fight to tell the truth and I confirm that I plan to appeal,” he wrote. “My resolve remains strong and I intend to prove that the allegations against me are false. My life and career will not be defined by this moment in time.” Heard’s American lawyers previously responded in a statement to Entertainment Tonight. “Very soon, we will be presenting even more voluminous evidence in the U.S.,” Elaine Charlson Bredehoft told ET. “We are committed to obtaining justice for Amber Heard in the U.S. Court and defending Ms. Heard’s Right to Free Speech.”   Depp’s role in the series has been controversial since preparations for the 2018 sequel The Crimes of Grindelwald. In November 2017, a year before the film premiered, director David Yates defended Depp’s inclusion and called the abuse allegations against him “a dead issue.”  Update, 4:30 p.m.: The third Fantastic Beasts movie has been pushed from November 12, 2021, to summer 2022, Warner Bros. told Variety in a statement. The company also confirmed Depp’s former role of Gellert Grindelwald will be recast. Where’s a time-turner when you need one?  Update, November 9: The Hollywood Reporter has more details on Depp’s ouster, with sources telling the magazine that Johnny Depp had just shot one scene after filming began on September 20. According to The Hollywood Reporter, Warner Bros. waited until the judgment came down to cut ties with Depp — who will still be paid his full salary for the project because of his pay-or-play contract.

Johnny Depp attempted to have ex-wife Amber Heard replaced on Aquaman. Depp and Heard were married from 2015-2017, and their relationship continues to have a major impact on the entertainment industry. The two made headlines for legal issues both during and after their marriage. Last month, Depp lost a lawsuit against The Sun, which called him a ""wifebeater"" in a 2018 article. Following this decision, Depp was asked to resign from the upcoming film Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them 3, where he was to reprise his role as Gellert Grindelwald. Despite only filming one scene, Depp received millions for his work on the movie.

Following Depp's exit from the Fantastic Beasts franchise, a subset of fans have similarly called for Heard to be fired from Aquaman 2. The actor starred as Mera in the first movie and will play the part again in the sequel. Last month, a petition titled ""Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman 2"" was started on Change.org. It quickly surpassed one million signatures and now sits at over 1.7 million. Shortly after, Heard debunked rumors Mera would be recast in the film, stating, ""I'm excited to get started next year."" Now, it seems those who signed the petition aren't the only ones who had an interest in having Heard replaced in the Aquaman franchise.

According to a new article from THR, at one point, Depp told his sister, Christi Dembrowski, a producer with pull at Warner Bros., that he wanted Heard ""replaced on the WB film."" In the process of the trial, Depp revealed the film in question was Aquaman.

The reveal about Depp comes after a similar report last year alleged the same. Though this more concrete information is shocking, it also lines up with what's already known about Depp and Heard's volatile relationship. Ultimately, it seems Depp's attempts to interfere with Heard's career amounted to nothing, as the actor remained a part of Aquaman. Still, the news is disconcerting to say the least, especially considering the power Depp once wielded in the industry. It's clear he was willing to use any sway he had against Heard, which is troubling.

It remains to be seen if this reveal about Depp will have any impact on Heard's future in the DC Extended Universe. If anything, it seems to reinforce Warner Bros' commitment to Heard. If Depp did follow through with contacting the studio through his sister, apparently his request was denied. Though there have been new developments in the last year or so, this could bode well for Heard's role in the next Aquaman movie.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kxCFkHY3Rbo/default.jpg,120,90,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kxCFkHY3Rbo/mqdefault.jpg,320,180,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kxCFkHY3Rbo/hqdefault.jpg,480,360,,,,,,,In News English,,25,none,Johnny Depp Tried To Get Amber Heard Replaced On Aquaman,"Subscribe I n  News English YouTube Channel To All The Big News Of The World.

No cabe duda que Amber Heard ha tenido un camino bastante golpeado en Hollywood en los últimos años, pues la hermosa actriz se involucró en batallas legales debido a su controvertido matrimonio con Johnny Depp.

Cabe mencionar que debido a ello, Johnny Depp fue despedido de Animales Fantásticos 3, sin embargo ella ha logrado mantener su papel en ""Aquaman 2"" como la princesa Mera.

Ahora nueva información señala que el estudio de Warner no quiere deshacerse de la actriz por miedo a que las relaciones públicas de la empresa se entorpezcan, ya que después de todo, ella fue declarada triunfadora en el juicio de Londres y por lo tanto es considerada de manera oficial como una víctima de vi0lencia doméstica.

Como recordaran, Amber Heard apareció por primera vez como Mera en ""Liga de la Justicia"", película en la que mantiene una conversación con Arthur Curry sobre la Caja Madre que residen en Atlantis; ella intenta detener el robo de Steppenwolf, pero no lo logra.


El personaje regresó en ""Aquaman"" como aliada e interés amoroso del protagonista, fascinando de esta forma al público con su belleza, poderes y actitud temeraria.

Sin duda durante un tiempo, Heard gozó el cariño del público como la nueva superheroína del DCEU, sobre todo a finales del año 2018; sin embargo, la buena voluntad de las redes no duró mucho, ya que este año a comenzar a ser repudiada por los internautas, quienes aparentemente no descansarán hasta verla fuera de ""Aquaman 2"".

Sin embargo, el paso de Heard por la segunda aventura en solitario de ""Aquaman"" es definitiva y de hecho ella misma lo confirmó durante una reciente entrevista con Entertainment Weekly, declarando que su alegría por comenzar con las grabaciones es muy grande.
Por otro lado, Mikey Sutton de Geekosity, popular en las redes sociales por estar enterado de los pormenores en el mundo del espectáculo, señaló que Warner no quiere despedir a Amber de ""Aquaman 2"" por miedo a represalias y dañar sus vínculos con socios.

Pues después de todo, la actriz de 34 años de edad tiene a la justicia de su lado y el estudio prefiere no ir contra corriente en esta situación tan delicada.

Han sido ya varias las veces que mientras avanza el mediático pleito legal entre Johnny Depp y Amber Heard, tanto los fans como las grandes empresas productoras del séptimo arte, han estado decidiendo que hacer y que no, con sus respectivos actores y películas venideras. 

Por ejemplo, sabemos que Warner Bros, prácticamente obligó a Depp a retirarse de las filmaciones de la tercera entrega de la saga de ""Animales Fantásticos"", gracias a que el juez encargado del caso, dictó a favor de la actriz, sin embargo, el papel de Mera en Aquaman 2 sigue estando intacto, aun que los fieles fans del actor han realizado gran cantidad de peticiones y han reunido millones de firmas para que esto sea posible. 


Sabemos también que, desde que inicio todo el proceso legal en contra del actor, a partir de las acusaciones Jhonny fue despedido de varios empleos, y curiosamente Amber obtuvo papeles protagónicos, como lo es el de la princesa Mera, en Aquaman, y a raíz de esto obtuvo un nuevo séquito de fans e innumerables oportunidades, incluyendo desde luego la posibilidad de una gran secuela en el Universo Cinematográfico de DC, la cual, es ahora mas que una realidad. 

Ahora, la nueva información obtenida, en torno a las resoluciones, señala que el estudio de Warner no quiere deshacerse de la actriz por miedo a que las relaciones públicas de la empresa se entorpezcan, ya que después de todo, ella fue declarada triunfadora en el juicio de Londres y por lo tanto es considerada de manera oficial como una víctima de vi0lencia doméstica.

""Que Warner Bros. elimine a una actriz que fue víct1ma de abus0 conyugal creará relaciones públicas aún peores, eso temen los ejecutivos, a pesar de lo que también se le acusa a ella"", a mencionado un productor al respecto. 


Sin embargo, los fans no se cansan de intentar que se haga algo al respecto, y una vez mas han reunido sus fuerzas para pedirle a los directivos y  productores de Warner Bros Company que se deshagan de Amber y Emilia Clarke tome su lugar para el papel de la princesa Mera en la secuela de Aquaman. 


Como sabemos, han elegido a Clarke debido a la enorme química escénica que tiene con Jason Momoa, el protagonista, tal y como ya lo han demostrado, trabajando juntos en ""Juego de tronos"", donde podemos ver que funcionan demasiado bien laborando de la mano, sin duda, la química es innegable.

Por tal motivo, el artista digital Bosslogic, un experto en el arte del fan cast, ha creado un diseño en el que se muestra a la Madre de Dragones con la corona y la icónica melena pelirroja dela fuerte y bella princesa Mera, y el resultado es de lo más sorprendente, ya que, gracias a sus facciones y sus ojos verdes, realmente si nos podemos imaginar a Clarke como la gobernante de los mares. 

Por el momento, Amber Heard sigue estando más que confirmada para la secuela de Aquaman, ya que lo ha confirmado recientemente en una entrevista para importantes medios británicos, aunque eso podría cambiar en las próximas semanas, ya que la petición para su despido ya recoge más de un millón firmas del público.


Y, en caso de ser sustituida, Clarke sería una gran opción, tal y como muestra la imagen de Bosslogic, en la que resalta su intensa y poderosa mirada.

He has since applied to have the decision overturned.   During the trial it was put forward to the court that Depp had demanded former wife Heard – who he was married to from 2015 to 2017 – be stripped of her role as Mera in Warner Bros’ Aquaman sequel, with the details re-emerging this week in a lengthy profile on the star.   As was reported by Press Association during the trial in July, Sasha Wass QC, for NGN, told the court ‘from the moment Ms Heard petitioned for divorce and for a restraining order, the full brute force of Mr Depp and his PR machine was engaged’.   She said: ‘Reports appeared in the press suggesting that she was a gold digger. Mr Depp personally set out to damage her career.’   Wass said that after Depp sent a text to his sister saying: ‘I want her replaced on that WB film’ – a reference to the Warner Brothers film Aquaman – ‘a petition garnered the support of 400,000 people [quoted at the time of trial] to have Ms Heard removed from the film’.   According to The Hollywood Reporter, which published the profile this week, the messages were sent to Depp’s sister, producer Christi Dembrowski, ‘who previously had a deal with the studio and was influential there’.    It comes amid a petition, titled ‘Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman 2′, which has reached 1.7million signatures.    However, the star, who appeared in the 2018 superhero film opposite Jason Momoa, confirmed last month she would be returning for the sequel which is set to film next year.   She recently said: ‘I’m super excited about the amount of fan love and the amount of fan appreciation that Aquaman has acquired and that it has garnered so much excitement for Aquaman and Mera that it means we’ll be coming back. I’m so excited to film that.’   The petition, started by Jeanne Larson, alleged that Amber is a ‘known and proven abuser’, and claims that she has ‘systematically crusaded to ruin Depp in Hollywood’.   Both Depp and Heard alleged abuse by the other during the libel trial, and also both denied allegations against them.   A judge eventually ruled in favour of The Sun, saying they were accurate in calling Depp a ‘wife beater’ in an article headline.   In the wake of his trial loss, Depp resigned from his role as Gellert Grindelwald in the Fantastic Beasts franchise, after being asked to by Warner Bros, and has since been replaced by Mads Mikkelsen however the profile claimed he was still paid $16million (£12m) for the one scene he’d shot before stepping down.    He continues to remain in advertisements for Dior’s Sauvage fragrance.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/manLDA_zqVY/default.jpg,120,90,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/manLDA_zqVY/mqdefault.jpg,320,180,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/manLDA_zqVY/hqdefault.jpg,480,360,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/manLDA_zqVY/sddefault.jpg,640.0,480.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/manLDA_zqVY/maxresdefault.jpg,1280.0,720.0,NewsMax News,[''],22,none,Johnny Depp ‘wanted Amber Heard axed from Aquaman’,"Claims Johnny Depp wanted Amber Heard replaced in her Aquaman role have resurfaced, following his highly-publicised libel trial.   Earlier this year the Pirates Of The Caribbean star lost his trial against The Sun’s publisher NGN Newspapers, over an article that labelled him a ‘wife-beater’.

Willem Dafoe played Vulko, Patrick Wilson played Orm / Ocean Master, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II played Black Manta, Dolph Lundgren played Nereus, Nicole Kidman played Atlanna, Temuera Morrison played Tom Curry, and Ludi Lin played Captain Murk were among the other notable cast members.

But Amber Heard’s court struggle with ex-husband Johnny Depp has received a lot of public attention in recent years. Despite the fact that the pair had split in 2017, judicial processes in respect to domestic violence accusations and Johnny Depp’s libel action were still ongoing in 2021.

In the middle of the libel action, Warner Bros. withdrew Johnny Depp from his part in the Fantastic Beasts film trilogy. As per We Got This Covered, Amber Heard supporters turned upon her due to the legal fight, and many joined a Change.org petition to have her withdrawn from the Aquaman 2 movie.

This all began when Amber Heard’s audio confession to physical attack leaked online. Previously, Johnny Depp was viewed as the culprit, however, this flipped things around. Fans of the Fantastic Beasts star staged protests to have Heard removed from Aquaman.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

The surreal judgement of the court in the UK will not change my fight to tell the truth and I confirm that I plan to appeal.’   Despite stepping down, the actor will reportedly get his full salary for the film, for which he shot just one scene.   According to the Hollywood Reporter, Depp had a ‘pay-or-play contract’, which requires that he be fully compensated whether or not the film is made and even if it is recast.    The star is believed to have been on an eight-figure salary, and was the highest paid out of his co-stars Eddie Redmayne, who plays Newt Scamander, and Jude Law, who plays Dumbledore.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mwZZsxHteJc/default.jpg,120,90,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mwZZsxHteJc/mqdefault.jpg,320,180,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mwZZsxHteJc/hqdefault.jpg,480,360,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mwZZsxHteJc/sddefault.jpg,640.0,480.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mwZZsxHteJc/maxresdefault.jpg,1280.0,720.0,Ms. Heloise,,22,none,Amber Heard comments on Aquaman role as Johnny Depp fans call for star to be given the boot,"Amber Heard has seemingly responded to Johnny Depp fans’ campaign to have her axed from the upcoming Aquaman 2, following Depp’s libel trial loss in the UK.    Last week Depp stepped down from the role of Gellert Grindelwald in the Harry Potter spin-off Fantastic Beasts, after being asked to do so by Warner Bros following the trial.   Not long after, his fans started a Change.org. petition to have Heard, who was married to Depp from 2015 to 2017, dropped from her role in the Aquaman sequel, which has so far reached more than 1million signatures.   Heard has now commented on her role in the DC film in an interview with  Weekly in which she appeared to rubbish any rumour she wouldn’t be making her return as Mera.   She told the publication: ‘I’m super excited about the amount of fan love and the amount of fan appreciation that Aquaman has acquired and that it has garnered so much excitement for Aquaman and Mera that it means we’ll be coming back.   ‘I’m so excited to film that.’   The actor added production hopes to get underway sometime in 2021.   Her comments follow the judge’s findings of Depp’s trial against The Sun’s publishers after he sued following an article which branded the actor a ‘wife-beater’.   In delivering his verdict, Justice Nicol found that 12 of the 14 alleged incidents of domestic violence did occur.   Depp’s lawyers said they want to appeal the ‘perverse’ verdict.    In a handwritten statement last week, the Pirates Of The Caribbean star confirmed he was leaving the Fantastic Beasts franchise.   Depp wrote on Instagram: ‘Firstly, I’d like to thank everybody who has gifted me with their support and loyalty.   ‘I have been humbled and moved by your many messages of love and concern, particularly over the last few days.   ‘Secondly, I wish to let you know that I have been asked to resign by Warner Bros from my role as Grindelwald in Fantastic Beasts and I have respected and agreed to that request.   ‘Finally, I wish to say this.

Sin embargo Amber Heard habló con Entertainment Weekly contanto que ella aún formará parte de Aquaman 2.

In this video, Celebrity Craze shows J.K Rowling's Reaction to Losing Johnny Depp in the upcoming Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them Movie. As you know, Johnny has been replaced by Mads Mikkelsen and according to J.K. Rowling, this can literally destroy the movie series!

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

Now she is chilling and taking photos on set of the new Aquaman 2 movie. Set to hit theaters in 2022. This is enraging a lot of Johnny Depp supporters.

Jackie Justice (Halle Berry) is a mixed martial arts fighter who leaves the sport in disgrace. Down on her luck and simmering with rage and regret years after the fight, she’s coaxed into a brutal underground fight by her manager and boyfriend Desi (Adan Canto) and grabs the attention of a fight league promoter (Shamier Anderson) who promises Jackie a life back in the octagon. But the road to redemption becomes unexpectedly personal when Manny (Danny Boyd, Jr.) — the son she gave up as an infant — shows up at her doorstep. BRUISED marks the directorial debut of Academy Award winner Halle Berry and also stars Adriane Lenox, Sheila Atim, Valentina Shevchenko, and Stephen McKinley Henderson in a triumphant story of a fighter who reclaims her power, in and out of the ring, when everyone has counted her out.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

The classic, black-and-white images are reminiscent of the 1950's and 1960's western film classics that defined a generation.

Cuffed, skinny jeans, cropped denim jackets, knit bustiers and retro-inspired dresses set the tone for the campaign -- a sexy, love story. The men's pieces draw the viewer into the western traveler with his denim jackets and leather bombers, western inspired wovens and worn in jeans which serve to compliment the women's collection. 

Through a precise balance of close-up and scenic photographs, Ellen's lens transports the audience out west to an unidentified bus stop where a love story between the two leading characters begins to unfold. Whether it's a private glimpse of our heroine lounging in her seat, primping at a motel before her performance or the intimate shots of the characters connection unfolding - the campaign is shot in such a way that the viewer knows they are witnessing a life altering experience between the pair.

""Amber embodies the essence of the true GUESS girl with her natural beauty and all-American good looks,"" says Paul Marciano, Chief Executive Officer and Creative Director for Guess?, Inc. ""The campaign, which was shot by Ellen Von Unwerth, is sure to become an American classic that will continue to define what the GUESS brand stands for."" 

Paul Marciano, who built the global lifestyle brand along with his brother, Maurice, Chairman of the Board, in 1981, has been heralded as launching the careers of then-unknowns including Claudia Schiffer, Anna Nicole Smith, Laetitia Casta and more recently, Kate Upton and Alyssa Miller. His natural eye for discovering raw talent has led to some of the most recognizable and iconic images over the past thirty years.

In this video, Celebrity Craze shows J.K Rowling's Reaction to Losing Johnny Depp in the upcoming Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them Movie. As you know, Johnny has been replaced by Mads Mikkelsen and according to J.K. Rowling, this can literally destroy the movie series!

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

Now she is chilling and taking photos on set of the new Aquaman 2 movie. Set to hit theaters in 2022. This is enraging a lot of Johnny Depp supporters.

In this video, Celebrity Craze shows J.K Rowling's Reaction to Losing Johnny Depp in the upcoming Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them Movie. As you know, Johnny has been replaced by Mads Mikkelsen and according to J.K. Rowling, this can literally destroy the movie series!

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

Now she is chilling and taking photos on set of the new Aquaman 2 movie. Set to hit theaters in 2022. This is enraging a lot of Johnny Depp supporters.

He seemed very sincere and willing to listen to new ideas from entrepreneurs who have the same interest in movie producing and website design. I asked Jason if he could ask Amber Heard if she would be willing to sign her autograph onto a post card or give me few hours of her time over diner?

Johnny Depp Is a Wife Beater Who Abused Amber Heard, British High Court Rules
Depp admitted to prodigious drink and drug use during the case. He admitted to spending $30,000 on red wine each month and said he used large amounts of cocaine, which he said merely “brought him to a normal level.” Depp lost a staggering $650 million he made at the height of his Pirates of the Caribbean fame and was left owing $100 million in taxes.

I asked my friend's insight who works at Hooters regarding the false alleged abuse allegations brought by Mr. Johnny Depp who plays ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"".
Just like it's title, lying to the British High Court was not a wise move.
Here is why - Everyone knows that once a drug addict has got a taste of the highly addicted  white powder cocaine, there is usually only 30% chance that a rehab may cure all Depp's habits such as greed, dope user, sexually active predator and Depp is also known for inviting friends to his wild parties where everything goes.  Mr. Depp will even offer to his friends or a family member a free room onboard at his luxurious estate located in Australia as a token of his generosity so no public eye would know how many women Mr. Depp had sex with while his gorgeous wife was working on the set.

The truth is that Johnny Depp is just like Jeffrey Edward Epstein, an American financier and convicted sex offender who was killed by the guards to silence this predator forever....
Johnny Depp is no different than Mr. Epstein who earned way too much money has turned a good man into a Pirate of nothing but tax frauds and wild sex.  An actor who makes this much cash with the film industry should have no problem paying all his taxes on time! His defense in the British High Court was nothing but just an act like any good male actor would do to win his case at all cost, even as to betray his best friend whom has giving Depp endless pleasure. 

According to our professional observation, Mr. Depp secretly recorded his girlfriend Amber as to trap her into a real abuse that we know happened by his burst of anger for not being able to perform in bed like a stallion would have if he was not so high on cocaine.
Unfortunately, Depp was only able to pleasure Amber for 30 minute then thereafter, this monster would fall into a deep psycho stage of irrational behavior of a 17 year old child who is in need of breastfeeding.
We cannot let this real life Pirate of the Caribbean monster get away with a fabricated lie!
Once a drug addict has gone to a rehab center, the chance of a recovery is very slim because of the massive millions of dollars cache in Switzerland was Depp's ticket to file a malicious civil lawsuit against the SUN as newspaper over an article that called him a ""wife beater"".  
In this life time we would called it ""shit out of luck MF Depp"" finally got a real awaken of a reality is.  

This donkey did not even try to improve his educational background after he made his first movie that paid him $20 Million per movie but instead he wasted all his energy at consuming expensive wine that he owns a $75 million town in France. Unlike two super star actors like John Travolta and Tom Cruise have made a name for themselves by obtaining their pilot licenses ;even though, they did not attend college.   

Think of how many struggling Americans we could have helped with $100 million dollars.
Suppose each college student gets a $600 stimulus check. 
100,000,000 / 600 = 166,666 college students
But instead, Disney decided to help a high school dropout who wanted it all for free!
Guess who will pick up this loser $100 million bankruptcy tax debt? the state of California where the majority of rich actors live.

It's official. Amber Heard will be returning to ""Aquaman 2."" On Thursday, Heard confirmed to Entertainment Weekly that she would be reprising her role as Mera in the Warner Bros.

Amber Heard deserves a Billionaire who would see no boundary between money & love, her business and her gorgeous girlfriends would always come first! Right Bianca Butti.
Who needs a monster like Depp when you can enjoy endless tender loving and be treated like a Princess Mera.

______________________________________________

Despite a growing fan movement to remove Amber Heard from Aquaman 2, Warner Bros. cannot fire her or ask her to resign, as they did in the case of Johnny Depp and Fantastic Beasts 3. This is largely due to how various legal issues are handled differently in different countries; a point that has only served to pour gasoline on the fire of an already explosive situation.

______________________________________________

Despite a growing fan movement to remove Amber Heard from Aquaman 2, Warner Bros. cannot fire her or ask her to resign, as they did in the case of Johnny Depp and Fantastic Beasts 3. This is largely due to how various legal issues are handled differently in different countries; a point that has only served to pour gasoline on the fire of an already explosive situation.

In the ongoing legal battle between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard, both have received a hard blow to their careers, losing movie and brand deals left and right. Especially for Johnny, it's been hard since he lost two major roles, one in the new and upcoming Pirates of the Caribbean movie, and one in the Fantastic Beasts as Gellert Grindelwald. Amber on the other hand hasn't been so unlucky as her role in Aquaman 2 has been untouched. Following the announcement by Warner Bros. that she would be cast in their forthcoming film, Amber Heard feels like she has won against Johnny Depp, and believes her future is safe. But who knows, Depp fans are currently fighting hard to get her removed claiming they would even ""not watch the movie"" if Amber's role as ""Mera"" persists. But for now, it seems like she is safe.

From Warner Bros. Pictures and director James Wan comes an action-packed adventure that spans the vast, visually breathtaking underwater world of the seven seas, “Aquaman,” starring Jason Momoa in the title role.  The film reveals the origin story of half-human, half-Atlantean Arthur Curry and takes him on the journey of his lifetime—one that will not only force him to face who he really is, but to discover if he is worthy of who he was born to be…a king.

The film also stars Amber Heard (“Justice League,” “Magic Mike XXL”) as Mera, a fierce warrior and Aquaman’s ally throughout his journey; Oscar nominee Willem Dafoe (“Platoon,” “Spider-Man 2”) as Vulko, council to the Atlantean throne; Patrick Wilson (“The Conjuring” films, “Watchmen”) as Orm/Ocean Master, the present King of Atlantis; Dolph Lundgren (“The Expendables” films) as Nereus, King of the Atlantean tribe Xebel; Yahya Abdul-Mateen II (Netflix’s “The Get Down”) as the vengeful Black Manta; and Oscar winner Nicole Kidman (“The Hours,” “Lion”) as Arthur’s mom, Atlanna; as well as Ludi Lin (“Power Rangers”) as Captain Murk, Atlantean Commando; and Temuera Morrison (“Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones,” “Green Lantern”) as Arthur’s dad, Tom Curry.

Wan directs from a screenplay by David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick (“The Conjuring 2”) and Will Beall (“Gangster Squad,” TV’s “Training Day”), story by Geoff Johns & James Wan and Will Beall, based on characters from DC, Aquaman created by Paul Norris and Mort Weisinger.  The film is produced by Peter Safran and Rob Cowan, with Deborah Snyder, Zack Snyder, Jon Berg, Geoff Johns and Walter Hamada serving as executive producers.

Wan’s team behind the scenes includes such frequent collaborators as Oscar-nominated director of photography Don Burgess (“The Conjuring 2,” “Forrest Gump”), his five-time editor Kirk Morri (“The Conjuring” films, “Furious 7,” the “Insidious” films), and production designer Bill Brzeski (“Furious 7”).  They are joined by costume designer Kym Barrett (“The Matrix” trilogy, “The Amazing Spider-Man”) and composer Rupert Gregson-Williams (“Wonder Woman”).

Warner Bros. Pictures Presents a Safran Company Production, a James Wan Film, “Aquaman.”  The film is set to hit theaters on December 21, 2018, in 3D and 2D and IMAX, and will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros.

Screwed Up,"One of the biggest news recently in Hollywood is probably the news about Johnny Depp being asked to leave Fantastic Beats 3 as Grindelwald but his ex-wife, Amber Heard was allowed to stay on for DC movies like Aquaman. Isn't that crazy? The Judge from the court case even threw out Johnny Depp's evidence even though it was a recording of Amber Heard admitting to hitting Johnny Depp. Hollywood is weird. But Warner Bros. did Johnny Depp dirty... Funny enough though, Warner Bros. still has to pay Johnny Depp his 8-figure salary even though he only filmed one scene in the movie.

Screwed Up,"One of the biggest news recently in Hollywood is probably the news about Johnny Depp being asked to leave Fantastic Beats 3 as Grindelwald but his ex-wife, Amber Heard was allowed to stay on for DC movies like Aquaman. Isn't that crazy? The Judge from the court case even threw out Johnny Depp's evidence even though it was a recording of Amber Heard admitting to hitting Johnny Depp. Hollywood is weird. But Warner Bros. did Johnny Depp dirty... Funny enough though, Warner Bros. still has to pay Johnny Depp his 8-figure salary even though he only filmed one scene in the movie.

Pictures and director James Wan comes an action-packed adventure that spans the vast, visually breathtaking underwater world of the seven seas, “Aquaman,” starring Jason Momoa in the title role.  The film reveals the origin story of half-human, half-Atlantean Arthur Curry and takes him on the journey of his lifetime—one that will not only force him to face who he really is, but to discover if he is worthy of who he was born to be…a king.  The film also stars Amber Heard (“Justice League,” “Magic Mike XXL”) as Mera, a fierce warrior and Aquaman’s ally throughout his journey; Oscar nominee Willem Dafoe (“Platoon,” “Spider-Man 2”) as Vulko, council to the Atlantean throne; Patrick Wilson (“The Conjuring” films, “Watchmen”) as Orm/Ocean Master, the present King of Atlantis; Dolph Lundgren (“The Expendables” films) as Nereus, King of the Atlantean tribe Xebel; Yahya Abdul-Mateen II (upcoming “Baywatch,” Netflix’s “The Get Down”) as the vengeful Black Manta; and Oscar winner Nicole Kidman (“The Hours,” “Lion”) as Arthur’s mom, Atlanna; as well as Ludi Lin (“Power Rangers”) as Captain Murk, Atlantean Commando; and Temuera Morrison (“Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones,” “Green Lantern”) as Arthur’s dad, Tom Curry.  Wan directs from a screenplay by David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick (“The Conjuring 2”) and Will Beall (“Gangster Squad,” TV’s “Training Day”), story by Geoff Johns & James Wan and Will Beall, based on characters from DC, Aquaman created by Paul Norris and Mort Weisinger.  The film is produced by Peter Safran and Rob Cowan, with Deborah Snyder, Zack Snyder, Jon Berg, Geoff Johns and Walter Hamada serving as executive producers.  Wan’s team behind the scenes includes such frequent collaborators as Oscar-nominated director of photography Don Burgess (“The Conjuring 2,” “Forrest Gump”), his five-time editor Kirk Morri (“The Conjuring” films, “Furious 7,” the “Insidious” films), and production designer Bill Brzeski (“Furious 7”).  They are joined by costume designer Kym Barrett (“The Matrix” trilogy, “The Amazing Spider-Man”) and composer Rupert Gregson-Williams (“Wonder Woman”). Warner Bros. Pictures Presents a Safran Company Production, a James Wan Film, “Aquaman.”  The film is set to hit theaters on December 21, 2018, in 3D and 2D and IMAX, and will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

Después del juicio contra The Sun, en el que el jurado dio la razón al periódico británico y falló contra Johnny Depp, el actor fue despedido de la película Animales Fantásticos 3, donde repetiría el papel del villano Grindelwald.


Por otro lado, la gran ganadora fue Amber Heard, quien se quedó con su papel de Mera en Aquaman 2 y reafirmó que fue la víctima en la relación tóxica que tuvo con Depp.

Parece ser que la actriz quiere involucrarse mucho con Warner Bros. Amber Heard estaría buscando unirse a la franquicia de Harry Potter, y dado que las únicas producciones de ésta actualmente son las películas de Animales Fantásticos, es lógico pensar que la actriz quiere ser incluida en esta saga.

Según el sitio Giant Freaking Robot, una fuente de confianza les reveló que Heard busca un papel en la franquicia de Harry Potter, ahora que su ex-marido fue despedido de ella.


También se sugiere la posibilidad de que no sea en Animales Fantásticos sino en un nuevo proyecto donde la veamos actuar, pero hasta ahora no hay noticias sobre lo que Warner Bros, está planeando hacer con este universo cinematográfico.

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

While the hits keep coming for Johnny Depp in his continuing estrangement battles against his ex-wife, this time she’s coming for his most iconic role.
 
In today’s video are going to tell about Amber Heard Reportedly in Talks for ‘Pirates of the Caribbean’ Reboot
 
Johnny Depp, now 55, and Amber Heard, 32, met on the set of The Rum Diary in 2011 and commenced dating fresh off his relationship with Vanessa Paradis. Depp and Heard's marriage was short-lived, only lasting from February 2015 until she filed for divorce in May 2016.

Amber Heard and Johnny Depp: the dramatic divorcee gift that keeps on giving. Just a few years ago, Johnny Depp was one of the highest-paid actors on the planet, but allegations of violence made him box office poison. Petitions calling for his removal from the Pirates of the Caribbean and Fantastic Beasts franchises emerged. Depp, during a lawsuit against his ex-wife Amber Heard, claimed that her allegations had hurt his career. While the role of Grindelwald is that the sole career casualty he’s faced so far in his epic years-long showdown with Heard, Depp’s legendary status as Captain Jack Sparrow could even be commandeered by his estranged ex-wife. Not only is she keeping her role in Aquaman 2, but she will even be within the running for a task within the new Pirates of the Caribbean reboot. If this information is true, she would be joining ranks with Margot Robbie’s Pirates reboot, promising “lots of girl power.”

While it’s unclear if the actress has had talks with the studio just yet about it, or if she’s only discussed it with the Birds of Prey star at this stage, booting Depp from Pirates of the Caribbean then drafting Heard in to sail the body of water instead would little question send the online into a fit of rage? That being said, within the eyes of the law, Amber is technically the victim here, and if Warner Bros is willing to possess her headline a significant blockbuster.

Johnny Depp continues to receive blows after losing his appeal against the United Kingdom’s court ruling on the Sun’s ‘wife-beater’ defamation case. New reports have circulated stating that Aquaman star Amber Heard is talking with Margot Robbie to hitch Depp’s former franchise.

While this is often ready to be a huge blow to Depp, we’re unsure Jerry Bruckheimer, producer of Pirates and longtime friend of the actor, would allow such disrespect. Fans are also on Depp’s side, with nearly 350,000 signatures on a petition to bring him back because of the famed Captain. Heard has her own, not so flattering petition to fireside her from Aquaman, which claims quite 1.5 million signatures.

The new developments in Depp and Heard’s careers still unfold while their legal battle ensues. it's interesting to determine how things would find yourself later and if Heard’s movies will receive the impact of the involves boycotts that fans are campaigning for. The Pirates of the Caribbean sixth installment with Margot Robbie remains in development. Disney dropped Johnny Depp from the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise four days after Amber Heard's op-ed within the Washington Post, his attorneys allege, which they see the events as connected.

Johnny Depp's lawyers just filed a $50 million defamation suit against Amber Heard, arguing her abuse allegations ""were a neighborhood of an elaborate hoax to urge positive publicity for Ms. Heard and advance her career."" Since the op-ed was published on December 18, the lawsuit also suggests it had been done to help promote her film Aquaman.

What are your views all about? Are you disappointed that the Jack Sparrow actor won’t be making an appearance in any future Pirates of the Caribbean installments, or are you happy with Disney’s decision to cut ties with the alleged abuser? Let us know your thoughts in the comments section below and If you haven’t subscribed to my channel yet, please do so. See you in the next video.

From Warner Bros. Pictures and director James Wan comes an action-packed adventure that spans the vast, visually breathtaking underwater world of the seven seas, “Aquaman,” starring Jason Momoa in the title role.  The film reveals the origin story of half-human, half-Atlantean Arthur Curry and takes him on the journey of his lifetime—one that will not only force him to face who he really is, but to discover if he is worthy of who he was born to be…a king.

The film also stars Amber Heard (“Justice League,” “Magic Mike XXL”) as Mera, a fierce warrior and Aquaman’s ally throughout his journey; Oscar nominee Willem Dafoe (“Platoon,” “Spider-Man 2”) as Vulko, council to the Atlantean throne; Patrick Wilson (“The Conjuring” films, “Watchmen”) as Orm/Ocean Master, the present King of Atlantis; Dolph Lundgren (“The Expendables” films) as Nereus, King of the Atlantean tribe Xebel; Yahya Abdul-Mateen II (Netflix’s “The Get Down”) as the vengeful Black Manta; and Oscar winner Nicole Kidman (“The Hours,” “Lion”) as Arthur’s mom, Atlanna; as well as Ludi Lin (“Power Rangers”) as Captain Murk, Atlantean Commando; and Temuera Morrison (“Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones,” “Green Lantern”) as Arthur’s dad, Tom Curry.

Wan directs from a screenplay by David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick (“The Conjuring 2”) and Will Beall (“Gangster Squad,” TV’s “Training Day”), story by Geoff Johns & James Wan and Will Beall, based on characters from DC, Aquaman created by Paul Norris and Mort Weisinger.  The film is produced by Peter Safran and Rob Cowan, with Deborah Snyder, Zack Snyder, Jon Berg, Geoff Johns and Walter Hamada serving as executive producers.

Wan’s team behind the scenes includes such frequent collaborators as Oscar-nominated director of photography Don Burgess (“The Conjuring 2,” “Forrest Gump”), his five-time editor Kirk Morri (“The Conjuring” films, “Furious 7,” the “Insidious” films), and production designer Bill Brzeski (“Furious 7”).  They are joined by costume designer Kym Barrett (“The Matrix” trilogy, “The Amazing Spider-Man”) and composer Rupert Gregson-Williams (“Wonder Woman”).

The film also stars Amber Heard (“Justice League,” “Magic Mike XXL”) as Mera, a fierce warrior and Aquaman’s ally throughout his journey; Oscar nominee Willem Dafoe (“Platoon,” “Spider-Man 2”) as Vulko, council to the Atlantean throne; Patrick Wilson (“The Conjuring” films, “Watchmen”) as Orm/Ocean Master, the present King of Atlantis; Dolph Lundgren (“The Expendables” films) as Nereus, King of the Atlantean tribe Xebel; Yahya Abdul-Mateen II (Netflix’s “The Get Down”) as the vengeful Black Manta; and Oscar winner Nicole Kidman (“The Hours,” “Lion”) as Arthur’s mom, Atlanna; as well as Ludi Lin (“Power Rangers”) as Captain Murk, Atlantean Commando; and Temuera Morrison (“Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones,” “Green Lantern”) as Arthur’s dad, Tom Curry.

Wan directs from a screenplay by David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick (“The Conjuring 2”) and Will Beall (“Gangster Squad,” TV’s “Training Day”), story by Geoff Johns & James Wan and Will Beall, based on characters from DC, Aquaman created by Paul Norris and Mort Weisinger.  The film is produced by Peter Safran and Rob Cowan, with Deborah Snyder, Zack Snyder, Jon Berg, Geoff Johns and Walter Hamada serving as executive producers.

Wan’s team behind the scenes includes such frequent collaborators as Oscar-nominated director of photography Don Burgess (“The Conjuring 2,” “Forrest Gump”), his five-time editor Kirk Morri (“The Conjuring” films, “Furious 7,” the “Insidious” films), and production designer Bill Brzeski (“Furious 7”).  They are joined by costume designer Kym Barrett (“The Matrix” trilogy, “The Amazing Spider-Man”) and composer Rupert Gregson-Williams (“Wonder Woman”).

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.

Now she is chilling and taking photos on set of the new Aquaman 2 movie. Set to hit theaters in 2022. This is enraging a lot of Johnny Depp supporters.

With petitions to remove Amber Heard from Aquaman 2 are rising, one might think that Amber Heard will soon be replaced. But that might not be the case, as WB reportedly thinks that Amber Heard Petitions are artificially inflated. 


In today’s video, we’ll tell you what WB reportedly, has to say about Amber Heard petitions. 


Amber Heard recently suggested that the barrage of online campaigns being launched against her were secretly funded and paid for. The star, told EW that “paid campaigns” on social media will not prevent her taking up her role in the sequel, which will see director James Wan return alongside Jason Momoa as the title character.


Warner Bros.’ decision to remove Johnny Depp from the Fantastic Beasts franchise has caused much controversy online, with many calling for him to be reinstated and for his ex-wife Amber Heard to be fired from the DCEU instead. While Depp’s recent UK libel case went against him, there’s a lot of passionate support for him on social media. In fact, one Change.org petition to get Heard removed as Mera from Aquaman 2 has just hit 1 million signatures.


You’d think that would be enough to make WB sit up and pause, but one report is claiming that the studio is not taking the swell of support for Depp and against Heard seriously, which might annoy a lot of people. 


The petition to remove which crossed 1.2 million signatures on Change.org, making it one of the most signed petitions on the platform so far. However, the executives at Warner Bros. Pictures think it’s all been inflated and doesn’t reflect what people really think.


We’ve seen it happened earlier than with the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s Captain Marvel, when trolls did all the things, to downvote Carol Danvers’ origin story into oblivion. And whereas some sections of the fanbase nonetheless haven’t reconciled themselves with the truth that Brie Larson is a part of the franchise for the long term, just a little on-line backlash didn’t cease the film from incomes over a billion dollars on the field workplace.


Now, Geekosity’s Mikey Sutton claims that Warner Bros. are of same perception that in the case of the relentless want from numerous corners of the web to see Heard booted from her position as Mera in Aquaman 2, they usually don’t have any intention of asking her to step down simply because Johnny Depp has been trending at numerous factors over the past couple of weeks.


“They see it no in another way than the boycott of Marvel Studios’ Captain Marvel movie, which proved to be ineffective because it introduced in over a billion to Disney,” says Sutton. “They imagine it’s artificially inflated and almost certainly politically motivated. They don’t base their selections on internet chatter.”


Warner Bros continues to remain silent on Amber Heard ‘s status. Much of the public believes that Warner Bros may be afraid of the public backlash of letting Heard go. 


Mikey Sutton also says, “the answer is the same now as it was then: there are no plans to have Heard fired. Whether Warner Bros. eventually is scared off from the Twitter attacks on Heard and lets her go is unknown. But what I’ve been told is quite the opposite.”


“Warner Bros. removing an actress who was the victim of spousal abuse will create even worse PR, executives fear, despite what she is also being accused of,” says Sutton.


However, that may be part of the reason, but the majority of the reason is that Heard’s contract with Warner Bros makes it almost impossible for them to let her go.

The inspiration behind this video:

The Spider-Man: No Way Home trailer may have spoiled Aunt May's tragic death, showing it's the end for the character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The latest No Way Home trailer revealed several details for the MCU's upcoming Spider-Man film. In addition to Alfred Molina reprising Doc Ock, Thomas Haden Church bringing back Sandman, and Willem Dafoe taking on Green Goblin again, the trailer shows the villains don't recognize Tom Holland's Peter Parker as Spider-Man. This reveals the criminals are definitely from other universes. Additionally, Spider-Man seems to want to save the villains' lives, but Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) says it's their fate to die.

In addition to bringing in numerous characters from past Spider-Man films, No Way Home has several returns as well. Peter Parker's love interest, MJ (Zendaya), and best friend, Ned (Jacob Batalon), return and wind up in trouble in the latest trailer. Additionally, Aunt May (Marisa Tomei) and Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau) come back to keep an eye on Spider-Man amid the chaos. And after a surprise appearance in Spider-Man: Far From Home, J. Jonah Jameson (J.K. Simmons), the head of The Daily Bugle and a leading force turning the public against Spider-Man, also shows up in the trailer.

The inspiration behind this video:

Spider-Man: No Way Home brings Alfred Molina's Doc Ock into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which will retroactively ruin Spider-Man 2. No Way Home is letting all the past Spider-Man films collide. The first trailer for the film showed Peter Parker (Tom Holland) going to Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) after the world learns that he's secretly Spider-Man. Doctor Strange wants to help and attempts a dangerous memory wipe spell to reverse the situation. Unfortunately, things don't go as planned. Doctor Strange's enchantment goes awry after Parker meddles with the spell, and past Spider-Man villains, such as Alfred Molina's Doc Ock, are free to cause chaos in the MCU.

Molina made Doc Ock a tortured and iconic Spider-Man villain in Spider-Man 2. After an entire movie of his evil AI tentacles corrupting him to build his dangerous fusion reactor, Doc Ock finally breaks loose from their hold with the help of Spider-Man (Tobey Maguire) at the end of the film. Realizing his experiment threatens New York City, Doc Ock drowns his device in a river, dying in a last-ditch effort to retain part of his former self. ""I will not die a monster,"" he says ahead of disappearing into the watery depths.

With the initial court date being pushed back, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been given some more time in order to gather more evidence for their individual cases. For quite some time, the two were firing evidence at each other in order to win in court. 

Ever since the recent release of the footage of the LAPD officers from the penthouse night of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, things have not been looking all too bright for Amber Heard. Her team has been working tirelessly in order to back up her side, however Johnny Depp seems to have made the attempt to strike back.
