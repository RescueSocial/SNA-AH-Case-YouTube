Johnny Depp’s lawyers said the video contradicts evidence given by Whitney Henriquez that Ms Heard had never been violent towards her. 

Ms Henriquez denied giving false evidence and said the fight referred to in the video was just verbal.

The case, the biggest English libel trial of the 21st century, is due to finish next week with closing submissions from both sides' legal teams on Monday and Tuesday, and a ruling expected at a later date.

Amber Heard Faces 10 Years In Prison For Accusations Against Johnny Depp!!!

https://youtu.be/UvsHWTGHmts

Amber Heard and Johnny Depp have been involved in major legal battles for years now and
it seems that this drama is coming to an end now with new revelations and plot twists. It is
not easy to keep up with Johnny and Amber's case but what is most important here is that
Amber Heard is potentially facing jail time.
The court drama made a major plot twist when Johnny Depp filed a defamation lawsuit
against his ex-wife. He not only claimed that she lied in court, but also that she was abusive
toward him. However, the actors will need to wait even longer to get an official court ruling. If
the court rules in Johnny Depp’s favor, Amber Heard could be facing up to three years of jail
time.
Basically, Amber Heard claimed that Johnny Depp had physically and emotionally abused
her. Their original court drama in 2015 resulted in a restraining order against Johnny Depp,
but that’s also where the blurry lines began. Johnny claims that Amber had faked her black
eye seen at the court, and Amber Heard’s stylist corroborated this.
She stated, “Throughout the day of December 16, 2015, I could see clearly that Amber
Heard did not have any visible marks, bruises, cuts, or injuries to her face or any other part
of her body.”
But this was not the only time Amber Heard lied and was caught lying. Why would she do
that all the time? It was her strategy. She wanted to play a victim and she was good at it until
the truth came out. Even in 2017 she still managed to convince everyone that in this
situation she suffered from Johnny Depp's actions against her. Amber Heard made people
trust her and, moreover, she almost ruined Johnny Depp’s career, as the publicity called him
a ‘wife beater’ and supported Amber and sympathized with her.
While nothing could be proven, Amber Heard’s accusations against Johnny Depp were
enough to significantly damage Johnny’s reputation and acting career. The story also almost
derailed the latest Pirates of the Caribbean movie, Dead Men Tell No Tales, Johnny Depp
has faced significant levels of hate and ostracizing over the past five years. But then things
have changed.
The first thing which ruined Amber Heard's vicious plan was the leaked audio. And since the
audio leak, the internet has already returned to Johnny Depp's side of the issue. Johnny
Depp filed a defamation lawsuit against his ex-wife just over a year ago, and Amber Heard
attempted to get the case dismissed but her request was denied.
Johnny Depp initially filed the suit to sue Amber Heard for $50 million. But now it appears
that she could not only be forced to pay the sum, but she could also be facing jail time.
According to the International Business Times:
“If Heard will be proven guilty of faking her bruises, she could face three years of
imprisonment. According to the Wallin & Klarich Law Firm, the California Penal Code Section
141 PC stated that it is illegal to alter, modify, plant, place, conceal, manufacture or move
any physical matter with the intention of causing someone to be charged with a crime. Some
would face felony charges for this”.
But it doesn’t stop there. Amber Heard could also be charged with offering false evidence.
These are also considered felony crimes and each carry a maximum sentence of up to three
years.
And again, it doesn’t stop here. More and more evidence has come forward to showcase
that Amber Heard was the one who abused Johnny Depp and that she had a strategy of
making people think she was innocent. The number of times Amber lied is impressive: she
was caught lying in court (the audio recording situation), she asked or even forced people to
lie for her in court and she stole her assistant’s s*xual assault story and used it as her own.
Later it turned out that Amber Heard has a history of violence.
...
And now I want to know your opinion about this situation. Do you think Amber Heard is
facing jail time? And what’s gonna happen with Johnny Depp’s career? Let me know your
opinion in the comments section down below.

Amber Heard has been in the news so much this year. A lot of the controversy she’s been involved in has to do with her involvement with Johnny Depp’s libel case against the Sun Publication. This year she's gotten a lot of media attention and we saw a lot of dirt come out that painted a very different picture than what we previously interpreted of their marriage, but this isn't the only picture that faced a lot of backlashes.

This year she's gotten a lot of media attention and we saw a lot of dirt come out that painted a very different picture than what we previously interpreted of their marriage, but this isn't the only picture that faced a lot of backlashes.

It’s a Hollywood drama like the world has never seen. With an A-list cast, it’s full of intrigue and fiery dialogue, and topped off with lashings of sex and drugs. There is even a pivotal scene set right here in Australia, starring politician Barnaby Joyce. But this production isn’t playing at any theatre. Centre stage is a London court where actor Johnny Depp is suing an English tabloid for calling him a wife beater. As Tom Steinfort reveals, no one is going to win an Oscar, but Depp and his one-time bride, actress Amber Heard, have been putting on the performance of their lives, airing every sordid detail of their bizarre and doomed marriage.

The case between Amber Heard and Johnny Depp is one that people are following all over the world. The anticipation builds day by day while fans of the actors wait for the official court hearing. Amber Heard is starting to create a pretty bad name for herself, but now might be the time for an offical apology to Johnny Depp. A lot of other celebrities have been dragged into this mess - one is the Tesla billionaire, Elon Musk (for some interesting reasons). And it does not seem like Elon Musk is quite done in this case, as Depp is not done dealing with him.

But it now looks like Captain Jack Sparrow won’t go down without a fight. Depp has now accused his ex-wife of submitting fake evidence in her abuse case against him, and if she’s eventually found guilty, Amber could face some serious jail time.

Jason Momoa is a name that is buzzing and has been buzzing in the world of showbiz for quite some time. In fact, when Aquaman was released earlier in the year 2018, he was the only talk of Hollywood! 

Due to Aquaman’s major success, soon after its release, the second sequel to the movie was announced to be premiered in the year 2022. Unfortunately, with the Me Too movement targeting so many A-listers, one of the cast members was accused of being a part of this bandwagon. Any guesses on who fell off the wagon and joined in amongst the list of abusers? Yes, it was Amber Heard!

Amber Heard has been making headlines regularly for almost 2 years now, especially after her divorce from Johnny Depp. Initially, people assumed her to be the poor victim in the chaotic scenario she had going on with Johnny Depp. At one point, we were pretty convinced that she was the victim after she posted her pictures of the scars that she had obtained due to being a victim of domestic violence. 
 
What were Amber’s claims?

Amber Heard proved to be the biggest victim of the year, with her constant rants on social media as well as her claiming Johnny Depp to be an evil man with anger issues. She kept throwing out lies until one day Depp was forced to sue her, hence causing the famous chaotic court case to make repeated headlines.

How did Ambers Claims backfire?
 
Johnny Depp was proven innocent to his ex-wife’s claims after a leaked conversation between the two was released, proving that in fact, it was Johnny Depp who was being victimized. This surely didn’t save the mess he was in but made the likes of big platforms such as Disney apologize to him for believing the allegations.

How did this news worsen?

The Me Too movement was trending and each day a new celeb was being called out for inappropriate behaviour of misconduct with the co-workers, especially the female ones. Due to this being embedded in the minds of all, Depp was the most likely candidate to get abuser-bashed for his immoral actions.

Due to her alleged accusations, Johnny Depp’s career was quite miserable. In fact, the production teams that loved working with his massive talent started to reject his role in the movies. And all this was due to the fault of Amber and her bunch of lies. Imagine not having Jack Sparrow in the next Pirates of the Caribbean sequel!

What’s the big question now?

What’s racing across everyone’s mind is what does Amber Heard’s co-star, Jason Momoa, have to say about this? 

As you may be aware, Warner Bros just like all other entertainment entities, have the contents of the contract that they sign with the actors, strictly specifying them to follow privacy protocols, leaving the actors with little to nothing left to say about what goes on with the production of their movie as well as any other activities that take place under the roof of the Warner Bros. 

Jason Momoa has been adhering to the protocol and has not stated anything about the scandal his co-star was involved in. It shows that he doesn’t care about this blow -up or change in the cast, or that he has been asked by Warner Bros. to keep this situation on the low.

But, was Momoa and Heard compatible in real life as much as they seemed on screen?

Rumor has it that the Momoa and Heard were not as compatible as they seemed on the screen. With them being actors from two different worlds, it is sure to be quite a clash in the studios. But others state that they were actually good together since they were complete opposites and that opposites attract. Even though they seem great together on the red carpet, always having fun, the truth behind this fact is still left unknown!

Would Momoa’s word and stance on this scenario change the fate of who plays the role of Mera?

Most probably, yes. Without Jason, there is no Aquaman. In fact, the entire success behind Aquaman was 90% due to Jason Momoa’s efforts in making the storyline as lively. Without him, reaching this milestone would have been highly impossible. On a serious note, it’s highly possible that rather than risking their biggest asset, Warner Bros. would not sacrifice their king for the sake of Amber!

But, was Momoa and Heard compatible in real life as much as they seemed on screen?

Rumor has it that the Momoa and Heard were not as compatible as they seemed on the screen. With them being actors from two different worlds, it is sure to be quite a clash in the studios. But others state that they were actually good together since they were complete opposites and that opposites attract. Even though they seem great together on the red carpet, always having fun, the truth behind this fact is still left unknown!

Would Momoa’s word and stance on this scenario change the fate of who plays the role of Mera?

Most probably, yes. Without Jason, there is no Aquaman. In fact, the entire success behind Aquaman was 90% due to Jason Momoa’s efforts in making the storyline as lively. Without him, reaching this milestone would have been highly impossible. On a serious note, it’s highly possible that rather than risking their biggest asset, Warner Bros. would not sacrifice their king for the sake of Amber!
