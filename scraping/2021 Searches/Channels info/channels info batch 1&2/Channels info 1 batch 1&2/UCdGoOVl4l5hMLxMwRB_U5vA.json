I gather the actual information from each call and I present it in a civil manner. I do not form an opinion, I leave that to the viewer. I would also like to explore other ideas on this channel, for example: DOCUMENTARIES , OR A DOCU-SERIES. I\u2019m still not sure about what exactly, but I\u2019d love to one day make something of that nature. Anyway, thanks for stopping by and hope you stick around for more videos. Thank you!",
