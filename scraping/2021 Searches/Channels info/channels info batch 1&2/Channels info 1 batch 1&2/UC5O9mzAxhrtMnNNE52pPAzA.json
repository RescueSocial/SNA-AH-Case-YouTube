I love Church History and I love telling the stories because of the revealed truths, the clarity of God\u2019s love for His children, and the inspiring stories of those early Saints that are so motivating to us today.  But I don\u2019t just tell the stories, I show how the stories of the past can help each of us draw closer to the Savior in our everyday lives!  I decided to now share stories from Church history with you, and I often tell them from the sites where those stories actually took place.  I\u2019ll also share the fun and entertaining stories too.  Stories I share come from the Sacred Grove, the Hill Cumorah, Fayette, Martin\u2019s Cove, Nauvoo, the Susquehanna River, the Kirtland Temple, Carthage Jail, Adam-ondi-Ahman, and so many other wonderful and sacred places.
