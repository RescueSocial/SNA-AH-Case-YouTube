It was founded in 2003 by Aniruddha Bahal, who had earlier co-founded Tehelka. One of its first major breaks happened in 2005, when, along with Aaj Tak, Cobrapost conducted an investigation named Operation Duryodhana that exposed eleven members (MPs) accepting money for tabling their questions in the Parliament of India. This investigation led to expulsion of eleven MPs from the Parliament, the largest expulsion of MPs in the country's history. Cobrapost is now entering the domain of mainstream news.",
