I've set up this channel to help to educate people about these different personality disorders and abuse so that they can protect themselves from it and start to heal from it if they have experienced it in the past. Understanding the way abusers think and behave can give people the validation they need to stop blaming themselves for abuse they have endured and to build up their strength and confidence.  I work as a coach specifically with people who have experienced, or are currently experiencing narcissistic abuse. \n\nPlease subscribe to my channel!\n\nwww.liveabusefree.com\ncontact@liveabusefree.com",
