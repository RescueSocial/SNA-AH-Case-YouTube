After I'm satisfied with my video's topic, I get into the scripting. This can take anywhere from 30min to 3 hours, depending on how complex the video is. Once I am done with the script, I record the audio and make sure that the quality is perfect for you guys. \n\nAll my videos are edited with Adobe Premiere Pro and the whole editing process can take me anywhere from 3-5 hours per video. Overall, this is probably the most time-consuming part.\n\nSchedule: Currently, I post videos every Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday of every week at exactly 11am EST.\n\nI hope to see you in my videos! :) \n\nFor Business Inquiries please contact the email address below \ud83d\udc47\n",
