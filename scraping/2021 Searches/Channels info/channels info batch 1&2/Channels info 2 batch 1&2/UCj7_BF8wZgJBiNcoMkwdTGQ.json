My goal on YouTube is to reach as many people as I can...from making funny videos to talking about solving health conditions. I enjoy doing voice overs and would like to someday be a voiceover actor. Although my life has been short of good health, I continue to find ways to not allow my conditions to bring me down. I don't have many friends and I barely go out. I do enjoy the simplicities of life, like that warm bath and a good article to read. It doesn't take much to make me happy. I'm an easy going person, who rather do things alone! My mother who passed away recently told me, \"No one owes you anything, go out and earn your way through life.\" I hope I can continue to be of some relevance here on youtube as the years go pass. Thank you for stopping by...love you guys a lot!",
