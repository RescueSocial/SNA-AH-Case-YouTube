I started this channel while I was in college and working at my part time job. After graduating college and working at my full time job, I had to figure out a way to still make YouTube videos.

My passion doe lie on diesel trucks so there may be more diesel content, but I love all trucks.\n\nUpload Schedule:\nTuesday, Thursday, and Saturday (some time on Sunday)\n",
