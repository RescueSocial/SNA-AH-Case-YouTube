            "description": "Salute, everyone. My name is Chris, aka The Fat Bald Sicilian. I am 42 years old, originally from Queens, NY, and I now live in Pennsylvania with my wife and stepkids. I spent most of my life in the streets, with the wrong type of people, and during that time, I became a career criminal, and drug addict. I've been through a lot in my life... jail multiple times, house arrest, rehab, and, at one point, even a psych ward. I have lost my health and freedom due to my bad decisions and choices in life, but I've managed to turn it all around, and now I'm doing well and living a happy, healthy, productive life. I also have an interest in the history of the mafia, as I've lived a lot of my life in the neighborhoods that bred these gangsters, and all types of notorious figures and criminals. I am not an expert, just an historian,  and a guy with an opinion. I hope you enjoy. ",
