I use my experiences, knowledge & understanding to make it make sense.\n\nMy grandmother & mother have NPD. My ex husband of 10 years is a narcissist & we have 2 son's. My upbringing made me a magnet for narcissistic/toxic people until I learned of narcissistic abuse age 37. I am no contact with many people & meeting my true self for the first time. It is the happiest I have ever been. \n\nWith encouragement from my therapist I have found a platform to share with others. Sending you lots love & strength.\n\nUdate Oct 2021; great news!
