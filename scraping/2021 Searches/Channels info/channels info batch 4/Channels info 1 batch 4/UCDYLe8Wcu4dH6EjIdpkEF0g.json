            "description": "Hi there everyone! Welcome to my Youtube Channel! First of all, thank you for visiting, I really appreciate each and everyone of you guys! My name is Jayden, also known as Mizuri online! I'm a self taught digital artist from Melbourne, Australia who likes to play around in photoshop, learning new things on the way! I like all sorts of things, but mainly games and comicbook related stuff here, so expect some of that. So this channel is mainly for my friends and followers who want to know more about me and my art, so this is how I started it. I\u2019ll mainly be doing speedarts, and possibly tutorials of my way of using photoshop and the way I composite things in it. Hope you\u2019ll like what I post! Enjoy, and thanks once again :)",
