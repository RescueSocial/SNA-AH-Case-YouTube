I am a big fan of George Strait, Alan Jackson, Randy Travis, Merle Haggard, George Jones, and many more, so they are at the top of my list to upload,  but any suggestions are welcome.  I upload as often as I can, but not as much lately, hopefully again soon.  Drop me a line whenever you like.\n\nIf you are a country musician or group, I would be glad to watch and support your videos as well, just let me know!",
