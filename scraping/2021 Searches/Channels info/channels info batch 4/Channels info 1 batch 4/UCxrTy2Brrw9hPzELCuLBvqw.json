Most of the time that I pick up an instrument it does not require electricity to play (although I'm passionate about amplified Blues Harp on stage), so I do a lot of writing out in nature or beside a fire. A lot of my lyrics tend to reference history, math, science, philosophy and romance. \n\n I am probably a complicated man, but trying to lead a simple life.",
