            "description": "Hello Toy Fans, Welcome to my world of Toymension! Where I James, AKA QuickShift talks to you and shares my toy collections. I believe in being an older child. Sometimes you just need to escape from the real world and think back to your childhood... when everything was based on imagination and stories of heroes and mythical creatures. I hope you enjoy of what I have to share. Remember we didn't ask to grow up... but we can still chose to stay young at heart :)\n\nSome of the things I like to do on this channel is review and discuss toys, action figures, statues and such. I believe anything can be a toy from a stuffed animals to cars. Remote ControlCars are fun.  Sometimes I will show an adventure or a simple stay at home clip. I love XBOX and a few of there games I may share aswell. Lately Ive been trying to get into cosplay and the fantasy of acting as something or someone else. Its your imagination at its finest. Hope you enjoy and make sure you check things out and subscribe :)\n",
