            "description": "An estimated 39 million survivors of childhood sexual abuse exist in the United States today. One in four girls and one in six boys experience some form of sexual abuse before the age of 18, and one in five children will be solicited sexually on the internet.\n\nIn most cases, childhood sexual abuse goes unreported or victims break silence many years after the abuse occurs. While there are many legal barriers to prosecuting those responsible for abuse, our firm has worked to overcome these barriers for more than 25 years. As pioneers of child protection through civil litigation, we are aggressively committed to this cause and capable of handling the most complex legal problems in courts across the United States.",
