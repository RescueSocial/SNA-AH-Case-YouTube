            "description": "The city of Gresham is rich in history, diversity, and natural beauty. With a population of more than 110,000, it is the fourth-largest city in Oregon and includes the youngest and most diverse neighborhood in the Portland metro region. Located between Portland and the Columbia River Gorge, Gresham has preserved its natural heritage, with more than 900 acres of open space, 300 acres of parks, and 10 miles of trails. Collaboration, practicality, nimbleness, inventiveness and equity are City of Gresham values. Gresham is home to a nationally recognized wastewater treatment plant powered by renewable energy, an award-winning small business incentive program, and a model industrial development review process. In Gresham, families and businesses have a mutual drive to thrive - and together, we get things done.\n\n",
