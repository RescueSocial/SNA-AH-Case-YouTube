            "description": "Environmental Studies is a multidisciplinary undergraduate educational program at Tufts University. It was created in 1984 to promote the study of our natural surroundings, designs that help minimize degradation of those surroundings, and the social and political tools needed to preserve and improve the environment. The program provides training in social sciences, natural sciences, engineering, and humanities.\r\n\r\nIt is our belief that students studying environmental and sustainability issues must build the capacity to communicate sometimes complicated scientific information to a broad audience. Our faculty continually have made an effort to introduce our students to a range of media strategies, including film, photography, fine art, and writing. Here we have posted videos produced by our students in their coursework and through their internships. We hope to eventually post films produced by our alumni.",
