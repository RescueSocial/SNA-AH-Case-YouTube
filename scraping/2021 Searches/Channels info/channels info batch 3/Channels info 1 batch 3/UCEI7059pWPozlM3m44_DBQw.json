Working across five regions (Asia & the Pacific, Latin America & the Caribbean, Middle East & North Africa, and Sub-Saharan Africa, and the United States) alongside those most excluded or at-risk, our regional teams identify gaps, design solutions, provide guidance, and co-develop strategies that enable vulnerable communities to hold the powerful to account and stand up for lasting change. We then scale this work globally on a systems level, sharing what we learn with communities facing similar issues around the world, and bringing grassroots perspectives to technology companies and other influential stakeholders to be translated into policies and solutions.\n",
