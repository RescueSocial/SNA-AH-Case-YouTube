I\u2019m from the US but currently call Vietnam home. I\u2019ve been living in Asia for 10 years and started making food and travel videos to document my experiences. People either enjoyed my undeniable wit or enjoyed watching me eat interesting food like sea penis, and thus Best Ever Food Review Show came to be. \n\nBest Ever Food Review Show is the first food review show exploring the unique foods of each country with a fresh point of view and a punchy delivery, encouraging empathy and understanding of other cultures along the way. From the best street food to the most insane food markets to...well...yes, sea penis, nothing is off limits (except cucumbers. Cucumbers are off limits). \n\nI can\u2019t wait to see where this food journey takes us. Don\u2019t forget to subscribe, so we can connect through food and travel and become Bestys!",
