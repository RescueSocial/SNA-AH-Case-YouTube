       "@anna mitrovic yes the facts are she committed domestic violence & spent the night in jail!!!!! he didn't & there's zero proof he abused her she had two witnesses both biased he had over 40 witnesses i'm quite overqualified to speculate & nothing is clear i speculate that her actions from australia (thinks laws don't apply to her) to going public 2 days after the death of his mother to demanding $50000 a mo spousal support (withdrawing due to her attorney it looks bad) marrying a man when she is gay for fame & money (she is only been with men who could do something for her!) & there's only one reason she refused to give her deposition (even after the judge ordered it) & she did refuse to take him to court duh dropping the case even though she was forced to give the money to charityalthough she threw a fit & i don't know how much she gave/kept that's her actions spousal abuse on her part!!!! abusers do not marry abusers! they marry passive people they can manipulatethis is fact the clear evidence is nowhere! she made a tape of depp when he was upset (due to finding out his managers had stole millions) she sold the tape which shows her abusing depp she is been out all night she lies gaslights & baits him (abusive behavior) on the tape!!!! if you were a abused person or a psychologist or even had the common sense of a ant you would see he's not abusive in spite of being upset about having millions stolen and being married to a whore who stays out all night not bothering to call in he never faces her calls her a name or does anything remotely abusive he kicks a cabinet guess what? if he was abusive he would be hitting her!! abusers don't hurt themselves moron even with the baiting etc going on he never faces her the court ruled this inadmissible bc no abuse takes place despite her efforts this is a tape it's fact not my opinion i'm not a depp fan i'm a psychologist & advocate for dv victims! that's why i followed the case & am upset a abuser is ruining the #metoo movement it's so blatant if you understand abusive narcissistic people watch a video on real abuse & see a abuser hurting himself instead of the victimit doesn't happen #men are abused too she is textbook he's not her 1st victim when he sues the sun & all the evidence is in court it will be horrible for female victims! some nobody in hollywood already accused a man of abuse the press called his x wife thinking she made the allegations then the 2nd former wife both said he never hit themabusers start young like heard not in their 50's and women since his 1st wife lori allison from the 80's publicly defended depp of their own accord sherilyn fenn kate moss vanessa paradis (who called heard a liar & was with him 14 yrs prior to heard) this is well documented in all psychiatric journals dealing with abuse and no one addresses the fact she was arrested for dv & now is representing the people she terrorized!!!! men get abused too well documented by friends employee's and co workers on pirates and now jk rowling who you claim to have more info & be smarter than she is seen the documentation when you find a angry drunk abuser who never touches his victim i'll reconsider doesn't happen i've seen both male & female abusers personally as well as hundreds of cases as a psychologist & advocate probably since before you were born do you really think i would risk siding with a abuser? if i wasn't 100% sure? depp is no choir boy we are talking abuse maybe you think that but jk rowling as well?!?!?!    1\n",

that tape ended this trial he has to know that he's going to look like a buffoon when she testifies she loses her temper and goes off on verbal rampages everyone agrees that a man who endured domestic abuse was badly injured by her then accused of being the abuser by her while she went on a campaign to destroy his careerhas the right to vent to his friends on illegally obtained private text messages                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        1\n",
       "ms heard has decided to fabricate evidence and lie about mr depp abusing her evidence lots of it was exactly what she didn't have texts with her mom (she obviously didn't know the mother and her father had texted mr depp to explain why she lied about the abuse) certainly are not going to help verify her lies it is easy to determine if a text has been altered the sound of defeat in his voice when he realizes that the woman he still loves is going to lie about domestic abuse to destroy him is heartbreaking fortunately he no longer loves her when her evidence proves to be altered and in some cases fabricated that is jail time she sold this evidence for profit as for tmz they went public with the fact that they had bought evidence from amber heard i don't think io tillet wright and raquel pennington are going to want to go to jail with her when evidence proves to be fake the narcissist is going to blame them after all ms pennington was living rent free in one of mr depp's penthouses i can imagine the look on ms pennington's face when ms heard says it was all ms pennington's idea she didn't want to be homeless she tried to persuade ms heard to bluff the penthouses from mr depp(she did ask for them in her lawyers extortion letter) and of course io tillet wright had an affair with ms heard and wanted mr depp out of the picture she persuaded ms heard to falsely accuse mr depp so that she could have ms heard all to herself when faced with hard time watch them turn on each other who ever confesses first gets the plea deal with the prosecutor all my facts are in the public domain tmz has released the stories on youtube with links to the documentation

       "amber heard doesn't realize that her conflicting stories are going to be the evidence that puts her behind bars for a long time! conflicting stories indicate lies she can't remember the last lie she told so she makes up a new one the virginia defamation case will have a field day playing footage of the constantly changing stories real abuse victims tell simple fact filled accounts of what they enduredand they can recount their stories repeatedly without ever changing a detail i hope raquel pennington and the co conspirators love amber heard enough to do some serious jail time for hermr depp has all the evidence they don't even have a single story between them some of them must be getting cold feet as mr depp's lawyer pointed out that ms heard had to sue some of them to force them to testify on her behalf in the virginia trial

       "all they are doing is nailing their coffin shut with them inside it it leaves a trail that is so easy to follow and it will be of use in the virginia defamation case it just makes the fans angrier and more committed to justice this isn't the first lawyer that ms heard has persuaded to cross a legal line (the extortion letter) it would be lovely if ms kaplan was disbarred for harassment they can't prevent justice for mr depp but they can add some new charges against ms heard when she loses the defamation case! a judge fined kesha $374000 for a single tweet defaming dr luke without evidence i wonder what ms kaplan will have to pay for each fan she unjustly harasses?

       "@sonic970 i enjoy talking to you also i don't think that i qualify as a fan of mr depp (although i understand that he has many of them) i have never seen any of his films in a theatre and i have only seen fifteen of his ninety one movies i have impaired vision and cannot watch too many movies mr depp is not the reason that i am involved in this case

       "once again i find that *the facts* need some clarification amber heard applied for a *temporary* restraining order why the distinction? you do not need to provide evidence for a temporary restraining order and you do not need to inform the person that the protective order is against these emergency orders are almost always granted with a hearing before the judge within a few weeks in order to determine if the order was warranted ms heard is eager to triumphantly explain that she obtained a restraining order as if this is some type of proof that mr depp was abusive in fact when the evidence was provided (including the testimony of the domestic abuse trained lapd officers on behalf of mr depp) the judge *dismissed* amber heard's case *with prejudice* this means that he found the case to be egregiously flawed and without merit it also means that ms heard *cannot bring these charges against mr depp in thr future* i have noticed that ms heard has circulated the story that *she* dismissed the restraining order only a judge has the power to dismiss a restraining order amber heard was arrested for the domestic abuse of her partner tasya van ree in 2009 long before she met mr depp the assault was witnessed by the arresting officers and an international airport full of people officer beverly leonard in an interview clarified that ms van ree indicated to the officers that she wanted ms heard arrested ms heard was booked and spent the night in jail she was arraigned the next day she did not protest her innocence (an audio recording of the arraignment still exists) and the judge and prosecutor agreed that because both women lived out of state that they would hold the case open for a period of two years in case ms van ree decided to prosecute or ms heard reoffended it should be noted that ms heard attempted to have this arrest expunged from her record *after* she met mr depp when the press discovered it amber heard suborned *her victim* to release a *false statement* to exonerate her this is tasya van ree's statement to exonerate amber heard in 2009 amber was wrongfully accused for an incident that was misinterpreted and over sensationalized by two individuals in a powerful position i recount hints of misogynistic attitudes towards us which later appeared to be homophobic when they found out we were domestic partners and not just 'friends' charges were quickly dropped and she was released moments later she added it is disheartening that amber's integrity and story are being questioned yet again this statement clearly illustrates the culture of lies that ms heard immerses herself in ms heard was *not* wrongfully arrested the police observed ms heard assault ms van ree and tear a valuable piece of jewelry from her neck ms van ree indicated she wanted ms heard arrested amber heard did not protest her innocence officer beverly leonard is not misogynistic *or* homophobic as she is an openly gay woman who champions gay rights and donates her free time to working in domestic abuse shelters in officer leonard's own words she would *not* mistake grabbing someone's arm for a domestic assault charges *were not quickly dropped* and ms heard *was not released moments later* the charges remained open for *two years* and ms heard was booked spent the night in jail and was arraigned the following day as for ms heard's integrity and story being questioned *yet again* ms heard was desperate to keep this story out of the press i can find no mention of it in the media prior to 2015 the yet again is tacked on to reinforce how unjustly victimized ms heard has always been if ongoing litigation cost mr depp his roleand it should be noted that mr depp has *never* been arrested and has *never* been charged with domestic abusethen ms heard's arrest should disqualify her from any role she might play amber heard is a narcissist she lies in fact unless she provides irrefutable evidence it is safe to assume that she is always lying her friends lie without compunction to cover for her the british trial revealed that during amber heard's australian trial (for lying in official australian documents) she suborned the perjury of kevin murphy mr depp's estate manager by threatening his employment unless he take some of the responsibility for ms heard's actions mr murphy has been working with the australian authorities to change his testimony and australia is looking at prosecuting ms heard for this crime now that judge nicol has been exposed as having close ties to dan wooton and newsgroup as well as his wife's personal friendship with ms heard's lawyer there is little doubt that he should have recused himself from the trial *any* judge who is willing to dismiss the evidence of *four* specially trained in the field of domestic abuse los angeles police officers *for no reason other than their story goes against his chosen narrative* should be questioned as to his impartiality testimony is considered proof in court *if credible* amber heard was caught in so many lies she destroyed her plausibility it is time for justice to rely upon the evidence it is time to stop rewarding people for outrageous lies    1\n",

       "amber heard's own personal stylist samantha mcmillen will be testifying for mr depp ms mcmillen was with her the entire day preparing her for the late late show with james corden mcmillen said on december 16 2015 i spent much of the day and evening with amber heard preparing her to appear on the james corden show i saw her throughout the day of december 16 2015 in good light at close range wearing no makeup throughout the day of december 16 2015 i could see clearly that amber heard did not have any visible marks bruises cuts or injuries to any part of her face or any other part of her body she appeared as a guest on the james cordon show that day the professional stylist who worked with amber starting in 2014 continued after the show ms heard said to me 'can you believe i just did that show with two black eyes?' ms heard did not have any black eyes and had been visibly uninjured throughout the day and at that moment i later learned that ms heard had accused johnny depp in court filings and the media of violently abusing her the previous night december 15 2015 makeup can cover bruises but it cannot disguise swelling or a physical injury along with samantha mcmillen's testimony the video tape of the actual show including all the exaggerated faces ms heard made while on camera will make a lovely contradiction to the testimony of ms inglessis the testimony of both these women is critical in proving that the plan to frame mr depp in order to extort money from him was premeditated and involved multiple co conspirators melanie inglessis is now as guilty as amber heard and i'm sure that now she regrets becoming involved in ms heard's crimes as she is building a career for herself this will derail all of that i think that ms inglessis is not so much afraid for her safety as she is afraid for her freedom british courts frown upon committing perjury especially when it is involved with framing someone for a crime ms heard and her co conspirators may find themselves facing charges in britain after this trial as well as in the united states

would have to decide that her own judgement on the plea in bar was incorrect (that is her last decision where the judge explained each separate reason that the uk decision could not be applied to the virginia case) and then *grant* her this appeal judge azcarate isn't the type to doubt the decision she just made a week agoso ah is stalling and judge azcarate is dotting the is and crossing the ts

       "as a survivor i would like to point out that physical abusers don't enjoy *being* in painthey enjoy *you* being in pain i'm having some trouble with evan rachel wood repeating this single weird christmas scenario over and over he hurt *himself* with a razor blade a hundred and fifty times to be brutally honest that is why sadists seek out masochists as partners (it is the masochist or the submissive who is in control) exactly like amber heard all we are hearing is a collection of stories we need hospital records doctor's affidavits x rays police reportsevidence there is no evidence that manson's friendship has had anything to do with detrimental things happening in mr depp's life if anything they both seem to be men who are easy to manipulate and control and now we are proving the exact opposite of what ms heard is intending she is really grasping at straws if she thinks he has a friend who may have done something bad but no one knows for sure is going to win this case as for evan rachel wood she has been making these claims for a long time now and we haven't seen any evidence yet so i don't think that we are going to when all you have are your stories it is advisable (for your credibility and for the legal ramifications) not to name names i would still respect her if she had not named manson without evidence and now we watch his career burn just like johnny depp's and i feel nothing but disgust people never learn (i secretly hope that there is a video of ms wood somewhere when she embarked on her adventure with manson where she explains what drew her to him and his lifestyle her quotes from the time indicate that this was exactly what she desired) ms wood 2016 rolling stone i met someone who promised freedom and expression and no judgements and i was craving danger and excitement i looked at my mother one day and said 'mom i'm going to get on this tour bus for eight months and see the world and have a crazy journey and find myself and if people aren't ok with that i'm sorry but i can't live my life for other people' some people believe that if you use gorilla glue in your hair it is somehow the fault of the company that manufactures it *we* decide what *we* want to do *if* there is no person forcing us into decisions that we don't want then it falls under the category of *personal responsibility*

       "in 2016 amber heard requested an emergency restraining order which opened a domestic abuse case she sold her photos and story to the tabloids then dropped the case depriving mr depp the opportunity of defending himself the judge in the case evaluated ms heard's deposition and evidence list (she refused to submit her evidence for evaluation) and mr depp's evidence and dismissed the case with prejudice that means ms heard lost the domestic abuse case the judge found the case to be egregiously flawed and without merit and ms heard can never bring a domestic abuse case against mr depp again but ms heard just went right on talking until she talked herself into this lawsuit which will put her evidence against mr depp's formidable accumulation of evidence and then ms heard her

       "ms heard is looking at a much longer sentence than three years this case will provide evidence of 1: fabricating evidence and selling it for financial gain (the bruise photos sold to people magazine) 2: tampering with evidence and selling it for financial gain (the [discredited] text messages sold to people magazine) 3: manufacturing a heavily edited video of mr depp without his knowledge or consent and selling it to tmz for five figures (the video didn't show evidence of any crime) 4: tampering with witnesses (sworn affidavits and testimony that ms heard attempted to have the staff of the eastern columbia building change their story to favor ms heard in exchange for a story in people magazine) 5: domestic abuse causing bodily harm (doctor's signed affidavits and sworn testimony x rays showing the damage that could only have been caused by a large glass object impacting a solid surface with mr depp's hand caught in between and signed affidavits and sworn testimony that ms heard confessed to throwing the bottle that caused the injury on the day it occurred) 6: attempted extortion (the letter ms heard's lawyer sent mr depp with a list of her financial and property demands made a week before ms heard filed for the restraining order) 7: perjury in the domestic violence deposition 8: perjury in the divorce deposition 9: perjury in the defamation deposition 10: defamation causing loss of income and now we can add 11: false accusations of sexual assault 12: providing false evidence of sexual assault 13: perjury in the sexual assault deposition if ms heard had any evidence she would have submitted it to the court in 2016 in order to win the domestic assault case and leverage the huge settlement that she outlined in the extortion letter ms heard's case was dismissed by the judge with prejudice meaning that ms heard lost the domestic abuse case the judge found the case to be egregiously flawed and without merit and ms heard can never bring a domestic abuse case against mr depp in the future ms heard and her co conspirators are all looking at substantial jail time that must be the reason that ms heard has had to sue some of her friends and family to testify on her behalf it already appears that josh drew is co operating with mr depp's team and i wouldn't be surprised if more of ms heard's group decided that they don't want

       "in narcissistic abuse the abuser *always* claims to be the victim they will then accuse their victim of doing to them everything that they themselves did it is called gaslighting and it is a secondary form of abuse so what we have are two people claiming abuse it is not difficult to tell which is the abuser and which is the victim the narcissistic abuser compulsively lies they claim to be perfect don't drink or do drugs even if there is proof that they do they will also claim excessive abuse but will have suffered no injuries they won't have had to seek hospital treatment the abuser will have no physical evidence of abuse they will expect you to take their word for it the victim will admit to having flaws they will tell the same story of abuse repeatedly without the need to embellish it or change details they will have had hospital treatment for injuries they will possess physical evidence the victim is the one who hides and the abuser is the one desperately trying to find them banging on the doors of rooms where their victim has retreated from the abuse the victim leaves at the first sign of violence the narcissistic abuser will name call belittle and berate them for leaving the victim never taunts the abuser because that will escalate the violence the abuser tries to make the victim feel as if it is all their fault they will isolate their victim from their friends and surround their victim with their own friends often persuade the victim to take medication the narcissistic abuser always believes that they are the smartest person in the room that is their downfall eventually their ridiculous claims of beatings and injuries will spiral out of control they will be claiming injuries severe enough to maim or kill but they will have treated it themselves and have completely recovered there is a reason that prisons are filled with narcissists they believe that they can get away with anything they have great disdain for law enforcement they always get caught

       "maybe was the primary abuser! all i ask meaww is one single verified piece of evidence that johnny depp ever abused his wife i can ask that with complete confidence because of the lawsuit that ms heard created by requesting a restraining order against mr depp california law as you know permits a judge to issue an emergency restraining order with no evidence but the evidence must be submitted to the court within about two weeks  ms heard sold her story and her pictures and her texts to the tabloid media for them to print and destroy mr depp's reputationbutms heard dropped the case before mr depp could clear his name with the evidence he had already submitted all the judge had was ms heard's deposition (and it only took 3 tries to get that) and her evidence list weighing her lies and contradictions against mr depp's actual evidence the judge dismissed the case with prejudice that meansamber heard lost the domestic assault caseand the judge found her case to be egregiously flawed and without merit as a result of this type of dismissal ms heard can never bring domestic abuse charges against mr depp again  so unless meaww has unseen evidence that mr depp abused ms heard there is no primary abuser and secondary abuser there is one and only one abuser and her name is amber heard all this information is in the public domain where your researchers could find it tmz has links to legal documents on their site youtube channel incredibly average has videos of the depositions legal documents floor plans police reports and photos this was not a big secret it was news so why did everyone buy amber heard's lies? why knowing what they now know do they still buy amber heard's lies? the truth isshe lies!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           1\n",

daniel richtman *doesn't know what he is talking about!* so far he has reliably informed us that ah is going to star in: margot robbie's pirates of the caribbean spinoff the fantastic four (as sue storm) an unnamed disney princess (i'll name her for them) the star wars franchise a solo mera series a drive angry sequel the fast and the furious (vin diesel desperately wants her) the harry potter franchise (because mr depp's good friend j k rowling suddenly loves her) marvel is seriously considering her for an mcu role netflix is developing a new movie for ah and brie larson a new film with zack snyder and one of my personal favorites we got this covered reported that jason momoa's aquaman was going to be *killed* in the zack snyder's cut of justice league and mera was going to replace

a reputable source and they have logical reasons to back up the claim that amber heard has been removed from aquaman 2 they may start shooting while these defamation cases are still being tried they are not going to postpone shooting this movie umberto gonzalez doesn't have a great track record of accuracy and he gives absolutely no reasons for his belief (perhaps ms heard has made it worth his while?) that ms heard has not been fired since her presence clearly will impact the profits from this film they have the legal right to release her from her contract without payment samurai136 is obviously a child domestic dispute that's so cute i love how samurai136 attempts to minimize what ms heard has done there are many jobs that would terminate your employment because of domestic abuse you see domestic abuse is a crime lawyers politicians athletes judges ministers ceo's of large corporations have all been terminated because of domestic violence ms heard's issues with mr depp stop her from playing mera because she has broken some serious laws and must now go to jail to pay her debt to society  anyone else find it amusing that samurai136 states as long as she hasn't killed anyone hurt any children or made any racist remarks publiclywell her best friend died in a car accident when she was sixteen and although her records are sealed (as she was a minor) she was given a driving ban until she was twenty one so you can decide about killing someone she hurt lily rose depp and caused her considerable harm when she and her bf io tillett wright conspired to out the child when she was only fifteen lily rose depp had to spend the next few years giving interviews to correct the misinformation they had releasedand didn't you hear the backlash to her racist and insensitive tweet just heard there's an ice checkpoint in hollywood a few blocks from where i live everyone had better give their housekeepers nannies and landscapers a drive home tonight she later had to delete the tweet someone has an agenda alrightsamurai136 i have a crush on amber heard so nobody can do anything mean to her sorry but she is going to jail oh and elon musk there are multiple eyewitnesses who have given sworn statements about the nights you spent with amber heard so don't perjure yourself for ms heard because she made it apparent in those released texts that she never cared about you when carino wrote you weren't in love with him and you told me a thousand times you were just filling space and ms heard replied i know

the main thing that should reverse the verdict in the uk trial is the undisclosed connections between judge nicol and the defendants in this case and judge nicol's decision to base a critically important verdict on his feelings *over the evidence!* we do not rely on the law for feelings we rely on the law to give us just verdicts based on the *facts!* in this case the facts are the corrupt judge nicol decided his son's job was more important than johnny depp's reputation and ability to make a living and of course amber heard gave her entire settlement of seven million dollars to charity so she couldn't be a gold digger if *this* is judge nicole at his best they had better review his last fifty cases to see how many of them he completely botched (start with the ones that he had a personal interest in)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    1\n",
       "in california making a public statement (like amber heard) that you are donating money to charity is a legally binding contract making a press release (like amber heard) that you are donating money to charity is a legally binding contract so is making a press release that you have *completed giving the money to charity* (like amber heard)! she could be sued to produce the funds that she promised nothing will repair her credibility she committed *perjury* in order to persuade a very *gullible judge andrew nicol * who has a complete *disregard for the law* and a *contempt for justice* that she wasn't a gold digger when that is *exactly* what she is judge andrew nicol pretends he has significant knowledge of domestic abuse but he proved to be just another mockery of a man fooled by amber heard the letter from the los angeles children's hospital asking if she ever intends to donate more of what she promised to them and her attempt to have them *return* the funds that mr depp donated in her name tells you everything that you need to know about ms heard she sent press releases to the mainstream media in 2017 confirming she had donated all of the money and they printed it without checking helping ms heard to destroy a mans career because she wanted to now they are all ms heard's fools!

       "i think a few points should be clarified before amber heard met johnny depp in 2009 at the seattle/tacoma international airport she was arrested for publicly assaulting her then domestic partner tasya van ree ms van ree did not protest the arrest she did not post bail leaving ms heard to spend the night in jail and she did not appear before the judge at the arraignment the next day the judge admonished ms heard which she did not protest and because the women lived in another state chose to leave the case open for two years in case ms heard re offended this alone is the reason ms heard can not be a domestic violence advocate (how many women do you know have been arrested for domestic assault?) ms heard sold her evidence to the tabloidsthen refused to submit this evidence to the court for testing and verification she dropped her allegations before the divorce was settled ms heard agreed to the minimum amount that california's no fault divorce law allows domestic abuse charities all refused ms heard's money it was donated on her behalf to the children's hospital of los angeles (where it has been incorrectly stated she actively volunteered) and the government charity the american civil liberties union mr depp waited until ms heard created a legal avenue for him to present his evidence x rays doctor reports police reports signed affidavits videos photos recordings text messages (including from her parents) witnesses and her police record have all been submitted to the court for testing it has been reported that mr depp would not submit his doctor records of drug use that is incorrect he hasit is ms heard that hasn't every past partner has come out in support of mr depp lori allison sherilyn fenn winona ryder kate moss and vanessa paradis in the newest tape released today ms heard taunts mr depp with the fact that she is a slender woman and no one will believe him that she abused him ms heard has been controlling the narrative and yes you should feel manipulated all this information is in the public domain tmz has released a series of youtube video's with links to all the documents for the record it was people magazine that paid ms heard and published unverified evidence of mr depp's alleged abusecompletely destroying his reputation

       "@kike heeb chink jigaboo but to you who are listening i say: love your enemies do good to those who hate you bless those who curse you pray for those who mistreat you if someone slaps you on one cheek turn to them the other also if someone takes your coat do not withhold your shirt from them give to everyone who asks you and if anyone takes what belongs to you do not demand it back do to others as you would have them do to you luke 6: 27 31 these are the most difficult words that christ speaks in the christian bible but it is what christians are required to do it is better to say i don't care about anyone but myself and my own than to use the christian faith as a reason to allow evil to exist in the world

       "i'm sorry for your loss first of of all now it's a pity you didn't catch this before posting this because during the trial that ended on tuesday depp's lawyers had the full footage of this and it continues (it wasn't released but described what was played in court) the phone falls down heard picks it up johnny is obviously upset she is been filming him and apparently she is then seen smiling/smirking and looking pleased with herself the internet version of it was cut at such a point it makes you think he beat her up after he saw her filming him yet the longer un aired version shows that that's not true also johnny said in court he's not entirely sure when it was taken but he thinks it was filmed when he found out he had lost 650 million dollars (i use the word lost but i believe it was basically stolen from him by his former managers) i'd say any human would be angry about this                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            1\n",
       "i think if you were to perhaps to do a follow up or just for your information he also mentions it in gq interview 2018 but more importantly i believe his mother had some sort of mental illness i don't want to be wrong here but i do believe he said in the past that they used to very poor once he started making more money he got her proper medical help and things got better and it is also alluded in the court documents/evidence that amber has been treated and i think that's more why he stayed longer of course she was manipulative so he stayed for more reasons but i think because he saw that with proper help his mother got better and their relationship improved he probably believed the same could happen with amber that is imo why he would stay despite the physical attacks because he would probably in his mind think it's not her fault that she just needed help of course there is a difference because his mother couldn't afford help amber had all the means to get help and didn't work on herself the way she should have plus she is just a shitty person on top of it so with her it just wouldn't work but he could have thought it would i'm not saying that as facts but it is i think a theory that could be right    1\n",

       "hey there some audio you will know in this and upcoming videos since i'm going through it all some you may not the court dropped a lot into the public sphere hours of it so i'm working on cleaning it up amplifying it and hopefully documenting the entirety i'll add it in videos and also into a playlist to help people find all the evidence attached to the trial in the video i also said two hours but that wasn't correct for all of it its two hours on this specific set of recordings there's more and i'm looking at potentially converting it all here so its all compiled and easily found the reason is because the media gave you snippets they took tiny pieces and they called that complete they left out the pots and pans they left out the abuse they left out the the lies the manipulation and a lot more all of this also belongs to two trials and will not only be in the depp/sun trial but also in the depp/heard 2021 trial plus heard mentioned another 50/51 audio tapes that the court hasn't seen so there's a lot more i'm assuming we haven't seen there's also all the testimony that isn't carried over into videos the ah declarations all 7 of them the depp ones all three of them and on and oni'm not sure how much of that i can put into these since they are so long but we'll see    1\n",
