       "if ms heard had been smart she would have demanded a pre nup i know that is counter intuitive but mr depp was madly in love with ms heard at that time he is notoriously generous he would have given her more than she asked for  when ms paradis and mr depp split they didn't have a pre nup (she is independently wealthy herself from a successful career and her family's wealth) and mr depp gave her anything that she wanted and he split his fortune down the middle and gave her half  even if ms heard had gone with a quiet dignified divorce mr depp would have given her all that she asked for and would still be using his clout (because she wouldn't have destroyed it) to get her the best roles that he could find texts just released from about a month into the divorce show mr depp was still in love with her good thing they kept the evidence from himor she might have persuaded him to destroy it!

assure him that they know the allegations are false that ms heard's lawyer made her claim abuse mrs heard asks if she can adopt mr depp so that they will always be family they both separately tell mr depp that they will always love him thenthey both ask him not to let ms heard know that they texted him mr heard says that she told him if he spoke to johnny again that she would never speak to him again they ask mr depp to delete the texts these texts are part of the evidence they are available in their entirety on youtube channel incredibly average along with other court documents nothing about ms heard's family is normal

       "all the media stories stem from one story written by emily smith editor of the tabloid page six and she owes her career to the sun they gave ms smith her first jobas editor of the sun us unbiased and unprejudiced media? i don't think so not one story that i've read discloses that emily smith is a shill for the sun the very company that depp is suing! they read them out in court even though they are unverified this was the best evidence they got from 70000 text messages                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            1\n",
       "i am a survivor of narcissistic abuse you have to understand the narcissist they do not present themselves as they are they mirror the person they want reflecting the same interests values thoughts and personality traits they are masters of hiding who they really arefor unbelievably long periods of time they love bomb you shower you with attention with interest with support with giftsuntil you suddenly realize that they have gradually replaced everyone in your life they are abusers they want to cut you off from your friends and family so that you will have no support no back up but them then they trap marriage usually after that they can reveal themselves this is the part that they enjoy the most make everything your fault persuade you that you are crazy gradually let the violence out promise to never do it again become violent again blame you for making them violent mr depp had never met anyone like amber heard he was at a vulnerable age and was quite frankly a bit innocent she saw the weakness and knew exactly how to exploit it when mr depp says i loved you for so many years but you didn't exist you don't exist you are not there you were a made up thing in my head that is the actual moment that mr depp realized that the person that he loved was not real it was all an act she never loved him narcissists are not capable of love it was just a game for fame and money as much as he loved her she was capable of completely destroying him to get as much as she could financially and because to a narcissist destroying people is fun if there are people in your life that you trust be it friends or family always listen if they tell you that something is off about a new person it will save you from a whole world of hurt may your life be filled with every

have you slammed a door? does that make you guilty of abuse? absolutely not california law requires that the police must arrest a documented abuser even if the partner does not want to press charges that is why the lapd had to enter the penthouse and check it and ms heard for signs of violence they found none if the tape had documented abuse mr depp would have been arrested that is the law                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           1\n",
       "if you are doing jail time it's difficult to make movies ms heard opted not to have her evidence examined but to drop her allegations of abuse instead they were dismissed with prejudice which

court along with the police reports the lapd officers who are his witnesses along with the many professionals testifying for him ms heard already has multiple arrests including one for domestic abuse

       "i so agree! although ms heard dropped her allegations of abuse rather than submit her evidence to the court for verification and the case was dismissed with prejudice (she can never accuse mr depp of abuse in court again) ms heard has constantly grandstanded as a victim of domestic abuse in an attempt to destroy mr depp's ability to work ms heard has only been in a domestic relationship twice and in her relationship with taysa van ree it was ms heard who was arrested for domestic abuse mr depp has never been arrested or charged with da he should not find himself the victim of petitions to remove him from movies as he did with fantastic beasts how do you legally defend yourself when you have never been accused legally ms heard sold her unverified evidence to the tabloids to destroy mr depp and a lot of people fell for it!

       "@me not mr depp can not go to jail for domestic abuse because the judge after reviewing ms heard's evidence and the evidence provided by mr depp dismissed ms heard's case stemming from her *temporary* restraining order *with prejudice* in 2016 just before the divorce the exact meaning of this verdict is that the judge found ms heard's case to be egregiously flawed and without merit and the result of this verdict is that ms heard can never bring these charges against mr depp anytime in the future the documentation is now available in the public domain in the california court system for you to verify this dismissal verdict the recent acknowledgement by the united kingdom high court that ms heard lied to the judge that she committed perjury during the trial that she failed to donate her divorce settlement to charity and that she failed to disclose all evidence in the case is a substantial blow to the case in virginia the fact that kevin murphy is in the process of reversing his testimony in the australian dog smuggling case and the australian high court intends to open a case against ms heard for suborning perjury under the threat of being fired which carries a thirteen year jail term (three years more than smuggling in her dogs would have carried) and that making a public statement that you are donating money to a charity is considered a legally binding contract in the state of california as is giving interviews that state that the donation was completed (and issuing press releases that the donation was completed) it appears that ms heard will be spending a great deal more time in court kate james may also decide to sue ms heard for appropriating her sexual abuse story (which was well documented at the time it occurred in police reports) these are the already pending cases after the virginia court weighs mr depp's evidence and it should be noted that american courts don't dismiss the police reports of two separate sets of specially trained domestic abuse police officers as well as ample physical and testimonial evidence in favor of stories with no evidence of any kind to substantiate them ms heard is facing potentially an entirely new set of charges stemming from attempted extortion suborning perjury and the fabrication of evidence even if mr depp lost the defamation case as unlikely as that may be he is still not facing any jail time you should also take care in the language you use to harass the survivors of narcissistic abuse who support mr depp as every comment is being reported and recorded in a central account to be used as evidence against ms heard for encouraging her fans to antagonize and threaten anyone who supports mr depp

       "@last emperor how delightful to hear from you i had a suspicion that you would leave comments on every pro depp comment in this thread i find the psychopathy of obsessive fandom very interesting i had no idea that you were so personally involved in this case you would be of much more assistance to ms heard if you were willing to take the stand to testify on her behalf because although you *know* that ms heard was attacked no less than twelve times as of this moment she has no viable evidence that she was ever attacked i state with confidence that the incident involving broken glass alcohol bottles would have resulted in a hospitalization of no less than three weeks i have unfortunate experience with such injuries the paramedics arriving with the ambulance would have medicated the subject with narcotic painkiller the injuries would have chemical burns from introduction of alcohol and contaminants into them a team could have removed the glass and contaminants over a period of about eight hours using x rays to locate the glass shards which covered the patients entire back and the bottoms of both feet then the injuries would have to be closed using staples stitches tape or adhesive depending on the size and depth of each cut glass bottles produce very jagged cuts so infection is always a concern the patient would require a tetanus shot and a full course of antibiotics the high risk of infection would result in the length of the hospitalization a professional would be required to change the dressings and monitor the wounds the patient could not do this themselves as the injuries on the back and soles of feet would not be accessible and the pain would require sustained amounts of painkiller the injuries could not be exposed to the sun for a period of a year as the scar tissue has a tendency to pigment after a year the reconstructive surgery could begin minimizing ripples and reducing the scars to fine lines unfortunately there is no record of any of this a single report of an x ray would go a long way to prove abuse in the united states the upcoming trial will be very different from the british trial as ms heard will be the defendant in this case opinions will not matter only verifiable evidence will be admitted

       "@christina taft i'm sorry but you have confused me with someone else i have never been charged with any crime and never been arrested my work requires that i have police checks regularly i am a survivor of narcissistic abuse and now counsel young people facing narcissistic abuse and it's resulting trauma at the time ms heard left highschool in texas she was arrested for a crime that resulted in a five year driving ban there is no crime in my country that can result in such a prolonged ban therefore the crime must be singular the arrest record is sealed but is archived and may be one of the arrest records that ms heard has been ordered to produce for the virginia defamation trial we are aware of the existence of this sealed arrest because ms heard was arrested in california for driving while her license was revoked in 2009 in the seattle/tacoma international airport ms heard was arrested for the domestic assault of her wife tasya van ree (at the time ms heard had changed her name to amber van ree) the assault was witnessed by the two arresting officers and an airport full of people ms van ree had a valuable piece of jewelry ripped from her neck during the assault the officers queried ms van ree if she wanted ms heard arrested and she responded in the affirmative ms heard was taken to the police station for booking and spent the night in jail she was arraigned the following day (an audio recording of the arraignment survives and is accessible if you desire to listen to it) the judge and the prosecutor noted that both women lived out of state and for that reason opted to hold the case open for a period of two years on the chance that ms heard would reoffend or that tasya van ree would decide to prosecute ms heard when ms heard met mr depp she attempted to have this arrest expunged from her record when the press discovered the arrest ms heard suborned *the victim of the assault* tasya van ree to release a statement that would clear her name if a *man* had assaulted a *woman* and then contacted the *victim* of the assault to write a statement *to clear his name* the #metoo movement would have erupted in *outrage* this is the statement of tasya van ree: in 2009 amber was wrongfully accused for an incident that was misinterpreted and over sensationalized by two individuals in a power position i recount hints of misogynistic attitudes towards us which later appeared to be homophobic when they found out we were domestic partners and not just 'friends' charges were quickly dropped and she was released moments later she added it is disheartening that amber's integrity and story are being questioned yet again this statement contained so many lies that the arresting officer officer beverly leonard agreed to give an interview correcting the mistakes ms van ree made the official declaration submitted to the court indicated ms van ree called the police to have amber heard arrested officer beverly leonard is an openly gay woman and gay rights advocate who donates her time to domestic abuse shelters she found the description of her as misogynistic and homophobic to be amusing and inaccurate the charges were *not* quickly dropped and ms heard was *not* released moments later as tasya van ree did not provide bail for ms heard and she was forced to spend the night in jail even ms van ree's final statement amber's integrity and story are being questioned *yet again* is worded to make ms heard appear a victim ms heard went to great lengths to make sure this arrest story did not become public knowledge i can not find any record of it being reported before the depp/heard divorcewhich is when ms van ree wrote this storytherefore ms heard's credibility was *never* questioned ms heard's other arrests were not for physical altercations but i do find the australia case particularly distasteful ms heard pleaded guilty to falsifying official documentation to australian immigration to smuggle her two tea cup yorkies into the country *knowing* the dogs would be euthanized if they were caught all animals must be quarantined before being admitted into australia because rabies does not exist on that continent the only test that is conclusive for rabies requires the dissection of the animals brain it was revealed during the british trial that ms heard had suborned perjury from estate manager kevin murphy threatening to have him fired mr murphy began proceedings to change his testimony when mr depp and ms heard divorced he has documentation that proves he repeatedly told ms heard what the consequences would be if she smuggled the dogs into the country it was cruel to endanger those two small innocent pets ms heard has some other arrests that will be exposed during the virginia trial as the judge has ruled her previous arrests are necessary to the case we may learn of other incidents but the abuse arrest is definitely pertinent in this case as a narcissistic abuser will have a history of abuse and will continue to abuse this is part of the disorder all of this information is in the open domain you can google any of the key words and legal documents news stories and other sources will be available to you if you have trouble finding anything leave a comment and i will direct you to my sources    1\n",
       "@last emperor how eloquent you are your extensive education and experience are put beautifully on display you are truly the finest example of an amber heard fan that i have had the pleasure to encounter i am conversely not interested in any of the personalities involved in this case i am a narcissistic abuse survivor and counsellor heavily concerned with the litigations of such crimes it is sadly not unusual to see crimes of this sort mishandled by the court systems all over the world fortunately where the law may fail us behavioral science always delivers justice in the end you have nothing to fear from this outcome as you have so succinctly illustrated your belief that amber heard is not a narcissist (although she does have that diagnosed disorder) narcissists are absolutely incapable of changing their pattern of behavior a narcissistic abuser will have abused in their past and most importantly they will abuse again in their future it is only a matter of time before the truth will be irrevocably established incidentally the virginia court ruled today to allow amber heard's prior arrest for the domestic assault of her wife tasya van ree in 2009 witnessed by two arresting police officers (and an international airport full of people) and held open for a period of two years from the arraignment

       "@hi wall amber heard even accused the police of lying in their reports (tmz amber heard: cops are lying they saw me bruised and battered 6/1/2016) but the fact that there were two witnesses that night and two 911 calls resulting in two sets of two police officers who both examined all of the apartments for signs of an altercation and for marks bruises or injuries on ms heardi think her lawyer advised against it it was a complex case ms heard had set it up so that she didn't call the police despite telling the press that she had she never filed a police report at the time i believe that they had little evidence against her other than her deposition raquel pennington was clever enough to say she never actually witnessed any abuse in her deposition #metoo was all over the news at that time the judge dismissed the case with prejudice and that should have ended it now ms heard will have to testify in court in the virginia defamation case her co conspirators will also have to testify that testimony along with every story every video and every speech that ms heard has given will provide ample evidence mr depp's lawyer has subpoenaed every text message every recording every

incident to the court with the condition that only the judge and the lawyers could see it because it could harm her reputation) but ms heard being a narcissist had to keep forcing the issue after the

       "a lot of people lose parents in their teens thirty four is youngbut not that young ms heard herself is responsible for the divorce and the airing of dirty laundry if she hadn't courted constant publicity and sold herself as the spokesperson for domestic abuse victims mr depp would not have had to sue her to clear his name in the recordings he begs her to settle quietly if ms heard had not been so obsessed with hurting mr depp's career and personal life she wouldn't have been fired the blame for all of this can be laid squarely at amber heard's feetandas she is a narcissist intentional suicide is very unlikely they threaten they even pretend but they are the center of their universe the only person who counts i would be more concerned that she would take one of the guns that she brags about owning and be gunning for mr depp because even though he tried to divorce privately and move on ms heard is going to blame all of this on him
