       "@mose jon sorry i wasn't ignoring you i just got caught up in some work yes rdj was a child star whose father gave him recreational drugs from the age of six after many years of drug and alcohol abuse he managed to turn his life around but it was mel gibson's paying to insure him that allowed him to act again once you become involved with the legal system cast insurance becomes exorbitantly expensive or simply unavailable ah's first arrest took place when she was sixteen and that mug shot is available online she was banned from driving for six years which is so severe it must have been the result of a felony arrest but ah was arrested again driving while banned the arrest record is available online 2009 would be her next arrest for the domestic assault of her wife tasya van ree at the time amber had changed her last name to van ree to match her wife the assault took place in front of the arresting officers in the seattle/tacoma international airport and culminated with amber tearing the necklace from tasya's neck officer beverly leonard was the arresting officer and although ah would attempt to blame the arrest on misogynistic and homophobic police officers officer leonard is an openly gay woman who volunteers at domestic violence shelters and would not mistake grabbing someone's arm for assault the officers arrested ah at the request of tasya van ree ah was booked and had her mugshot taken again and spent the night in jail (as tasya didn't bail her out) she was arraigned the next day where she did not protest her arrest and because both women lived out of state the judge and the prosecutor decided to keep the arrest open for a period of two years in case ah reoffended there is a recording of the arraignment available online when ah met johnny depp she immediately changed her last name back to heard and applied to expunge the record of her arrest ah was arrested next in 2015 for smuggling her dogs into australia she was aware that the dogs would be euthanized when discovered but didn't want to wait for them to pass the quarantine period ah would plead guilty to the charges and mr depp would pay a very large fine to secure her release but in the uk trial it was exposed that ah had suborned perjury to lessen the severity of the charges against her australia has reopened the case and is working with the american fbi to investigate the new charges when mr depp informed ah that he intended to file for divorce in 2016 she immediately filed first and had her lawyer samantha spector send mr depp a list of demands including $50000 per month support payments the range rover (with mr depp covering all costs) three of the five eastern columbia building penthouse apartments reportedly worth thirteen million dollars (with mr depp to continue paying utilities and fees) $100000 lawyer fees $25000 forensic accounting fees and an undisclosed divorce settlement rumored to be thirty million dollars to be payed within three days or ah would go public with accusations of domestic abuse (this letter is available online) mr depp refused and ah went to obtain a temporary restraining order after ah sold an illegally made video to tmz mr depp had the leverage to force her to accept the minimum divorce payment allowed by california's no fault divorce laws she publicly stated that she was giving her entire settlement to charity in california that constitutes a legally binding contract ah dropped her temproary restraining order and the judge *dismissed it with prejudice* meaning he found her allegations to be egregiously flawed and without merit and ah *can never bring these charges against mr depp in the future* both parties signed a non disclosure agreement ah continued to promote herself as a victim of abuse although mr depp has never been arrested or charged her op ed broke the non disclosure agreement which led to the defamation case ah's involvement as a witness in the uk trial against the sun resulted in her making some serious accusations against the lapd whom ah accused of lying ah's lawyer requested the bodycam footage of the night in question and it was recently provided but it shows that the police were telling the truth and that ah and her co conspirators had committed perjury the lapd has opened a subsequent investigation of ah and her co conspirators these are the reasons that it will be difficult for ah to get cast insurance for aquaman 2 the defamation trial will be ongoing until next year and will likely result in more criminal charges being brought against ah and australia and the lapd both have open felony investigations concerning her

       "what is truly disturbing is that before johnny depp in 2009 amber heard was arrested for the domestic assault of her partner tasya van ree at the seattle/tacoma international airport ms van ree did not protest the arrest she let ms heard sit overnight in jail she did not attend ms heard's arraignment the next day the judge left the case open for two years in case ms heard repeated the offence when ms heard met johnny depp she had her record expunged she thought there was no more evidencebut airports have to keep a set of records of crimes committed on site when tmz uncovered the arrest ms heard had ms van ree release a statement that the police officers were homophobic and exaggerated the assault tmz interviewed the arresting officer she was an openly gay women who volunteered at domestic abuse shelters and did not confuse grabbing her arm with domestic abuse can you imagine if a man arrested for domestic assault contacted his victim to make them release a statement exonerating them how the feminists would react? these were facts when amber heard was allowed to speak for abused women and l'oreal hired her as an ambassador for their company i guess it is alright if a woman assaults another woman if you want more information tmz has released youtube videos of these events                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           1\n",
       "the first piece of evidence amber heard tampered with was a collection of text messages with mr depp's assistant she was unaware that texts have to be matched to the phone that was texting as well as the carrier we already have a group of discredited text messages that ms heard supplied mr depp's assistant provided his phone to prove they had been tampered with ms heard refused to provide her phone in that instance since there has been no reporting of mr bettany being subpoenaed or showing up in court today i think that it is safe to assume more of ms heard's smoke and mirror tactics

       "io tillett wright is bluffingwhy would they have allowed a judge to dismiss the domestic abuse allegations with prejudice while hiding evidence that could convict mr depp? that would be concealing evidence which is a crime so tillett wright is saying he and ms heard obstructed justice to save evidence for a trial that would happen four years laterthat they didn't know about that sounds likely i was going to email you when i first saw this news breakbut as twitter was abuzz about being excited for your upcoming video about roberta kaplan jumping ship i knew that your twitter followers had you covered!

       "in 2009 amber heard (who had changed her last name to van ree) was arrested for the domestic assault of her partner tasya van ree in the seattle/tacoma international airport tasya van ree not only *did not protest* the arrest the police officers noted that *she requested it* during the assault ms heard ripped a valuable necklace from ms van ree's neck ms van ree did not make bail so ms heard spent the night in jail ms heard was arraigned the next day (a recording of her before the judge survives) she did not protest the arrest nor did ms van ree make a statement to support her the judge kept the case open for a period of two years on the chance that ms heard committed another domestic assault or ms van ree decided to prosecute when ms heard met mr depp she quickly changed her name back to heard and expunged her record she thought no one would ever know about the arrest but airports must keep records of arrests made on site  when the press discovered this arrest ms heard went to ms van ree and had her lie releasing the statement in 2009 amber was wrongfully accused for an incident that was misinterpreted and over sensationalized by two individuals in a power position i recount hints of misogynistic attitudes towards us which later appeared to be homophobic when they found out we were domestic partners and not just 'friends' charges were quickly dropped and she was released moments later if ms heard had been wrongfully accused why did ms van ree not protest the arrest? why did she request ms heard being charged? why didn't ms heard protest the arrest? the arresting officer beverly leonard is an openly gay woman and gay rights activist who volunteers at domestic abuse shelters is neither misogynistic or homophobic and can discern between grabbing someone's arm and domestic assault charges were *not* quickly dropped and ms heard was *not* released moments later how well would it have been accepted if a *man* arrested for domestic assault went to the *woman he assaulted* to have her make a statement to clear him and that statement was full of such easily proven lies? since domestic abusers have a history of domestic abuse ms heard's history and the lies that she tried to use to cover it up are most certainly relevant in the australia dog smuggling case mr depp's estate manager in australia london and vancouver kevin murphy testified for ms heard stating that she was not aware of australia's quarantine lawsbut mr murphy has been working with the australia authorities to change his testimony at the sun defamation trial mr murphy testified that ms heard had suborned him to commit perjury in her behalf on the threat of losing his employment subornation of perjury is considered the same crime as committing perjury this is the crime that australia is in the process of bringing against ms heard along with a re evaluation of the dog smuggling case because subornation of perjury is also under consideration in the virginia defamation case it would also be relevant interestingly the homeland security letter concerning savannah mcmillan is also perjury it will be difficult for a jury to believe someone who commits perjury so often and with so little consideration my very favorite fact is that publicly pledging that you are giving a sum of money to a charity constitutes an enforceable contract in the state of california california civil code was amended to ensure people would not pledge money for the publicity and then renege on the donation it has become a legal matter now so receipts will have to be produced ms heard may face charges stemming from this fraud as well! you should note that *no* domestic abuse charity in california accepted any money from ms heard the la children's hospital is not associated with domestic abuse and the american civil liberties union is a non profit organization founded to defend and preserve the individual rights and liberties guaranteed to every person in this country by the constitution and laws of the united states every domestic abuse charity in california was individually written to by a prominent medical specialist (who sits on almost every domestic abuse organization's board of directors) asking them to refuse any donations from amber heard citing the proof that they had that she was not a victim of domestic violence and defining the damage that her case had caused the domestic abuse community as amber heard is asking for all records concerning mr depp's arrests from over twenty years ago not to mention that she wants a record of all gifts mr depp made to women he knew over the past ten yearsi don't think that the judge is going to be in the mood to grant ms heard's motions there are viable reason's to admit the evidence in question (whereas i can't think of a reason mr depp's gifts would have any bearing on the case)at this point ms heard and her team are desperate the judge will be ending her requests to compel discovery of documents that don't exist it is a strategy to make it appear as if the plaintiff is not co operatingbut the court is not easily manipulated in this manner the evidence against ms heard continues to build and her stories of abuse that have no evidence supporting them have now been embellished to the point of absurdity this narcissist's time is running out    1\n",
       "in 2016 amber heard asked the court for a restraining order citing domestic violence she sold her story and evidence to the tabloid media for them to publish and destroy mr depp's reputation she gave her deposition but instead of turning her evidence over to the court she dropped the case depriving mr depp of his chance to submit his evidence and clear his name the judge had ms heard's deposition and an evidence list of what she was going to submit and mr depp's actual evidence the judge then dismissed this case with prejudice meaning ms heard lost the domestic violence case the judge deemed the case that she presented was egregiously flawed and without merit and ms heard can never bring the charge of domestic violence against mr depp again after waiting four years ms heard has presented mr depp with a legal avenue to force her into court with her evidence to be weighed against his evidence what is surreal is that mr depp was canceled by the media when no verified evidence was provided ms heard repeatedly elevated her status as domestic abuse advocate when she had proven nothing and had a prior arrest for the domestic assault of her ex partner tasya van ree now that the courts are going to step in and justice will finally be done how will the media erase what they have done to mr depp for the last four years mr depp has never been arrested for domestic violence mr depp has never been charged with domestic violence mr depp has evidence that he is the victim of domestic violence we are sorry is not going to be enough they have not covered this story because they were making money from it and they didn't want the truth to come out and spoil their profitable misrepresentation of the truth what is to stop the media from doing this exact thing again?

       "et canada seems to be spreading the *false narrative* that there is such a thing as mutual abuse any expert in the field will explain why this cannot ever be the case in domestic abuse (which in case et canada hasn't done *any* research is what amber heard is claiming) the lie of mutual abuse was created by abusers to absolve themselves of responsibility and guilt domestic abuse centers on *one* person establishing *complete control* over the other by using isolation mental abuse and physical violence it is not possible for both parties to have control et canada was wrong in supporting amber heard without any evidence and you should just admit it she has not donated a penny the initial donations were made by johnny depp in her name she attempted to get the children's hospital of los angeles to return the initial donation to her she claimed she needed the money for her lawyers but the recent court documents prove she *isn't* paying for her lawyersshe spent the money she had legally contracted to donate to charity on herself and her friends and then perjured herself in the uk trial stating it all had been donated to the charities you are just one of the sites that have been manipulated by this woman she has certainly made et canada look like fools along with the other media who take orders from rupert murdoch or don't bother to research their topics start reporting

       "i used to think screengeek was a reputable source obviously they are not a single source gives a statement from warner brothers in the next line gives a statement from l'oreal paris and in the next line says what amber heard's lawyers are going to do this must be the warner brothers l'oreal paris lawyer publicist how about there's much more to these allegations than what's been revealed so far this is why amber heard hasn't settled with johnny depp excuse me? amber heard can't settle with johnny depp because he is the plaintiff in this case lies lies and more lies screengeek should be ashamed! amber still has incredibly damaging evidence against johnny depp then why did she drop her allegations of domestic abuse rather than turn her evidence over to the court? the judge in amber heard's domestic abuse case dismissed the case with prejudice that means amber heard's case was so flawed that she is barred from bringing any action on the domestic abuse claim against johnny depp permanently but she still has incredibly damaging evidence that she hid from the court for what reason screengeek just published an article that's source was amber heard sure ms heard who sold her pictures and other questionable evidence to people magazine and tmz for cold hard cash is now stating amber heard and her legal team have chosen to do everything involving their case in the court rather than rely on social media everything except this article                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 1\n",
       "so sorry for your loss friends and family must come first  johnny depp if things get physical we *have* to separate amber heard no we don't johnny depp we have to be apart from one another whether it's for an hour or ten hours or a f  g daywe must there can be no physical violence amber heard i can't promise you i'll be perfect i can't promise you i won't get physical again god i f  g sometimes get so mad i lose it!  as a survivor of narcissistic abuse i see mr depp admit his faults and flaws on the stand he owns his battles with drugs and alcoholbut he calmly and consistently denies that he has ever hit a woman  ms heard refuses to accept her doctor's diagnosis or her nurses affidavit concerning what drugs she is taking that interfere with her prescribed medication during her years of non stop abuse she has not gone to a doctor or an emergency room she has not been admitted to hospital and only her sister has seen mr depp strike her once her friends have only testified to ms heard telling them about the beatings one friend testified she saw bruises and cuts but a second witness testified that they were with ms heard all day and saw her without clothing and she didn't have a mark on her to make up for the viable evidence that ms heard lacks her stories are becoming increasingly outlandish the three day hostage situation where she alleges she was repeatedly beaten strangled sexually assaulted (this is the story that kate james accuses ms heard of stealing from her and twisting to use against mr depp) and slammed repeatedly onto a floor covered with broken glass from both windows and bottles ms heard admits that she was in possession of her phone which was working the entire time she also admits that when johnny was passed out she slept in a room with patio doors opening on a staircase to the ground but insists she had forgotten the stairs were there  i am familiar with injuries from broken glass there is no possibility that ms heard suffered the injuries she describes without going to the hospital to have the wounds cleaned and stitched having a tetanus shot administered and a full course of antibiotics certainly her injuries would have been reported to the police as it is against the law not to report such clear domestic violence the doctor's report or the emergency room paperwork would have provided the evidence ms heard requires to prove her case she had no treatment there is no evidence and mr depp was actually in the hospital on one of the dates ms heard alleges this assault happened                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 1\n",

       "ms heard's co conspirators have begun to turn on her as we knew they would now she is looking at: fabricating evidence and selling it tampering with evidence and selling it making a heavily

       "good catch darth!!! oh yeah! amber heard is spending cash to get some good publicity a million articles (and two reputable insiders) say that warner brothers have already fired her but some guy or should i say amber heard shill umberto gonzalez states that she has not been fired with absolutely no evidence to back it up and all the weak minded articles come out quoting him she can spend all of her money on shillsit won't change the fact that she is going to be in court for at least two years on these cases with her appeals and then she will go to jail how long will aquaman 2 be willing to wait? even when she is released her mental instability and drug use will render her uninsurable robert downey jr spent time in jail then spent multiple time in re habs before he was given a second chance in acting rdj's insurance was paid by very influential wealthy friends within the acting community amber heard doesn't have any  daily mail will run a positive story if it gets them a vast quantity of hate comments more comments more cash!  amber heard can't be heart broken she would need a heart for that she is a narcissist and as such cares about one person in the world  if ms heard didn't hire a photographer for a shoot how exactly did she take that picture of both of them on horseback?

       "from what i read this has *only* been confirmed by amber heard herselfand she is a well known liar deadline reported and i quote: according to the papers *heard* will only agree to it (the postponement) if it 'would not entail any prejudice to her much less unfair prejudice' to her schedule *she expects to film aquaman 2* at some point next year mikey sutton (amber heard's *biggest fanboi* ) takes this as confirmation of his report warner brothers won't fire her *where* in that statement does warner brothers say that they won't fire her? just more *amber heard propaganda!* australia has begun the process necessary to charge ms heard with perjury in the dog smuggling case and aquaman 2 will be shot there do you think that they will move the entire production for the benefit of ms heard? to be honest i don't think that the announcement will come before the virginia trial by request of mr depp he is suing ms heard for the financial devastation caused by losing the pirates franchisehow would it look to the jury if ms heard lost the aquaman franchise because of the lawsuit? it could be argued that she lost the franchise because the sun lost the lawsuit and there is no evidence that mr depp ever abused anyonebut why risk it?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               1\n",

       "why is amber heard tweeting a picture from the first aquaman movie? she really *has* gained a great deal of weight since 2018! i can't imagine what they will do about her cheek implants breaking down and causing her face to become so much broader perhaps if she looses a great deal of weight she may be able to minimize the double chubby cheek look they warn actors that this can happen when they get cheekbone implants and that there isn't anything that they can do to remove them but everyone thinks it won't happen to me!

       "amber heard was banging everything on the side io tillett wright had an affair with ms heard while living free of charge in mr depp's propertyand mr depp kicked him out because of it ms heard is the worst actor ever! the dialogue body language compared this fabricated storytelling with two actual abuse victims recounting their abuse in the video amber heard unicorns and rainbows nothing to see here boys! unfortunately for ms heardthere were two witnesses in the room at the time the two security guards that ms heard didn't expect to be there have testified that mr depp was across the room in the kitchen when ms heard was yelling in the phone stop hitting me! ms pennington had come out of her hiding place in the closet (she did not pass the two guards in the entrance way) and was yelling get away from her! then they saw the two guards and changed their screams to don't hit me again! i will never understand why she went ahead with this storyknowing that there were witnesses there ms heard was surrounded by her friends the first thing an abuser does is isolate their victim mr depp allowed all of ms heard's friends to live in his properties it was mr depp who was isolatedbutnot that particular day! that day mr depp had two witnesses with him later that night two sets of domestic abuse trained police officers came to the apartments two separate times and after examining ms heard for any signs of assault and all of the penthouse apartments (including the one raquel pennington lived in with her boyfriend josh drew) for any signs of an altercation the police officers determined there were no signs of a fight or any injuries the police are testifying for mr depp in the defamation case this case fell apart before it even had a chance to come together there are so many lies that are so easy to prove ms heard never thought that it would come to a legal caseshe believed mr depp would just cave in to her demands when she had to give her deposition the first time she spent the day yelling and screaming hysterically and refused to enter the deposition room on 8/6/2016 on friday of the next week 8/12/2016 she just didn't show up 8/13/2016 she finally sat for her depositionbut was at a loss to explain why two security guards the police officers and five concierge saw no evidence of any altercation or injuries great video darth! you capture the essence of the insanity that pervades this case no sane person would try to get away with thisbut ms heard is a narcissist and believes that she is clever enough to fool everyone your rants are very cathartic!

       "@tiramisu mochi you have a wonderfully logical mind in therapy we are not concerned whether allegations are real or not those are concerns for the police and other investigative bodies we are on a journey with the person and we go to wherever they need to go i have had clients who discovered that they were abused and others that discovered that their memories were false the *damage* is *always* real and has to be worked through processed and then put away into it's proper place where it is no longer a burden that must be dealt with every day very few clients have tried to purposefully deceive me and those cases remain obvious because money is always involved victims concerns are far more tangible and important than money personal safety is always first escape and evanesce a client in fear of their abusers can not be compelled for any reason to draw the negative attention of their abuser as they know what angering their abuser results in they just want to be free and safe in thirty years i have never been involved with a case that ended in litigation for settlement the fear that the abuser would become so angry that they would extract revenge at any cost to themselves or to people who love them is too real evan rachel wood has filed a police report but it against photographer lindsay usich who is manson's current wife ms wood is concerned about the release of embarrassing photographs of her that are in manson's possession and for some reason believes his wife is going to make them public (that would be incredibly unwise as victimizing the victim is never perceived in a good way) the police have found no evidence that this was going to occur so there is no way to pursue it the only victim who declares she did not give consent has not yet filed a police report we will have to see where that goes i am curious as to what the victims want from their alleged abuser if you consent everything is legalso why would women who gave their consent go public? i think your questions are insightful and enlightened i deal with narcissistic abuse so the abusers i am familiar with do indeed abuse all of their partners they are not capable of having a relationship that is not abusive narcissism has a very narrow band of human behavior (compulsive lying evading questions embellishing stories without being able to remember them and of course accusing their victims of doing exactly what they themselves did) sadly narcissism cannot be corrected and the narcissistic abuser never stops which makes them a dangerous person i regret to say that even as a counselor there is always risk from those people who do not want to lose their victim but as a survivor of narcissistic abuse myself (just as you are a survivor) we do not let the desires of the abuser affect us in any way once abuse has been processed and dealt with a survivor is free to spend the rest of their life pursuing their dreams and none of us will waste one second of that time thinking about the person who instigated the abuse                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  1\n",

       "mr depp is a victim ms heard sold her fabricated evidence to the tabloids for cold hard cash but when she had to submit her evidence to be tested she dropped the case the judge dismissed the case with prejudice meaning ms heard lost and she cannot bring these charges against mr depp again ms heard is still selling to the tabloids mr depp like a proper gentleman is waiting to go to court where his evidence will send ms heard to jail for a long time how evil is it to accuse someone in the papers but not let them clear their name in court?

       "she is clearly threatening him here all she cares about is herself in this tape she clearly doesn't care if she ruins his reputation and she pretty much threatens to do that here the crying is to look innocent she is terrible she pretends to be a victim while she is aggressing it is somewhat evident that she has borderline personality disorder she is worried about herself being hurt but she clearly doesn't give a damn about the fact she physically hurt him she is awful she is so manipulative that she basically comes out and tells him that she is going to drag his name through the mud because she is concerned about her own public reputation and that's pretty dirty considering that she was violent towards him in someways she is clearly sociopathic the only thing that makes her not sociopathic is that she has this histrionic affect sociopaths have a flat affect it is just striking to me that she has no conscience and we've seen that through all three videos she blames the fact that she is going to drag johnny depp through the mud on her lawyers as if they are not working for her she never takes responsibility for anything she tries to control and isolate depp by goading him saying he is gay this is how she tries to manipulate him and keep him away from his male friends she tries to shame him filing a police report that is fake is illegal they should have put her in jail for orchestrating this press stunt she even says that wants to file a police report and use the court instead of a mediator to revamp her reputation and to try to cover up her violence that is just taking advantage of the courts and the police and of course depp who is clearly at his wits end here while getting more publicity by her writing an editorial in the new york times claiming that she is a victim because she doesn't have her privacy what a nutcase it's so disgusting she further manipulates him by claiming everything he says is an attack when she claims she was afraid he would hurt her he is so stunned at this histrionic claim that he has to ask her if she really believes what she is saying meanwhile she clearly doesn't care if she hurts him i don't think there's any doubt she has borderline personality disorder i am shocked that the therapist didn't tell her that when she claims in the other tape that she gets scaredwhen he leaves is a dead giveaway the classic fear of abandonment she has and her rage that is out of proportion with what is going on are two criteria used by psych workers to diagnose bdp she exhibits more borderline criteria so i wonder what kind of therapist they went to this comment is long enough but i can't understand how she didn't get diagnosed because it's so glaring    1\n",
